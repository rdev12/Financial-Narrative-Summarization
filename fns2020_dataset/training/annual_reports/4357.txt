Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
Dairy Crest is the UK’s 
leading dairy company. 
Our business depends 
on milk and we make 
sure we use every drop 
we buy. This diagram 
shows how milk flows 
through our business 
and the products we 
make from it
We operate across 
two divisions, Foods 
and Dairies
This flow diagram only covers our UK 
operations, excluding St Hubert, France 
(Spreads) and Wexford, Republic of Ireland 
(Cheese) – see ‘Overseas operations’ 
opposite for information on these businesses
Dairies
Our Dairies division processes 
around 1.7 billion litres of milk each 
year. Most is sourced directly from 
dairy farmers across the southern 
half of England and Wales. Milk 
production is seasonal, with more 
being produced in the spring, but 
because our consumers want to 
drink the same amount every day, 
we turn any surplus milk we have into 
skimmed milk powder and butter. 
Over 90% of the milk our Dairies 
division buys is sold in liquid form, 
through UK retailers, ‘middle ground’ 
customers ranging from coffee shops 
to hospitals, and direct to consumers’ 
doorsteps by our milkmen
Today’s consumers prefer to drink 
lower fat varieties of milk so we skim 
off the cream and sell it or churn it 
into butter
Our Dairies division also produces a 
range of potted cream for consumers 
to enjoy 
Read more about our Dairies division 
on pages 16–20
Milk Purchasing
A sustainable supply of high quality 
milk is important to Dairy Crest. 
We buy 2.1bn litres each year – 
around 1 litre in every 6 produced 
in Great Britain
There is more about Milk Purchasing 
on page 21
Foods
Our UK Foods division is made up 
of our Cheese and our UK Spreads 
businesses. The Cheese business 
uses over 400 million litres of milk 
each year, which is all sourced 
direct from dairy farmers in Devon 
and Cornwall and is turned into 
cheddar cheese at our Creamery 
in Davidstow, Cornwall 
Our spreads business makes 
butter and dairy spreads from 
cream skimmed from the milk 
used by our Dairies division

division on pages 10–15

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
ensure that the business is well funded to 
invest in its brands and into efficiency-driven 
capital projects. Accordingly, it has decided 
to rebase this and future dividends by 25% 
and is recommending a final dividend of 
13.0 pence per share. As a result, the total 
dividend for the 2008/9 financial year will 
be 20.1 pence. Looking forward, the Board 
will seek to resume its progressive dividend 
policy from the rebased level whilst seeking to 
maintain dividend cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times.
 The strong performance by our brands 
this year was very encouraging. Clover has 
recovered from its product recall in May 
2007 and both Country Life and FRijj have 
responded to increased marketing activity. 
Cathedral City goes from strength to strength 
and is a key element of the improvement 
we have made to our cheese business over 
the past ten years. We now have a very 
well invested cheese supply chain, which 
has been completed this year with our new 
packing facility at Nuneaton. There is still a 
significant opportunity to develop branded 
cheese sales further and we are well placed 
to lead this. Our French spreads acquisition 
has lived up to the high expectations we had 
when we purchased this business in 2007 and 
provides a valuable platform into Continental 
markets which over time will enable us to 
develop our overseas business further.
 Our Dairies division has made real 
improvements in its manufacturing and 
distribution cost base. Coupled with savings 
from restructuring our head office we have 
improved our competitive position.
 During the year we chose to sell our Stilton 
and speciality cheese business and the 49% 
share in Yoplait Dairy Crest. Looking forward 
this will allow us to increase the Group’s 
focus on brands which we own outright.
 There has been one change to the Board 
this year; the departure of Martin Oakes from 
his position of Executive Managing Director, 
This year has been an important one 
for Dairy Crest in our journey from 
commodity processor to added value food 
manufacturer. We have shown ourselves 
capable of developing our business in a 
difficult economic environment by growing 
brands and improving operational efficiency.
 In these circumstances I am able to 
report a sound financial performance. 
Our Foods division benefited from brand 
growth and delivered strong margins. Our 
Dairies division faced a more challenging 
environment and its profits were adversely 
affected by high milk purchase prices and 
weak dairy commodity markets. Overall 
Group profit before taxation increased 56% 
to £103.2 million and earnings per share 
increased 41% to 56.8 pence. However 
Group adjusted profit before taxation* fell 
8% to £79.5 million and adjusted basic 
earnings per share* fell 13% to 45.0 pence. 
 We made good progress on a number 
of fronts. In addition to the ongoing growth 
we have seen in all our key brands, we 
continue to reduce our costs and become 
more efficient. Structurally, we made two 
disposals and we continue to invest to 
improve our asset base. Importantly in the 
current market we renewed our main bank 
facility for five years and now have no debt 
facilities maturing before November 2011.
 The Board remains confident that the 
business is well positioned to deliver in the 
year ahead and, following the disposal of 
its stake in Yoplait Dairy Crest, the Group’s 
net debt position has improved considerably 
and the Group is operating comfortably 
within its banking covenants. However, in 
light of additional cash contributions to the 
pension fund and the dilutive effect of the 
Yoplait Dairy Crest disposal on 2009/10 
earnings the Board has reviewed the Group’s 
dividend policy. The Board has concluded 
that it is sensible to conserve cash and 
Dairies division. We chose not to replace 
Martin on the Board. Mike Sheldon and Toby 
Brinsmead, who are the Managing Directors 
of our Household and Liquids businesses 
respectively, now report directly to Mark 
Allen. This structure is working well. Since 
the end of the year David Richardson has 
announced that he will leave the Board 
when a suitable replacement has been 
found. That process is underway. We thank 
Martin and David for their contributions.
 I continue to value the relationship 
we have with our dairy farmers who have 
supplied us with milk during the year. They 
play a key role in our business. It is important 
that we continue to take their views into 
account as we move forward and I believe 
we have the right structure in place to do this.
 The improvements we have made this 
year would not have been possible without the 
hard work of all our employees. We have a 
strong workforce, led by an experienced and 
well-motivated leadership team. In the tough 
trading environment we failed to achieve the 
demanding targets we had set ourselves and 
as a result our employees have not received 
discretionary bonuses this year. However 
we value the work they have done and I 
would like to thank all employees for their 
contribution to the success of the Group. 
 Overall I am pleased by the progress the 
Group has made and that our business is 
becoming increasingly robust. We remain a 
broadly based dairy business and I am happy 
that this model offers a strong base from 
which we can continue to grow.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s review 7
Overview
Making progress 
in difficult times
February 2009 and the decline rate has 
started to improve. 
 It is not just consumer markets that 
became tougher during the year. World 
dairy commodity prices fell dramatically as 
increased production outpaced demand. 
Inevitably this had an adverse effect on the 
profitability of our Ingredients business. 
Dairy commodity returns remain low as we 
enter 2009/10 and we have taken steps to 
reduce the amount of milk balanced into 
skimmed milk powder as well as reducing 
our milk purchase prices.
Financial results
The Group’s turnover increased to £1,648 
million (2008: £1,570 million). This 5% 
increase reflects good volume growth 
across our key brands and higher prices 
achieved across the range of our products. 
 Group profit before tax was up 56% at 
£103.2 million (2008: £66.0 million). After 
adjusting for £26.4 million of exceptional 
profit (2008: £21.1 million cost), £6.9 million 
pension interest credit (2008: £10.1 million) 
and £9.6 million of acquired intangible 
amortisation costs (2008: £9.0 million) 
adjusted profit before tax was down 8% at 
£79.5 million (2008: £86.0 million). Basic 
earnings per share were 56.8 pence (2008: 
40.2 pence). Adjusted basic earnings per 
share decreased by 13% to 45.0 pence 
(2008: 51.7 pence). 
 Group net debt at 31 March 2009 
was £415.8 million, £59 million lower than 
at 31 March 2008 when the debt was 
£474.8 million. This reflects the proceeds 
from the sale of the 49% stake in Yoplait 
Dairy Crest, which was sold during the 
year. Although our Euro denominated 
debt increased as sterling weakened in 
the middle of the year we offset this by 
increased focus on cash management. 
As an example we reduced our year end 
Overview
Dairy Crest has made significant progress 
in a number of areas during the year. 
Our brands have again delivered good 
growth and we have continued to reduce 
costs and improve efficiencies. We have 
made progress on our plans to move from 
commodity processor to added value food 
manufacturer by disposing of our Stilton 
and speciality cheese business and the 
sale of our 49% stake in Yoplait Dairy Crest 
Limited allows us to focus more strongly on 
core brands we own outright. 
 However, we have also had to meet 
the challenge of a global recession and the 
most difficult dairy commodity markets that 
many in the industry have ever witnessed. 
Against this backdrop our financial 
performance in the year has been sound.
 This year we have made a material 
reduction in our net debt, our brands are in 
good shape and our profits are in line with 
our November 2008 forecast. 
Market environment
Consumers are at the heart of our business 
and we have worked with our major 
retail customers to offset the difficulties 
consumers have faced from the recession. 
By advertising, and importantly, promoting 
our brands more in both the UK and on 
the Continent we have delivered good 
brand growth in the year. We will continue 
with this strategy into 2009/10. We are 
convinced that this investment is in the 
best interest of shareholders in the medium 
and longer term.
 Our doorstep business, which had 
consistently improved decline rates over a 
number of years, was adversely impacted 
by the recession and by the need to pass 
on higher raw milk prices in the early part 
of the year. This has been addressed; milk 
prices have fallen by around 10% since 
Mark Allen

debtors by £48 million this year. During 
December 2008 and January 2009 we 
swapped €225 million of Euro denominated 
debt into sterling to reduce the effect of 
future currency movements on the Group’s 
net debt and banking covenants.
Growing brands
Our brands have made good progress 
this year. We felt it essential to continue 
to promote our brands in order to provide 
hard-pressed consumers with the value 
they were looking for and to reassure 
them, through advertising, of the quality our 
brands deliver. This strategy created strong 
growth in the year and leaves our brands 
well placed to continue to deliver during 
the downturn.
 Cathedral City remains by far the 
UK’s most popular cheddar brand and is 
now the 21st largest UK food and drink 
brand as measured by The Grocer trade 
magazine. It has annual retail sales in 
excess of £190 million. The brand has 
grown market share and remains larger 
than the next three cheddar brands 
combined. We are particularly proud of the 
progress we have made with Cathedral 
City since we bought the brand in 1995 
when annual sales were less than £20 
million. By investing in product quality, 
television advertising and innovative 
packaging we have grown sales to their 
current level. 
  Our two key UK spreads brands; 
Clover and Country Life have also grown 
strongly over the year. Clover is up 29% 
by volume and 33% by value and Country 
Life is up 29% by volume and 24% by 
value. Both have benefited from increased 
expenditure on television advertising. A 
particular highlight has been the success 
of the Country Life “Great British Butter” 
advertising campaign, featuring John Lydon. 
In France, our Spreads business, 
St Hubert, has delivered in line with 
expectations and has made a significant 
contribution to the profitability of the Group 
as a whole.
 This year St Hubert has strengthened 
its leading market positions in France and 
Italy. In France, St Hubert Omega 3 is the 
leading ‘health’ spread and has increased 
its market share to 21%, an all time high. 
In Italy, St Hubert’s subsidiary, Vallé Italia, 
remains the clear market leader with a 
market share of 55%.
Innovating now and for the future
A key element of our strategy is innovation 
to ensure that we can continue to meet 
consumers’ ever-changing needs. 
Innovation is not restricted to developing 
new products, where we have been 
successful; it is also about finding new 
ways of carrying out business that can 
reduce costs and increase efficiencies 
and capacities.
 Our ‘lighter’ brand extensions have seen 
strong sales growth during the year. As 
well as promoting the good things in dairy 
products we also recognise that we need to 
offer our consumers choice. We are really 
pleased with the progress we have made 
in developing lower fat alternatives that do 
not compromise on taste. Our reduced 
fat cheese, Cathedral City Mature Lighter, 
has 30% less fat than standard cheddar 
and now accounts for over 10% of total 
Cathedral City sales. Together our three 
‘lighter’ brands had combined retail sales 
of more than £40 million in the year, over 
double those of 2008.
 Product innovation has not been solely 
focussed on our brands. We have worked 
with Sainsbury’s and Morrisons to develop 
and supply milk with only 1% fat. The 
development of new products for our retail 
customers is a key part of our strategy 
going forward.
 Our investment in a new cheese packing 
facility at Nuneaton is progressing well. This 
gives us the opportunity to develop new and 
innovative packaging formats as it becomes 
operational this year.
 We are accelerating our investment 
in our new doorstep internet proposition, 
milk&more. This will increase sales of 
products to doorstep customers. It offers 
them an innovative solution, allowing them 
to order and pay on-line. Having extensively 
trialled this service this year and invested in 
a new website, we will roll milk&more out 
across around 120 depots this summer.
 We have completed our investment in 
two new Regional Distribution Centres for 
our Dairies division, this will reduce costs 
and free up valuable capacity in our dairies. 
Cutting costs
In times of recession controlling costs 
and improving operational efficiencies are 
even more important. Early in the year we 
identified the need to improve our value 
offer to consumers. One of the ways to do 
this was to make sure our cost base was 
minimised.
 We carried out a review of our central 
and support functions and as a result 
implemented a head office restructure in 
September 2008. This reduced headcount 
by around 100 people and positioned us 
better for the rapidly changing market.
 Controlling our Dairies division’s 
costs is vitally important. We have made 
particularly encouraging progress in this 
respect, especially in the reduction of 
waste in our dairies. Following on from 
the closure of Totnes in September 2007 
we shut the Nottingham dairy in February 
2009. We have also closed 15 household 
depots over the year. These reductions

comprehensive new induction programme 
for new employees and introduced a value-
based leadership training programme.
 We continue to work with our 
customers and suppliers to build 
responsible supply chains. All four of 
our major liquid milk customers have 
established milk groups, linking them 
with dairy farmers. These groups benefit 
customer and supplier and help give much 
needed stability. 
Outlook
The market downturn is well documented. 
Against this difficult background we have 
delivered a sound performance and 
taken a number of actions to position the 
business now and for the future. Our plans 
for 2009/10 are to maintain our focus on 
cash management and to continue the 
development of our key brands. 
 We are a broadly based dairy business. 
The benefits of this will be demonstrated 
during 2009/10 as stock profits in our 
cheese business unwind and those in our 
Dairies division increase to compensate. 
 Trading at the start of the year is in line 
with expectations and we believe that our 
business is in good shape to deliver in 
the year ahead. In addition we are well 
placed to benefit when the external 
environment improves.

enable us to deliver competitive prices for 
our customers and consumers without 
compromising on service or quality. They 
also mean that over time we can improve 
the returns for our shareholders. 
Focussing the business
Our long-term plan remains to reduce 
exposure to commodity markets and focus 
on brands which we own outright. The 
decisions to make two significant disposals 
are in line with this. In August 2008 we sold 
our Stilton and speciality cheese business 
and in March 2009 we sold our 49% stake 
in Yoplait Dairy Crest. These sales allow 
greater focus on the ongoing parts of our 
business and reduce our exposure to 
external influences. 
Looking after our people and the 
community as we grow
Dairy Crest is a responsible business. 
In 2009 we have continued with our plans 
to reduce our impact on the environment. 
In particular we have developed innovative 
new packaging, which gives consumers 
the ability to buy their milk in bags rather 
than plastic bottles. This reduces material 
usage and makes recycling easier. Our 
factories have cut down on water usage; 
for example at Davidstow the water used 
to clean the factory is condensed as part of 
the whey handling process. In conjunction 
with our dairy farmer suppliers we have 
developed an on-farm environmental 
scorecard. This project will help to reduce 
the carbon footprint of the milk we buy.
 We continue to train and empower 
our people so that every employee can 
maximise their individual potential and take 
responsibility for their actions. We have 
repeated our staff survey, first carried out 
in 2007. Results are encouraging with 
the overall engagement score improving

continued to grow strongly, out-performing 
the butter and spreadables segments, with 
sales up 24% in value and 29% in volume. 
The brand was relaunched with a very 
strong television advertising campaign, 
which emphasised the provenance of 
Country Life as the only major British 
butter, featuring ex-Sex Pistol John Lydon 
as a tongue-in-cheek spokesperson. 
This, plus a highly effective promotional 
campaign, and continued strong growth 
for the lighter variant, has propelled the 
brand to £60 million at retail value. Within 
the Dairies division the re-branding of 
Dairy Crest milk to Country Life is further 
expanding the brand footprint. 
 With Clover Lighter, Country Life 
Spreadable Lighter, Utterly Butterly 
with Omega 3, and Vitalite we are proud 
of the choice we offer today’s health-
conscious consumer. 
St Hubert
St Hubert was acquired in January 2007 
from Uniq, and has now become an 
integral part of the Dairy Crest Group. 
We manufacture at our Ludres factory 
in Eastern France, for distribution across 
France and to Italy. The business continues 
to strengthen its leading market positions 
in France and Italy and, despite difficult 
market conditions, its performance since 
acquisition has beaten our expectations. 
The total non-butter French spreads 
market has remained flat by value at €387 
million, with the ‘health’ segment continuing 
to grow by 2%. Within this market our 
leading brand, St Hubert Omega 3, has 
strengthened its market leadership, with 
value growth of 10% (volume +5%) to 
achieve an all time high value share of 
21% of the French spreads market. Overall 
St Hubert has held market share.
UK Spreads
Our UK butters and spreads are 
manufactured in two factories at Kirkby in 
Liverpool and Crudgington in Shropshire, 
and distributed via our national distribution 
centre in Nuneaton to UK retailers. 
 The UK market for butter and spreads 
grew by 12% in the year to March 2009, 
reaching £1.1 billion. This was primarily 
as a result of price increases to offset 
input cost inflation, and volumes were 
down slightly overall (-0.6%). The largest 
growth came in the dairy spreads and well-
being segments. 
 The second half of the year was 
characterised by a significant rise in 
promotional sales across the market as 
consumers became increasingly hard-
pressed. This has lowered total margins 
without increasing overall consumption.
Dairy Crest recognised the need to provide 
value to our consumers and accordingly 
we chose to promote our brands more. 
This, along with our focus on advertising, 
contributed to their increased market share 
and enabled us to far exceed the market 
growth rate. Together our brands achieved 
23% value growth and we were the only 
major manufacturer in volume growth at 
+12%. We now enjoy a 20% share of the 
total butters and spreads market. 
 All of our dairy spreads brands have 
performed well in the year, with strong 
growth on both Clover and Utterly Butterly. 
Clover, now fully recovered from the 
previous year’s operational issues, grew by 
33% in value and 29% in volume. Utterly 
Butterly grew by 19% in value and 1% in 
volume. The launch of Clover Lighter has 
been a big success, and now accounts for 
over 15% by value of the brand. In terms of 
trial and repeat purchase levels it has been 
the most successful launch in the butters 
and spreads category in the past five years.

The division’s strategy is to focus 
on brands and this has improved 
profits over recent years. This 
year nearly 80% of the sales of the 
Foods division are branded. To 
generate more momentum we have 
further concentrated our marketing 
expenditure behind our core brands, 
Cathedral City, Clover, Country Life 
and St Hubert and spent over 40% 
more on these brands in the year. 
As a result, all these brands are in 
strong share growth and well placed 
for the future.  
 Investment in innovation has 
enabled us to give consumers the 
choice of buying healthier products 
without having to compromise on 
taste or quality. We built upon our 
previous success with Country Life 
Lighter and Cathedral City Lighter 
and have now launched Clover 
Lighter in the UK and St Hubert 
Léger in France. 
 In Foods we will focus on 
brands and businesses where we 
can add value and where we own 
the brands outright. Accordingly, in 
July 2008 we sold our Stilton and 
speciality cheese business, based at 
Hartington, to Long Clawson Dairies 
Limited. In March 2009 we sold our 
49% share of the UK chilled yogurts 
and desserts joint venture with 
Yoplait SAS.
 Following these sales we have 
fewer manufacturing sites to invest 
in. We continue to concentrate 
on the elimination of waste and 
inefficiency in order to keep our 
costs in line with affordability.

consumers have increased their purchases 
in hard discounters, who now represent 
almost 15% of retail sales. In September 
2008 we successfully entered this channel 
with the St Hubert brand.  
 St Hubert’s subsidiary, Vallé Italia, 
remains the undisputed leader of the Italian 
spreads market. With renewed media 
support, Vallé has grown by 8% in value, 
achieving a market share of 55%. 
 As in the UK, we are broadening 
the choice offered to health-conscious 
consumers. In France, St Hubert Omega 3 
introduced a Lighter variant to the range, 
and in Italy we launched Vallé + Leggera, 
whose performance is encouraging.

Davidstow
Cheese
The Davidstow named creamery brand has 
performed less well as increased Cathedral 
City sales allowed us to reduce the high 
levels of Davidstow brand promotions from 
the previous year. Overall sales were down 
21% by volume and 3% by value. 
 During the first half of the year the 
cheese business benefited from selling 
cheese made with lower milk prices in 
the previous year, but by the second 
half that situation had reversed. With 
a strong increase in Irish cheddar 
imports, promotional pressure increased 
significantly. We responded by increasing 
marketing and promotional expenditure to 
ensure the continued strong performance 
of Cathedral City.
 In the last quarter of the year we 
started to commission our new, highly 
automated, cheese cutting and packing 
facility at our national distribution centre 
and maturation store in Nuneaton. We 
remain on track for full-scale production 
by mid 2009. This completes our plans 
to achieve a world-class supply chain 
for cheese linked to our state-of-the-
art creamery at Davidstow, served by 
a dedicated pool of local dairy farmers.
 As with our butters and spreads range, 
we have been successful in launching 
alternative cheese recipes to suit health-
conscious consumers. The Cathedral City 
Lighter variant has been extremely successful 
and enjoys around 90% of the branded 
lower-fat segment. The launch of a lighter 
variant of the Davidstow brand will further 
enhance our range in the coming year.
The UK cheese retail market continues to 
grow, and is now worth nearly £2.3 billion. 
The market grew by 13% in value and 0.6% 
in volume in the 52 weeks to March 2009. 
The cheddar category grew by 17% in 
value (1.5% in volume). Within this, branded 
cheddar continued to outperform and 
increased its market share, growing by 9% 
in volume and 21% in value to £503 million. 
 Our flagship brand, Cathedral City, 
is the leading cheese brand in the UK. 
It is made at our well-invested creamery 
in Davidstow, Cornwall and delivered to 
retailers from our national distribution 
centre in Nuneaton. In addition some of 
the cheddar made at Davidstow is sold 
under the Davidstow label as a retailer 
brand. We also have a cheddar factory in 
Wexford, Republic of Ireland, producing 
both branded and unbranded cheese.
 Cathedral City has again outperformed 
the category, with volume sales up 9% 
and value up 22%. The brand now sells 
£192 million at retail prices, has a 15% 
share of total cheddar (38% of branded), 
and is ranked 21st in Nielsen’s top 100 UK 
grocery brands. This performance reflects 
our brand-building investment, as well as a 
successful promotional program.
 We continue to prove that we can 
add real consumer value to everyday 
cheese. Sales of Cathedral City Lighter, our 
reduced-fat cheese, have increased by 91% 
by value in the year. In September 2008 we 
launched Cathedral City Vintage 20, and at 
the Nantwich international cheese show a 
Davidstow recipe won Supreme Champion 
– for the second year in a row.

Supported by our innovative and successful 
“Four Ridges” media campaign and by the 
ongoing introduction of Limited Editions, 
there were one million more FRijj drinkers 
this year compared to last.  
 The business continues to focus on 
driving efficiency to improve its costs of 
production and the quality and service 
provided to its customers. 
 To support our ongoing commitment 
to cost reduction and to maintain the 
long-term sustainability of the business 
we continued to invest in its infrastructure. 
Our Foston dairy, which was acquired 
in 2005 from Starcross Foods Limited, 
has been the focus of significant capital 
investment over the last two years. For 
a total investment of £34 million we have 
developed this site into an efficient facility 
with current capacity of around 250 million 
litres and the potential to expand beyond 
this. During the autumn of 2008 the business 
commissioned a new Regional Distribution 
Centre in Aldridge in the West Midlands. 
This facility, together with our existing RDC 
in Collumpton, complements the distribution 
operations run from our dairies and means 
the business has considerably increased its 
geographical reach and improved its supply 
chain efficiency.
 Health and the environment have 
been key areas of focus for our innovation 
team over the last year. We launched 1% 
fat milk for Sainsbury’s and Morrisons in 
the year and sales are growing strongly. 
We also rolled out our milk pouch and 
Jugit packaging solution in Sainsbury’s 
and Waitrose. The pouch uses 75% less 
packaging than a standard polybottle. In 
2009/10 we will continue to drive listings 
of pouch and launch it through our 
doorstep business.  
 Our Ingredients operation had a difficult 
year. The markets for dairy commodities 
Consumption of fresh conventional milk has 
remained steady year on year in terms of 
volume. However, there has been a 13% 
growth in value as prices rose, reflecting 
input cost inflation. Sales of higher fat milk 
have declined as consumers continue to 
switch to healthier, lower-fat products.
 Organic milk accounts for around 5% of 
total milk sales. The growth in consumption 
of organic milk seen over recent years has 
stalled as consumers have reacted to the 
economic downturn. There is also some 
evidence that consumers have become 
more interested in locally sourced produce 
and provenance, rather than organic.
 The market for fresh flavoured milk 
grew both in terms of volume and value, 
(14% and 15% respectively), with branded 
growth taking the lead. Strong growth in 
the consumption of healthier cream options 
such as Crème Fraiche, have led to the 
total cream market showing growth of 9% 
in value.
 Our Liquid Products business increased 
its share of supplies to the retail liquid milk 
market by delivering both volume and value 
growth ahead of the market. Dairy Crest 
supplies major retailers, including sole 
supply for Waitrose and Marks & Spencer 
and 50% share of supply to Sainsbury’s 
and Morrisons. During the year our sales 
grew by 17% in value and 4% in volume.  
 Our sales of organic milk to the major 
retailers remained steady during the year. 
Distribution of our Country Life organic milk 
brand was extended towards the end of the 
year and this will deliver growth in 2009/10.
 FRijj, our leading flavoured milk brand, 
grew by 23% in value terms and 17% in 
volume. This growth means FRijj annual 
retail sales have exceeded £40 million 
for the first time. The brand has a 50% 
share of the fresh milkshake category 
and continues to attract new consumers.

It also manufactures, markets and 
sells FRijj, the leading fresh flavoured 
milk brand as well as potted creams 
including speciality and seasonal 
offerings and milk powders.
 The business has four milk 
packing dairies located at 
Severnside in Gloucestershire, 
Chadwell Heath in London, 
Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire 
and Foston in Derbyshire. A large 
proportion of our potted cream 
and all our speciality seasonal 
creams, as well as our retail milk 
powders are made at Chard in 
Somerset. FRijj is made at our 
Severnside dairy.
 Our Ingredients operation, 
which is also based at Severnside, 
provides the Dairies division with 
a flexible balancing solution and 
deals with the Group’s by-products. 
Surplus milk in the spring, and milk 
arising from short term supply and

such as skimmed milk powder and bulk 
butter have been depressed over the last 
year. Peaking in the autumn of 2007, the 
market went into steep decline over the 
winter and into the spring of 2008. The 
difference between the realisations from 
these markets and the price we paid our 
suppliers for their milk widened considerably 
to unprecedented levels. As market prices 
fell, trading activity also slowed and as a 
consequence, stocks grew.  
By focussing on raw milk utilisation we 
were able to reduce the amount of milk 
put through our Ingredients business in the 
second half of the year and minimise the 
impact of the market slowdown. By the 
year-end, we had managed commodity 
stocks back down to below £5 million, in 
line with previous years.
 Since February 2009 milk purchase 
prices have started to fall, partially reflecting 
the ongoing low returns from dairy 
commodity markets. We have reviewed 
our milk purchasing requirements to 
minimise the amount of milk we process 
through our Ingredients business.
 Our Liquids business has continued 
to progress since the year end and has 
recently secured additional business with 
the Co-operative Group. The focus 
remains on increasing efficiency and 
improving the quality and service offered 
to customers.

is available in Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Jugit 
uses less packaging and makes recycling easier
DC_AR09_FC-p25_28-5-09.indd 19 DC_AR09_FC-p25_28-5-09.indd   19 1/6/09 18:28:09 1/6/09   18:28:09 Although sales to doorstep customers 
have fallen over the years as more 
consumers purchase their milk from the 
big supermarkets, we are working hard 
to reverse this trend. We have carried 
out detailed analysis of our customer 
base and have found that they value the 
convenience of having their milk and other 
essentials delivered, provided we can 
get the right products and service levels. 
Customers appreciate the familiar face of 
their milkman, especially when he delivers 
against all odds during the sort of snowfalls 
we saw in February 2009.
 Against this background we have 
invested in our new internet-based, 
doorstep delivery service, ‘milk&more’, 
which now has 67,000 registered 
customers. This will give our doorstep 
customers a contemporary shopping 
experience delivered by the traditional 
milkman. It will allow consumers to order

over 100 products through the internet for 
their next doorstep delivery and will let us 
compete with convenience stores for top-
up purchases. Over the past year we have 
extended trials of milk&more from 5 depots 
to 30 depots. We have built a new website, 
enhancing users’ experience and we have 
confirmed that we will roll milk&more out 
nationally to around 120 depots over the 
summer of 2009. Our trials have shown 
that milk&more users spend more with us 
and it also helps with cash collection.
 During the year turnover in the 
Household business rose slightly on 
the back of higher prices. However the 
increasingly tough consumer environment 
and the need to recover higher milk 
prices at the start of the year adversely 
affected profits. These factors increased 
the underlying net annual decline rate to 
over 10%, although it has since fallen back 
below this level.  
 To differentiate our milk we have 
rebranded it using our Country Life brand 
and we have also increased the amount 
of organic milk we sell to doorstep 
consumers.
 Our doorstep delivery service is 
recognised as being environmentally 
friendly. We use electrically powered milk 
floats where possible and over 80% of the 
milk we supply to our doorstep customers 
is in returnable glass bottles, which are 
used nearly 20 times each.
 The business has been proactive in 
controlling its costs. In February 2009 we 
completed the closure of a bottling dairy 
in Nottingham and we also shut 15 
depots during the year. We continue to 
work with the suppliers of the products 
we sell through our business to control 
costs and to ensure we are able to give 
our customers the best possible range 
and value.
Country Life 
During the year we took the decision to extend 
our Country Life brand to cover all the milk we 
sell to our Household customers. We are proud 
that our milk carries the Red Tractor quality mark
Dairy Crest’s Household business 
delivers fresh milk and a wide range 
of other products. We have over 
1.3 million doorstep customers, over 
20,000 ‘middle ground’ customers 
ranging from coffee shops to 
hospitals, and we also supply milk 
to around 1,000 independent 
dairymen, most of whom have their 
own doorstep customers. 
 The business has an extensive 
distribution network across England 
and Wales, with over 3,800 
employees and another 1,500 
franchised milkmen, 150 depots and 
3,500 vehicles. Milk is bottled at 
dairies located at Aintree in 
Liverpool, Hanworth in London, and 
Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire.
Looking forward, falling milk costs will 
benefit this business and we will continue 
to drive out other costs to ensure we can 
offer our consumers the best possible 
value without compromising service levels. 
We are excited about this year’s full launch 
of milk&more.

DC_AR09_FC-p25_28-5-09.indd 20 DC_AR09_FC-p25_28-5-09.indd   20 29/5/09 16:49:12 29/5/09   16:49:12 Milk Purchasing
Sourcing our milk
Dairy Crest currently purchases 2.1 billion 
litres of raw milk per anum. Around 70% 
of this milk comes direct from over 1,300 
direct supplying dairy farmers located 
throughout England & Wales. 
 A dedicated team of head office 
and field based staff are responsible for 
managing and developing the relationship 
Dairy Crest has with its farmer suppliers. 
This relationship encompasses all aspects 
of milk supply including milk purchasing 
agreements, farm assurance, milk quality, 
and, in some cases, the delivery of specific 
customer requirements.
 The team works closely with Dairy 
Crest Direct (DCD), the elected farmer 
representative organisation, to ensure 
better communication and an improved 
understanding of the issues and 
opportunities impacting on the partnership. 
There is regular dialogue between the DCD 
Board and the Dairy Crest Executive. DCD 
also engages with our retail customers, 
promoting greater awareness of key industry 
issues and the impact on farm. 
 Since summer 2008 there has been 
downward pressure on raw milk prices due 
to the collapse of dairy commodity returns.  
However farmgate milk prices remained 
stable until spring 2009. Farm production 
costs remained high and the poor summer 
weather further impacted on already fragile 
farmer confidence. Concerns over declining 
milk production levels, strong competition 
for milk supply and weaker sterling delayed 
and reduced the impact of lower commodity 
prices. Since February 2009 most UK 
farmgate milk prices, including those paid by 
Dairy Crest, have fallen by around 10%.
 With UK milk production in long-term 
decline, securing and increasing Dairy 
Crest’s direct milk supply is a key priority. 
The Dairy Crest offer to its farmer suppliers 
is based on working in partnership to 
develop a long-term secure relationship and 
achieve value for both parties. 
 We have further developed our retailer 
milk pools for M&S, Sainsbury’s and 
Waitrose in the year. 
 The introduction of the Morrisons 
regional milk initiative in 2008 now means 
that all our liquid milk suppliers are part of 
an added value scheme. As milk supply 
in the UK continues to fall we expect to 
see more product, factory and customer 
specific dairy supply chains established. 
 Customer partnerships have supported 
innovative projects at farm level. These 
projects have focused on supporting 
consumer choice, the environment, 
animal husbandry and improved supply 
chain efficiency. 
 Consumers are becoming increasingly 
aware of where their food comes from 
and how it is produced. This means 
that animal health and welfare and the 
environment remain in the spotlight and 
have to be a priority for dairy farmers. We 
have continued to support our suppliers 
through the unique independent White 
Gold Service, raising awareness of how to 
adopt ‘best practice’ on farm efficiently.
 With an increasing focus on efficiency 
we have fundamentally reviewed our ex-farm 
milk haulage operation and have decided, 
over time, to end shared milk collection 
agreements with other processors. This will 
also increase the opportunity for marketing 
initiatives for our suppliers’ milk.  
 The milk procurement team has held a 
number of meetings and events throughout 
the year to provide an opportunity for 
discussion and debate, and also seek 
views and ideas of how we can work better 
together. This process has been very 
positive and is informing the development 
of our future plans. 
 Dairy Crest is proud of its dairy 
farmer suppliers and their achievements. 
In a challenging market we continue to 
work together to deliver value for all our 
stakeholders. Our farmers are at the heart 
of the business and key to our success. 
We will continue to develop and build our 
relationships to secure a sustainable milk 
supply for our business.

Environment 
Our aim is to be more energy efficient, 
carbon conscious and climate friendly.
Reducing carbon emissions 
We have been measuring the amount of 
carbon dioxide released from our sites 
since 2002. The quantity released per tonne 
of milk processed was reduced by 24%* in 
the first five years. Continued efforts have 
led to a further 4%* reduction in 2009, as 
can be seen by the chart at the top of this 
page. We aim to reduce this by a further 
3%* during the next year. We have also 
agreed specific carbon emission reduction 
targets with the Carbon Trust which will be 
met by 2020.
 Throughout our sites we have invested 
in improved energy measurement systems 
on the principle of ‘what gets measured 
gets managed’. 
 We have updated our boiler control 
systems with more modern accurate versions 
to ensure the most efficient use of fuel. 
Making better use of our water
Following on from our decision to join 
the Federation House Commitment in 
early 2008 we have continued to focus 
on reducing the quantity of water used to 
process milk as illustrated in our chart. 
 In the last year we have achieved 
an overall 8%* reduction in water 
used per tonne of milk processed by 
improvements in operational systems and 
efficiencies. During 2009 we intend to 
make a 3%* reduction. 
Waste management and recycling
We continue to focus on reducing the solid 
wastes that result from our operations and 
where waste is unavoidable look for ways 
of diverting it from landfill by re-using and 
recycling it. 
Managing CR
Dairy Crest is a responsible business. In 
our last annual report we reported that we 
had established a CR committee chaired 
by Carole Piwnica. We also reported that 
the committee’s mandate for the year was 
to review and implement Dairy Crest’s CR 
strategy. We are pleased to report that we 
have done this and this report sets out our 
commitment to corporate responsibility; 
our CR strategy; and how we manage 
CR within Dairy Crest. We summarise our 
commitments, targets and achievements. 
We will publish a full CR report, giving more 
details, on our website in summer 2009.
 We have made considerable progress 
over the last twelve months ensuring 
that our CR strategy is absorbed into the 
fabric of the business. Our Group Solicitor, 
Caroline Slettengren, heads an internal CR 
committee which is made up of employee 
champions from across the business, and 
oversees the implementation of our strategy 
in four key areas: environment, workplace, 
marketplace and community. 
 In the coming year, we plan to make 
further strides and these will be regularly 
reported on our website. This will allow 
us to provide greater insight, such as our 
core commitment targets, and make our 
performance easy to follow and measure. 
 Having a CR programme that is 
fully integrated within the culture of the 
business offers a number of advantages. 
It ensures that everyone at Dairy Crest 
can be confident of working in a safe and 
respectful environment. It means that we 
attract and retain good people. It helps us 
add shareholder value and it helps us grow 
as a company and meet the expectations of 
all our other stakeholders – our consumers, 
customers, suppliers, employees and the 
communities where we operate.

plastic and cardboard at all our Household 
depots and at our manufacturing sites we 
have reduced solid waste to landfill by over 
200 tonnes. We aim to have zero waste 
going to landfill by 2015, provided this is the 
best environmental solution.
Packaging 
Our strategy is to Reduce, Re-use and 
Recycle. Therefore our first challenge 
is always to try to find better ways of 
reducing the amount of packaging we use.
 In 2007 Dairy Crest was the first dairy 
company to sign the Courtauld 
Commitment, a voluntary agreement 
between WRAP (Waste & Resources 
Action Programme) and major grocery 
organisations and retailers to reduce 
packaging waste in the food industry. 
Through our initiatives such as our 
recyclable milk pouch and rHDPE 
polybottle, we are currently ahead of the 
targets set by the Courtauld Commitment 
for 2010. 
 In partnership with bottle manufacturer 
Nampak and recycler WES Greenstar, 
the company has developed the UK’s 
first recyclable plastic milk bottle. Bottles 
containing rHDPE can be collected from 
recycling centres and used in future bottle 
production. We expect that by the end of 
2009 all our plastic bottles will include at 
least 10% recycled material.
Food waste
As well as working with WRAP on packaging 
reduction we also support their Love Food 
Hate Waste campaign. We continue to 
work to develop packaging which will allow 
consumer choice and eliminate waste 
without compromising food safety. 
Workplace
The safety of our employees is paramount. 
We provide the necessary tools and 
training to maintain their understanding of 
health and safety and put it into practice 
throughout the working day. 
 Our new health and safety management 
and technical standards are designed to 
monitor compliance with relevant company 
policies and drive continual improvement.  
 Dedicated health and safety 
committees help raise awareness of work-
related stress and other health issues. 
 Our Accident Incident Rate (AIR) in 
2008/09 increased over previous years. 
We are not satisfied with this and are 
prioritising an improvement.
 We recognise the importance of 
retaining our highly skilled workforce. 
This year we rolled out a new Leadership 
Programme to our top 150 managers. We 
have played a key role in the development 
of Project Eden, an industry training 
initiative, and look forward to identifying 
Dairy Crest employees to take part in the 
first intake at Reaseheath College, the 
appointed education provider.
 We have also created a “Diversity and 
Flexibility” committee to oversee policy and 
approach and will be reviewing our ethical 
policy to ensure that its values are aligned 
with the company’s stated vision.  
 We listen to our workforce. In response 
to the 2008 staff survey we introduced two 
initiatives: Team Talk, a monthly briefing; 
and ‘the gardens’ a staff website. We 
also launched a Reward and Recognition 
scheme. 2009 saw the second Employee 
Engagement Survey in which everyone was 
invited to participate.

Revenue
Reported Group revenue from continuing 
activities increased by 5% to £1,647.6 
million, principally reflecting the impact of 
price increases in the prior year, increased 
volumes across our key brands and the 
translation impact of Sterling weakness 
on St Hubert revenues. Group revenue, 
including our share of joint ventures, 
increased by 5% to £1,717.9 million.
Profit on operations
In this review, except where otherwise 
indicated, profit on operations is from 
continuing operations, includes our share of 
joint ventures’ pre-exceptional post-tax profit 
and is stated before exceptional items and 
amortisation of acquired intangibles. On this 
basis, Group profit on operations decreased 
by 2.9% to £109.0 million, generating an 
operating margin of 6.3%. Reported profit on 
operations from continuing operations after 
exceptional items was £68.1 million (2008: 
£74.4 million) a decrease of 8.5%. 
 The Foods division’s profit on operations 
increased by 25.4% to £101.1 million 
reflecting a strong Spreads performance 
compared to last year when results were 
adversely affected by the Clover recall in 
May 2007. Furthermore, Sterling weakness 
in 2008/09 has improved reported St 
Hubert profits when translated into Sterling. 
Operating margins in the Foods division 
increased from 14.2% to 16.6%.
 The Dairies division has been impacted 
by losses in our Ingredients operations due 
to sharp falls in realisations in the second 
half. Additionally, the doorstep decline rate 
increased in the Autumn although this has 
since improved. Finally, property profits of 
£4.3 million are £2.3 million lower than last 
year reflecting the weak UK property market. 
Profit on operations fell to £7.9 million as a 
result of these factors however the closure 
 26 Financial review
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
of the Nottingham dairy further improved 
the liquids operational cost efficiencies and 
fresh milk volumes have increased in the 
year. Dairies margins decreased from 3.0% 
to 0.7%.
Exceptional items
Exceptional gains of £26.4 million represent 
the profit on disposal of our share in Yoplait 
Dairy Crest Limited (‘YDC’), the loss on 
disposal of our Stilton and speciality cheese 
business, the closure of the Nottingham dairy 
(and associated distribution changes), the 
extra costs of dual running of our new cheese 
cutting and packing facility at Nuneaton with 
the existing packing agreement, a non-cash 
asset impairment in relation to our business 
in Wexford and final amounts in relation 
to exceptional costs charged in 2007/08, 
namely the onerous contract provision and 
the closure of a dairy in Totnes, Devon.
 On 26 March 2009 we sold our 49% 
investment in YDC to Yoplait SAS for gross 
consideration of £63.5 million resulting in a 
Group profit on disposal of £50.4 million.
 On 23 August 2008 we sold the 
property, plant and equipment and 
inventories of our Stilton and speciality 
cheese business based in Hartington, 
Derbyshire to Long Clawson Dairies Limited 
for gross consideration of £3.8 million resulting 
in a Group loss on disposal of £4.5 million.
 During the second half of the year, 
we closed our dairy processing plant in 
Nottingham and reconfigured our milk 
distribution arrangements by moving to 
regional distribution centres (‘RDCs’). 
As previously announced, this restructuring 
cost has been treated as exceptional 
and amounted to £7.2 million, of which 
£2.1 million related to asset impairments and 
£5.1 million were cash costs being principally 
costs of redundancy.

Overview
Despite a challenging economic 
environment, especially in the second 
half of the year, the Group has 
delivered strong cash flow, 
maintained investment in its brands 
and delivered profit in line with 
expectations.  
 2008/09 saw unprecedented 
volatility in financial markets and 
commodity prices. Key cost inputs 
(namely milk, energy, diesel, vegetable 
oil) were all increasing at the start of 
the year but fell sharply during the 
second half. Furthermore, realisations 
from milk by-products (cream, 
skimmed milk powders) decreased 
significantly during the year 
dramatically increasing the cost to the 
Group of balancing surplus milk by 
processing into ingredients. 
Additionally, Sterling depreciated 
against the Euro in the second half and 
the UK property market weakened 
which has limited our ability to sell 
surplus depots at acceptable prices. 
 The economic downturn and 
reduced levels of credit availability 
have decreased consumer confidence. 
Against this backdrop, promotional 
activity has increased markedly in 
the food sector as retailers focus on 
value propositions. Our brands have 
performed well but the increased 
level of promotional activity inevitably 
impacts margins. 
 In this environment, the Group 
priorities are:
•  to deliver strong net cash flows 
in the short term further reducing 
gearing levels;
•  to invest in brand strength to 
ensure that our brands are well 
placed as consumer confidence 
recovers in the future; and
•  to deliver improved earnings per 
share and return on capital employed.
DC_AR09_p26-30_28-5-09.indd 26 DC_AR09_p26-30_28-5-09.indd   26 1/6/09 18:43:40 1/6/09   18:43:40 business in October 2006 to First Milk 
Limited, the purchaser has been cutting and 
packing our product under a transitional 
agreement. During the year to 31 March 
2009 we have completed the building of a 
new cheese cutting and packing facility at 
our National Distribution Centre at Nuneaton. 
This will reduce the physical movement of 
cheese between sites in the future and allow 
us to exit the transitional arrangements with 
First Milk Limited. The plant and equipment 
was commissioned in early 2009 and 
volumes have been increasing since that 
time. We expect to reach the required 
volumes by July 2009. During this period of 
volume transferral from First Milk to Nuneaton 
there are cost inefficiencies at both sites 
leading to dual running costs until full exit 
from First Milk is completed. In the year to 31 
March 2009 these amounted to £3.7 million 
and a further £1.0 million is expected to be 
incurred during the first half of 2009/10. 
  Weakening realisations from commodity 
cheese have adversely impacted the 
performance of our business in Wexford, 
Ireland. As a result, an impairment of £5.6 
million has been charged against the carrying 
value of plant and equipment in the year 
ended 31 March 2009.
 The unprecedented increase in milk 
costs in 2007/08 resulted in a long-term 
supply contract with a middle ground 
customer becoming onerous in that year. A 
provision of £4.4 million was charged last 
year which represented the present value 
of future cash outflows estimated to result 
from this contract. The negotiation to exit 
this contract took more time than anticipated 
last year however resolution is now expected 
in the first half of 2009/10 and the contract 
should cease to be onerous from that time.

has been charged in the year to March 2009

contract versus those anticipated last year 
and some minor asset impairments.
 In September 2007, we closed our 
Totnes site and an exceptional cost of £4.8 
million was charged last year. Delays in 
the planning process and the very weak 
UK property market has caused significant 
delays to the final sale of the Totnes site 
and in the light of this a further £2.0 million 
has been charged as exceptional in the 
year ended 31 March 2009 in order for the 
carrying value of the property to reflect our 
revised best estimate of fair value less costs 
to sell.
Interest
Finance charges have increased by 12.6% 
to £29.5 million principally as a result of 
the translation effect on Euro-denominated 
interest costs. The decision to reduce Euro-
denominated debt in the second half will 
reduce the exposure of interest costs to 
exchange movements in the future. Currently, 
approximately 70% of Group debt is at fixed 
rates of interest through fixed coupon loan 
note issues or interest rate swaps. 
 Other finance income comprises the net 
expected return on pension scheme assets 
after deducting the interest cost of the defined 
benefit obligation. This resulted in a credit 
of £6.9 million in the year ended 31 March 
2009, a decrease of £3.2 million compared 
to the previous year. This amount can be 
highly volatile year on year as it is dependent 
upon financial market conditions on a specific 
day, namely 31 March. This volatility and the 
fact that the amount bears no relation to the 
underlying operational performance of the 
business have led us to exclude this item 
from ‘adjusted profit before tax’ - see below.
 Interest cover excluding the pension 
interest credit, calculated on adjusted profit 
from operations, remains comfortable, at 3.7 
times (2008: 4.3 times).
Adjusted profit before tax
The Group’s adjusted profit before tax on 
a historic basis (calculated on continuing 
operations, before exceptional items and 
amortisation of acquired intangibles) was 
£86.4 million (2008: £96.1 million). This 
definition has been revised to exclude other 
finance income relating to pensions. Under 
this measure, the Group’s adjusted profit 
before tax was £79.5 million (2008: £86.0 
million). The reconciliation to reported profit 
before tax is as shown above.
 Profit before tax from continuing 
operations after exceptional items, reported 
under IFRS, was £103.2 million (2008: 
£66.0 million).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate on profits 
excluding exceptional items and including 
joint ventures’ tax was 26.8% (2008: 
23.2%). The effective tax rate is below 
the mixed UK / France statutory rate of 
corporation tax due to:
•  the profit on depot disposals (£4.3 
million) being sheltered by rollover relief 
and brought forward capital losses; and
•  the benefit of certain tax efficient 
financing structures that were 
implemented on the acquisition of
 St Hubert.
The increase in effective rate of tax 
compared to last year is due to lower 
property profits (which are tax free), a higher 
proportion of St Hubert profits and tax due 
to Sterling weakness (French profits are 
taxed at higher rate), the lost benefit from 
the St Hubert financing structures following 
the March 2008 budget and the extra 
benefit in 2007/08 of deferred tax balances 
being reduced as the UK rate of corporation 
tax reduced from 30% to 28%. The effective 
rate of tax is expected to increase next year 
to approximately 28%.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
Furthermore, the first half of 2008/09 saw 
the enactment of the cessation of industrial 
buildings’ allowances. Under IFRS the 
Group must recognise a non-cash deferred 
tax liability which will unwind over 25 years. 
This deferred tax liability was charged 
as exceptional tax in the first half and 
amounted to £14.3 million.
 The reported Group effective tax rate 
from continuing operations is 28.0% 
(2008: 18.9%)
Group profit for the year
Reported Group profit for the year after 
discontinued operations increased by 35.8% 
to £74.3 million (2008: £54.7 million).
Earnings per share
The Group’s adjusted basic earnings per 
share from continuing operations decreased 
by 13.0% to 45.0 pence per share (2008: 
51.7 pence per share). This measure has 
been amended to exclude the pension 
interest credit consistent with our adjusted 
profit before tax measure going forward. 
Under the old measure, adjusted earnings 
per share decreased by 14.5% to 48.8 
pence per share (2008: 57.1 pence per 
share). In the year to 31 March 2009, 
Yoplait Dairy Crest contributed £7.1 million 
of profit after tax and 5.4 pence per share. 
 Basic earnings per share from continuing 
operations which includes the impact of 
exceptional items, pension interest income 
and the amortisation of acquired intangibles, 
increased by 41.3% to 56.8 pence per share 
(2008: 40.2 pence per share). This reflects 
the exceptional profit on disposal of YDC in 
the year ended 31 March 2009.
 A diluted earnings per share calculation, 
which reflects the impact of potential 
ordinary shares from unvested share option 
schemes, is presented for both the basic 
and adjusted earnings per share amounts.  
Dividends
The proposed final dividend of 13.0 pence 
per share gives a total dividend of 20.1 pence 
per share for the full year. The proposed 
final dividend represents a 25% rebasing 
compared to last year. The final dividend will 
be paid on 6 August 2009 to shareholders 
on the register on 26 June 2009. The interim 
dividend paid on 29 January 2009, was 7.1 
pence per share. If this had been subject to 
the rebasing noted above the payment would 
have been 5.3 pence per share.
Pensions
The total pension deficit at 31 March 
2009 was £63.3 million compared to 
a £31.6 million surplus at 31 March 
2008. The position worsened due to the 
unprecedented weak performance of equity 
and bond markets during the year partly 
mitigated by increased AA corporate bond 
yields, which under IAS 19 are used to 
discount pension liabilities. The Group paid 
an additional £12 million into the main UK 
scheme during the year. Looking ahead, 
the Group will resume deficit funding 
contributions at a rate of £20 million per 
annum from October 2009. 
 The reported pension deficit is 
extremely sensitive to changes in underlying 
assumptions and will, inevitably, be volatile 
from year to year. The actuarial loss 
reported in equity for the year is £118.1 
million (2008: £10.7 million gain).
 During the year, the Trustee of the 
pension fund agreed a £150 million 
transaction with Legal & General to insure 
around half of the fund’s liability for pensions 
in payment. This structure provides flexibility 
for Dairy Crest and the Trustee to explore 
further similar arrangements in the future. 
For the liabilities insured, the deal provides 
protection against both financial and 
demographic pension risks, in particular 
members living longer than expected. The 
Fund will continue to pay pensions and 
members will not be impacted directly as 
the policy is an investment of the Fund. 
Dairy Crest remains committed to working 
together with the Trustee to meet its 
pension obligations, through a combination 
of cash funding and strategic investment of 
the Fund’s assets.
Cash flow
Cash generated from operations was 
£129.1 million in the year (2008: £108.4 
million). This includes a working capital 
inflow of £19.1 million (2008: £7.4 million 
outflow). The increased working capital 
inflow in 2008/09 was achieved despite an 
outflow in relation to stocks of £38.3 million. 
 The stock increase principally relates 
to cheese stock inflation due to milk cost 
increases during 2007/08. In the first half 
of the year, the remaining lower cost cheese 
was sold through. Stocks of ingredients 
peaked at the half year, however the volume 
of milk processed into ingredients was 
substantially reduced in the second half and 
ingredients stock levels of below £5 million 
at 31 March 2009 are back at normal levels. 
 There has been substantial progress this 
year in reducing debtors in our Household 
business, where the level of trade debtors 
is approximately £20 million less than at 
31 March 2008. A further benefit was the 
timing of receipt of large customer payments 
around the year end. Several customers pay 
monthly around the calendar month end and 
we benefited in March 2009 from certain 
customer receipts falling before the year end 
cut-off. This beneficial timing difference will 
not necessarily repeat in future periods. 
 Capital expenditure of £49.3 million (net 
of grants), was £15.3 million higher than 
last year (2008: £34.0 million). Significant 
investment was undertaken at our National

year in order to build and commission a 
new cheese cutting and packing facility. The 
spend during the year was £17.2 million 
and the facility commenced operating in the 
last quarter with target capacity utillisation 
expected by July 2009. Cash receipts from 
the disposal of fixed assets amounted to 
£22.4 million (2008: £13.2 million) and 
include £15.5 million from sale of certain 
plant and equipment at Nuneaton which has 
been leased back under an operating lease.
 Cash interest and tax payments 
amounted to £30.3 million and £9.2 million 
respectively (2008: £22.9 million and £6.7 
million). Interest payments are £7.4 million 
higher than last year consistent with the 
higher interest cost in the profit and loss 
account. Tax payments remain low in 
the UK due to additional pension deficit 
contributions of £12 million on which we 
receive a tax deduction.
 Cash inflows from the sale of businesses 
of £63.1 million comprise £59.9 million 
from the sale of our 49% share of Yoplait 
Dairy Crest in March 2009 and £3.2 million 
from the sale of our Stilton and speciality 
cheese business in August 2008. There 
was minimal expenditure of £0.3 million on 
infill acquisitions in the Household business 
during the year. 
 The Group received £2.9 million in 
dividends from YDC in the year (2008: £7.3 
million) and paid dividends to shareholders 
of £32.3 million (2008: £30.8 million).
Net debt
Net debt decreased by £59.0 million to 
£415.8 million at the end of the year as 
strong operating cash flows and receipts 
from the sale of businesses more than 
offset the £36.1 million increase in reported 
net debt due to the translation effect of 
weaker Sterling. Net debt is defined such 
that, where cross currency swaps are used 
as cash flow hedges to fix the interest and 
principal payments on currency debt, the 
swapped Sterling liability is included rather 
than the retranslated foreign currency debt.  
 In July 2008 the Group successfully 
agreed a new 5-year revolving credit facility of 
£85 million and €175 million which replaced 
the 2004 facility that was due to expire in 
June 2009. Despite difficult credit markets 
the Group succeeded in agreeing unchanged 
financial covenants in the new facility and had 
good support from the existing syndicate of 
banks. The Group remains comfortably within 
its covenants with the net debt to EBITDA 
ratio (for covenant purposes) at 31 March 
2009 just below 3.0 times.
  During the year, the Group reduced its 
net debt / EBITDA exposure to fluctuations 
in the Sterling / Euro exchange rate by 
reducing Euro-denominated borrowings by 
€225 million. This limits the impact on our 
banking covenant should Sterling depreciate 
further in the future.
 At 31 March 2009, gearing (being the 
ratio of net debt to shareholders’ funds) was 
116% (2008: 122%).
Borrowing facilities
Group borrowing facilities comprise £321.5 
million of loan notes maturing between April 
2013 and April 2017, a £100 million multi-
currency revolving credit facility expiring 
in November 2011 and a £85 million plus 
€175 million multi-currency revolving credit 
facility expiring in July 2013. At 31 March 
2009 there was £234.5 million effective 
headroom against committed facilities 
(2008: £191 million). 
 Borrowing facilities are subject to 
covenants which specify a maximum ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and a 
minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times. 
Treasury policies
The Group operates a centralised treasury 
function, which controls cash management 
and borrowings and the Group’s financial 
risks. The main treasury risks faced by the 
Group are liquidity, interest rates and foreign 
currency. The Group uses derivatives only 
to manage its foreign currency and interest 
rate risks arising from underlying business 
and financing activities. Transactions of a 
speculative nature are prohibited. The Group’s 
treasury activities are governed by policies 
approved and monitored by the Board and 
further details are provided in Note 31 to the 
financial statements. 
Net assets
The Group’s balance sheet remains robust 
with net assets of £357.0 million (2008: 
£387.7 million). Goodwill, intangible assets 
and property, plant and equipment total 
£834.2 million (2008: £812.5 million). 
Inventories of £197.8 million are £38.3 
million higher than prior year reflecting the 
increased cheese stocks referred to above.  
Going concern
The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis as the 
directors are satisfied that the Group has 
adequate financial resources to continue 
its operations for the foreseeable future. In 
making this statement, the Group’s directors 
have reviewed the Group budget and 
available facilities and have made such other 
enquiries as they considered appropriate.

compliance with the principles contained in the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting 
Council and explains any departure from its provisions. As the 
2008/09 financial year commenced after November 2006 but prior 
to 29 June 2008, references to the Combined Code in this report 
are to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of June 
2006 (‘Code’). This report has been prepared following the main 
principles of the Code. Those not referred to in this statement are 
dealt with elsewhere in the annual report. In accordance with listing 
rule 9.8.10R(2), the relevant parts of this report have been reviewed 
by Ernst & Young LLP and their opinion is set out on page 106.
The Board
Code main principle A.1: “Every company should be headed by an 
effective board, which is collectively responsible for the success of 
the company.”
Dairy Crest’s Board recognises its responsibility to provide 
entrepreneurial and responsible leadership to the Group within 
a framework of prudent and effective controls (described below) 
allowing assessment and management of the key issues and 
risks impacting the business. The Board sets Dairy Crest’s overall 
strategic direction, reviews management performance and ensures 
that the Group has the necessary financial and human resources 
in place to meet its objectives. The Board is satisfied that the 
necessary controls and resources exist within the Group to enable 
these responsibilities to be met.
The Board also ensures that the principal goal of the Company is to 
create shareholder value, while having regard to other stakeholder 
interests and takes responsibility for setting the Company’s values 
and standards. Accordingly, the long-term interests of shareholders, 
together with consideration of the wider community of interests 
represented by employees, customers and suppliers, and community 
and the environment are factored into the Group’s management 
processes. They are reinforced through employee participation in 
share ownership plans. Appropriate account is also given to social, 
environmental and ethical issues within the Company’s control and 
risk assessment processes. The steps taken to achieve these goals 
are communicated to shareholders and other interested parties 
through the Company’s External Affairs Director, the Company’s 
website (www.dairycrest.co.uk) and to employees via the Group 
intranet and through formal and informal briefings and newsletters. 
Through formal policies (summaries of which are published on the 
Company’s website) the Board seeks to engender a culture where 
business ethics, integrity and fairness are values that all employees 
endorse and apply in their everyday conduct.
During 2008/09, the Company continued its programme of 
embedding its core values with employees. Details of activity 
undertaken during the year are set out in the Corporate 
Responsibility report on pages 22 to 25. Further details will 
be provided in the CR report which will be published on the 
Company’s website in the summer.
The Board meets at least eight times a year, with additional meetings 
as required. In 2008/09, it met 12 times. On one occasion this was 
preceded by a Senior Executive strategic review meeting at which 
Board members were present. Details of Directors’ attendance 
at meetings during the year are set out below. Throughout the 
financial year a number of formal Board meetings are held at the 
site of operational business units. In 2008/09 the Board visited the 
Group’s manufacturing sites at Crudgington (Shropshire), Fenstanton 
(Cambridgeshire) and Foston (Derbyshire).
There is a documented schedule of matters reserved to the Board 
including strategy and management, financial structure and capital, 
reporting and controls, Board and committee appointments, executive 
remuneration, dividend policy and corporate governance compliance. 
During 2008/09, the Board received regular briefings upon the Group’s 
performance (including detailed commentary and analysis) and key 
issues and risks affecting the Group’s business. Reports on Group 
operations, human resources, governance and regulatory matters 
affecting the Group were provided to the Board on a regular and 
timely basis. Briefings on market activity, together with the views of 
shareholders and analysts on the Company, were also provided to 
the Board. The Group maintains appropriate insurance cover for 
the Directors and Officers and in 2005 the Company’s articles were 
amended to provide that the Company shall indemnify its Directors 
and other Officers out of the assets of the Company to the extent 
permitted by law.
Board committees
Summary
There are five principal Board committees: the Management Board; 
Audit; Corporate Responsibility; Nomination; and Remuneration. 
The roles and responsibilities of each of these committees 
are detailed below. All the Audit, Corporate Responsibility and 
Remuneration Committee members and a majority of Nomination 
Committee members are independent Non-Executive Directors 
under the Code. The Committees are provided with sufficient 
resources via the Company Secretariat and, where necessary, have 
direct access to independent professional advisers to undertake 
their duties.
Details of Directors’ attendance at each of the Board meetings and

& General Counsel and the Group Human Resources Director. 
Other Senior Executives, such as the Director of Group Financial 
Control and Director of Corporate Development attend by invitation. 
The Management Board is responsible, amongst other matters, 
for implementing the Group’s strategic direction, monitoring the 
performance of the business and its control procedures on a day-
to-day basis. Members normally meet weekly.
Audit Committee 
David Richardson continues to be chairman of the Audit Committee 
but has announced that he will step down from the Board once his 
successor has been appointed. The other members are Anthony 
Fry, Howard Mann, Neil Monnery and Carole Piwnica. David 
Richardson is a chartered accountant. Consistent with the Smith 
Guidance, all members of the Committee are independent Non-
Executive Directors. David Richardson is deemed by the Board to 
be the Audit Committee financial expert with recent and relevant 
financial experience and independent for the purposes of the 
Code. All of the Committee members have extensive commercial 
experience (see page 30). Further information on the Company’s 
application of the Code and on the Audit Committee and its work 
during the year is set out in its report on pages 35 and 36.
Corporate Responsibility Committee 
The Corporate Responsibility (‘CR’) Committee was established by 
the Board in year ended 31 March 2008 under the chairmanship of 
Carole Piwnica. The Committee, whose other members are Anthony 
Fry, Howard Mann, Neil Monnery and David Richardson, oversees 
the Group’s CR programme and ensures that key social, ethical and 
environmental risks are identified, assessed and prioritised accordingly. 
Terms of reference for the Committee are available on request and 
are published on the Group’s website. During the year 2008/2009 the 
Committee has focussed on strategy and commitment across four 
key areas: Workplace, Marketplace, Community and Environment. A 
report on the Committee’s activities during the year 2008/09 is set out 
at pages 22 to 25.
Nomination Committee 
The members of the Nomination Committee are Howard Mann, 
(the Senior Independent Director and chairman of the Committee), 
Anthony Fry, Neil Monnery, Simon Oliver, Carole Piwnica and David 
Richardson. The Committee meets as and when required. During the 
year it met once and details of Directors’ attendance at that meeting 
during the year are set out above. Company executives and advisers 
attend meetings by invitation only. The Committee updates the 
Board and makes recommendations as and when required.
The terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are available 
on request and are published on the Group’s website. In essence, 
this Committee is responsible for succession planning at Board 
level, overseeing the selection and appointment of Directors and 
making its recommendations to the Board. It is also responsible, 
in conjunction with the Chairman of the Group, for evaluating the 
commitments of individual Directors and the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board. It also ensures that 
the membership of the Board and its principal committees are 
refreshed periodically. Where appropriate, the Committee will 
prepare an outline of the role and capabilities required for particular 
appointments and use an external search consultancy and/or 
advertising in relation to Board appointments.
During 2008/09, its focus was upon succession planning for the 
Board and it has commenced a suitable search process, including 
the use of external consultants, to identify a successor for David 
Richardson, following the announcement in April 2009 that he will 
step down from the Board once his successor has been appointed.
The Remuneration Committee 
Neil Monnery has chaired the Remuneration Committee for 
the year ended 31 March 2009. Its other members have 
been Anthony Fry, Howard Mann, Carole Piwnica and David 
Richardson. The Committee has met twice in 2008/09. Details 
of Directors’ attendance at meetings during the year are set out 
above. A detailed description of the Committee’s remit and work 
during 2008/09, including further information on the Company’s 
application of the principles of the Code, is contained in the 
Remuneration Report (which was approved by the Board) on 
pages 38 to 44. Its terms of reference comply with the Code, are 
available on request and are published on the Group’s website. 
The full terms and conditions of appointment of the Company’s 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at its registered 
office, and a summary is available on the Group’s website. The 
chairman of the Committee provided a report to the Board following 
each meeting of the Remuneration Committee.
Other committees 
The Group’s Strategy and Policy Leadership Team, chaired by 
the Chief Executive, which consists of executive Board members 
and Senior Executives responsible for the key business units 
also meets regularly. The Strategy and Policy Leadership Team 
is used to assist the Executive Directors in the execution of their 
duties by helping to shape and influence the Group’s strategy and 
policy. Through its diverse membership representing the various 
constituencies of the Group it helps to ensure that key stakeholders 
are consulted and have the opportunity to input into the design 
and preparation of the Group’s strategy, policy and key business 
decisions. Within each of the Group’s commercial divisions there 
are operating boards responsible for monitoring the performance 
of those business units. To ensure consistency of approach and 
cross-learning, members of the Strategy and Policy Leadership 
Team also chair Group leadership teams responsible for the 
following areas: finance; information technology / systems; supply 
chain; human resources; innovation; marketing; sales; vision & 
values; health and safety. Reports are provided from these various 
leadership teams, as appropriate, to the Management Board, the 
Strategy and Policy Leadership Team and the Board.
Chairman and chief executive
Code main principle A.2: “There should be a clear division of 
responsibilities at the head of the company between the running 
of the board and the executive responsibility for the running of the 
company’s business. No one individual should have unfettered 
powers of decision.”
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the roles of 
Chairman (who serves in a non-executive capacity) and Chief 
Executive which is set out in writing and which has been approved 
by the Board.

Code main principle A.3: “The board should include a balance of 
executive and non-executive directors (and in particular independent 
non-executive directors) such that no individual or small group of 
individuals can dominate the board’s decision taking.”
As at the date of this report, the Board comprises three Executive 
Directors and six Non-Executive Directors (including the Chairman). 
Simon Oliver is Non-Executive Chairman and Mark Allen, Chief 
Executive; Alastair Murray, Group Finance Director; Martyn Wilks, 
Executive Managing Director (Foods); Anthony Fry, Non-Executive 
Director; Howard Mann, Non-Executive and Senior Independent 
Director and chairman of the Nomination Committee; Neil Monnery, 
Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee; Carole Piwnica, Non-Executive Director and chairman 
of the Corporate Responsibility Committee; and David Richardson 
is Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Audit Committee.
During the year, on 11 December 2008, Martin Oakes resigned as 
an Executive Director from the Board.
Biographies of each of the current Directors, their responsibilities and 
principal Board committee memberships can be found on page 30.
During 2008/09, all the Non-Executive Directors confirmed to 
the Board that they had sufficient time available to fulfil their 
obligations as directors of the Group and, should any individual’s 
position change, that they would inform the Board. Details of the 
Chairman’s other significant professional commitments are included 
in his biography (page 30).
Following review of the provisions of the Code by the Nomination 
Committee and the Board, the Board considers all the Non 
Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman who was independent 
on appointment, to be independent.
Appointments to the Board
Code main principle A.4: “There should be a formal, rigorous and 
transparent procedure for the appointment of new directors to 
the board.”
Appointments to the Board and its committees are reserved for 
the Board, based on recommendations from the Nomination 
Committee (see above). The appointment and removal of the 
Secretary is a matter reserved to the Board as a whole.
Information and professional development
Code main principle A.5: “The board should be supplied in a timely 
manner with information in a form and of a quality appropriate 
to enable it to discharge its duties. All directors should receive 
induction on joining the board and should regularly update and 
refresh their skills and knowledge.”
Robin Miller, who was Company Secretary during the year, was 
responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters, 
under the stewardship of the Chairman, ensuring Board procedures 
were followed and applicable rules and regulations were 
complied with. During 2008/09, Mr Miller ensured that Board and 
Board Committee papers containing accurate, timely and clear 
information, were generally circulated at least seven days before 
meetings. Periodic updates were circulated as and when required.
Training and briefings are available to all Directors on appointment 
and thereafter Directors keep abreast of the Group’s business 
through meetings with and presentations by senior management 
below Board level and through site visits to operating divisions. 
During 2008/09, as part of the process of enhancing the Non-
Executive Directors’ knowledge of the business, various visits and 
presentations from management teams took place.
All Non-Executive Directors undergo induction programmes upon 
appointment and have full access to management and to the internal 
and external auditors. The induction process includes the provision of 
background materials on the Company, together with information on 
the responsibilities of Directors under the Listing Rules, briefings by 
key Senior Executives at and below Board level and the Company’s 
Head of Internal Audit and site visits to the main operating locations. 
An overview of the business is provided, along with information on 
its financial performance and the Risk Register. The Non-Executive 
Directors variously receive independent training on technical 
accounting and other governance related matters from professional 
service providers and institutions and bulletins from the Group on 
developments in the dairy sector generally.
All Directors individually, and each of the Board Committees, have 
access to the advice and services of the Company Secretariat and 
the Secretary. They all receive from the Company Secretariat a regular 
report on corporate governance issues. There are also procedures 
in place enabling Directors in the furtherance of their duties to seek 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense.
Performance evaluation
Code main principle A.6: “The board should undertake a formal and 
rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual directors.”
The Board conducts an annual evaluation of individual Directors, 
its own performance and of Board Committees. The evaluation 
process is designed to improve the effectiveness of the Board.
Individual Director performance is usually reviewed as follows:
•  Each Director completes a self-assessment questionnaire and 
the Chairman then meets separately with each Director in order 
to appraise their individual performance and effectiveness and 
to identify any training requirements.
•  Appraisal of the Chairman’s performance is conducted by 
the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director (taking into account the views 
of the Executive Directors) using completed assessment 
questionnaires.
•  The Chief Executive appraises the performance of the other 
Executive Directors with regard to their management and 
operational responsibilities, in accordance with the Company’s 
normal performance and development review procedures.
Appraisals were performed for the Directors for their performance 
in 2008/09. The Chairman reported to the Board on the outcome 
of the appraisals, in relation to the Board’s overall effectiveness, 
at its meeting on 15 May 2009. A summary of the completed 
self-assessment questionnaires indicated that Board processes 
and frequency of meetings were satisfactory, that the level of 
information provided was good and that Board relationships were

the performance of its Board Committees and it was agreed 
that the practice of all Non-Executive Directors (except for the 
Chairman) being members of all Board Committees (apart from the 
Management Board) was effective in ensuring good communication 
and awareness of all relevant issues.
The Senior Independent Director has led the process to evaluate 
the performance of the Chairman. Assessment questionnaires have 
been completed on this by the other Board members. During the 
year, the Non-Executive Directors met alone and with the Chairman 
to review his performance.
Re-election
Code main principle A.7: “All directors should be submitted for 
re-election at regular intervals, subject to continued satisfactory 
performance. The board should ensure planned and progressive 
refreshing of the board.”
All Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) following appointment and 
thereafter to re-election at least every three years. The Company’s 
articles require the retirement of one third of the Directors who 
are subject to retirement by rotation at each AGM, however, if the 
number of Directors eligible for retirement by rotation at any given 
AGM is less than three, one Director must retire by rotation. Details 
of the Directors retiring by rotation at the 2009 AGM are set out at 
page 48 in the Directors’ report.
As detailed above under ‘performance evaluation’ the contribution 
that each of the candidates seeking re-election by shareholders 
makes to the Group was evaluated. This was a particularly rigorous 
evaluation in respect of the Senior Independent Director, Howard 
Mann, as he will have completed more than six years service 
as a Director at the date of the AGM in 2009. The Nomination 
Committee’s conclusion was that, having regard to the roles that 
they perform and individual input and contribution they make, 
each candidate’s performance more than justified nomination for 
re-election by shareholders. The Board unanimously endorses the 
views of the Nomination Committee on all Directors seeking re-
election. In particular, it was felt that Howard Mann’s nomination 
for re-election would help provide Board continuity, in view of the 
appointment of three new Non-Executive Directors in 2007.
The Code is clear at provision A.2.2 that the Chairman should 
be independent on appointment; however, footnote 2 to Code 
provision A.3.1 is explicit that thereafter, the test of independence 
is not appropriate to the Chairman. Notwithstanding, at its meeting 
in May 2007, the Nomination Committee resolved that because 
the Chairman would have completed more than nine years service 
as a Director as at the date of the AGM in 2008, in accordance 
with the spirit of the Code he should stand for re-election annually. 
Accordingly, Mr Oliver will retire from the Board again at the 2009 
AGM and offer himself for re-election. The Nomination Committee 
has recommended that Mr Oliver be proposed for re-election 
and the Board supports this recommendation and is satisfied 
that his performance continues to be effective and demonstrates 
appropriate commitment to the role, including devoting adequate 
time for Board and committee meetings and other duties.
Risk management and internal controls
Code main principle C.2: “The board should maintain a sound 
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the company’s assets.”
Introduction 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring a sound system 
of internal control and risk management. The schedule of written 
matters reserved to the Board ensures that the Directors are 
responsible for the control of, amongst other matters, all significant 
strategic, financial and organisational risks.
An overview of some of the principal risks surrounding the Group 
is contained in the business review section of the Directors’ report 
at pages 45 to 47. To manage these and other commercial and 
operational risks the Group has an established programme that 
assists management throughout the Group to identify, assess and 
mitigate business, financial, operational and compliance risks on a 
continuous basis. The Board views management of risk as integral 
to good business practice. The programme is designed to support 
management’s decision making and to improve the reliability of 
business performance. The risk management process operates 
throughout the Group, being applied to the main business divisions 
and corporate functions.
Internal controls 
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing its 
effectiveness to support its strategy and objectives. The systems 
of internal control are based on an ongoing process of identifying, 
evaluating and seeking to manage key risks and includes the risk 
management processes set out above. The systems of internal 
control were in place throughout the year and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The 
effectiveness of these systems has been periodically reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and the Board, in accordance with the 
Turnbull Committee Guidance On Internal Control (revised October 
2005).
Control systems 
The main components of the organisation for internal control are 
summarised below. Their foundation is in the considerable value 
that the Group places, throughout its activities, on seeking to 
ensure that employees are of the highest quality and integrity. 
Formal control is exercised through a management structure, 
which includes clear lines of responsibility and documented 
delegations of authority from the Board. Processes underpinning 
the financial reporting systems are managed and monitored by line 
and functional management and regular reporting. Separately, the 
effectiveness of these internal controls is reviewed by an Internal 
Audit function that operates on a Group wide basis. It reports its 
results to the executive management team and directly to the Audit 
Committee. These controls and processes have been in place for 
the year under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual 
Report and Accounts.
• Board – the Board exercises its responsibilities through an 
organisational structure with clearly defined levels of responsibility 
and rules relating to delegated authorities. The Board meets regularly 
throughout the year and receives oral and written presentations to 
maintain control over strategic, financial, operational and compliance

financial performance, assessing capital expenditure proposals, 
agreeing media spend, senior management appointments and 
embedding risk management and controls in the Group. The 
Managing Director of each Division, in conjunction with senior 
management, operates and maintains controls appropriate to its own 
activities which conform to Group policies and procedures.
• Financial reporting – there is an annual budget presented to and 
approved by the Board which includes consideration of the major 
business risks, an assessment of the likelihood of crystallisation and 
actions in place to mitigate these risks. Each Division is required 
to report monthly to the Board on financial performance. Monthly 
financial information includes trading results, balance sheet and 
cash flow information by business Division with comparison against 
prior year and budget. Each Division periodically reassesses its 
forecast for the financial year. Annually, a strategic plan is also 
presented to the Board, which reviews financial projections for the 
following three years and includes consideration of current and 
likely future strategic, operational and market environment matters.
• Business Division reviews – on a quarterly basis, each 
business Division is required to complete a self-assessment 
controls questionnaire that requires the approval of business 
unit management. In addition, the Audit Committee and the 
Management Board receive copies of all Group Internal Audit 
reports which detail audit issues noted and corrective action 
plans. They also receive reports from the external auditors on the 
conclusions of their interim review and final audit.
Control of significant risks 
As required by the Code, the Board has established an ongoing 
process, in accordance with the Turnbull Committee Guidance On 
Internal Control (revised October 2005), to identify, evaluate and 
manage significant risks faced by the Group. This process includes 
the consideration of a register identifying and evaluating the Group’s 
significant risks and related financial, operational and compliance 
controls. With oversight from the Board and Audit Committee (which 
uses the services of the Group Internal Audit function), individual 
members of the Group’s senior management team are responsible for 
the ownership and mitigation of significant risks. The Audit Committee 
and the Board review the identified key risks, changes in their status or 
the composition of the risk matrix regularly.
Function of controls 
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system 
of internal control (including that of its former joint venture Yoplait 
Dairy Crest Limited, its stake in which the Company sold in 
March 2009). The systems of internal control are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives. They can only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material errors, losses, fraud or breaches of laws 
and regulations.
Report of the Audit Committee
Code main principle C.3: “The board should establish formal and 
transparent arrangements for considering how they should apply the 
financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an 
appropriate relationship with the company’s auditors.”
Members 
The Audit Committee met three times in 2008/09. Details of 
Directors’ attendance at meetings during the year are set out at page 
31. The chairman of the Audit Committee provided a report on the 
work of the Committee and any significant issues that may have 
arisen at the Board meeting following each Committee meeting.
Attendees at meetings 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and Chairman of the 
Group and other senior management attend Committee meetings 
by invitation of the Committee. Representatives of the Group’s 
external auditors and the head of Group Internal Audit, also attend 
these meetings by invitation. In 2008/09, the external and internal 
auditors attended all meetings, had direct access to the Committee 
during the meetings and time was also set aside for them to have 
private discussions (jointly and independently) with the Committee, 
in the absence of management.
Audit Committee compliance with the Code 
The Audit Committee’s terms of reference (available on request 
and published on the Group’s website) comply with the Code. 
During 2008/09, the formal calendar of items (which were reviewed 
at each Audit Committee meeting and within each annual cycle) 
embraced the Code requirements to:
•  monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, 
and any formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial 
performance, including reviewing significant financial reporting 
judgements and any disclosures contained in them;
•  review the Company’s internal financial controls and its 
internal control and risk management systems and to make 
recommendations to the Board;
•  monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit function;
•  make recommendations to the Board, for it to put to the 
shareholders for their approval in general meeting, in relation to 
the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external 
auditors and to approve the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors;
•  review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements; and,
•  review the Group’s policy on the engagement of the external 
auditors to supply non-audit services.
Audit Committee activities 
An overview of the work undertaken by the Audit Committee during 
2008/09 is described below.
The Audit Committee determined that it was satisfied that the 
independence of the external auditors had been maintained, having 
taken into account the external auditors’ written representations 
and the Committee’s own enquiries.
The Audit Committee reviewed the external auditors’ audit scope, 
plans and materiality levels and the resources proposed to execute 
the plans. Having done so, the Committee approved the terms 
of engagement and the audit fees. The Committee also reviewed 
the findings of the external auditors, their management letters on 
internal financial controls and audit representation letters.

and resources and independence of the external auditor and the 
effectiveness of the audit process. Ernst & Young LLP was first 
appointed as external auditor to the Company in 1996. There 
are no contractual restrictions on the Company with regard to its 
appointment. The Audit Committee has not considered it necessary 
since its initial appointment to require the firm competitively to 
tender for the audit work. In the light of the assessments and 
review undertaken and having considered a recommendation of the 
Committee to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s and 
Group’s external auditors, the Board endorsed the Committee’s 
recommendation which was approved by shareholders in July 2008.
Where the external auditors have provided non-audit services the 
Group Finance Director has obtained prior authorisation from the 
chairman of the Committee to instruct Ernst & Young LLP to carry 
out this work. In the year ended 31 March 2009, non-audit work 
undertaken by Ernst & Young was principally advice on tax. A 
statement of fees for services from the external auditors in relation 
to 2008/09 is set out at note three to the Financial Statements on 
page 64. Having undertaken a review of the nature and amount 
of non-audit related work, the Audit Committee has satisfied itself 
that the services undertaken during 2008/09 did not prejudice the 
auditors’ independence.
The Audit Committee met prior to the Board meetings at which the 
interim Financial Statements and the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements were approved. The Committee reviewed significant 
accounting policies, financial reporting issues and judgements and, 
in conducting this review, considered reports from the external 
auditors, financial management and Internal Audit.
The Committee considered authority limits; the adequacy of the 
Group’s accounting systems and internal controls; the Group’s 
Risk Register and its compliance with the Code. It reviewed the 
Group’s treasury operations including, net debt levels, facility 
headroom, compliance with banking covenants, Group pension 
scheme funding arrangements, and the level and appropriateness 
of hedging arrangements.
During the year the Committee reviewed and considered reports 
from the head of Group Internal Audit including findings from the 
Internal Audit function concerning internal controls and the status 
of the correction of any weaknesses in internal controls identified 
by the internal and the external auditors. In addition, the Audit 
Committee reviewed and approved the remit, organisation, plans 
and resources of the Group’s Internal Audit function; and, carried 
out a review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and 
met the head of that function without management being present.
The Committee reviewed its written terms of reference and, in 
revising these, took account of the latest changes to relevant 
legislation, regulation and best practice. 
Whistle Blowing 
The Audit Committee reviews the arrangements by which 
employees of the Group may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other 
respects, under the Group’s whistle blowing policy. The Company 
Secretary leads the whistle blowing team. The Audit Committee is 
satisfied that these arrangements allow for appropriate independent 
investigation of any such matters and suitable follow-up actions.
Communication with investors
Code main principle D.1: “There should be a dialogue with 
shareholders based on the mutual understanding of objectives. 
The board as a whole has responsibility for ensuring that a 
satisfactory dialogue with shareholders takes place.”
Introduction 
The Group believes it is important to explain business developments 
and financial results to its shareholders and to understand any 
shareholder concerns, and that suitable arrangements are in place 
to ensure a balanced understanding of the issues and concerns of 
major shareholders. The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
have primary responsibility for investor relations. They are supported 
by the Company’s External Affairs Director who, among other matters, 
organises presentations for analysts and institutional investors and holds 
meetings with key institutional shareholders to discuss strategy, financial 
performance and investment activities immediately after the full year and 
interim results announcements. Slide presentations made to institutional 
shareholders are also available on the Company’s website. All the 
Non-Executive Directors and, in particular, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director, are available to meet with major shareholders, if 
such meetings are so required. Further financial and business information 
is available on the Investor Centre section of the Company’s website.
Feedback from meetings with shareholders is provided to the 
Board to ensure that the Non-Executive Directors have a balanced 
understanding of the issues and concerns of major shareholders. 
This includes communication with the shareholders at the AGM, 
regular feedback from the Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director on their meetings with major shareholders, and periodic 
reports to the Board on investor relations together with feedback 
from the Company’s brokers on the views of major shareholders.
The principal method of communication with private shareholders is 
through the Annual and Interim Reports, the AGM and through the 
Company’s website.
Annual general meeting
Code main principle D.2: “The board should use the AGM to 
communicate with investors and to encourage their participation.”
A business review is presented by the Chairman at the AGM 
to facilitate shareholder understanding of the Group’s activities. 
Arrangements are made for all Executive Directors, the Chairman, 
the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, the remaining 
Non-Executive Directors and the chairmen of Board Committees 
to attend the AGM and to be available to answer shareholders’ 
questions. Unfortunately Mr Anthony Fry was unable to attend the 
AGM in July 2008 as a result of his attendance at a family funeral 
overseas. Notice of the AGM is, in accordance with the applicable 
Companies Act and the Company’s articles, either posted in hard 
copy to shareholders or posted on the Company’s website at least 
21 days before the date of the AGM. Resolutions are proposed for 
each substantial separate issue and details of the proxy voting on 
each resolution are announced at the AGM after the results of the 
show of hands is known and are posted on the Company’s website 
following the conclusion of the meeting.

lodged on each resolution. It also publishes the level of votes for and 
against resolutions and the number of abstentions. The Company 
ensures that votes cast are properly received and recorded.
Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially discrete 
subject and the Company does propose a resolution at the AGM 
relating to the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Access to information 
Electronic communication continues to become the principal 
medium for shareholders, providing ready access to shareholder 
information and reports. Recognising this, Annual Reviews, 
Annual Reports and Financial Statements and Interim Reports 
are published on the Company’s website. Pursuant to changes 
introduced by the Companies Act 2006, the Company sought 
shareholder approval at the 2007 AGM, subject to certain 
requirements, to communicate electronically with its shareholders. 
Other information which shareholders and third parties are entitled

The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee of Non-
Executive Directors of the Company. The Committee consists of Mr 
Neil Monnery (Chairman), Mr D H Richardson, Mr H Mann, Mr A Fry 
and Ms C Piwnica (Mr S M D Oliver attends meetings by invitation 
only). Members of the Remuneration Committee have no potential 
conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and they are not 
involved in the day-to-day running of the Company. The Committee 
also received material assistance and advice on remuneration policy 
from the Company’s Human Resources Director, Rob Tansey. The 
Remuneration Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP (‘PwC’) to provide advice on executive remuneration. During the 
year, PwC also provided other valuation services to the Group. The 
Chief Executive attends all meetings and provides advice on matters 
other than those concerning himself.
Role of the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the broad policy 
with respect to senior executives’ salary and other remuneration. It 
specifically determines, within remuneration principles agreed with 
the Board, the total remuneration package of each Executive Director 
and reviews with the Chief Executive the remuneration packages 
for other senior executives. A copy of the terms of reference of the 
Committee can be found on the Company’s website.  
The Committee met twice during 2008/09. Details of attendance are 
shown in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 31.
Key developments
2008/09
In 2008/09, Dairy Crest faced a challenging economic environment. 
The Group generated strong cash flows and increased investment in 
key brands but profits declined. Payment of annual bonus is subject 
to achieving demanding short-term financial targets and personal 
objectives. These stretching financial targets were not achieved, 
therefore, there will be no bonus payments even though Executive 
Directors met many personal objectives.
Awards under the 2006 Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’) will 
vest in August 2009 in respect of the three years to March 2009. 50% 
of the total award was based on the Company’s Economic Profit (‘EP’) 
and 50% was measured against the Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) 
performance of a comparator group of companies. Dairy Crest achieved 
the maximum EP target of £90 million and therefore 100% of the award 
related to EP will be released. EP performance over the three year 
vesting period was improved by the acquisition of St Hubert in January 
2007, a decreased exposure to commodity markets and strong financial 
performance in the first two years. However, the company did not 
meet the TSR target since recent share price performance versus the 
comparator group has been adversely impacted by the revised profit 
guidance issued in November 2008 and none of the award related to 
TSR will be released.
2009/10
2009/10 is expected to be a highly challenging year in light of the global 
economic climate. Consequently, there will be an even stronger focus 
on cash flow and cost control and on preserving profitability.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration framework 
continues to provide an appropriate link between reward and 
competitive performance. However, the Committee has made some 
adjustments in 2009, to ensure that the strategy of competitive 
outperformance is sustained in the current market conditions.
Key changes for 2009 are as follows:
•  Base salaries and fees for Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors have been frozen at 2008 levels. This decision 
has been taken in view of the challenging cost environment 
within which the Company will be operating throughout the 
coming year.
•  In the short term, there will be a strong focus on cost control, 
cash flow and profitability. Therefore for 2009, performance 
targets for annual bonus will be based 50% on Profit Before 
Tax, 25% on a measure of cash generation and the remaining 
25% on personal objectives. The additional financial target 
based on a measure of cash generation places emphasis on 
the need to optimise cash flow and manage working capital. 
•  In respect of long-term performance, the Committee has 
decided to place greater emphasis on relative TSR and this 
now forms 60% of the overall LTISP.
•  The achievement of the Company’s earnings objectives 
remains a key priority. The Committee has therefore decided to 
replace EP with Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) for the 2009 LTISP 
awards. The Committee believes that EPS provides greater 
transparency for shareholders and participants as well as a 
stronger line of sight to focus participants on achieving the 
Company’s earnings objectives.
•  LTISP awards for the 2009 – 2012 cycle will be based on a 
balance of growth in EPS (40%) and relative TSR (60%) in light 
of the difficult trading conditions. 
•  The Committee believes that the combination of TSR and EPS 
measures provides a strong and transparent alignment between 
executive and shareholder interests in the current turbulent 
environment.
•  Benchmark adjusted profit before tax and EPS numbers for 
the year ended 31 March 2009 have been adjusted to exclude 
the impact of Yoplait Dairy Crest, which was disposed of in 
March 2009.
The Committee believes this 2009 remuneration structure will 
enable us to continue to retain and motivate a strong and 
experienced management team, while at the same time reflecting 
the current environment within which we operate, and ensuring 
continued alignment with shareholder interests. Furthermore 
Executive Directors are encouraged to build a shareholding worth 
100% of salary in the Company and to this end would normally 
retain 50% of shares acquired from share and bonus plans until 
that shareholding is achieved.
Summary of remuneration policy for 2009
We ensure that remuneration packages contribute to the delivery 
of long-term shareholder value. This is reflected in the Company’s 
annual bonus scheme and LTISP awards which are explained in 
more detail below.

Make up of remuneration
A significant proportion of a director’s total remuneration package 
is variable, being subject to the achievement of specified short-
term and long-term business objectives. In applying this policy the 
Committee has taken account of the provisions of Schedule A of 
the Combined Code.
In the chart below we show the make up of remuneration under 
on-target performance. It can be seen that the fixed elements of 
pay represent around half of the maximum. 
•  Base salary is taken as amount paid in the year excluding any 
salary supplements in relation to pensions;
•  Benefits are taken as the taxable benefit provided in the year;
•  Pension is taken as (i) the value of one years’ pension, i.e. 
transfer value of the pension accrued in the year for defined 
benefit schemes or (ii) the amount of Company contributions 
for defined contribution schemes. It also includes any 
cash supplements resulting from contribution caps or non-
membership of any Company scheme;
•  Bonus is taken as the amount that would have accrued for the 
year ended 31 March 2009 for on-target performance; and
•  LTISP awards are based on the fair value of options granted in 
2008 in a manner consistent with IFRS2.
Components of remuneration
• Base salary
Salary levels for Executive Directors are reviewed annually based 
on an independent assessment of market practice. They are set 
to reflect the pay levels of executives with similar responsibilities in 
companies of comparable size and complexity. Base salaries for 
2009 have been frozen at 2008 levels.
• Bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors 
is 100% of annual salary. There are no current plans to change 
the maximum bonus percentage. Payment of the bonus is subject 
to the achievement of demanding short-term financial targets and 
personal objectives. Financial targets comprise 75% of the bonus, 
and personal objectives 25%. From 2008/09, 40% of the bonus is 
payable for on-target performance. 
We recognise the increased focus on cost control, cash flow and 
profitability and therefore, from 2009/2010 the targets for the 
annual bonus will be based 50% on Profit Before Tax, 25% on a 
measure of cash generation and the remaining 25% on personal 
objectives. 
To ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between long-
term and short-term reward, any bonus earned over 50% of annual 
salary is paid in the Company’s shares and deferred for a three 
year period.
• Long Term Incentive Share Plan
LTISP is designed to encourage continuing improvement in the 
Group’s performance over the longer term. An LTISP award is 
payable in shares, rather than cash, to emphasise the alignment 
of interests between the participants and the Company’s 
shareholders. The LTISP has a three-year performance cycle and 
pre-determined performance conditions which must be met before 
awards under the LTISP can be exercised. Awards under the LTISP 
are granted annually.
For existing awards under the LTISP:
•  50% of the total award is based on the Group’s EP. EP is 
defined as net operating profit less a capital charge based on 
capital employed multiplied by the Group’s Weighted Average 
Cost of Capital (‘WACC’); and
•  50% is measured on TSR performance against a comparator 
group of food manufacturing companies.
Performance against both EP and TSR is measured over a three 
year period.
The targets for the 2008 and 2007 awards are as follows:

Associated British Foods plc Premier Foods plc
Cranswick plc Robert Wiseman Dairies plc
Glanbia plc Tate & Lyle plc
Greencore Group plc Uniq plc
Kerry Limited Northern Foods plc
McBride plc
The value of shares awarded under the LTISP in any financial year 
is subject to limits determined by the Remuneration Committee 
from time to time. The current annual limit for awards is 150% of 
base salary and the maximum awards during the year were 100% 
of base salary. There is no current intention to make awards in 
excess of 100% of base salary in the future.
For awards made from 2009, the performance measures and 
structure are to be changed as follows:
• 40% of the total award will be based on EPS growth; and
•  60% will be measured on TSR performance against the 
FTSE 250 (excluding financial service companies, real estate 
companies and investment trusts).
Performance against both EPS and TSR will be measured over a 
three year period.

• Executive Share Option Scheme
The Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) was 
established on 30 July 1996 for Directors and certain senior 
management and expired in July 2006. A new ESOS was adopted 
at the AGM 2006 (‘ESOS 2006’). Part A is approved by the Inland 
Revenue and Part B is an unapproved scheme. Options are 
granted to participants at prices determined by the Remuneration 
Committee which may not be less than the market price of the 
shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official 
List at the time of grant.
At 31 March 2009, there were no outstanding options under this 
scheme (2008: Nil).
• Sharesave Scheme 
The Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme was first established on 
30 July 1996 and there have been seven grant phases since that 
date. The life of the Sharesave Scheme was extended in August 
2006 to allow options to be granted until the twentieth anniversary of 
flotation, being August 2016. The Sharesave Scheme is open to all 
eligible employees and full time Directors. Employees enter into an 
approved savings contract over a three-year term to make monthly 
contributions up to an overall maximum of £250 per month. At the 
end of the term members have the right to buy ordinary shares in the 
Company at a price fixed at the time of the option grant. The price at 
which the options may be offered may not be less than 80% of the 
market price at the time of option grant.
A sharesave grant was made in December 2007 in which 
approximately 1,700 employees participated. A further grant is 
expected to be made in 2009/10.
• Pension benefits
All Executive Directors with the exception of Mr M Wilks are 
members of the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund, which provides 
for a pension based upon an executive’s final basic salary. No 
bonuses are pensionable. Benefits are restricted by a scheme 
earnings cap which is calculated in a similar manner to the 
previous Inland Revenue pensions earnings cap. The following 
supplementary arrangements are in effect:
Mr M Allen and Mr A S N Murray received a salary supplement of 
20% of base salary above the earnings cap which is included in 
cash allowances in the emoluments table on page 41. 
Mr M N Oakes was a member of the Company’s stakeholder 
scheme up to the date of his resignation. This is a defined 
contribution arrangement operated by Zurich Insurance. The 
Company matched contributions paid by Mr M N Oakes at the rate 
of 1:2.5 up to a maximum contribution of 20% of basic salary.
Mr M Wilks is not a member of a Company pension scheme. 
He receives a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
• Beneﬁts in kind 
These include the taxable value of company car benefits, 
life assurance cover and Company contributions to medical 
insurance plans.
• Service contracts 
In accordance with best practice as set out in the Combined 
Code, all Executive Directors have a notice period not exceeding 
one year. All such Directors’ service contracts provide explicitly for 
termination payments in the event of termination by the Company 
other than on grounds of incapacity or in circumstances justifying 
summary termination. Payments on termination are calculated at 
70–90% of the value of annual salary, benefits, pension and bonus 
for the notice period. In the case of Mr M N Oakes, Mr M Wilks 
and for future appointments there is a mitigation clause in the 
service contract with respect to termination payments such that 
certain compensation payments are deferred. A summary of the 
service agreements of the Executive Directors is available on the 
Company’s website.
Details of the Directors offering themselves for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting are set out in the Directors’ 
report on page 48.

thirteenth Annual Report to shareholders together with the audited 
Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the 
year ended 31 March 2009. The purpose of the Annual Report is to 
provide information to members of the Company. The Company, its 
Directors, employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume 
responsibility to any other person to whom this document is shown or 
into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability 
is expressly disclaimed. It contains certain forward-looking statements 
with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of 
the Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since 
future events and circumstances can cause results to differ from those 
anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and 
information available at the date of preparation of this Annual Report 
and except to the extent required by applicable regulations or by law, 
the Group undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking 
statements. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a 
profit forecast.
Except where required by subsequent legislation, this report has been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 1985 s234 and the Companies Act 2006 s417. It has been 
compiled for a year in which the Company was a parent company. 
As the Company’s accounts are prepared as group accounts, this 
report is a consolidated report or “group directors’ report”. It relates 
to the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are included 
in the Company’s consolidation. As permitted by Companies Act 
1985 s234 (3), where appropriate, this report gives greater emphasis 
to the matters that are significant to the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings included in the consolidation, taken as a whole.
As the 2008/09 financial year commenced after November 2006 
but prior to 29 June 2008, references to the Combined Code in this 
report are to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance of June 
2006 (‘Code’). This report has been prepared following the main 
principles of the Code. Those not referred to in this statement are 
dealt with elsewhere in the Annual Report. In accordance with Listing 
Rule 9.8.10, the relevant parts of this report have been reviewed by 
Ernst & Young LLP and their opinion is set out on page 106.
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are the manufacture and trading 
of milk and dairy products.
Principal risks and uncertainties
In addition to the opportunities we have to grow and develop our 
business, the Company faces a range of risks and uncertainties as 
part of both its day-to-day operations and its corporate activities. 
The processes that the Board has established to safeguard both 
shareholder value and the assets of the Company are described in the 
corporate governance statement.
The narrative which follows describes those specific risks and 
uncertainties that the Directors believe could have the most significant 
impact on the Company’s long-term value generation. The risks and 
uncertainties described below are not intended to be an exhaustive list.
Marketplace risks
Consumer trends
It is possible that changing consumer trends may reduce the appeal 
of some of the Company’s businesses if those trends are not properly 
anticipated and action is not taken to address potential issues at an 
early stage.
Dairy Crest mitigates this risk in a number of ways. First, the Company 
carries out market research and analyses consumer trends. This 
research is used to anticipate future customer trends and, through 
new product development, to position itself to benefit from those 
trends. An example of this has been the continuing development of 
products focused on health described in the Chief Executive’s review 
on page 8. 
Our household business operates in a declining market but the 
Company delivers market-leading productivity ratios, has invested in 
new customer propositions, including its innovative milk&more internet 
proposition, and invests in targeted marketing and canvassing activity to 
address the overall decline rate. It is also trialling new business models.
Competition
The foods sector is highly competitive. The Company’s future financial 
performance would be at risk if it failed to compete strongly and lost 
market share to its competitors.
Dairy Crest has a portfolio of leading brands which it consistently 
supports by marketing and promotional investment such as the TV 
advertisements for Country Life spreadable brand focussing on its 
British heritage, designed to build long-term shareholder value.
Within the liquid milk business, the Company has strong relationships 
with certain major retailers and there is full involvement of Executive 
Directors in negotiations with these retailers and significant focus in 
delivering high levels of quality and service. 
Consumer spending
The current recession in Western economies is having an impact 
on consumer spending. As the majority of the Company’s revenue 
is generated in the UK, the general health of the UK economy 
and its influence on consumer spending in particular is important 
to the Company’s success. This poses a risk to the Group’s 
financial performance.
The Company’s product base consists of dairy-based consumables 
which form part of the staple purchases of the majority of households. 
This mitigates the impact on our business of any decrease in general 
consumer spending. The Company also continues to invest in its 
business, particularly in the form of targeted marketing spend and in 
the development of its operating facilities while maintaining focus on 
operating efficiencies and cost control. 
Inflation
The Group has experienced high levels of inflation with respect to 
certain non-milk input costs during 2008/09 namely, diesel, vegetable 
oils, energy, gas and plastics. There is a risk that this could impair 
future profitability.
Non-milk costs are monitored regularly and appropriate levels of 
forward cover are maintained. Where necessary, prices are increased 
to offset input cost increases. In addition, the cost base of the 
business continues to be rationalised so that we can absorb more 
inflationary costs and minimise price increases to our customers 
while investment has been focussed on the Company’s non-milk 
purchasing function.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
Directors’ report 45
DC08_Directors' report pp45-49_245 45 DC08_Directors' report pp45-49_245   45 2/6/09 18:36:46 2/6/09   18:36:46 The risk of continued increases in raw milk prices identified in last 
year’s report has not materialised, as commodity dairy prices have 
declined dramatically in 2008/09 as increased production outpaced 
demand. These are discussed in more detail in the Operating review 
on page 21.
Credit market weakness
Weakness in the international credit markets could pose risks to 
the cost of financing borrowings, the ability of the Group to 
renegotiate banking facilities and the financial position of our 
customers and suppliers.
The Group regularly reviews its funding arrangements and has a high 
proportion of fixed interest long-term debt which mitigates risks to the 
cost of borrowing. More details concerning financial risk management 
are described in Note 31 to the accounts on pages 93 to 96.
The Group has had a long-term relationship with a group of banks 
that participate in its syndicated loan facility. There is regular contact 
with all of our relationship banks from the Chief Executive and 
Finance Director and other senior management. As a result the 
banks understand the business and requirements of the Group and 
have provided support for a number of years. Additionally, there is 
enough depth in the syndicate to mitigate the risks of any one bank 
experiencing difficulties.
In July 2008 we successfully renegotiated our 2004 facility and 
agreed a new five year multi-currency revolving credit facility expiring 
in July 2013. This gives us security in facilities and comfortable facility 
headroom. The earliest facility to expire is the £100 million revolving 
credit facility in November 2011. Further details are included in the 
Financial review on pages 26 to 29 and Note 31 to the accounts on 
pages 93 to 96.
Customers with whom the Group trades are subject to credit checks 
and there is very close review of trade debtors, days outstanding 
and overdue amounts. The Group is focusing particularly closely 
on smaller customers who are considered to be more financially 
vulnerable during the current recession. Appropriate provisions are 
made when specific customers are deemed to be a risk. A large 
proportion of debt is with major UK multiple retailers which are 
considered to be of above average financial strength. Wherever 
possible, legal proceedings are taken to recover monies due. There 
is regular review of our supplier base for key inputs to ensure that 
wherever possible there is not over-reliance on one supplier and 
therefore a risk to the Group.
Operational risks
Milk supply 
There is a risk that the future volume produced in the UK of the 
key ingredient in the Company’s products, raw milk, will not be 
sufficient to cover forecast demand. In order to mitigate this risk, 
the Company obtains its milk under contract from a wide supplier 
base, more than half of which are farmers (rather than third-party 
commodity traders). The Company has paid a premium over 
commodity dairy prices for much of 2008/09 to the farmers 
supplying it with milk. The Company’s Milk Committee regularly 
reviews the strategy for milk supply. There is full involvement of the 
Company’s Milk Purchasing Director and its Executive Directors in 
negotiations with these milk suppliers.
Health and safety
A major incident resulting from a health and safety failure would be a 
significant reputational and financial risk to the Company. 
The Company takes health and safety very seriously. It has robust 
management processes focused on quality control risk management 
and has established major incident procedures that are in place and 
have been tested successfully during and since the recall of Clover in 
May 2007. Dairy Crest continues to set increasingly high standards 
for food safety throughout its supply chain and has recently enhanced 
its ‘Good Manufacturing Practice’ review and audit processes. 
The Company has recently undertaken a project, expected 
to complete during the course of 2009/10, to ensure its crisis 
management and business continuity processes remain appropriate.
Dairy Crest works closely with Government Agencies and dairy 
organisations to ensure it is able to respond effectively to the specific 
risk of raw milk supplies being impacted by an outbreak of diseases 
affecting cattle.
The Company carries insurance against the risk of property damage 
and business interruption.
More information on Dairy Crest’s approach to health and safety can 
be found on page 25 of the Corporate Responsibility review. 
Equipment
A failure of the Company’s principal equipment including its 
manufacturing control systems could lead to a halting of production 
and consequent loss of product. In order to mitigate this risk, the 
Company has trained engineering resources at its production sites 
which are supported by major equipment suppliers. The Company’s 
engineers undertake a continuous programme of preventative 
maintenance and they hold a supply of key spare parts on site. A 
project has been initiated to identify any additional support required 
for control systems used within the business in order to ensure 
company wide standards are maintained. 
Utilities
Maintaining a reliable supply of gas, electricity and water to its 
production sites is key for the Company’s manufacturing processes. 
Without this, there would be a risk of disruption to production, 
and spoilage of both finished product and raw materials. In order 
to mitigate this risk, the Company has contracts with major utility 
suppliers; it has its own generators at a number of its sites; and 
the Company adopts a layering approach to securing the supply 
of services. The Company is regularly audited by the responsible 
Government Agency and each manufacturing site is IS accredited.
People
The successful delivery of service to the Company’s customers 
relies on Dairy Crest recruiting and retaining people of a high quality. 
The failure to employ appropriate people would put the Company’s 
reputation at risk and could lead to the loss of market share.
Dairy Crest is proud of its people. The Company believes that by 
taking care of its people, its people will take care of its customers 
and financial performance will follow. Dairy Crest listens to the views 
of its employees, has a range of employment policies designed to 
make Dairy Crest a rewarding place to work and emphasises the 
importance it attaches to its people. Dairy Crest carries out a rigorous

More information on Dairy Crest’s people can be found on page 25 of 
the Corporate Responsibility review.
External financial risks
The Company’s financial risk management objectives and policies 
and risk exposures are described in detail in Note 31 to the accounts 
on pages 93 to 96.
Pension funding
Dairy Crest operates a defined benefit pension scheme. At 31 March 
2009, there was a gross pension fund deficit of £63.3 million (under 
IAS 19). There is a risk that this deficit could deteriorate further in the 
event, for example, of poor investment performance or increasing 
mortality rates and a corresponding risk that an increase to the level of 
funding already agreed to address the deficit, may be required. Recent 
legislation means that, on occasions, it may be necessary to approach 
the Pensions Regulator for pre-clearance of agreements reached with 
the Pension Trustee at the time of significant corporate transactions. 
Such clearance could include a requirement to increase the level of 
funding.
Dairy Crest’s pension risks have been mitigated by the closure of its 
defined benefit scheme to new entrants on 1 July 2006. As an 
alternative, a defined contribution pension scheme is available to 
eligible new employees. 
The Company continues to maintain a close dialogue with the 
pension scheme’s Trustee Board. The Company’s pension risks have 
been mitigated through the purchase in December 2008 of a bulk 
annuity policy with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited (‘L&G’). 
The policy sees L&G insuring part of the fund’s pension liabilities to 
the value of £150 million (equating to approximately half the fund’s 
liability for pensions in payment).
Legal and compliance risks
The business sector in which the Company operates is subject to a 
number of complex demanding Legal regulatory requirements. The 
Company has an in-house legal function and retains external advisors 
to ensure rigorous compliance with those existing regulations while it 
monitors and responds to new legal and regulatory developments.  
Going concern
As highlighted in the Financial review and Note 31 to the accounts, 
the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through 
committed long-term bank facilities. A tranche of these facilities 
was renegotiated in July 2008 and the earliest to expire is the £100 
million revolving credit facility expiring in November 2011. The recent 
economic conditions have increased risks and uncertainties faced by 
the Group particularly over: (a) the future direction of milk and other 
input prices and ingredients realisations; (b) the availability of future 
bank finance; (c) the competitive landscape with regard to branded 
products; and (d) the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro 
and impact on net debt. 
The Group has recently performed forecasts and projections both 
for 2009/10 and for the three years ending March 2012. These 
projections have taken account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance and have been stress tested to consider 
the impact of changes in key assumptions. These forecasts show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its 
current facilities. A €175m tranche of the Group’s facility flexes with 
movements in the Sterling/Euro exchange rate and there is currently 
adequate facility headroom. Should the £100 million facility expiring 
in November 2011 not be renegotiated and fall away, forecasts show 
that headroom would remain adequate. The level of Euro borrowings, 
having been reduced in the year ended 31 March 2009, are now 
such that exchange rate fluctuations no longer materially impact our 
bank covenant tests. There were no breaches of bank covenants in 
the year ended 31 March 2009 and projections do not indicate any 
breaches in the foreseeable future.
It should be recognised that any consideration of the foreseeable 
future involves making a judgement, at a particular point in time, 
about future events, which are inherently uncertain. Nevertheless, 
at the time of preparation of these accounts and after making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Business review
S417 of the Companies Act 2006 requires that the Company sets 
out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during 
the 2008/09 financial year, including balanced and comprehensive 
analysis of the development and performance of the Group during 
the financial year and the position of the Group at the end of the 
year; together with information relating to environmental, employee, 
social and community matters. In addition, the Company is required 
to provide a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group as described above and, to the extent necessary for an 
understanding of the business, the main trends and factors likely 
to affect the future development, performance and position of the 
Company’s business. The information satisfying the business review 
requirements is set out in this report; the Chairman’s statement on 
page 6; Chief Executive’s review on pages 7 to 9; Operating review 
on pages 10 to 21; the Corporate Responsibility review  on pages 
22 to 25 and Financial review on pages 26 to 29; all of which are 
incorporated into this report by reference.
Group results
The Group’s consolidated income statement set out on page 
51 shows a profit for the 2008/09 financial year of £74.3 million 
compared with £54.7 million in 2007/08.
Dividends
The Directors are recommending a final dividend of 13.0 pence 
(2007/08: 17.3 pence) per ordinary share, which, if approved, will be 
paid to members on the register at the close of business on 26 June 
2009. Together, the final dividend and interim dividend (7.1 pence per 
ordinary share paid on 31 January 2009) make total dividends for the 
year of 20.1 pence per ordinary share (2007/08: 24.4 pence).
Share capital
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company together 
with details of movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during 2008/09 are shown in Note 25 to the Financial Statements 
on page 87. As at the date of this report, 133.3 million ordinary 25p 
shares were in issue and fully paid with an aggregate nominal value

which are set out in its articles of association.
Issue of shares
At the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 17 July 2008, shareholders 
renewed the authority for the Board under the Company’s articles of 
association to exercise all powers of the Company to allot relevant 
securities up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to the ‘section 80 
amount’ until the conclusion of this year’s AGM. A ‘section 80 amount’ 
of £10,976,999 was declared at last year’s AGM. The Directors believe 
it advisable to seek renewal of this authority or replacement of it with a 
suitable alternative, annually at the AGM. Approval will be sought from the 
shareholders at this year’s AGM to renew the authority for a further year. 
Purchase of own shares
At the AGM on 17 July 2008 shareholders granted the Company 
authority to make market purchases of up to 13,305,454 of its issued 
ordinary shares of 25 pence each, provided that: the minimum price 
which may be paid for any such ordinary share is 25 pence (exclusive 
of expenses and appropriate taxes); the maximum price (exclusive of 
expenses and appropriate taxes) which may be paid for any such 
ordinary share shall be not more than 5% above the average of the 
middle market values for an ordinary share in the Company as taken 
from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business 
days immediately preceding the date of purchase. The Company did not 
exercise this authority during the year and made no market purchases.
Except in relation to a purchase of ordinary shares, the contract for 
which was concluded before the authority expires and which will or may 
be executed wholly or partly after such expiry, the authority granted 
shall expire at the conclusion of this year’s AGM. The Directors believe 
it advisable to seek renewal of this authority or replacement of it with a 
suitable alternative, annually at the AGM. Approval will be sought from 
the shareholders at the AGM to renew the authority for a further year. 
Pensions
The Group’s defined benefit pension fund is controlled by a corporate 
trustee, Dairy Crest Pension Trustees Limited, the Board of which 
comprises four nominees from Dairy Crest Limited (including an 
independent professional trustee organisation) and two employee 
members elected by all members whether active, deferred or pensioners. 
The pension funds’ assets are held separately from those of the Group 
and can only be used in accordance with the rules of the scheme. In 
2006, the defined benefit scheme was closed to new employees and a 
defined contribution scheme was established for new employees.
Significant agreements – change of control
A change of control of the Company following a takeover bid 
may cause a number of agreements to which the Company or 
its subsidiaries are party to take effect, alter or terminate. The 
agreements that are considered significant are as follows:
Borrowing facilities
Non-compliance with the change of control clauses in the Group’s 
funding arrangements, or failure to reach agreement with the parties 
on revised terms, would require any acquirer to put in place 
replacement facilities.  
Essential Contracts
It is imperative that Dairy Crest is able to source high quality raw milk at 
the most competitive prices. To this end the Company has numerous 
contracts for its supply. While these contracts are collectively essential 
to the business, no single contract nor any single supplier of raw milk 
is critical to the Company’s business. 
The Company also has strong relationships with certain major 
retailers to supply them with liquid milk. Individually these contracts 
are important to the business but not essential.
Substantial shareholdings
The Company has been notified pursuant to DTR5 of the following 
interests in 3% or more of its issued share capital as at 15 May 2009:
 Notified 
 percentage
 issued share 
 capital (%)
Standard Life Investments Ltd 4.995

Directors
The names and biographical details of the current Directors of the 
Company are given on page 30. The names of those persons 
who were Directors during the year but have retired or resigned from 
the Board are set out at page 31 together with the dates on which 
they left the Board.
Further information about the Company’s rules on the appointment 
and replacement of its Directors is given in the Corporate governance 
statement on pages 32 to 33. 
In accordance with the articles of association, Mark Allen and Howard 
Mann retire by rotation. Both offer themselves for re-election at this 
year’s AGM. In addition, in compliance with the spirit of the Code, 
Simon Oliver will retire from the Board at the 2009 AGM and offers 
himself for re-election.
Directors’ interests
Details of the interests in the shares of the Company of the Directors 
holding office as at the date of this report along with those of the 
Directors who held office during the year but retired or resigned from 
office and their immediate families appear in the Remuneration report 
on pages 43 to 44.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment 
appear in the Remuneration report on page 42.
No Director had a material interest in any significant contract with the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries during the year.
Directors’ and officers indemnities and insurance
The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors and 
officers. At its AGM held on 14 July 2005 shareholder approval was 
given for the amendment of the Company’s articles of association 
giving Directors and officers the benefit of an indemnity to the extent 
permitted by law.
Environment, social and community issues
Information on Dairy Crest’s approach to the environmental, social and 
community issues can be found in the Corporate Responsibility Review 
on pages 22 to 25.

The Group employs approximately 7,800 people throughout the 
United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, France and Italy and depends 
on the skills and commitment of its employees in order to achieve its 
objectives. Personnel at every level are encouraged to make their fullest 
possible contribution to Dairy Crest’s success. 
Employees are kept regularly informed on matters affecting them 
and on issues affecting the Group’s performance through a variety of 
communication tools, including the Group intranet, which has been 
completely redesigned during the year ended 31 March 2009, and the 
in-house magazine, ‘People’.
In 2009, an employee and franchisee survey has again been conducted 
in order to research their views. Results are encouraging with the 
overall engagement score improving by 6%. Detailed results for each 
site are scheduled to be issued by June 2009. Thereafter further 
consultation is planned to develop action plans, addressing feedback 
from the survey which shows that further improvements are possible. 
The Group has well-established consultation and negotiating 
arrangements with established trade unions.
Employees are encouraged to acquire shares in the Group through 
participation in the savings-related share option scheme (‘Sharesave 
Scheme’). Details of this scheme are set out on page 40 of the 
Directors’ remuneration report.
The Board is committed to ensuring a culture free from discrimination 
and harassment remains embedded within the Group and 
discrimination of any sort is not tolerated. Proper consideration is 
given to applications for employment from disabled people who are 
employed whenever suitable vacancies arise. Wherever practicable, 
staff who become disabled during employment are retained. The Group 
practices equality of opportunity for all employees, irrespective of ethnic 
origin, religion, political opinion, gender, marital status, disability, age or 
sexual orientation.
Research and development
The Group has adopted a target of delivering part of its annual turnover 
through new product development and has implemented a new 
project management process aimed at achieving this. In line with the 
Company’s strategy to offer consumers a wide product mix, it has 
continued to develop during the year ended 31 March 2009 lower fat 
variants of its existing products. Through innovation, Dairy Crest has 
also remained at the forefront of dairy industry developments to reduce 
packaging waste.
Land and buildings
The Directors have obtained an informal valuation of the Group’s land 
and buildings and believe that the current market value in existing use 
of these properties slightly exceeds their book value.
Supplier payment policy
Payment dates are established according to the agreed date of 
delivery of goods or provision of services and the receipt of a correct 
invoice. The Group agrees the length of payment terms with each 
of its suppliers as part of the overall purchasing agreement. It is the 
Group’s policy to abide by these agreed terms of payment. The 
number of days’ purchases in the Group’s creditors at 31 March 
2009 was 24.8 days (2007/08: 23 days). The Company has no trade 
creditors and therefore the number of days purchases in creditors is 
not relevant.
Charitable and political donations
Charitable donations amounted to £0.1 million (2007/08: £0.1 million) 
in the year. Small contributions, mainly of product, were also made to 
local charities. No political donations or expenditures were made or 
incurred during the year.
Disclosure of information to the auditors
So far as each Director in office at the date of approval of this 
report is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware.
Each of the Directors has taken all steps that they ought to have 
taken in performing their roles as directors to exercise due care, skill 
and diligence in order to make themselves aware (i) of any relevant 
audit information and (ii) to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of such information.
For the purposes of this statement on disclosure of information to the 
auditors, ‘relevant audit information’ is the information needed by the 
Company’s auditors in connection with the preparation of their report 
at page 106.
Directors’ responsibility statements
The responsibility statements required under Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 4.1 are set out on page 50.
Annual general meeting
The AGM will be held at Eversheds, 1 Wood Street, London 
EC2V 7WS on Thursday 16 July 2008 at 11.00 am. Details of the 
resolutions to be proposed, including items of special business, are 
given in the Notice of Annual General Meeting and Explanatory Notes 
which has been dispatched. The notice of this year’s AGM has been 
posted on the Company’s website. The Directors believe that the 
resolutions set out in the notice of meeting are in the best interests of 
the Company and its shareholders and unanimously recommend that 
shareholders should vote in favour of all resolutions.
Auditors
The Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken 
as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of 
that information.
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue as 
auditors of the Company. A resolution to reappoint Ernst & Young 
LLP as the Company’s auditors will be put to the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.

 50 Statement of directors’ responsibilities
For the ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Financial Statements in accordance with applicable United 
Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
To the best of our knowledge:
•  The Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position 
and proﬁ t of the Company and undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
•  The management report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and position of 
the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties they face.
The Directors are required to prepare Financial Statements for 
each ﬁ nancial year which present fairly the ﬁ nancial position of the 
Company and of the Group, the ﬁ nancial performance of the Group 
and cash ﬂ ows of the Company and the Group for that period. In 
preparing those Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:
•  Select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8, 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors’ and then apply them consistently;
•  Present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
•  Provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁ c 
requirements in IFRS is insufﬁ cient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s ﬁ nancial position and performance; and
•  State that the Company has complied with IFRSs, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
Financial Statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and, 
therefore, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud or other irregularities.

interest in relation to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes. Previously, adjusted earnings per share calculations did not exclude pension interest, however this number is 
dependent upon the pension valuation at 31 March each year and assumptions based on ﬁ nancial market conditions on that date and therefore excluding it gives a better 
indication of the underlying operational performance of the Group. Comparative numbers have been restated accordingly (see Note 9).

Accounting policies 55
Basis of preparation
The consolidated and Company ﬁ nancial statements are presented 
in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million 
(£ million) except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements of Dairy Crest Group plc have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European 
Union (‘EU’). The Company ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. The 
Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under 
section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual 
income statement and related notes.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a signiﬁ cant risk 
of causing material adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are the measurement of 
the impairment of goodwill and measurement of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
assets and obligations. The Group determines whether goodwill 
is impaired on an annual basis and this requires an estimation of 
the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill is 
allocated. This requires estimation of future cash ﬂ ows and the 
selection of a suitable discount rate. Measurement of deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t obligations requires estimation of future changes in salaries 
and inﬂ ation, mortality rates, the expected return on plan assets 
and the choice of a suitable discount rate. Further analysis of the key 
sources of estimation uncertainty and sensitivities are included in the 
relevant notes to the accounts.
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards (with an 
effective date after the date of these accounts) and interpretations:
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS)
IFRS 1 & IAS 27 (amendment): Cost of an Investment in a 
Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate (effective from 
1 January 2009) 
IFRS 8: Operating Segments (effective from 1 January 2009)
IAS 23 (amendment): Borrowing Costs (effective from 
1 January 2009) 
IAS 1 (amendment): Presentation of Financial Statements 
(effective from 1 January 2009) 
IFRS 2 (amendment): Share-based Payments – Vesting conditions 
and Cancellations (effective from 1 January 2009) 
IFRS 3 (amendment): Business Combinations (effective from 
1 July 2009)
IAS 27 (amendment): Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements (effective from 1 July 2009)
IFRS 7 (amendment): Financial instruments: Disclosures 
(effective from 1 January 2009) 
IAS 32 & IAS 1 (amendment): Puttable Financial Instruments and 
Obligations Arising from Liquidation (effective from 1 January 2009) 
IAS 39 (amendment): Eligible Hedged Items (effective from 
1 January 2009)
International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC)
IFRIC 15: Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate (effective 
from 1 January 2009). Currently not applicable to the Group
IFRIC 16: Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 
(effective from 1 October 2008). Applicable to the Group but 
no impact
IFRIC 17: Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners (effective 
from 1 July 2009). Currently not applicable to the Group
IFRIC 18: Transfers of Assets from Customers (effective from 1 July 
2009). Currently not applicable to the Group.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8 the number of segments reported by the 
Group will increase from 2 to 3 as disclosures will more closely follow 
the ‘management approach’. The reportable segments will be 
Dairies, Cheese and Spreads. Upon the amendment to IAS 23 the 
Group will capitalise all borrowing costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset. Upon 
the amendment to IFRS 2 the Group will accelerate the share based 
payment charge resulting from participants leaving the sharesave 
scheme (treating their leaving as a cancellation rather than a 
forfeiture). The fair value factor used at grant will be amended to 
reﬂ ect likely future exits. Upon the amendment to IFRS 3 the Group 
will charge fees relating to a business acquisition to proﬁ t and loss 
and not to goodwill, furthermore, any contingent consideration will 
be measured at fair value with changes being credited/charged to 
proﬁ t and loss.
Apart from these, the directors do not anticipate the adoption of 
these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on 
the Group’s accounts in the period of initial application.
Consolidation
The Group ﬁ nancial statements consolidate the accounts of Dairy 
Crest Group plc and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 March each year 
using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances and 
transactions, including unrealised proﬁ ts and losses arising from 
intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. 
Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated from the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. At 31 March 2009, 
minority interests represent the 20% interest in Wexford Creamery 
Limited not held by the Group.
Interest in joint ventures
The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for under 
the equity method of accounting. Joint ventures are entities over 
which the Group has joint control under contractual agreement and 
which are not subsidiaries. The company and joint ventures both use 
consistent accounting policies. The investment in joint ventures is 
carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint ventures, less any 
impairment in value and any distributions received. The income 
statement reﬂ ects the share of the results of the joint ventures. 
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the joint 
ventures’ equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes 
and discloses this, when applicable in the consolidated statement 
of recognised income and expense.

Foreign currency translation 
The functional and presentational currency of Dairy Crest Group plc 
and its United Kingdom (‘UK’) subsidiaries is Pound Sterling (£). 
The functional currency of Wexford Creamery Limited and St Hubert 
SAS, subsidiary companies incorporated in Ireland and France 
respectively, is the Euro. 
Transactions in foreign currency are initially recorded in the functional 
currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into 
Sterling at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences on 
monetary items are taken to the income statement, except where 
deferred in equity as qualifying cash ﬂ ow hedges and qualifying net 
investment hedges. 
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are 
translated into Sterling at year end exchange rates. The results of 
foreign subsidiaries are translated into Sterling at average rates of 
exchange for the year (being an approximation of actual exchange 
rates). Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net 
investment in foreign subsidiaries at year end exchange rates, less 
exchange differences on borrowings, which ﬁ nance or provide a 
hedge against those undertakings are taken to a separate component 
of equity as long as IFRS hedge accounting conditions are met. 
Exchange differences relating to foreign currency borrowings that 
provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity remain in 
equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. Tax charges and 
credits attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are 
also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and any impairment losses.  Cost comprises the 
purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the 
asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of 
operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation is 
calculated to write off the cost (less residual value) of property, plant 
and equipment, excluding freehold land, on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
Freehold buildings: 25 years
Leasehold land and buildings:  25 years or, if shorter, 
the period of the lease
Ofﬁ ce equipment: 4 to 6 years
Factory plant and equipment: 6 to 20 years
Vehicles: 4 to 10 years
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value exceeds 
the estimated recoverable value, the asset is written down to its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of plant and equipment 
is the greater of the fair value less costs to sell or value in use. In 
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
speciﬁ c to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash ﬂ ows, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Impairment 
losses are charged to the consolidated income statement.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal or when no future economic beneﬁ ts are expected to arise 
from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on 
derecognition of the asset is included in the consolidated income 
statement in the year that it is derecognised. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred in 
accordance with IAS 23: Borrowing Costs.
Investments
The Company recognises its investments in subsidiaries at cost 
being the fair value of consideration paid. Income is recognised 
from these investments only in relation to distributions received 
from post-acquisition proﬁ ts. Distributions received in excess of 
post-acquisition proﬁ ts are deducted from the cost of investment.
Goodwill
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of transition 
to IFRS is stated at the net book value as at this date and is not 
subsequently amortised. Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured 
at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s (acquirer’s) interest in the net fair value of the 
identiﬁ able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Following initial 
recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated 
impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, 
or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may be impaired. All goodwill was tested 
for impairment at the time of transition to IFRS and no impairment 
was identiﬁ ed.
As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the 
cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units expected to 
beneﬁ t from the combination’s synergies. Impairment is determined 
by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to 
which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment 
loss is recognised. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating 
unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the 
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in 
the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain 
or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this 
circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of 
the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating 
unit retained.
The Group’s cash-generating units, for the purpose of considering 
goodwill, are ‘Dairies’, ‘UK Spreads’, ‘St Hubert’, ‘Speciality Cheese’ 
and ‘Cheese excluding Speciality Cheese’. These represent the 
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for management purposes 
and are no larger than the segments being ‘Dairies’ and ‘Foods’.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 1998 has been 
charged against the merger reserve and will remain set off against 
reserves even if the related investment becomes impaired or the 
business sold.

 The numbers
The Group has not restated business combinations prior to the 
transition date of 1 April 2004. Acquisitions prior to this date are 
recorded under previous accounting rules.  IFRS 1 requires that an 
impairment review of goodwill should be conducted in accordance 
with IAS 36 at the date of transition and at the balance sheet date. 
This review was performed and no adjustment was required.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are 
capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill if the fair value can 
be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future expected 
economic beneﬁ ts ﬂ ow to the Group. Following initial recognition, the 
carrying amount of an intangible asset is its cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The useful 
lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either ﬁ nite or indeﬁ nite. 
Currently, all the Group’s intangible assets have ﬁ nite useful lives and 
are amortised over 3 to 25 years. The signiﬁ cant acquired brands 
have useful lives as follows:
St Hubert 25 years
Le Fleurier 15 years
Valle 15 years
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, 
where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. 
Intangible assets acquired separately from business combinations 
include software development expenditure. Software is carried at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. Software is amortised over ﬁ ve 
years. Intangible assets that are not yet available for use are tested 
for impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is written off as incurred. Development 
expenditure is also written off as incurred unless the future recoverability 
of this expenditure can reasonably be assured as required by IAS 38: 
Intangible Assets.
Recoverable amount of non-current assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable 
amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written 
down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the 
higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂ ows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes the purchase price of raw materials (on a ﬁ rst in 
ﬁ rst out basis), direct labour and a proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal operating capacity incurred in bringing 
each product to its present location and condition. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business 
less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
 57
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at original 
invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An 
estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount 
is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identiﬁ ed.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and 
short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. 
For the purposes of the Consolidated cash ﬂ ow statement, cash and 
cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as deﬁ ned 
above, net of bank overdrafts.
Interest bearing loans
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of 
the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the 
borrowing. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking 
into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on 
settlement. Gains and losses are recognised in net proﬁ t or loss 
when the liabilities are derecognised.
Net debt
The Group and Company deﬁ ne net debt as cash and cash 
equivalents, interest bearing loans and ﬁ nance leases. The 
calculation of net debt excludes the fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments with the exception of cross currency swaps to ﬁ x foreign 
currency debt in Sterling where they are designated as cash ﬂ ow 
hedges. In this case the ﬁ xed Sterling debt, not the underlying 
foreign currency debt retranslated, is included in net debt.
Classiﬁ cation of shares as debt or equity
When shares are issued, any component that creates a ﬁ nancial 
liability of the Group is presented as a liability in the balance sheet; 
measured initially at fair value net of transaction costs and thereafter 
at amortised cost until extinguished on conversion or redemption. 
The corresponding dividends relating to the liability component are 
charged as interest expense in the income statement. The initial fair 
value of the liability component is determined using a market rate 
for an equivalent liability without a conversion feature. The remainder 
of the proceeds on issue is allocated to the equity component 
and included in shareholders’ equity, net of transaction costs. 
The carrying amount of the equity component is not re-measured 
in subsequent years.
Transaction costs are apportioned between the liability and equity 
components of the shares based on the allocation of proceeds 
to the liability and equity components when the instruments are 
ﬁ rst recognised.
Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The asset or liability in respect of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes is the 
present value of the relevant deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation at the balance 
sheet date less the fair value of plan assets and an adjustment for 
past service costs not yet recognised. The independent actuary 
completes a full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension 
fund and the Wexford Creamery plan triennially. The obligation is 
updated annually for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes by the actuary 
using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the 
0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1057 57 0982 Dairy Crest Accounts p52-1057   57 2/6/09 17:00:48 2/6/09   17:00:48 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2009
obligation is determined by the estimated future cash outﬂ ows using 
interest rates of high quality corporate bonds which have terms to 
maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.  
The current service costs are recognised in operating costs in the 
consolidated income statement.  Past service costs are included in 
operating costs where the beneﬁ ts have vested, otherwise they are 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The 
expected return on assets of funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes and 
the interest on pension scheme liabilities comprise the ﬁ nance 
element of the pension cost and the difference between these 
amounts are included in other ﬁ nance income or costs. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes 
in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full and are charged or 
credited to the consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expense in the period in which they arise.
IFRIC 14 has been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2008. 
The recognition of any retirement beneﬁ t surplus as calculated by the 
actuary as part of the annual update for reporting purposes, is limited 
to the present value, using an appropriate discount rate, of any real 
cash beneﬁ t the Company will obtain in the future through either 
reduced potential contributions or cash on a winding up of 
the scheme. In order to calculate the potential future beneﬁ ts 
consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements agreed 
between the Company and the Pension Trustee.
Share based payments
Equity based performance payments
The Group and Company has issued equity-settled share based 
payment schemes for which they receive services from employees 
in consideration for the equity instrument. Equity-settled share based 
payment schemes are measured at fair value at the grant date by an 
external valuer using a Monte Carlo option-pricing model. The costs 
of equity settled transactions are recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised for 
equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting reﬂ ects 
the expired vesting period and the number of awards that, in the 
opinion of the directors, will eventually vest (after adjusting for the 
expected achievement of non-market performance conditions). 
The amount charged to the consolidated income statement is 
credited to reserves.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional on market conditions, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market 
conditions are satisﬁ ed.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the 
Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the fair value at the grant date 
(Sharesave Scheme). The Group records an expense, based on the 
estimate of the 20% discount related to the shares expected to vest 
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period using a Black-Scholes 
option pricing model.
The Company adopted IFRIC 11 in the year ended 31 March 2008. 
Rights granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings over equity 
instruments of the Company are treated as an investment in the 
Company’s balance sheet.
 58 Accounting policies continued
Employees’ Share Ownership Plan (‘ESOP’)
The shares in the Company held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ 
Share Ownership Plan Trust to satisfy Long Term Incentive Share 
Plan awards are presented as a deduction from equity in arriving 
at shareholders’ equity. Consideration received from the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity with no gain or loss recognised 
in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group and Company have not adopted the exemption to 
apply IFRS 2 Share-based payments only to awards made after 
7 November 2002.  
Leased assets
Assets acquired under ﬁ nance leases, which transfer to the Group 
substantially all the risks and beneﬁ ts incidental to ownership of the 
leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value 
of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. The net present value of future lease rentals is 
included as a liability on the balance sheet. The interest element of 
lease rentals is charged to the Consolidated income statement in the 
year. Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
beneﬁ ts of ownership of the asset are classiﬁ ed as operating leases. 
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Revenue
Revenue on sale of food and dairy products is recognised on 
delivery. Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods 
net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the Group. 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive 
payment is established.
Other income
Other income comprises the proﬁ t on disposal of closed sites and 
household depots. 
Exceptional items
Certain items are recorded separately in the consolidated income 
statement as exceptional. Only items of a material, one-off nature, 
which result from a restructuring of the business or some other event 
or circumstance are disclosed in this manner in order to give a better 
understanding of the underlying operational performance of the 
Group. The proﬁ ts arising on disposal of closed sites, other than 
as a result of depot rationalisation, are reported within exceptional 
items. Exceptional items are not excluded from the basic earnings 
per share calculation.
Government and other grants
Government grants are initially recognised at their fair value where 
there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all 
attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates 
to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods 
necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs 
that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an 
asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is 
released to the consolidated income statement over the expected 
useful life of the relevant asset in equal annual instalments.

 The numbers
Income tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount 
expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, 
based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the 
balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts for ﬁ nancial reporting purposes, except 
as indicated below.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences except:
•  where the deferred income tax liability arises from initial 
recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
proﬁ t nor taxable proﬁ t or loss; and
•  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary 
differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and 
unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ t 
will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, 
the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can 
be utilised except:
•  where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting proﬁ t 
nor taxable proﬁ t or loss; and 
•  in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint 
ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in 
the foreseeable future and taxable proﬁ t will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed 
at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that sufﬁ cient taxable proﬁ t will be available to allow 
all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Income 
tax relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in 
equity and not in the income statement.
Financial assets
The Group and Company classiﬁ es ﬁ nancial assets that are within 
the scope of IAS 39 as ﬁ nancial assets at fair value through proﬁ t 
and loss; loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; or as 
available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets, as appropriate. The Group and 
Company determines the classiﬁ cation of ﬁ nancial assets at initial 
recognition and re-evaluates this designation at each ﬁ nancial year-
end. When ﬁ nancial assets are recognised initially, they are measured 
at fair value.
Derivative instruments
The Group and Company use derivative ﬁ nancial instruments such 
as forward currency contracts, cross-currency swaps and interest 
rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign 
currency ﬂ uctuations. Such derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently re-measured to fair value 
at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity proﬁ les. The fair value of interest rate swap and 
cross-currency swap contracts is determined by reference to 
market values for similar instruments and speciﬁ c valuations 
performed by counterparties at the period end. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁ ed 
as either: 
•  fair value hedges where they hedge the exposure to changes 
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability;
•  cash ﬂ ow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in 
cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated 
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast 
transaction, or a ﬁ rm commitment in relation to foreign exchange 
exposure; or
•  net investment hedges where they hedge the exposure to 
variability in the translated net assets of an overseas operation.
Neither the Group nor the Company has entered into any fair value 
hedges during the year.
Cash ﬂ ow hedges
In relation to cash ﬂ ow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge 
accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in 
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated 
income statement. 
When the hedged ﬁ rm commitment (in relation to foreign exchange 
exposure) or the highly probable forecast transactions results in the 
recognition of a non-monetary asset or a liability, then, at the time 
the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that 
had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial 
measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the 
asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses 
that are recognised in equity are transferred to the Consolidated 
income statement in the same year in which the hedged item affects 
the net proﬁ t and loss, for example when the future sale actually 
occurs, interest payments are made or when debt matures. For 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or 
losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the 
Consolidated income statement for the year.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Where the Group hedges net investments in overseas entities 
through currency borrowings, the gains and losses on retranslation 
of those borrowings are recognised in equity. If the Group uses 
derivatives as the hedging instrument, the effective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion being 
recognised in the Consolidated income statement whenever 
applicable. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are recycled 
through the consolidated income statement on disposal of the 
foreign entity.
In order to satisfy hedge accounting, the Group (or Company) 
documents in advance the relationship between the item being 
hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group (or Company) also 
documents and demonstrates an assessment of the relationship 
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which 
shows that the hedge has been and will be highly effective on an 
ongoing basis. The effectiveness testing is re-performed on a regular 
basis (being at least half-yearly) to ensure that the hedge remains 
highly effective.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualiﬁ es for 
hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until 
the highly probable forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain 
or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement 
for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other ﬁ nancial instruments or other host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts, 
and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised 
gains or losses reported in the income statement. When the contracts 
are closely related and hedge accounting is adopted, they are 
designated at inception and treated as described above.

1 Segmental information
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the Group’s risks and rates of return are affected 
predominantly by differences in the products produced. The Group is segmented into two divisions, Foods and Dairies, according to the 
nature of the products sold and markets serviced. The Foods segment comprises predominantly branded cheese and spreads sold via the 
multiples. It includes both the UK Spreads business and the St Hubert business acquired in January 2007 since both supply similar product 
to similar markets using the same production and distribution methods. The Dairies segment comprises predominantly liquid milk sales via 
the multiples, middle ground or doorstep. The Household business is included within the Dairies segment as its operations are mutually 
interdependent with the liquid milk business. All revenue is derived from the sale of goods. Inter-segment sales of cream from Dairies to Foods 
amounted to £41.0 million in the year ended 31 March 2009 (2008: £42.6 million). Transfer prices are based on delivered cost to the Group.
The Group’s geographical segments are based on the location of the Group’s assets. The Group has two geographical segments being 
‘UK and Ireland’ and ‘Rest of world’. The Wexford business, based in Ireland, generates the majority of its revenue from sales into the UK and 
operates under similar economic and political conditions to the UK. As a result, the UK and Ireland businesses have been combined into one 
geographical segment. Sales to ‘Rest of world’ disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of customers. 
The Rest of world category comprises the St Hubert business and ingredients and ﬁ nished goods exports from the UK.

The Group continues to rationalise its household operations as a result of the ongoing decline in doorstep volumes. This rationalisation 
includes the closure of certain depots (the proﬁ t on which is shown above), acquisition of small inﬁ ll dairy businesses and rationalisation of the 
ongoing household operations. These activities represent a fundamental part of the ongoing ordinary activities of the household operations.

2009
Exceptional items in 2008/09 comprise:
Dairies
–  Restructuring costs in relation to a wide-ranging efﬁ ciency improvement project within Dairies manufacturing and distribution (£9.2 million). 
These costs comprise the closure of the Nottingham dairy processing plant and associated distribution network restructuring costs. 
Cash costs comprise £5.1 million and relate principally to redundancy and related expenditure. Furthermore there was a non-cash asset 
impairment of £1.7 million for plant and equipment and £0.4 million for intangible assets.
In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group closed its dairy at Totnes. This resulted in exceptional costs of £4.8 million including 
impairment of property, plant and equipment. Since that time the land and buildings at Totnes have been held at fair value less costs to 
sell. In the year ended 31 March 2009, there have been signiﬁ cant delays in the planning process for the sale of this land at Totnes and 
any sale is now likely to take several years. Additionally, during this time the property market has weakened substantially. These factors 
have led to a further impairment of £1.5 million against the carrying value of Totnes assets to a level that reﬂ ects management’s best 
estimate of the revised fair value less costs to sell and a further £0.5 million cash costs relating to the site that will now not be recovered 
through disposal proceeds.
–  In the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group provided £4.4 million for an onerous long-term milk supply contract. The contract had 
become onerous as a result of unprecedented increases in milk prices during 2007/08. A combination of higher milk costs in the ﬁ rst 
half of 2008/09 and a negotiation with the customer that was longer than expected have resulted in a further charge of £1.0 million being 
required in the year ended 31 March 2009. This comprises £0.9 million for onerous cash outﬂ ows to the expected renegotiation date 
(of which £0.4 million was utilised in the year ended 31 March 2009) and a further £0.1 million for impairment of plant and equipment that 
is expected to form part of the negotiated settlement with the customer (this is a non-cash charge). From the ﬁ rst half of 2009/10, this 
contract is no longer expected to be onerous to the Group. See Note 24.
Foods
–  In October 2006 the Group sold its retailer brand cheese business to First Milk Limited. This included the cheese cutting and packing 
facility at Maelor. First Milk Limited have continued to cut and pack cheese since that time under a three year transitional service 
agreement. Signiﬁ cant capital investment was undertaken during 2008 to build a modern, efﬁ cient cheese cutting and packing facility at 
our national distribution centre at Nuneaton. In the period from January 2009 to July 2009 volumes are being transferred from Maelor to 
Nuneaton as the latter gradually increases processing volumes. During this ramp up phase, there are duplicate running costs resulting 
from cutting and packing at two separate sites and inefﬁ ciencies at Nuneaton due to low initial volumes. 
These duplicate running costs amounted to £3.7 million in the year to 31 March 2009, of which £3.6 million were cash. A further
£1.0 million is expected to be incurred in the ﬁ rst half of 2009/10.
–  On 23 August 2008, the Group disposed of the property, plant and equipment and the inventories of its Stilton and speciality cheese 
business based in Hartington, Derbyshire to Long Clawson Dairy Limited. The results of this business have not been classiﬁ ed as 
discontinued operations since it is not considered a major line of business in the context of Group revenue and proﬁ t.

Associated pension curtailment gain      0.5 
Exceptional charge (before tax)      (4.5)
–  An impairment of £5.6 million has been charged against the carrying value of plant and equipment at our cheese manufacturing plant 
in Wexford, Ireland. The proﬁ tability and cash generation of this business was adversely impacted in the year ended 31 March 2009 as 
realisations for commodity cheese declined. Following a review for possible impairment, these assets have been written down to their 
fair value less costs to sell based on managements’ best view as to their current market value.
–  On 26 March 2009, the Group sold its 49% share in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited (‘YDC’) to Yoplait SAS, the majority owner, for cash 
consideration of £63.5 million. The YDC joint venture had been accounted for using the equity method up to the date of its disposal. 
The results of this business have not been classiﬁ ed as discontinued operations since it was not considered a major line of business 
or geographical area of operations. The proﬁ t on disposal amounted to £50.4 million and can be analysed as follows:
£m
Sales proceeds – cash consideration      63.5 
Group share of YDC net assets at date of disposal       (8.6)
Provision for cost of insuring YDC deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme liabilities (see Note 24)   (3.5)
Other fees and costs      (1.0)
Gain on disposal       50.4 
Tax
–  The cessation of IBAs was enacted during the year ended 31 March 2009. Under IFRS the Group has charged an increased deferred 
tax provision in respect of IBAs as the tax written down value has decreased signiﬁ cantly. This provision has been charged as exceptional 
due to its one-off nature and material size. The provision will unwind in future periods offsetting the cash impact of the cessation of IBAs 
on the Group’s effective tax rate.
2008
Exceptional items in 2007/08 comprised:
–  £4.8 million charge in relation to the closure of a dairy at Totnes. This charge included cash costs of £3.1 million principally in respect 
of redundancies (£2.0 million) and a non-cash asset impairment of £1.7 million for plant and equipment.
–  £8.6 million cash charge of restructuring expenditure with respect to the rationalisation of the Express Dairies depot operations and 
the Liverpool and Nottingham dairies of Arla Foods UK Limited, which were acquired on 19 August 2006. These restructuring costs
comprised £3.1 million of redundancy costs, £3.5 million of duplicate running costs and £2.0 million of other rationalisation costs.
–  £10.0 million charge for penalties and associated legal fees in relation to settlement of the OFT investigation into ‘milk price initiatives’. 
On 20 September 2007 the Ofﬁ ce of Fair Trading (‘OFT’) issued a detailed Statement of Objections to certain retailers and dairy 
processors in its investigation into pricing in the dairy produce sector. On 7 December the Group announced that it had reached an early 
resolution agreement with the OFT concerning this investigation. Under this agreement the Group expects to pay a signiﬁ cantly reduced 
ﬁ ne of £9.4 million. In addition, legal fees of £0.6 million have been charged in relation to the investigation. 
The exceptional cost has been allocated £3.6 million Foods and £6.4 million Dairies. Cash costs incurred in the year ended 31 March 
2008 amounted to £0.4 million of legal fees.
–  £4.4 million provision for an onerous long-term milk supply contract. This contract became onerous during the year ended 31 March 
2008 as a result of unprecedented increases in milk costs combined with weaker cream prices in the second half. The provision 
comprised the present value of estimated cash outﬂ ows under this contract through to its term as estimated in March 2008. Cash
utilisation of this provision in the year to 31 March 2008 was £1.5 million. See Note 24.
–  £6.7 million proﬁ t on a site in west London originally sold in October 2002. The site was sold with a potential future overage receipt 
from the purchasers should certain planning permissions be obtained. A cash amount of £6.7 million was received in the period in 
full and ﬁ nal settlement of this overage clause.
–  £1.2 million ﬁ nal tax adjustment on the disposal of the majority of our retailer branded cheese business to First Milk in October 2006.

The Group has trading tax losses which arose in the UK of £9.6 million (2008: £9.6 million) that are available indeﬁ nitely for offset against future 
taxable proﬁ ts of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they 
may not be used to offset taxable proﬁ ts other than in the trades in which they arose and the future proﬁ tability of these trades is uncertain.
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £71.3 million (2008: £70.6 million) that are available indeﬁ nitely for offset against future 
taxable gains. Deferred tax has not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is no foreseeable prospect of their being utilised. The 
Group has realised capital gains amounting to £36.9 million (2008: £36.1 million) for which rollover relief claims have or are intended to be made. 
At 31 March 2009, there was no recognised deferred tax liability (2008: nil) for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the 
Group’s subsidiaries in Ireland as the Group has determined that retained proﬁ ts will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The deferred 
tax liability arising from the investments in these subsidiaries, which has not been recognised, is £2.8 million (2008: £2.8 million).

In the year ended 31 March 2008 there was a £1.2 million tax adjustment in relation to the disposal of the retailer branded cheese business 
to First Milk Limited in October 2006. This has been classiﬁ ed as exceptional and discontinued consistent with the classiﬁ cation of the 
disposal to which it relates.
9 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) on proﬁ t for the year is calculated by dividing proﬁ t attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Basic EPS on continuing operations is calculated on the basis of Group proﬁ t for the year from continuing operations less proﬁ t attributable 
to minority interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the proﬁ t attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be 
issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees’ Share Ownership Plan Trust (‘ESOP’) are excluded from the weighted average number of 
shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings per share.

2009
Following the decision to close the Nottingham dairy and restructure the Dairies distribution network, certain assets which were unable to be 
used in the wider business were written down to their fair value less costs to sell. This resulted in an impairment of £1.7 million to property, 
plant and equipment.
Following the closure of the Totnes dairy in the year ended 31 March 2008, planning delays and a weakening UK property market have 
resulted in a reduced fair value less costs to sell at 31 March 2009 compared to March 2008. This resulted in a further impairment of 
£1.5 million to property, plant and equipment.

Impairment testing of goodwill
Acquired goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to ﬁ ve groups of cash generating units (‘CGUs’): Dairies, UK Spreads, 
St Hubert, Cheese and Speciality Cheese. The Speciality Cheese CGU was disposed of in August 2008 (see Note 30). All CGUs are tested 
for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is determined 
based on a value-in-use calculation using cash ﬂ ow projections based on ﬁ nancial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior 
management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that. The discount rate applied to the projections is 9.5% 
for UK Spreads and Cheese (2008: 8.4%),  9.9% for St Hubert (2008: 9.1%) and 9.8% for Dairies (2008: 8.4%). 
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on 
the capital asset pricing model. Discount rates have increased compared to March 2008 as a result of the global ﬁ nancial market uncertainty 
and resultant increase in the equity risk premium.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ﬂ ows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese is 2.0% pa (being the 
estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks) (2008: 2.0%). The growth rate 
used to extrapolate cash ﬂ ows beyond the three-year period for the Dairies CGU is 0% (2008: 0%). Management considers this a cautious 
assumption in the light of current opportunities in the enlarged Household business and ongoing improvements in the Dairy manufacturing 
and distribution networks but recognise the historical doorstep decline rates experienced in the doorstep milk business.

12 Goodwill (continued)
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2009 is:
Dairies £68.9 million (2008: £68.6 million)
UK Spreads £65.5 million  (2008: £65.5 million)
St Hubert £206.2 million (2008: £177.6 million)
Cheese  £2.1 million (2008: £2.1 million)
The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations:
Gross margin – budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected 
input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efﬁ ciency improvements. The budgeted margins form the 
basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends. 
Discount rates – reﬂ ect management’s estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for each CGU.
Raw materials prices – budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available. The key  resources are milk, 
vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates – for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research 
adjusted downwards to reﬂ ect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame. For the Household business within Dairies, 
long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU and to be realistically achievable 
in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts. In addition, the value in use calculation for the Group (comprising each CGUs 
value in use) is compared to the Group market capitalisation at the date of impairment testing and 31 March each year.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions – With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of the Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese CGUs, 
management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed 
its recoverable amount with the exception, in the cases of St Hubert and Cheese, of the discount rate used in the value in use calculation 
which is outside management’s control. Should the discount rate used for calculating the St Hubert value in use rise to 11.2% and the 
discount rate used for calculating the Cheese value in use rise to 12.3% due to external ﬁ nancial market uncertainties then the carrying value 
would exceed that unit’s recoverable amount. The impairment headroom for the St Hubert and Cheese CGUs is €47 million and £63.1 million 
respectively.
For the Dairies CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its 
recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are 
cautious. The key assumption is future growth rates. Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation. 
Should any decline in the Dairies CGU be greater than 3% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for  this CGU could be reduced 
to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount. The impairment headroom for the Dairies CGU is £74.6 million.

and not as a prior year adjustment as the amount is immaterial in the context of the overall carrying value of property, plant, equipment 
and intangible assets.
2008
–  On 17 February 2008 the Group acquired certain assets from the East of England Co-operative Society. This included two customer
contracts that have been recognised as intangible assets (£2.0 million). These contracts will be amortised over four years.
–  During 2008 certain adjustments were made to the fair value of intangible assets acquired with St Hubert SAS in January 2007.
 These total £0.6 million and are analysed in Note 30.

15 Investment in joint ventures using equity method
The principal investment in joint ventures was represented by a 49% interest in Yoplait Dairy Crest Limited which was involved in 
the marketing and distribution of chilled yogurts and desserts in the United Kingdom. This investment was sold on 26 March 2009
(see Note 4). At 31 March 2009, the only investment in a joint venture was the 50% interest in Fayreﬁ eld-Foodtec Limited, a company 
manufacturing specialist dairy ingredients and powders. The share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of joint ventures at 
31 March and for the years then ended, which are equity accounted for in the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements, are as follows:

On 6 December 2007, the Group acquired a 50% interest in the ordinary share capital of Fayreﬁ eld-Foodtec Limited for a consideration of 
£2.1 million. On completion, both put and call options were put in place for the remaining 50% of Fayreﬁ eld-Foodtec Limited which are 
exercisable from 6 June 2009 to 6 July 2009, by the other joint venture party or the Group respectively. Exercise of these options will result in 
the Group acquiring the remaining 50% based on a multiple of earnings subject to a ﬂ oor and cap. The combination of call and put options 
makes acquisition of the remaining 50% by the Group highly probable, however until exercise of the options the Group does not exercise 
control. Therefore the investment in Fayreﬁ eld-Foodtec Limited is accounted for using the equity method. The option to acquire the remaining 
50% of Fayreﬁ eld-Foodtec Limited had an initial fair value of nil and had an immaterial fair value at 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2008.

On 23 October 2007 the Group sold its 50% investment in Cotteswold Dairy Limited for cash consideration of £3.0 million. 
Until 30 September 2007 this investment had been disclosed as an investment in joint venture using the equity method. 
At this date the carrying value was impaired by £0.6 million to £3.0 million (see Note 3).

21 Retirement beneﬁ t obligations
The Group has two deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension plans, Dairy Crest in the UK and Wexford in Ireland, both of which require contributions to be 
made to separately administered funds. The Dairy Crest Group pension fund is a ﬁ nal salary scheme that was closed to new employees 
joining after 30 June 2006. Employees joining after this date are invited to join a Dairy Crest Group deﬁ ned contribution plan. The most recent 
full actuarial valuation of the Dairy Crest Group pension fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007 by the fund’s independent actuary using 
the projected unit credit method. Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially.
The following tables summarise the components of net beneﬁ t expense recognised in the consolidated income statement and the funded 
status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet for the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans. These plans are wholly funded.

In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract. This contract is 
included within scheme assets and its value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered. 
This will reduce the volatility of the reported deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations in future periods.
At 31 March 2008, recognition of the net deﬁ ned beneﬁ t surplus was not restricted by the implementation of IFRIC 14 (see Accounting 
Policies note).

21 Retirement beneﬁ t obligations (continued)
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates with the exception of the insured retirement obligations 
which equal the valuation of obligations which it covers. The expected rate of return on equities of 8.25% (2008: 8%) reﬂ ects historic UK 
equity returns with an assumption for 2009 that unprecedented equity market falls in 2008/09 will give rise to marginally higher market returns 
in the medium term. They represent a reasonable risk premium over gilts. It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies 
of a similar size. The expected rate of return on bonds of 7.1% (2008: 6.1%) is based upon the gross redemption yield available on a similar 
proﬁ le of gilts and corporate bonds.
The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years. Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon 
quoted AA-rated corporate bond indexes, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the schemes expected beneﬁ t payments. 
Inﬂ ation assumptions are based upon the difference between long-term ﬁ xed income and index linked gilt yields. The scheme deﬁ cit is highly 
dependent upon these input assumptions which are struck at 31 March each year. A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would 
increase the scheme obligation by approximately £12 million.
Included in the above analysis is the Wexford Creamery pension fund. The net beneﬁ t expense in the year ended 31 March 2009 amounted 
to £0.5 million (2008: £0.4 million). The fair value of plan assets at 31 March 2009 was £7.8 million (2008: £8.6 million) and the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
obligation was £11.1 million (2008: £10.6 million) resulting in a scheme deﬁ cit of £3.3 million (2008: £2.0 million).

The agreed cash funding requirement resulting from the last full actuarial review is for the Group to make cash contributions of 18.3% of 
pensionable pay amounting to approximately £16.5 million in 2009/10. Additionally, in the years ended 31 March 2009 and 2008 the Group 
paid an additional £12 million per annum as additional cash contributions.

£(39.7) million (2008: £78.4 million) and in the Company statement of recognised income and expense is nil (2008: nil). The directors are 
unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deﬁ cit recognised on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of £93.2 million, 
is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes. Consequently, the directors are unable to determine 
the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 
1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognised income 
and expense in relation to the Group pension plans. The legal sponsor of the Dairy Crest Group pension plan is Dairy Crest Limited.
The  Group has charged £1.3 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group deﬁ ned contribution scheme in the year ended 31 March 2009 
(2008: £0.7 million). The Company has charged £0.1 million in respect of the Dairy Crest Group deﬁ ned contribution scheme in the year

Ofﬁ ce of Fair Trading (‘OFT’)
An exceptional provision has been charged in relation to the settlement of the OFT investigation into milk price initiatives (including legal 
costs). The amount of the ﬁ ne provided is £9.4 million and reﬂ ects the early resolution agreement that was reached with the OFT in 
December 2007. This ﬁ ne represents a signiﬁ cant reduction to the amount that could have been imposed by the OFT and is dependent upon 
the Group’s continued full co-operation with the OFT until the conclusion of its investigation. The possibility of the imposition of a higher ﬁ ne 
by the OFT is considered remote given the Group’s continuing co-operation in this matter. Settlement is expected to be reached in the year 
ending 31 March 2010 and the related provision has been classiﬁ ed as current.
Onerous contract
The Group has one milk supply contract with a middle ground customer which, due to unprecedented increases in milk costs in 2007/08 and 
a subsequent weakening of cream prices, become onerous. An exceptional provision of £4.4 million was charged in the year ended 31 March 
2008, being the best estimate at the time of the present value of future cash outﬂ ows resulting from the contractual obligations in the contract 
(see Note 4). In that year, £1.5 million was charged against this provision. In the year ended 31 March 2009, there were further milk cost 
increases and contract negotiations took longer than anticipated. This onerous contract is now expected to be renegotiated in the ﬁ rst half 
of 2009/10 and a further provision of £0.9 million has been charged for expected cash outﬂ ows under this contract until its expected 
renegotiation date. In calculating the amount of cash outﬂ ows to the end of this contract, estimates have been made regarding future pricing 
and volumes.

YDC pension liabilities
As part of the disposal of YDC, future service accruals immediately ceased in the YDC deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme and the Group contracted to 
extinguish any remaining funding liability by purchasing an insurance buy-out. On completion of the disposal, £3.5 million was charged as a 
provision for the cost of the insurance and funds were deposited in escrow for the beneﬁ t of the YDC scheme trustee. This amount was the 
best estimate at the date of disposal of the cost of buying out the scheme liabilities. This has been accounted for as a provision under IAS 37 
and not under IAS 19 as there ceased to be a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme on completion of the disposal.
Inevitably, the ﬁ nal cost of insurance is dependent upon bond yields and other factors. Management’s best view, based on current 
ﬁ nancial market conditions,  is that the ﬁ nal cost could be below £3.5 million and that the Group might recover some of the funds placed 
into escrow. This contingent asset has not been recognised since receipt is not virtually certain and therefore does not meet the recognition 
criteria under IAS 37.

At 31 March 2009 the ESOP held 483,723 shares (2008: 751,879 shares) in the Company at a cost of £1.9 million (2008: £3.7 million). The 
ESOP was established in August 1996 to purchase shares in the Company in order to hedge certain future obligations of the Group including 
shares awarded under the LTISP and the ESOS. During the year the Trustee of the ESOP issued 468,156 (2008: 249,794) shares following 
exercises of LTISP options. In addition, the Company issued 200,000 shares to the ESOP in March 2009 at the prevailing market price of 
£2.60 (March 2008, 600,000 shares at £5.40). The market value of the shares held by the ESOP , which are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, was £1.3 million at 31 March 2009 (2008: £3.5 million).

As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate proﬁ t and loss account is presented for the Company. The proﬁ t for the 
year dealt with in the accounts of the Company is £11.7 million (2008: £22.0 million) including dividends received from subsidiary companies 
of £25.0 million (2008: £50.0 million). Dividends paid amounted to £32.3 million (2008: £30.8 million) which, along with a credit for share 
based payments of £0.8 million (2008: £3.2 million) and the cost of the cash gift to the ESOP of £0.5 million (2008: £3.2 million) resulted 
in a £20.3 million decrease in retained earnings (2008: £8.8 million).
In 1996 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Dairy Crest Limited. Consideration was in the form of cash and the issue 
of 109.8 million ordinary shares of 25 pence each. The fair value of the shares issued was estimated as £170.2 million. The capital reserve 
of £142.7 million represents the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of £27.5 million.

27 Share based payment plans
Group
The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan (‘LTISP’)
This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares 
for a nominal price subject to the achievement of ﬁ nancial targets based on (i) total shareholder return (‘TSR’) over a three year period versus 
comparator companies and (ii) growth in earnings per share or, from August 2006, economic proﬁ t. The vesting period for grants made under 
this scheme is three years with an exercise period of seven years. On 1 July 2008 1,161,635 options were granted under the LTISP scheme 
(July 2007: 563,314). There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme
All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase 
shares. Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares. No ﬁ nancial performance criteria are attached to 
these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months. In December 2007 1,340,664 options 
were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave scheme at a grant price of 487 pence. No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 
2009. There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’)
Options granted under the Dairy Crest ESOS to subscribe for the Company’s shares could be exercised up to 2012 but all outstanding 
options were exercised in the year ended 31 March 2007. No options have been granted under this scheme since 22 July 2002. There were 
no cash settlement alternatives.
In addition, from 2005/06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares with a vesting period of three 
years. The only vesting condition is continuing employment. The cost of these shares is charged over four years (being the year the bonus 
related to and the three year vesting period) and is based on the number of shares issued and the share price at date of issue. There is no 
bonus payout for the year ended 31 March 2009 and therefore will be no deferred shares issued (2008: 2,931 shares).
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows:

* The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.
At 31 March 2009 no ESOS share options were outstanding (31 March 2008: nil). Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to 
September 2011 at a price of 487p (31 March 2008: exercisable up to September 2011 at prices ranging from 388p to 487p). LTISP options 
are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2018 (March 2008: July 2017). 
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2009 is 8.52 years for the LTISP and 2.42 years for the 
Sharesave Scheme (2008: 8.19 years and 2.50 years respectively). The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 
£3.88 (2008: £6.90) and on exercise of Sharesave options was not applicable as none was exercised (2008: £6.49).

27 Share based payment plans (continued)
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2007 is 18% giving a fair value of £0.94 per option granted. This 
has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The number of share options granted has been adjusted for forfeitures in 
the period to 31 March 2009. The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2007 grant were: expected share price 
volatility 28.3%, risk free rate of interest 4.15% and dividend yield 4.57%. The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the 
Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option. There 
were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2009.
The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions. The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards 
is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model. The fair value factor for the award made in July 2008 is 44% for the TSR element 
and 100% for the Economic Proﬁ t element (July 2007: 59% TSR and 100% Economic Proﬁ t) giving a fair value of £2.37 per option granted 
(2008: £5.43). The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on economic proﬁ t and the charge for this is the value of shares 
expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant. There is no reasonable likelihood of the economic proﬁ t 
condition on the 2007 and 2008 LTISP issues being met and no charge has been assumed for this element. A 100% charge has been 
assumed on the 2006 LTISP economic proﬁ t measure. Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies 
based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life. 
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2009 were as follows:
Term 3 years (2008: 3 years)
Volatility 32% (2008: 24%)
Risk free rate 5.2% (2008: 5.1%)
Average volatility of comparator TSR 33% (2008: 24%)
TSR correlation (Dairy Crest vs comparators) 11% (2008: 8%)
The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2009 is £0.8 million (2008: £3.2 million) (See Note 10).

At 31 March 2009 no ESOS share options were outstanding (March 2008: nil). Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 
2011 at a price of 487p (March 2008: up to September 2011 at prices of 388p to 487p). LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up 
to July 2018 (2008: July 2017). The remaining average weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2009 is 8.25 
years for the LTISP and 2.29 years for the Sharesave Scheme (2008: 8.25 years and 2.29 years respectively). There were no exercises of 
Sharesave options in the year ended 31 March 2009 (2008: nil). 
The Company credit arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2009 was £0.1 million (2008: £1.1 million charge).

Operating lease commitments
The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain land and buildings, vehicles and equipment. Excluding land and buildings, these 
leases have an average life of between three and seven years with no renewal option, escalation clauses or purchase options included in the 
contracts. There are no contingent rentals or operating leases or material sub-leases. There are no signiﬁ cant restrictions placed upon the 
lessee by entering into these leases. 
During the year certain assets at the new cheese packing facility in Nuneaton were sold for cash consideration of £15.4 million. This equipment 
has been leased back under an operating lease with a seven year term. The assets subject to the operating lease have an average useful 
economic life of 10 years. There are no purchase option clauses or any contingent lease rentals

Trading guarantees
The Group has provided guarantees and counter-indemnities which totalled £12.9 million at 31 March 2009 (2008: £10.4 million). This includes 
a guarantee for liabilities amounting to £12.8 million (2008: £10.3 million) (as deﬁ ned in Section 5(c)(iii) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 
1986, Republic of Ireland) of Wexford Creamery Limited and subsidiaries, which are Irish registered companies, for the ﬁ nancial year ended

Provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities of these depots were used to calculate goodwill due to the proximity of the acquisition to 
31 March 2008. Final valuation took place during the period to 17 February 2009 and did not result in any further fair value adjustments. Fair 
value adjustments principally comprise the recognition of two supply contracts as intangible assets along with the related deferred tax liabilities.
During 2008, the Group acquired the goodwill of a number of bottled milk buyers for cash consideration of £1.6 million resulting in goodwill of 
£1.6 million. 
Included in goodwill for the above acquisitions are certain intangible assets that cannot be separately identiﬁ ed and measured due to their 
nature. These include acquired milk rounds lists and assembled workforces. Management believes that goodwill represents value to the 
Group for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted. The majority of the value was assessed to comprise synergy 
beneﬁ ts expected to be achieved by merging the businesses acquired into the Group’s existing operations.
The trade and assets acquired as a result of the above acquisitions were absorbed into the wider Dairies business within Dairy Crest Limited. 
As a result, disclosure of the proﬁ t for the year to 31 March is impracticable. Similarly, it is impracticable to disclose what Group proﬁ t and 
revenue from continuing operations would have been if the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2007.
Certain fair value adjustments were made in relation to St Hubert in the period to December 2007. These comprised adjustments to property, 
plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax and resulted in additional goodwill of £0.6 million being recognised.
31 Financial risk management objectives and policies 
The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Group’s and Company’s ﬁ nancial risk, secure 
cost-effective funding for the Group’s operations and to minimise the effects of ﬂ uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value 
of the Group’s and Company’s ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities, on reported proﬁ tability and on cash ﬂ ows.
The Group’s principal ﬁ nancial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, ﬁ nance leases and cash and short-term deposits. 
The main purpose of these ﬁ nancial instruments is to raise ﬁ nance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other ﬁ nancial assets 
and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions; principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts. 
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of ﬁ nance. It is, and has 
been throughout 2009 and 2008, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁ nancial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁ nancial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit 
risk. Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their 
management and the methods used to measure each risk. Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of
ﬁ nancial instruments in accordance with the Group’s treasury policies. The Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set 
out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s objective is to ensure that forecast net borrowings, plus a reasonable operating headroom, are covered by committed facilities 
which mature at least 12 months after the year end. The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 20. At 31 March 2009 the 
Group’s total credit facilities amounted to £669 million (2008: £632 million) excluding ﬁ nance leases of £14 million (2008: £16 million) and the 
impact of cross-currency swaps on $US and € loan notes of £32.1 million (2008: £(15.8) million). The facilities consist of:
2009
– a £85 million plus €175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013;
– a £100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011;
– Loan notes totalling £321 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
2008
– a term loan of £25 million repayable in semi-annual instalments in June 2008 (£20 million) and December 2008 (£5 million);
– a £250 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in June 2009;
– a £100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011;
– Loan notes totalling £257 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2009 amounted to £127 million (2008: £150 million). This can be analysed as follows 
(see also Note 20):

The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to 
budgets and forecasts. Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash 
payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process. Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly 
reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance. 
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market 
deposits if there is excess cash.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with a ﬂ oating 
interest rate.
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of ﬁ xed and variable rate debt. Speciﬁ cally, to keep between one third and three 
quarters of its borrowings at ﬁ xed rates of interest. To manage this mix in a cost-efﬁ cient manner, the Group has issued ﬁ xed coupon loan 
notes and also enters into interest rate swaps on a portion of its ﬂ oating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at 
speciﬁ ed intervals, the difference between ﬁ xed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional 
principal amount. These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash ﬂ ow obligations. At 31 March 2009, after taking into 
account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 73% of the Group’s borrowings were at a ﬁ xed rate of interest (2008: 67%). 
The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk is shown (by way of a sensitivity analysis) in Note 32.
Foreign currency risk
The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling. As a 
result the value of the Group’s non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash ﬂ ows can be affected by movements in exchange 
rates – predominantly Euro/Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign 
operation into which it invests. The foreign operations hedged in this way are St Hubert SAS (France) and Wexford Creamery Limited (Ireland); 
both are Euro-denominated subsidiaries. Our policy changed during the year ended 31 March 2009. Previously, 100% of overseas net assets 
were hedged but this proportion has been reduced in line with the Group’s reduced levels of Euro-denominated borrowings. Our new policy 
is to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible ﬁ xed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure (2008: 100% of net assets) 
of these subsidiaries through borrowings and/or cross-currency swaps in Euros. No hedging of earnings exposure is undertaken. At present, 
our only currency exposure is Euros. At 31 March 2009, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis 
and no cross currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship. For part of the year ended 31 March 2008, cross-currency 
swaps were used as part of the designated hedge relationship and this and an element of Euro-denominated borrowings were designated 
as a post-tax hedge of the St Hubert net investment.
The majority of the Group’s transactions are carried out in the relevant entity’s functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are 
limited. This can be seen in Note 17 where the only signiﬁ cant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the 
functional currency of St Hubert and Wexford. The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and 
Central and South America. The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products. The Group’s 
policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign 
exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be ﬁ xed. There are currently no sales 
between the UK business and St Hubert SAS.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following 
approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.

31 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
In 2006, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US. At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest 
and principal repayment cash ﬂ ows. The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan 
notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings. There is no proﬁ t and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as 
any retranslation impact on the proﬁ t and loss account is offset by recycling of amounts from the SORIE. 
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on €75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future 
interest and principal repayment cash ﬂ ows. The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on 
the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings. There is no proﬁ t and loss exposure in relation to this 
€75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the proﬁ t and loss account is offset by recycling of amounts from the SORIE.
Price risk
The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Group’s businesses. The principal 
non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil (‘HFO’) and crude oil 
by-products (used in packaging). 
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on proﬁ tability and to assess whether 
the amount of forward cover is appropriate. Vegetable oil contracts are usually structured such that between six and nine months purchases 
are at ﬁ xed prices. Energy is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement 
contracted at more regular intervals. Diesel and HFO is not generally contracted at ﬁ xed prices although from time to time, forward contracts 
have been put in place to ﬁ x future prices.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover. Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the 
approval of the Executive Directors. 
Credit risk
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit veriﬁ cation procedures. The Group only offers 
these terms to recognised, creditworthy third parties. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that 
the Group’s history of bad debt losses is not signiﬁ cant. 
The Household doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis. Cash and debt management is a 
crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly where payment terms have been breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other ﬁ nancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other 
debtors (excludes prepayments) and certain derivative instruments, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty. 
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these ﬁ nancial assets of £279.6 million (2008: £219.7 million). 
There are no signiﬁ cant concentrations of credit risk. 
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above. Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are 
invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of AA or better. The Group currently 
has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable. Derivative ﬁ nancial 
instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of ﬁ nancial 
instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support 
its business and maximise shareholder value. In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they 
are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements. The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants 
is 3.5 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group 
structure. Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning 
capital to shareholders. No signiﬁ cant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2009 or 2008 and 
there have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.

31 Financial risk management objectives and policies (continued)
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders’ funds. The deﬁ nition of net debt is included in 
Note 34. The gearing ratio at March 2009 and 2008 can be analysed as follows:
2009 2008
£m £m
Net debt      415.8 474.8
Shareholders’ funds     357.0 387.7
Gearing ratio      116% 122%
Dividends
Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7. The dividend policy is to maintain a stable dividend policy whilst 
maintaining an appropriate level of dividend cover. Total dividends paid and proposed in the year ended 31 March 2009 of 20.1 pence 
represents a decrease of 17.6% (2008: 24.4 pence and 6.6% growth).

Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the 
Group’s proﬁ t before tax through the impact on ﬂ oating rate borrowings. There is no impact on the Group’s equity resulting from movements 
in interest rates other than in relation to the $US/GBP and EUR/GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ﬂ ow hedge on $US and EUR loan 
notes. The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative ﬂ oating 
rate ﬁ nancial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ﬂ ow hedges. This is due to the fact that gains and 
losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative ﬂ oating rate ﬁ nancial instrument which are subject to the 
hedge are matched in both proﬁ t and loss and cash terms. No non-derivative ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial instruments have proﬁ t and loss exposure 
due to ﬂ oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2009 analysis below reﬂ ects a larger reasonably possible upside change in interest rates than in 2008 due to the current exceptionally low 
LIBOR levels and likelihood of future inﬂ ation.

The above table excludes trade and other receivables and payables as their fair value approximates to carrying value. The fair value of interest 
rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party ﬁ nancial institution with whom the Group holds the 
instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments. The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected 
future cash ﬂ ows at prevailing interest rates.
Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was €74 million (£69 million) (2008: 
€74 million (£59 million)). Interest rate swaps are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 
2009 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 4.045% to 4.053% (2008: 4.045% to 4.053%). The ﬂ oating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these 
swaps is EURIBOR (2008: EURIBOR). The hedged item is the interest cash ﬂ ows on €74 million of borrowings under the revolving credit 
facilities at ﬂ oating EURIBOR – the margin is not hedged. The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next 
three years (being the life of the swap) (2008: four years). 
Cross currency swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding USD/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was $233 million (£133 million) 
(2008: $233 million, £133 million). These cross currency swaps have both legs at ﬁ xed interest rates, are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2009 and 2008 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 5.305% to 5.315%. The loss deferred in 
equity will reverse in the income statement during the next four to seven years (being the life of the swaps).
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was €75 million (£67 million) 
(2008: None). These cross currency swaps have both legs at ﬁ xed interest rates, are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and meet the criteria 
for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2009 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 4.955% to 5.180%. The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the 
income statement during the next ﬁ ve to six years (being the life of the swaps).
During 2007/08, a further cross currency swap contract for a notional principal amount of €72 million was designated as part of a post-tax 
hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS (along with Euro denominated borrowings). This swap had both legs at ﬂ oating interest 
with the Group paying three month EURIBOR and receiving three month LIBOR. The swap was closed in March 2008 at a closing rate of 
EUR/GBP 1.2699, with Euro-denominated borrowings all being designated as a pre-tax net investment hedge for St Hubert at 31 March 
2008. The loss on closure of this swap was separately identiﬁ ed in the statement of recognised income and expense.

Hedge of net investment in foreign entities
The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of (i) the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its 
subsidiary in France (ii) the net asset investment in Wexford Creamery Limited, its subsidiary in Ireland. The fair value of the Euro borrowings 
at 31 March 2009 was £138.0 million (2008: £299.4 million). The foreign exchange loss of £36.8 million (2008: £47.1 million) on translation of 
the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in reserves.
Forward currency contracts
The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases 
and receipts. These forward currency purchases have been designated cash ﬂ ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting. They all 
have a duration of less than one year.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2009 of £127 million (2008: £150 million) in respect 
of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date. These undrawn facilities expire in July 2013. In July 2008, the Group agreed a 
new ﬁ ve year multi-currency revolving credit facility of £85 million and €175 million. 
On 17 July 2008 all amounts outstanding under the 2004 facility were repaid and the facility cancelled. The new facility has the same ﬁ nancial 
covenants as the 2004 and 2006 facilities and includes a maximum net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.
On 5 April 2007, £100 million of revolving credit facilities were repaid and cancelled. These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 
€150 million and £10 million issued on 4 April 2007 maturing 4 April 2014 and 4 April 2017.

Interest rate risk
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Company’s proﬁ t before tax through the impact on ﬂ oating rate borrowings. There is no impact on the Company’s equity resulting 
from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US/GBP and EUR/GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ﬂ ow hedge 
on $US loan and EUR notes. The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative ﬂ oating 
rate ﬁ nancial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ﬂ ow hedges. This is due to the fact that gains and 
losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative ﬂ oating rate ﬁ nancial instrument which are subject to the 
hedge are matched in both proﬁ t and loss and cash terms. No non-derivative ﬁ xed rate ﬁ nancial instruments have proﬁ t and loss exposure 
due to ﬂ oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2009 analysis below reﬂ ects a larger reasonably possible upside change in interest rates than in 2008 due to the current exceptionally 
low LIBOR levels and likelihood of future inﬂ ation.

Other receivables comprise intercompany balances with Dairy Crest Limited. All intercompany balances are repayable on demand and those 
on which interest is receivable/payable include:
–  an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of £178.2 million (2008: £169.1 million) on which interest is receivable at 5.3% (2008: 5.3%);
–  an intercompany loan from Dairy Crest Limited of £46.9 million (2008: £45.0 million) on which interest is payable at LIBOR + 100 basis 
points (2008: LIBOR + 100 basis points).
A convertible loan was issued by Dairy Crest Limited to Dairy Crest Group plc on 15 January 2007. The loan had a principal value of 
£236.0 million with a coupon of 0.1% per annum. On 2 October 2008 the receivable under this loan was sold to a subsidiary undertaking 
for cash consideration of £228.9 million, being its fair value at that date as advised by external valuation professionals. 
Up to its sale, the convertible had been designated as at fair value through proﬁ t and loss having satisﬁ ed the conditions in IAS 39 paragraph 
11A. Since the loan was neither an equity investment nor currently convertible, it was within the scope of IAS 39. In addition, the convertible 
loan contained a derivative, namely a call option to acquire an equity interest in Dairy Crest Limited which meets the requirements in IAS 39 
paragraph 11A.
The convertible loan was carried at fair value with any gains or losses taken to the income statement up to 2 October 2008. At 31 March 
2008 an external valuation was undertaken resulting in a loss on the convertible loan of £12.3 million. The valuation at 2 October 2008 was 
£228.9 million resulting in a gain in the year ended 31 March 2009 of £1.2 million. The convertible loan is not traded in a publicly quoted 
market therefore a Black Scholes Option Pricing model was used in order to value the equity portion of the loan at the date of sale. The input 
assumptions used were as follows: dividend yield 2.6% (2008: 2.6%), volatility 29% (2008: 23%), risk free rate 3.6% (2008: 5.0%), time to 
expiry six months (2008: one year). Dairy Crest Limited is the principal UK Group trading company and therefore the exposure to credit risk 
on the convertible loan is nil.
Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was €74 million (£69 million) (2008: 
€74 million (£59 million)). Interest rate swaps are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 
2009 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 4.045% to 4.053% (2008: 4.045% to 4.053%). The ﬂ oating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these 
swaps is EURIBOR (2008: EURIBOR). The hedged item is the interest cash ﬂ ows on €74 million of borrowings under the revolving credit 
facilities at ﬂ oating EURIBOR – the margin is not hedged. The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement during the next 
three years (being the life of the swap) (2008: four years).

External
The notional principal amount of the outstanding USD/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was $233 million (£133 million) 
(2008: $233 million, £133 million). These cross currency swaps have both legs at ﬁ xed interest rates, are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and 
meet the criteria for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2009 and 2008 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 5.305% to 5.315%. The loss deferred in 
equity will reverse in the income statement during the next four to seven years (being the life of the swaps).
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR/GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 was €75 million (£67 million) 
(2008: none). These cross currency swaps have both legs at ﬁ xed interest rates, are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and meet the criteria 
for hedge accounting. At 31 March 2009 the ﬁ xed interest rates vary from 4.955% to 5.180%. The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the 
income statement during the next ﬁ ve to six years (being the life of the swaps).
Intercompany
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR/GBP ﬂ oating rate cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2009 with Group 
companies was €150.0 million (£138.9 million) (2008: €351.5 million (£276.8 million)). The Company receives EURIBOR and pays LIBOR. 
Intercompany cross currency swaps have not been designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges and any gain or loss arising on revaluation is credited 
or charged to the income statement. These swaps are used in order to minimise currency exchange risk in the Company and match the 
€149 million (£138 million) of external Euro-denominated borrowings at 31 March 2009 (2008: €349 million (£278 million)).
Borrowing facilities
The Company has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2009 of £151 million (2008: £150 million) in 
respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date. These undrawn facilities expire in July 2013. In July 2008, the Company 
agreed a new ﬁ ve year multi-currency revolving credit facility of £85 million and €175 million. 
On 17 July 2008 all amounts outstanding under the 2004 facility were repaid and the facility cancelled. The new facility has the same ﬁ nancial 
covenants as the 2004 and 2006 facilities and includes a maximum net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.
On 5 April 2007, £100 million of revolving credit facilities were repaid and cancelled. These facilities were replaced by loan notes of 
€150 million and £10 million issued on 4 April 2007 maturing 4 April 2014 and 4 April 2017.

* The Group and Company have $233 million and €75 million of loan notes against which cross-currency swaps have been put in place to ﬁ x interest and principal 
repayments in Sterling (2008: $233 million only). Under IFRS, currency borrowings are retranslated into Sterling at year end exchange rates. The cross-currency swaps are 
recorded at fair value (Note 32) and incorporate movements in both market exchange rates and interest rates. The Group deﬁ nes net debt so as to include the effective 
Sterling liability where cross-currency swaps have been used to convert foreign currency borrowings into Sterling. The £32.1 million adjustment included above (2008: 
£(15.8) million) converts the Sterling equivalent of Dollar and Euro loan notes from year end exchange rates (£232.1 million (2008: £117.2 million)) to the ﬁ xed Sterling liability 
(£200.0 million (2008: £133.0 million)). This amount forms part of the overall swap fair value of £39.5 million (2008: £(3.9) million) shown in Note 32.

 106 Independent auditors’ report to the members of Dairy Crest Group plc
We have audited the Group and Parent Company ﬁ nancial 
statements (the “ﬁ nancial statements”) of Dairy Crest Group plc for 
the year ended 31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated 
income statement, the Consolidated and Parent Company balance 
sheets, the Consolidated and Parent Company statements of 
recognised income and expense, the Consolidated and Parent 
Company cash ﬂ ow statements, Accounting policies and the related 
notes 1 to 35. These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described 
as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by 
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ remuneration report and the ﬁ nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union are set out in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance 
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial statements 
give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁ nancial statements and 
the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985 and, as regards the Group ﬁ nancial information, Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion 
the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the 
ﬁ nancial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report 
includes that speciﬁ c information presented in the Chief Executive’s 
review, Operating review and Financial review that is cross referred 
from the Business review section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all 
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if 
information speciﬁ ed by law regarding directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions are not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reﬂ ects 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 
Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not 
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or 
its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report 
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁ nancial 
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ 
report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, 
the Chairman’s statement, Operating review, the Chief Executive’s 
statement, the Financial review and the Corporate governance 
statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies 
with the ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant 
to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgments 
made by the directors in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁ cient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the 
presentation of information in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•  the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its 
proﬁ t for the year then ended;
•  the Parent Company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 March 2009;
•  the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with 
the ﬁ nancial statements.

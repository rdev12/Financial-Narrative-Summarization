Non Financial KPIs
Notes 
On pages 1 to 67 of this report the Company’s results for the year ended 31 December 2012 are presented on an ‘Underlying business’ basis, 
unless otherwise stated. ‘Underlying business’ excludes the results of previously announced business disposals, Milling (sales only), and non-core 
discrete contract losses. Milling is excluded due to the cost plus pricing nature of the business that has a direct impact on sales but not trading profit. 
A reconciliation to statutory numbers can be found on page 34.
The purpose of using the ‘Underlying business’ basis for measuring performance is to reflect the performance of the core business of the Company. 
With the Company having undergone a year of restructuring in 2012, this basis better reflects underlying business performance.
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before re-financing costs, restructuring costs, profits and losses associated with divestment activity, 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension credits 
or charges in relation to the difference between expected return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension liabilities. 
EBITDA is trading profit excluding depreciation.

Chairman’s Statement
Delivering on our promises
“over the year management has clearly 
demonstrated their commitment to deliver 
on the key strategic priorities to turnaround 
the business whilst at the same time 
generating growth momentum.”
Overview of the year
2012 has been a year of very significant 
transformation for Premier Foods. The 
management team has done an exceptional 
job to deliver underlying trading profit growth 
in challenging market conditions, complete 
the disposal programme ahead of schedule 
and establish a platform for growth as we look 
forward to 2013. In 2012 management set out 
a number priorities to stabilise the business 
and I am delighted that they have delivered on 
these. The ability to deliver, often ahead of time, 
is an important step in rebuilding trust with key 
stakeholders – our customers, shareholders, 
banks, pension schemes and employees. It’s 
also the key reason why the Company has 
been able to report an increase in sales of its 
Power Brands and in underlying trading profit 
despite the difficult economic environment  
in 2012.
In March we announced the successful 
completion of a re-financing package with our 
banking syndicate. The new facility, extended 
to 2016, allows the space for the business 
to execute its turnaround strategy. As part of 
this strategy, the Company agreed to dispose 
of non-core businesses to raise £330m of 
proceeds, a target it exceeded by £40m and 
over a year and a half early, in turn reducing 
net debt levels significantly. In addition, a major 
cost reduction programme was implemented 
to help adapt the Company’s cost base to the 
more focused portfolio, delivering £48m of 
savings by the end of 2012 with a further £20m 
of savings promised in 2013. Importantly, the 
Company has generated growth momentum 
behind its Power Brands by stepping up 
marketing investment and through initiating 
more collaborative partnerships with its key 
retail customers. As a result, underlying sales 
increased 3.2% to £1,353.8m with Grocery 
Power Brands up 4.0%.
Leadership
In February, Gavin Darby was appointed as 
Chief Executive Officer following Michael 
Clarke’s decision to resign from the Company. 
Michael had previously indicated to the Board 
that, having delivered the initial stages of the 
turnaround and set a course for sustainable 
profitable growth, he was considering moving 
on to pursue other opportunities. To help plan 
for a potential succession, the Board initiated a 
contingency process which eventually led to the 
appointment of Gavin Darby. 
I am delighted that we have been able to find 
a successor of Gavin’s quality. His strong 
consumer goods background and senior 
executive experience make him the ideal 
candidate to lead the Company and the 
Board looks forward to working with him as 
Premier Foods moves to the next phase of its 
transformation. I would also like to take this 
opportunity to thank Michael for his significant 
contribution to the Company. 
Employees
During the year we have continued to 
strengthen the capabilities of the Company 
particularly within sales and marketing. In the 
Grocery Division, we re-aligned our commercial 
team bringing together our sales and marketing 
teams under one roof along with our innovation, 
technical, insight and Grocery supply chain 
teams. This will ensure greater alignment with 
the delivery of our growth plans. A dedicated 
management team has also been put in place 
to focus on addressing the challenges faced by 
the Bread business. 
David Beever
Non-executive Chairman
In October 2012 we won the John Sainsbury Award for 
Learning and Development, a prestigious national food 
industry award for our Breakthrough Leadership Programme.

During the year a large number of ambitious 
change programmes have been undertaken 
simultaneously in order to increase focus and 
efficiency including the disposal of non-core 
businesses, a major cost reduction programme 
and the recently announced restructuring of 
the Bread business. Management has moved 
quickly to communicate these changes and 
provide clarity to employees. However, I fully 
recognise this has been a challenging time for  
those concerned and I would like to thank all 
staff at Premier Foods for their hard work and 
commitment in delivering the 2012 results. 
As has been the case in past years, the health 
and safety of employees remains an area of 
key focus and I am delighted that yet again the 
operational team have delivered improvements 
with reportable accidents down 42% in 2012. 
This outstanding health and safety record puts 
Premier Foods at the forefront of the British 
manufacturing industry.
Sustainability
Ultimately, the Company endeavours to deliver 
sustainability in everything it does whether that 
applies to financial results or in the way it uses 
natural resources. Wider sustainability issues 
are becoming more and more important with 
our consumers and customers. Most of our 
major customers have significant sustainability 
programmes and this is another way we are 
working in partnership with them to help 
support their strategic priorities. In 2012 the 
Company delivered further improvements 
across all of its environmental KPIs including 
CO
2
 equivalent emissions reduced by 28% and 
waste to landfill down by 53%. 
Our approach to sustainability also extends to 
how we source our raw materials and ensure 
the highest levels of quality and food safety. 
I’m pleased to say that we continue to have 
an excellent track record in this respect which 
is important given recent public concerns over 
the authenticity of meat products. We are 
also addressing consumer concerns about 
health issues such as the amount of salt, fat 
and sugar in their diet as well as portion size. 
We continue to offer a wide range of ‘better 
for you’ choices and informative labelling and 
other communication. We also continued to 
deliver against our commitments under the 
Public Health Responsibility Deal to reduce 
salt levels in a range of products and reduce 
calories across a significant part of our portfolio. 
Further information about our approach to 
Sustainability is set out on page 24.
Governance
As a Board we are committed to good 
governance and have kept up to date with 
changes in the year including the new 
Corporate Governance Code that was issued 
in September and the proposed changes 
to remuneration disclosures outlined by the 
Government in June 2012. A detailed update 
on our governance process, changes to the 
Board and dialogue with shareholders over the 
course of the year are set out in my introduction 
to the Governance section of this annual report 
on page 38. 
Looking forward
It’s clear the economic climate will remain 
very challenging in 2013. However, following 
the achievements of 2012 I believe we have 
a strong platform from which to drive growth. 
We have the right focus, strategies and 
management team in place and in Gavin Darby 
we have a CEO with a proven track record to 
deliver further progress in 2013 and improve 
shareholder value over the medium term. I 
look forward to working with Gavin Darby, the 
management team and the rest of the Board 
to deliver the next stages of Premier Foods’ 
transformation.

Chief Executive’s Review
Delivering sustainable growth
“I am looking forward to working with the 
management team to deliver sustainable 
growth for the business.”
Q: What attracted you to joining 
Premier Foods?
A: I am excited to have joined Premier Foods 
at this important stage in its transformation. 
Premier Foods has a great portfolio of 
brands that consumers know and love and 
a great depth of talent and expertise. I am 
confident that there is real potential to grow 
the Company. Given my track record and 
experience, I believe I have a big opportunity 
to make a difference at Premier Foods by 
working with the management team to deliver 
sustainable growth.
Q: What is your background?
A: Much of my management experience has 
been spent in the consumer goods sector 
building brands. I spent 15 years at Coca-
Cola, one of the world’s best known brands, 
before moving into the telecoms industry 
where I was one of the pioneers that helped 
develop the Vodafone brand to be amongst 
the top ten global brands in value. I led the 
team that introduced the Vodafone brand into 
India. Earlier in my career I worked in the food 
and homecare sectors. In fact, I started out 
at Spillers Foods working on the Homepride 
brand which, of course, is now owned by 
Premier Foods.
Q: You’ve only been at Premier 
Foods a short time but what are 
your initial views on the Group?
A: I am impressed with the job that 
management did last year to stabilise the 
business, particularly, given the difficult 
economic environment. The results for the 
year are encouraging. With much of the initial 
restructuring now complete or in motion, we 
now need to turn our focus to growth to drive 
the next stage of the turnaround. I believe we 
have a clear strategy and a strong team in 
place to deliver future growth.
Q: Are you planning to change 
the Group’s strategy?
A: I am a great believer in ‘focus’ and in 
strategies that require focus. The existing 
strategy of investing behind a small number 
of Power Brands is exactly in line with my 
approach. Furthermore, the Company has 
demonstrated that this strategy is beginning 
to deliver results. I therefore see no need 
for any significant change of course. It’s 
important to ensure continuity for the 
business and for our customers and other 
stakeholders. The important point for me is 
to drive the execution of our strategies and 
ensure we continue to deliver our results. 
Q: Why have you chosen to 
invest such a significant sum in 
Premier Foods shares?
A: I believe a CEO should be personally 
aligned with the interests of shareholders 
from the start. I have confidence in the future 
of Premier Foods and our ability to deliver 
improved shareholder value over the medium 
term. 
Q: How do you see the 
economic outlook for 2013?
A: Markets look just as difficult in 2013 
as they did in 2012. Consumers have less 
disposable incomes and are shopping 
differently. It is very important that we give 
consumers a clear reason to buy our brands 
versus the competition and also build 
mutually beneficial relationships with our 
key customers. I believe we have the right 
strategies in place to deliver further progress 
in 2013.
Q: What are the strategic 
priorities for 2013?
A: There is a strong business plan for 2013 
which builds on the foundations laid down 
in 2012. Our strategic priorities for this year 
are to: 
•	 build on the momentum we have in 
Grocery, particularly through continuing 
to invest behind the Power Brands and 
exploit growth opportunities across 
different channels;
•	 re-build value in the Bread business 
through implementing restructuring plans 
and selective investment in the Hovis 
brand; and 
•	 continue the simplification and cost 
reduction process, including the delivery 
of a further £20m of overhead cost 
savings.
My priority will be to ensure we execute these 
strategies with energy and pace to deliver 
further progress in 2013. I’m looking forward 
to it!

Market insight
Deep market insight is important to help 
us understand what is happening to our 
consumers and what is shaping their 
shopping behaviour.
Insight team
We have a dedicated Insight Team at Premier 
Foods focused on helping us to understand 
consumer and shopper trends and identify 
growth opportunities.
We undertake research to understand the 
impact of Macro trends on purchasing and 
consumption within our categories and 
use insights to develop and measure the 
impact on our brand and sales activities. This 
research also helps us to understand our 
retail customers’ strategies and how they are 
reacting to changes in the market.
What are some of the key factors that 
are affecting our markets, consumers 
and customers?
1. Macro economic impact
During 2012 the UK entered a “double dip” 
recession. The graph above tells the story 
and is something that we all, as consumers, 
have experienced over the last year. UK Gross 
Domestic Product (GDP) fell back into negative 
territory after a brief rally in 2010/2011. Whilst 
the dip in 2012 was not nearly as severe as 
that experienced in 2009 its impact on the 
continuing low level of consumer confidence 
can clearly be seen. 
Spending power has been affected by grocery 
inflation (currently around 4%) and also the 
sustained impact of domestic fuel costs such 
as gas, electricity and in particular petrol. At the 
same time salaries have remained flat. 
As a result people are spending more on food 
as a proportion of their income as prices rise 
but, overall are buying less in volume terms. Of 
the food they do buy, people are increasingly 
looking for greater value. 
How are we responding?
We will continue to improve and emphasise the 
quality, taste and more convenient packaging 
that our products have to offer versus the 
competition. With our Consumer Quality 
Benchmarking we undertake blind testing with 
consumers to test our major products with their 
main competitors.
2.  Low market growth driving high 
promotional activity 
With little market growth, competition is 
intensifying, driving high levels of promotional 
activity. Since 2011 there has been a change 
in the promotional metrics observed within 
grocery with a significant increase in the use of 
a single price point (particularly £1) as opposed 
to multiple purchase deals. This is in part a 
response to the growth in discounters and has 
been popular with consumers looking for value 
and spending on a fixed budget.
How are we responding?
We will continue to invest behind our brands 
to compete with rival products. We must 
ensure our marketing is effective and engages 
with consumers. We also need to work with 
customers to ensure our promotional activity is 
effective whilst maintaining margin.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Market insight
3.  More people eating in but they have 
less time to cook
There has been significant shift in consumption 
behaviour following the onset of recession in 
2007 with people eating out less and preferring 
to eat at home.  
Whilst more meals are now being prepared 
at home, preparation times are continuing 
to decline highlighting the importance of 
convenience.
Consumers are also less willing to experiment 
and instead focus on ‘family favourites’ which 
they know will be well appreciated. 
How are we responding?
Our portfolio of affordable, convenient meal 
solutions is well placed to take advantage of 
this trend providing high quality, great tasting 
food that can be prepared easily by following a 
few simple steps. 
New packaging formats also help provide 
greater convenience for people eating on the 
go, using lunch boxes or snacking. 
4. Health and food quality concerns
Long terms trends show that health 
considerations have almost doubled in 
importance in the last 17 years. This can be 
seen in the increasing interest in ingredients 
such as salt and fat, increased disclosure 
through labelling and Guideline Daily Amounts 
(GDAs) and the focus on the benefits of eating 
‘5 a day’. 
Allied to health is an increased interest in food 
quality and provenance. People are looking for 
reliable brands they can trust. This means an 
increased focus on the sourcing of products 
and the traceability of ingredients.
How are we reacting?
We have committed to a target that at least 
50% of our new products have a claimable 
health or nutritional benefit. This might be by 
reducing salt, portion size or the inclusion of 
one of your ‘5 a day’. 
In addition we continue to ensure that our 
products are produced to the highest quality. 
Where possible we source our ingredients in 
the UK and have an integrated traceability and 
testing system throughout the supply chain. 
5. Seasonal events
The importance of seasonal events has 
steadily increased over recent years with both 
traditional events, such as Easter, as well as 
Halloween and Chinese New Year. In addition 
specific events such as the Olympics and 
Royal Wedding can have a significant although 
temporary impact on consumption.
How are we responding?
We identify seasonal events and introduce 
products with seasonal relevance and work 
with customers to ensure prominent in-store 
execution.
6. Changing shopping habits
In 2012 people were shopping more often 
with increased trips to small stores to ‘top up’ 
to best manage household budgets. There 
has been a fall in the main weekly shop at 
larger format supermarkets. More people 
are purchasing daily on a fixed budget and 
often buying from more than one shop to get 
best value. There has been an increase in the 
discounter channel although this remains a 
relatively small share of the overall market. We 
have also seen continued growth of online 
shopping which enables consumers to plan 
and scrutinise their purchasing in more detail. 
“Whilst my wife and I are sitting together 
watching telly, she will open two windows [on 
the computer] and go through comparing the 
total shop at two supermarkets. It’s actually 
quite satisfying.” 
Quote from a consumer in research this year. 
How are we responding?
In 2012 we re-aligned our Grocery commercial 
team to help exploit growth opportunities 
across all channels. 
Case study  — Sharwood’s Wrap Kits
Consumers are eating more at home. They are looking for the high 
quality, great tasting food but it must also be affordable. People 
have less and less time to cook, so a quick and simple step by step 
approach can help whilst still being something that involves the 
whole family. 
Meal Kits is a fast growing sector in the cooking sauces and 
accompaniments category and has historically been dominated by 
Mexican flavours.
Meal kits are a great way to give the family a home cooked meal, 
whilst they all can share the meal experience.
This gave Sharwood’s the opportunity to introduce Asian cuisines 
to the sector. In addition Indian and Chinese wrap kits fit perfectly 
with Sharwood’s plans to move into new categories producing meal 
solutions which will, in turn, drive brand growth and sales. The kits 
performed exceptionally well in consumer tests.
Each wrap kit is made up of three components – eight wraps, a dry 
spice mix, and a wet sauce and serves a whole family of four.
In September 2012 Mr. Kipling Angel Slices won The Grocer New Product 
Awards Sweet Snack category for its innovative Snack Pack format. The novel 
Snack Pack design makes the individual cakes an ideal lunch box cake, that 
exceeded expectations on appearance, taste and texture.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Brands
Investing in and growing our Power Brands  
is at the heart of our strategy
Our strategy is to focus on our Power Brands. 
Power Brands operate in large categories and 
hold No.1 or No.2 positions in their respective 
categories. We believe they have the best 
potential for growth either through new product 
development or through category growth.
Investing in growth
In order to deliver sustainable growth we are 
focusing our investment behind our Power 
Brands. This means investment in innovation to 
ensure we have a steady flow of new products, 
investing in quality to ensure our products taste 
great and appeal to consumers and investing 
in marketing and promotions to support our 
brands and help them compete in the market.  
Marketing
During the year we have significantly increased 
investment in our Power Brands with a 59% 
increase in marketing spend. Following the 
disposal of certain non-core businesses Power 
Brand revenue now makes up 80% of our total 
branded revenue. 7 of the 8 Power Brands 
were on TV in 2012, a major increase in activity 
compared to 2011, supporting a range of new 
product launches.
Consumer quality benchmarking
We are also investing in our brands to become 
leaders in food quality to ensure consumers 
think our products taste great and better than 
the leading competitor. We know that product 
quality is a key driver for repeat consumption 
and that improving quality has a significant 
impact on consumption with consumers. We 
have a two fold approach:
•	 we use consumer insight to assess our 
product quality and where necessary 
redesign recipes; and 
•	 we ensure we have the correct production 
techniques to ensure that finished products 
are produced to the right level of quality.
During 2012 we have undertaken a significant 
project to review the performance of our 
main products against their biggest market 
competitors whether branded or own label. 
The process involves external blind testing with 
consumers. Unless our product achieves a 
rating of ‘significantly superior’ to its competitor 
improvement opportunities are investigated and 
we work with our Brand teams to reformulate 
recipes that win with consumers. A good 
example of this is Batchelors Super Noodles 
reduced salt. Prior to reformulation our product 
tested at parity with the key competitor. 
Through the reformulation process our focused 
product understanding enabled us to design a 
better product that now tests as superior.
 
Focused innovation
In order to achieve our growth objectives it is 
important that we can generate a range of new 
products that respond to consumer trends and 
changes in eating habits. The starting point 
for this is our insight into British consumers 
which is driven by a clear understanding of the 
values, attitudes and needs of our consumers. 
Premier Foods has a history of creating new 
and unique products and we continue to invest 
in our innovation process. During the year we 
launched a number of new products including 
Sharwood’s Wrap Kits, Batchelor’s Deli Boxes, 
Bisto Stock Melts and also Hovis British 
Farmers loaf which was one of the top 10 UK 
Grocery brand launches in 2012.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Products
The most important area is obviously new 
products, this can be a completely new product 
or a new variety of an existing product. 
Bisto Stock Melts
Bisto Stock Melts are a range of new individual 
concentrated stock pots. The innovative 
new product format was launched in 2012 
responding to the increased popularity of wet 
stock. Stock Melts offer consumers a high 
quality and easy-to-use stock product which 
represents a credible short cut for home 
cooking. It is also relevant to a wide range of 
meal occasions such as casseroles, stews, 
pies, spaghetti bolognese, soups, and curries. 
Stock Melts performed well in consumer 
research in terms of ease of use and taste with 
over 88% of consumers rating the product as 
good/very good.  
Packaging
Packaging innovation is also important and can 
help our products be used in different ways and 
in different meal occasions. 
Mr. Kipling Snack Packs
Mr. Kipling have launched a new Snack Pack 
range of individually wrapped cakes. This 
new and innovative packaging is designed to 
provide convenient cakes to eat when you’re 
out and about. Snack Packs are perfect for 
younger families and packed lunches. The 
new pack design has proved popular with 
consumers and also helps our product stand 
out from its competitors in-store. Over 2012 we 
have increased the range of varieties available 
in the Snack Pack range and also launched 
the ‘Cake to Go’ campaign using innovative 
dispensing posters outside 20 locations where 
passers-by could get their own free sample at 
the touch of a button. In September 2012 the 
novel packaging won The Grocer New Product 
Awards in the Sweet Snack category.
Promotion
Finally, we also focus on innovation in 
promotion to ensure we engage with 
consumers and customers to help raise 
awareness for our products and drive sales.
Batchelors ‘Fuelling Britain’
In 2012 Batchelors launched its biggest 
ever on-pack promotion ‘Fuelling Britain’. In 
response to the continued rise in fuel prices 
and household bills we introduced an innovative 
promotion aimed at helping hard working British 
families. The promotion offered shoppers the 
chance to win free fuel for a year during every 
week of the promotion. The promotion proved 
very popular in the first half of the year and was 
repeated in the run up to Christmas.
Case study  — Innovation Kitchen
generating 10% of turnover 
from npD 
The ability to bring to market a steady 
stream of new products is key to our 
long-term success. We introduced a 
new innovation platform in 2011 to focus 
innovation on fewer, bigger and better 
concepts in order accelerate branded 
growth plans via organic growth.
The programme starts by using our 
consumer insight to identify trends and 
opportunities for growth. The process 
is designed to ensure greater alignment 
between our functions and is based 
around a set of standard processes and 
systems.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Whilst we recognise this is an ongoing process 
and there is still more to do, we have made 
significant progress over the year. 
Customers
We have a broad customer base that operates 
across a number of channels including multiple 
retail, wholesale, cash & carry, impulse retail, 
discounter, foodservice and international. Each 
of these channels and each of our customers 
are different so we need to have an approach 
for each customer which is aligned with their 
priorities.
Building capability
Within Grocery we have now combined the 
sales and marketing functions into a single 
commercial group, including our technical and 
innovation functions. Furthermore this aligned 
commercial function is now much closer 
aligned with the manufacturing and logistics 
operations within the Grocery business. At the 
same time, we have built internal resources 
and made a number of senior appointments to 
strengthen and develop the commercial group. 
Within Bread we have put in place a dedicated 
management team to drive the turnaround of 
the division. 
Multiple Retail
Our focus has been to move from a 
transactional approach to develop long-term 
sustainable relationships. Over the year we 
have agreed joint business plans with each 
of our major customers. This process has 
involved:
•	 Working with our customers to understand 
their categories and their strategy;
•	 Developing ways that we can align to their 
strategic objectives;
•	 Collaborating with customers to maximise 
the opportunities for category growth; 
•	 Using our innovation and consumer insight;
•	 Focusing on multi-format in-store 
execution; and 
•	 Resourcing and delivering plans with 
excellence.
Cash & carry, Wholesale and Impulse 
Over 2012 we implemented standard pricing 
and promotional architecture across this 
channel. This has reduced complexity and 
helped provide clarity in how we deal with 
customers. Additionally in 2012 we have 
created a range of price marked packs across 
our top 20 products. Price marked packs 
provide confidence to the consumer in the 
value being offered. A key focus in 2013 will be 
to gain wide distribution of this price-marked 
range.
Discounters 
Whilst still a relatively small channel in terms 
of the overall market the discounter channel 
has been growing over the last few years as 
consumers react to the challenging economic 
environment. This channel therefore represents 
a growth opportunity for the Group. In 2012 
we have put in place a discreet team whose 
role it is to grow our business in this sector by 
establishing strong relationships with each of 
the major customers.
Online
Building strong relationships with our key 
retail customers is underpinned by our 
understanding of different retail formats and 
how the importance of formats is changing for 
each retailer, for example online.
UK Online grocery sales in 2012 were £5.3bn 
representing 5.0% of the total grocery market 
and grew 18% in 2012. Internet usage is 
increasing in importance with 29m people 
in the UK now viewing the internet daily and 
offers growth opportunities for Premier Foods. 
However, the channel has different dynamics to 
the traditional shopping trip which need to be 
understood and addressed. 
Partners
Developing long-term relationships with all our partners
For our business to be successful in the long-term 
we need to develop strong relationships with all our 
partners. Improving our relationships with customers and 
strengthening our capabilities within the commercial team 
were both strategic priorities in 2012. 
Working with our customers
Celebrating Chinese 
New Year with 
Sharwood’s!
Seasonal events are a significant opportunity 
for both Premier Foods and our customers 
to grow sales. Christmas and Easter are two 
established opportunities. However, Chinese 
New Year is another event which is growing 
in popularity. In early 2013 we partnered 
with number of large customers to capitalise 
jointly on this growing event with our

STRATEGIC REVIEW
For 2013 our focus will be:
•	 Improving the shopper experience, making 
sure our products receive prominence in 
online searches and that they are correctly 
described with up to date product images;
•	 Maximising the potential for cross selling 
opportunities; and
•	 Linking with key seasonal events to capture 
peak trading opportunities.
Diagnostic capability
We have been investing in our systems to 
improve our decision making process. The 
commercial team is developing an integrated 
plan to improve:
•	 Forecasting – to simplify processes and 
improve accuracy;
•	 Retailer profitability modelling – to support 
joint business plans (JBPs) with customers; 
and
•	 Promotional evaluation and modelling – to 
understand the impact of promotions on 
category, brand and customer.

Sustainability
In recent years sustainability has become a 
much bigger part of our relationship with all of 
our retail customers. An increasing number of 
retail customers are now working to embed 
sustainability into their businesses. They are 
setting ambitious targets in areas as diverse 
as sustainable and ethical sourcing, health 
and nutrition, packaging, energy use, waste 
reduction and greenhouse gas emissions.
Premier Foods’ produces both branded and 
retail customer own label food products and we 
have found many opportunities, both through 
direct collaboration and industry programmes, 
to engage with our customers and improve the 
sustainability of our businesses.
Engaging our employees
We provide employment for around 9,000 
employees at over 40 sites across the UK 
including production sites, bakeries, mills and 
offices.
We are committed to providing high standards 
of learning and development to deliver 
excellence in all our business activities while 
equipping our employees with the right skills 
they need to progress. We continually assess 
the Learning & Development requirements of 
our employees and our challenge is to deliver 
high quality training. 
We strive to attract and retain talented, 
committed employees and actively encourage 
development from within. We have developed 
a talent identification and succession planning 
programme which has now been rolled out 
across the business to help build our internal 
pool of talent so we can resource roles 
internally wherever possible. 
We also run a successful student workplace 
placement programme within our Technical 
function which gives us a talent pool for future 
recruitment and support site based learning 
such as NVQ and ILM training through our 
Learning Resource Centres. 
Leadership
Over the year we have made significant 
progress in strengthening capabilities 
particularly within the commercial team with a 
number of senior appointments. We now have 
in place a strong team with significant brand 
experience and a focus on execution and 
delivery.
Breakthrough Leadership Programme
The Breakthrough Leadership Programme is 
one of our main management learning and 
development activities; giving key managers 
training and experience on being a senior 
manager and giving them the confidence and 
skills to develop their own leadership style. 
The programme is designed to work with our 
business strategy and develop our leadership 
behaviours. We believe that the programme is 
fundamental to the success of the business as 
it equips colleagues to support change though 
increased confidence and knowledge. The 
programme also prepares leaders for bigger 
roles, to build effective cross-functional teams. 
In 2012, the Breakthrough Programme won 
the John Sainsbury Award for Learning and 
Development. This Award is a national food 
industry accolade and is given at the IGD 
Food Industry Awards, which recognise 
the achievements of companies in food 
manufacturing, farming, retail, distribution, 
wholesaling and foodservice, as well as best-
in-class programmes that demonstrate exciting 
new thinking in the sector. 
Suppliers
We are committed to working in close 
partnership with our key suppliers to facilitate 
value creation and enhance long term 
sustainable relationships. As one of the UK’s 
largest food producers our preference is to 
source ingredients, products and services from 
UK producers and suppliers. Last year we 
spent around £1.3bn with suppliers, and of this, 
82% was with UK producers and suppliers.
During 2012 our team of category procurement 
experts continued to consolidate our supply 
base, manage key supply chain risks through 
effective risk management and ensure that we 
have fully leveraged our scale across all areas 
of the business.
As part of our efforts to simplify the business 
and increase leverage we have actively reduced 
our supply base and increased spend with 
our leading strategic and preferred suppliers. 
Over the past five years we have reduced the 
number of our suppliers by 65% from 9,472 in 
2008 to 3,299 last year and we are targeting 
a further reduction of 5% during 2013. During 
this period the total spend with our top 250 
suppliers has increased, reaching over 82% in 
2012.

employee reC ognition aW arDs
The Premier Food’s “Best in British Foods Awards” recognises the outstanding achievements of employees working 
at locations across the country. In 2012 we had a record number of nominations under the four headings that are 
aligned to our strategy – building our brands, collaborative working, focus, and sustainability.
The winner of the Collaborative Working Award was the Mr. Kipling team who worked with Carleton Community High 
School as part of an initiative to engage children in the manufacturing industry. The school children came up with 
the idea of the British Summer Mini Batts; a twist on the traditional Battenberg range. The school children wanted 
a product that portrayed Britain and out of this came the Rhubarb and Apple Mini Batt, a product with truly British 
flavours. Packaging was also conceptualised and the team, assisted by the school children, settled on pink and 
green union jack inspired packaging to give real stand out on shelf. Finally a listing with a major retailer was secured. 
This was a major collaborative project building relationships both within the local community and also with a key 
customer.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
At the same time we will not compromise on 
our commitment to food quality, food safety 
and health & safety ensuring it remains at the 
forefront of everyone’s mind – we call this 
Operational Excellence.
Business simplification,  
efficiency and effectiveness
Disposal of non-core businesses
During 2012 we completed a major disposal 
programme exceeding our lender agreed 
disposal target of £330m by £40m. The 
proceeds of £369.5m have been used to 
reduce net debt and further details on the 
disposals is set out on page 92. The disposals 
allow the business to focus on its Power 
Brands helping to simplify the business and our 
overhead costs. The disposals require careful 
management of complex transitional services 
between the Company and purchaser to 
provide an orderly separation of the business. 
This ensures that orders, production and 
delivery standards are maintained for our 
customers. Further information of how we 
have managed separation risk over the year is 
provided on page 49. 
Cost savings initiative
In January we announced an initiative to deliver 
£40m in overhead cost savings by 2013 and 
have been able to significantly exceed this 
target by delivering savings of £48m in 2012.
The project is part of our ongoing simplification 
exercise across the business reflecting the 
Company’s scale following the disposal 
activity outlined above. This has focused on 
the optimisation of structures particularly 
within central functions; simplifying reporting 
structures; the introduction of new IT systems; 
and reviewing ways of working to focus on key 
requirements.
We have committed to deliver a further £20m of 
overhead cost savings in 2013 and the majority 
of these savings have now been identified.  
Consolidation of Grocery logistics
The disposal programme has been 
concentrated on brands within the Grocery 
business and has provided the opportunity to 
significantly reduce the complexity and size of 
our logistics footprint.  
Our Grocery distribution footprint is being 
restructured as our centre of gravity moves 
away from East Anglia. We have now reduced 
our original seven distribution centres to three 
including a new outsourced distribution centre 
at Corby, operated on our behalf by Wincanton. 
Our ambient logistics are now fully outsourced. 
This removes disynergies of more than £4m a 
year. Again it’s a highly complex project with 
27 separate work streams to ensure customer 
service levels are maintained throughout the 
process.  
Progress in 2012 saw our new distribution 
centre in Corby go live – the 252,000ft site 
has a capacity to hold 35,000 pallets and has 
facilitated the closure of several smaller sites.
Focus
Simplification, efficiency and effectiveness

tra Ceability
We have put in place 
integrated traceability and 
monitoring systems from 
animal and crop husbandry, 
via delivery of these raw 
materials to our factories, 
through the manufacturing 
process and distribution 
system, to our products being 
consumed within the home. 
This traceability system is 
tested during all factory 
audits, and annually as part 
of the Quality Management 
System.
The following table highlights 
some elements of testing and 
control throughout our supply 
chain: 
We continue to focus on ways to simplify the business, 
improve efficiency and reduce our costs. In 2012, we 
divested a number of non-core businesses, significantly 
reduced our overhead costs, progressed the consolidation 
of our Grocery logistics and began a broader restructuring 
of our Bread supply chain.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Ongoing cost reduction exercise 
Underlining our commitment to efficiency and 
effectiveness there have been a number of cost 
reduction initiatives running across our sites in 
2012. Within Grocery there have been projects 
to reformulate recipes and reduce packaging 
from our products. Indirect procurement have 
addressed all areas of indirect spend, including 
energy saving initiatives, reduced costs of 
engineering spares and agency labour. The 
sites have also been successful in flexing labour 
costs to respond more efficiently to changes in 
production volumes.
Within Bread, cost saving initiatives focused on 
wastage, labour flexibility, recipe reformulations, 
reliability, indirect procurement and capex 
investment. Logistics savings in Bread were 
generated through a variety of projects 
including driver management software and 
working practice improvements.
Investing for growth
The savings generated from improved efficiency 
are being used to fuel investment behind 
our Power Brands. We are also increasingly 
targeting more of our capex spend into growth 
projects rather than repairs. In 2011 growth 
capex accounted for 46% of the total capex 
spend. This increased to 52% in 2012 and for 
2013 we are targeting 64%. 
Food quality and safety
As one of the UK’s leading food producers we 
are committed to producing high quality, safe 
and wholesome food products. Food safety 
and quality are of paramount importance to 
Premier Foods and are a core requirement 
throughout our organisation. Premier Foods 
has had no public food safety recalls during 
2012 demonstrating the effectiveness of 
the investment and improvements made in 
supply chain management, factory facilities, 
manufacturing controls risk mitigation and 
horizon scanning for emerging issues. 
Resource and Capability
Premier Foods has a high calibre technical team 
who support the operational and innovation 
programmes within the business. This includes 
research facilities, chefs, pilot plant facilities and 
an analytical testing facility (Premier Analytical 
Services) which carries out work for Premier 
Foods, other food manufacturers, Government 
agencies and research institutes.
Product Quality 
In 2012 we have put in place a Finished 
Product Evaluation programme at each site to 
ensure that product quality and consistency is 
maintained. We have made in excess of 11,000 
assessments and the results have been used 
to focus quality improvement programmes at 
manufacturing sites. The programme has been 
augmented by an independent Consumer 
Quality Benchmarking programme where 
we have carried out blind evaluations with 
consumers to test our product against the key 
competitor product. 
For information about Consumer Quality 
Benchmarking go to page 18. 
Quality Audits 
Premier Foods has carried out an extensive 
review of supply chain food safety and 
quality controls including the combining of 
co-manufacturing and Premier Foods factory 
compliance controls and audits. In 2012 a 
total of 142 audits were conducted globally. 
These audits are carried out to the British 
Retail Consortium (“BRC”) Global Standard for 
Food Safety version 6,  and/or our bespoke 
Corporate Technical Standard to guarantee the 
quality and consistency of the ingredients we 
use. 
Premier Foods maintains a comprehensive 
raw materials risk assessment covering all 
food ingredients. A risk based due diligence 
contaminant testing programme is in place 
with 561 tests carried out to verify regulatory 
compliance of the ingredients we use and 
the finished products we sell with both food 
regulation and our own stringent policies. In 
addition, a range of audits, assessments and 
visits were carried out on our raw material 
suppliers in the UK, Europe and other regions. 
Industry leading workplace health  
& safety
Providing a safe workplace for our staff and 
others who work within our business remains a 
key priority for the Group. 
Since 2007, in collaboration with employees, 
we have led a step-change in health & safety 
management which has resulted in significant 
and sustained improvements in health & safety 
performance across the Group. Our Health & 
Safety Corporate Plan, setting out our strategy 
and the bespoke initiatives which deliver it, has 
been fully adopted and embedded across our 
sites.
At the end of 2012, our RIDDOR Frequency 
Rate of 0.07 reportable accidents per 100,000 
hours worked represented a year on year 
improvement of 42% and is the lowest 
achieved to date. Since 2007 this rate has been 
reduced by 87%, delivering what we believe to 
be an industry leading performance. 
During 2012, we adopted a Lost Time Accident 
(LTA) Frequency Rate as a key performance 
indicator signalling our determination to apply 
a preventative focus on all accidents which 
caused absence from work, not only those 
which were reportable under RIDDOR. 
At the end of 2012, the Group LTA Frequency 
Rate was 0.20 LTA’s per 100,000 hours worked, 
representing a 46% reduction over 2011.
2012 A Safe Workplace for All
Throughout 2012 we continued to drive our 
health & safety strategy, a strategy which 
defines Premier Foods’ pioneering approach 
to Safety Leadership at all levels in our 
workplaces. 
Through the commitment and dedication of our 
Site Managers and their Teams critical 
components of our strategy were further 
advanced.
Total Observation Process (“TOPS”)
Our unique, inclusive approach to hazard 
identification and control continued to identify 
and address work place hazards. 
Since its launch in 2008;
128,580 TOPs Hazards have been identified.
124,292 TOPs Hazards have been closed-out.
In this way, 124,292 potential accidents have 
been prevented and injuries to our employees 
and others avoided, enabling them to return 
safely to their homes at the end of their shift.
BS OHSAS 18001:2007
Through a site audit programme undertaken by 
an independent 3rd party auditor, the Health 
& Safety Management system across all our 
sites continues to be certificated to BS OHSAS 
18001:2007.
And our passion for the health, safety and 
wellbeing of our employees and others was 
externally recognised.
SEQOHS Accreditation: The Royal College of 
Physicians, commissioned by the Faculty of 
Occupational Medicine, awarded SEQOHS 
(Safe Effective Quality Occupational Health 
Service) Accreditation to Premier Foods’ 
Occupational Health and Wellbeing Service. 
In October 2012, Premier Foods became one 
of only 63 UK organisations, and the first within 
the UK Food Manufacturing Sector, to receive 
SEQOHS accreditation.
In addition our performance was recognised 
by the Royal Society for the Prevention of 
Accidents (RoSPA) winning the RoSPA UK 
Food and Drink Sector Award. 36 RoSPA Gold 
Achievement awards were also received by our 
individual sites.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
Sustainability in everything we do...
Happy Hens lay g ooD eggs
At the prestigious Good Farm Animal Welfare Awards last year we were awarded a Good Egg Award by Compassion in 
World Farming in recognition of our commitment to improving animal welfare.
We are the first food producer in the UK to commit to using free range or barn eggs across our entire brand portfolio 
which is the equivalent to over 70 million eggs. This pioneering work forms part of our broader commitment to 
guarantee full traceability and high safety, quality and animal welfare for all the eggs that we use.
Hosted by top cook, food writer and broadcaster, Valentine Warner, the Good Farm Animal Welfare Awards recognises 
and awards food companies that are committed to implementing substantial policy changes that result in positive 
impacts for farm animals.
Including animal welfare as part of our sustainable procurement programme not only improves the lives of thousands 
of laying hens, it also meets the growing expectations of our customers and consumers that food systems are kind to 
animals and care for the environment. We’re proud to be leading the way on this important animal welfare issue.
Sustainability
We strive for Sustainability in everything we do
We have many stakeholders for whom 
sustainability has become more and more 
important including our consumers, customers, 
employees and stakeholders in general. 
We have embedded sustainability within 
our core business strategy. By promoting 
‘sustainability in everything we do’ we believe 
we will build a foundation for a more stable, 
sustainable business which will deliver long-term 
profitable results and shareholder value.
Our integrated approach to managing our key 
environmental impacts has delivered continual 
improvement and commercial benefits. We 
have set ourselves targets relating to wider 
sustainability challenges including how we 
source our raw materials and ensure the highest 
levels of quality and food safety whilst also 
addressing consumer concerns on health issues 
in respect of certain ingredients, calorie control 
and portion size. 
You can read more about our performance in 
these areas within the sustainability section of 
our Company web site but we have included 
some of the highlights within this summary.
Buying Responsibly 
We procure the best quality raw materials 
that meet our current and future needs. We 
try to deliver long-term value, maximise social 
and economic benefits as well as minimise 
associated environmental impact when buying 
our goods and services. For example, we 
are committed to sourcing 100% sustainable 
palm oil by 2015, playing our part in helping to 
prevent damaging deforestation in South East 
Asia. 
We place a high value on the integrity, 
provenance and traceability of all the 
ingredients we buy. Wherever possible we 
actively look to support UK agriculture as 
this gives us greater confidence, control 
and influence over our supply chain. It also 
gives confidence to our customers and 
consumers who are increasingly interested in 
the provenance of the food they buy. In 2012, 
we spent 82% of our £1.3 billion procurement 
budget with UK producers and suppliers.
Sustainable Manufacturing 
Making more from less makes good business 
sense. Using fewer natural resources and 
generating less waste not only lowers our 
costs but also reduces our environmental 
footprint. By creating a culture of environmental 
improvement across the business, we are able 
to encourage new ideas to continue improving 
our efficiency year on year. We continue to build 
on our strong track record of environmental 
progress and in 2012 we made good progress 
against our targets. Our performance has been 
tracked over the past five years in the table 
opposite. 
Particular highlights include a 41.8% reduction 
in our waste to landfill against a 20% target 
reduction* bringing us closer to reaching our 
ambition of sending zero waste to landfill 
by 2015 and we reduced actual road miles 
travelled by 16% against a 5% target*. 
Our achievements in using less natural 
resources contributed to us being awarded the 
‘Green and Sustainable Manufacturing Award’ 
at the 2012 European Strategic Manufacturing 
Awards for demonstrating unparalleled 
performance in environmental manufacturing. 
* Performance in ‘relative’ terms to tonnes of product 
manufactured (excluding divested manufacturing 
sites).
Diet & Health 
We aim to offer a wide choice of products 
to help our consumers manage their busy 
lifestyles. For each of our Power Brands and 
our portfolio as a whole, we’ve developed 
health and nutrition action plans setting out 
We have developed an end to end approach to 
sustainability encompassing all areas of our business 
and addressing a broad range of social, economic and 
environmental issues.

STRATEGIC REVIEW
targets for the number of products that will 
have an improved nutritional value whether 
through the addition of ‘positive’ ingredients 
such as wholegrains, cereals, oats, fruits or 
vegetables, or the reduction in ingredients of 
concern including salt, saturated fat or trans 
fats. More than half of all our new product 
innovations must be for products that have a 
claimable health or nutrition benefit or otherwise 
offer portion sizes that discourage excessive 
consumption. We’ve also made a number of 
public commitments to improve the nutritional 
value of our products within the framework of 
the Public Health Responsibility Deal. 
To help consumers understand the nutritional 
impact of our products, we are committed to 
labelling all key nutrients on pack, wherever 
possible per 100g and per serving. For many 
years we have also included information on 
energy, fat, saturated fat, sugars and salt 
content in the form of Guideline Daily Amounts 
(GDAs) on both the front and back of pack. 
Whenever possible, we highlight the nutritional 
benefit of our brands in our communications 
and marketing. And we provide balanced 
recipe suggestions via our ‘Great Little Ideas’ 
programme both on pack and via a dedicated 
website. 
Quality & Food Safety 
The quality of our products is a key priority 
for us. We are committed to ensuring that 
all factors relating to the quality and safe 
production of our food consistently meets the 
highest of standards. We maintain far reaching 
and stringent quality standards within our 
supply chain which exceed legal requirements. 
This includes rigorous systems of supplier 
approvals and auditing, traceability and testing 
to ensure our raw materials, ingredients and 
production processes conform to our specific 
specifications. 
Quality for us also includes our dedicated 
programme to ensure that we are constantly 
improving our ingredients and recipes to deliver 
great tasting food as well as bring new high 
quality products to the market each year. We 
launched a number of new products to the 
market in 2012 including our Sharwood’s Wrap 
Kits and Bisto Stock Melts, Ambrosia Rice 
Pots, Mr. Kipling Snack Packs and Hovis British 
Farmers Loaf. Nearly 18% of Premier Foods 
branded portfolio by sales value over the last  
2 years are new products. 
Our People 
We provide employment for around 9,000 
employees at over 40 sites across the UK 
including production grocery sites, bakeries, 
mills and offices. 
As well as putting the safety of our people first, 
we offer excellent learning and development 
opportunities and recognise people who go the 
extra mile through our annual Best in British 
Food Awards (BIBFA). 
The winners of our 2012 BIBFA Sustainability 
Award, which goes to the person or team who 
has strengthened the sustainability of our brand 
portfolio or our environmental programme, 
was presented to the site service team at our 
Carlton site for reducing waste consumption by 
25% in the period 2011/12. 
More detailed information on our approach to 
training and development can be found on the 
sustainability section of our Company website. 
Community Involvement 
We strive to make a difference to the local 
communities in which we operate and our 
people are extremely passionate about 
charitable giving. We support community 
development projects and local charities 
across our sites, and have a corporate charity 
partnership that unites our business in their 
fundraising activities. Our collective employee 
fundraising for Help for Heroes raised over 
£260,000 over a two-year partnership. This 
has enabled us to leave a lasting legacy with 
the charity, which amongst other initiatives, 
supported the creation of a new dining room 
at their state of the art recovery centre for 
the wounded, Tedworth House in Tidworth, 
Wiltshire. This year, employees have chosen 
Macmillan Cancer Support as our new partner 
and we are committed to funding 10,000 vital 
nursing hours over the next two years.

Underlying business
Underlying business excludes all disposals announced in 2011 and 
2012, non-core discrete contract losses and Milling sales. The following 
commentary is based on Underlying business unless otherwise stated. A 
reconciliation from statutory to underlying performance measures is set 
out in the tables on page 34.

Introduction
Underlying business sales increased by 3.2% to £1,353.8m in the year, 
an increase of £42.1m compared to the prior year. Underlying business 
Trading profit increased by £11.8m to £123.4m in the year. 
Grocery divisional contribution decreased by £11.4m to £195.5m during 
the year, reflecting increased consumer marketing investment partly offset 
by growth in Power Brand sales.
Bread divisional contribution declined by £24.8m to £26.9m due to 
adverse customer mix, wheat quality affecting manufacturing efficiencies 
and higher costs to serve.
Divisional contribution is the measure which the Company uses for 
managing and reporting divisional performance and excludes all selling, 
general and administrative (S,G&A) costs.
The Company exceeded its target to reduce S,G&A costs by £40m in 
2012, achieving total cost reductions of £48m by the end of the year, 
contributing to the increase in Underlying Trading Profit. As previously 
announced, a further £20m of overhead cost savings are expected to be 
delivered in 2013.
In the year, the Company benefitted from pension credits of 
approximately £32m. Additionally, the Company increased certain 
balance sheet provisions on onerous lease provisions relating to vacant 
properties held by the Company and cleaned up certain legacy fixed 
assets. These items offset the pension credits recognised in the year, and 
therefore the impact on Underlying business Trading profit in the year is 
neutral.

Total Underlying business sales increased by 3.2% to £1,353.8m 
compared to 2011. Sales of the Company’s Power Brands grew by 
2.1%; in line with the trend seen in the first three quarters of the year.
In the support brand portfolio, sales declined by 2.9% reflecting declines 
in Homebaking, owing to a highly competitive business to business 
channel and lower promotional activity.
Consumer Marketing
£m 2012 2011 Change
Consumer Marketing 39.4 24.7 59.5%
Total consumer marketing investment increased by nearly £15m in 
2012 compared to the prior year, principally due to new TV advertising 
campaigns for seven of the Company’s Power Brands. Investment in the 
Grocery Power Brands nearly doubled compared to the prior year and 
included new campaigns for Sharwood’s (Great British Curry), Ambrosia 
(Picnic) and Bisto (Pledge).
The Company expects to continue to benefit from the significant step-up 
in investment in 2012, with consumer marketing expenditure expecting 
to remain at similar levels in 2013, but with greater emphasis on Grocery 
marketing investment.

Total sales 856.7 811.2 5.6%
Power Brands sales 533.1 512.6 4.0%
Divisional contribution 195.5 206.9 (5.5%)
Sales in the Grocery division increased by 5.6% to £856.7m compared 
to £811.2m in 2011. Following recent disposals, this business has 
increased its proportion of branded sales by over five percentage points 
to 86.6% and retains strong EBITDA margins which the Company 
believes it can build on.
Grocery Power Brand sales, in particular, continued to gather momentum 
during the year increasing by 4.0%, demonstrating  four successive 
quarters of growth. This growth was driven by improved customer 
collaboration and increased levels of consumer marketing investment.
Marketing investment in the Grocery division increased by 96% 
compared to the prior year, as consumer marketing spend rose by 
around £16m reflecting higher spend across all the Grocery Power 
Brands.
During the year, Sharwood’s benefitted from the launch of Wrap Kits, 
Batchelors growth was well supported by the new Deli Box range and 
Ambrosia Rice pots performed well.
Consequently, Divisional contribution was £195.5m, a 5.5% decrease on 
the previous year. 
In the fourth quarter, the Company confirmed it has agreed an extension 
to the licence it holds to produce Cadbury branded cakes and ambient 
desserts until June 2017. The brand is the fastest growing in the ambient 
cake category and the Company plans to work closely with Cadbury 
to leverage the potential of other Cadbury trademarks over time, where 
appropriate.
Non-branded sales in the Grocery division increased by 31.8% in the 
year, due to contract gains in Cake and additional co-pack arrangements 
following recent disposals. 
Savings in manufacturing controllable costs are expected to continue 
to deliver gross savings in 2013 through process improvements at our 
manufacturing sites.
Bread division
£m 2012 2011 Change
Branded bread sales 374.4 380.9 (1.7%)
Non-branded bread sales 122.7 119.6 2.6%

Milling sales 191.4 193.0 (0.8%)
Total sales 688.5 693.5 (0.7%)
Divisional contribution 26.9 51.7 (48.0%)
Sales for the Bread division excluding Milling declined 0.7% to £497.1m 
in the year while total sales for the division decreased by 0.7% to 
£688.5m. Divisional contribution declined by £24.8m to £26.9m in the 
year.  
During the year, Hovis maintained its value market share in a highly 
competitive market, where promotional activity levels remain high. 
However, changes in the customer and product mix during the course 
of the year, as a result of a number of contract gains and losses, have 
adversely impacted Divisional contribution. Additionally, some of the 
contract gains require higher costs to serve. Continued collaboration 
with our retail customers in 2013 is expected to result in an improved mix 
impact year on year.
Adverse wheat quality following the worst harvest for 35 years also 
affected manufacturing efficiencies and negatively impacted Divisional 
contribution in the second half of the year. Price increases were achieved 
in the Baking and Milling businesses in the third quarter of 2012 to offset 
wheat price inflation following the lower quality harvest seen during 
the year, and while the Company has taken the decision to diversify its 
sources of wheat in the short-term, it remains committed to supporting 
British farming.
As previously announced, the Company will lose a branded and non-
branded bread contract with a retail customer in the second quarter 
of 2013, equivalent to approximately £75.0m of annual sales. The 
lost volume and margin from this contract is expected to be offset 
by manufacturing and distribution cost savings from the previously 
announced closures of the Birmingham, Greenford and Eastleigh 
bakeries and distribution centres at Mendlesham and Plymouth. 
Additionally, the Company recently announced the proposed closure 
of its Glasgow Mill to optimise capacity in its Milling business in light of 
reduced volumes. As previously announced, the cash costs associated 
with this restructuring are expected to be approximately £28m in 2013.
Milling sales were £191.4m in 2012, down 0.9% compared to the prior 
year, while margins were also affected by the lower wheat quality from 
the 2012 harvest.
In 2013, the Company plans to re-build value in its Bread division through 
focusing on reducing costs to serve, improving profitability and targeting 
capital investment to enhance flexibility, efficiency and customer service.
In September 2012 we received a Good Egg Award by Compassion in World Farming 
in recognition of our commitment to farm animal welfare by becoming the first UK food 
producer to source free range or barn eggs across our entire brand range.

achieved through right-sizing both the commercial and support functions 
to ensure the overhead cost base better reflects the Company’s scale 
following disposal activity. 
As previously announced, a further £20m cost savings are expected to 
be delivered in this area during 2013. The expected costs to achieve 
the delivery of the total savings programme are £32m, of which 
approximately £24m were taken in 2012 and a further £8m are expected 
to be charged in 2013. The cash impact of this programme is expected 
to be approximately £12m in 2013.
The Company will continue to explore further cost opportunities to fuel 
branded growth.
Net regular interest

Term debt interest 36.0 40.1 10.2%
Swap contract interest 17.3 59.7 71.0%
Securitisation interest 3.1 2.5 (24.0%)
56.4 102.3 44.9%
Amortisation and deferred fees 13.1 13.4 2.2%
Net regular interest 69.5 115.7 39.9%
Net regular interest charge was £69.5m in the year, 39.9% lower than the 
prior year, and compares to guidance of £70-£75m. This lower charge 
was principally due to the conversion of the higher rate interest rate 
swaps into additional term loan at the end of March, at a significantly 
lower interest rate and following completion of the previously announced 
re-financing agreement. Term debt interest was lower reflecting reduced 
levels of Net debt following the disposal of businesses during the course 
of the year.
The Company expects Net regular interest for 2013 to be in the range 
of £60-65 million, of which amortisation of deferred financing fees are 
expected to be approximately £22 million.

Group recurring cash inflow before non-recurring items such as 
restructuring activity, financing fees and the impact of disposals was 
£50.0m in the year.
Underlying business Trading profit was ahead of last year while 
depreciation was £1.5m lower. Other non-cash items in 2012 largely 
reflect the add-back of share based payments.
Cash interest was significantly lower in the year owing to the close out of 
the higher rate interest rate swaps following the re-financing agreement 
announced in March 2012. A tax credit in the year of £0.3m reflected tax 
relief from allowances on capital expenditure, pension contributions and 
brought forward losses. Cash tax in 2013 is expected to be minimal.
Pension deficit contribution payments to the Company schemes in the 
year (including administrative costs) were £17.7m, compared to £56.0m 
last year, owing to reduced pension deficit contribution payments as 
agreed with the Trustees as part of the re-financing agreement concluded 
earlier this year.
Regular capital expenditure was £56.4m, in line with guidance of 
approximately 3% of sales. Capital expenditure for 2013 is expected to 
be in the range 3-3.5% of sales.

to disposed businesses, including costs related to the cost savings 
programme, resulted in a cash outflow of £21.6m in the year.
Disposal proceeds of £312.2m are from the sale of the Irish brands, 
Vinegar & Sour Pickles, Elephant Atta Ethnic Flour and Sweet Spreads 
& Jellies businesses. Cash paid due to fees directly relating to the re-
financing agreement concluded in March 2012 accounted for outflows of 
£24.0m.

tax. The next triennial valuation date of the Company pension schemes is 
on 5 April 2013, the outcome of which is expected in early 2014.

In the classification disclosed in the table above, ‘Other’ includes 
investments in infrastructure assets and private equity funds. The 
negative swaps valuation is due to these assets having been re-
couponed to release cash in 2012; this is reflected in the higher cash 
asset balance compared to the prior year.
The Group acknowledges the significance of the current pension deficit 
in determining a fair reflection of the Group’s Enterprise value. The 
Group’s preferred approach is to discount the post tax future cash flows 
of the agreed pension deficit contribution schedule, which amount to 
approximately £275 million.

Business Disposals
During the course of the year, the Company was successful in exceeding 
its planned disposals proceeds target by nearly £40 million and 20 
months early, achieving total proceeds of £369.5 million. This has 
resulted in lower Net debt, allowing the Company to focus on investing 
behind its Power Brands. The average EBITDA multiple for the four 
transactions announced in 2012, based on expected 2012 results and 
including additional £20m S,G&A cost savings recently announced, was 
8.9x EBITDA.
Proceeds from Vinegar & Sour Pickles, Ethnic Flour and Sweet 
Spreads & Jellies businesses are reflected in reported Net debt as at 
31 December 2012. The Sweet Pickles and Table Sauces divestiture 
completed on 2 February 2013, therefore gross proceeds of £92.5m will 
be included in reported Net debt in 2013.
Outlook
In 2012, the Company delivered its strategic priorities to stabilise the 
business, re-focus the portfolio and invest in its future growth. Growth 
momentum was generated behind the Company’s Grocery Power 
Brands and strategic decisions were taken to re-build value in Bread. 
While markets are expected to remain challenging in 2013, the Company 
believes the right strategies and plans are in place, including the delivery 
of further cost savings, to make progress in 2013.

Operating review
The Company presents its financial results for the year ended  
31 December 2012 with comparative information for the year ended  
31 December 2011. 
Company structure
The Company completed the disposals of the following businesses 
during the year: Irish brands, Vinegar and Sour Pickles, Elephant Atta 
Ethnic Flour and Sweet Spreads and Jellies. Additionally, the Company 
announced the disposal of the Sweet Pickles and Table Sauces  
business on 30 October 2012, and completed this transaction on  
2 February 2013.
The Canned grocery operations business is treated as a continuing 
operation in the financial statements and reported separately as an 
operating segment, ‘Disposed of Canning Operations’.
All commentary on the performance of the Company included below 
refers to continuing operations unless otherwise stated and therefore 
reflects the respective periods that the Company maintained ownership 
of the businesses disposed during the year. For example, the Vinegar 
and Sour Pickles business disposal completed on 28 July; therefore the 
results of the continuing operations include seven months’ results of the 
Vinegar and Sour Pickles business.
Income statement
Revenue from continuing operations was £1,756.2m, a decrease of 
£243.3m compared to the prior year. The major driver of the decline 
is attributed to the disposals of the canned grocery operations, Irish 
brands, Vinegar and Sour Pickles, Elephant Atta Ethnic Flour and Sweet 
Spreads and Jellies businesses, partly offset by Power Brands sales 
growth. 
Operating profit
Operating profit for continuing operations was £96.3m, compared to a 
prior year loss of (£176.3m). 
Trading profit was £154.7m in the year, a decline of £33.6m, principally 
reflecting the impact of the businesses disposed during 2011 and 2012.  
During the year, significant savings in the overhead cost base were partly 
offset by increased consumer marketing investment. 
Restructuring costs and losses associated with disposal activity were 
£46.1m in the year. These charges relate to access costs associated 
with the Company’s cost savings programme and restructuring activity 
associated with the previously announced closure of three bakeries and 
two distribution sites in the Bread division.
Amortisation of intangible assets was £53.3m in year, a reduction of 
£18.7m from the prior year. This reflects the impairment of goodwill and 
the Hovis brand in 2011 and also the impact of disposals made during 
2012. Impairment charges in 2012 were £36.2m which relate to the write 
down of part of the carrying value of the Bread business following the 
decision to restructure the supply chain. This compares to a charge in 
2011 of £282.0m.
The pension financing credit was £12.5m in 2012, £4.5m lower than the 
prior year, primarily due to lower expected asset returns.
Finance expense
Net finance expense in the year to 31 December 2012 was £91.9m, 
compared to £82.8m in the prior year. Net regular interest reduced from 
£115.7m to £69.5m, due to the conversion of higher rate interest rate 
swaps into additional term loan at a significantly lower interest rate in 
addition to lower levels of Net debt following the disposal of businesses 
during the course of the year. Partly offsetting this reduction in net finance 
expense is the year on year net movement of interest rate instruments. 
In the prior year, there was a positive movement in the fair valuation of 
interest rate derivatives of £36.9m, compared to an adverse movement 
of £9.7m in the year to 31 December 2012. Additionally, an exceptional 
write off of financing costs amounting to £10.8m was recognised in 
the year, relating to debt issuance costs associated with the previous 
financing agreement. This compares to a £1.6m charge in the prior year. 
Profit before taxation
The Company made a profit before tax of £4.4m, compared to a prior 
year loss of £259.1m. Operating profit in the year was £96.3m due to 
the reasons outline above and net finance expense was £91.9m. The 
prior year loss of £259.1m was principally due to impairment charges 
associated with goodwill in the Bread division and the Hovis brand.
Taxation
The taxation credit for the year was £21.9m (31 December 2011: 
£29.1m). The rate of corporation tax for the year was 24.5%. The 
taxation credit during the year is principally a result of recognising a 
deferred tax asset for prior year tax losses.
The corporation tax rate for 2013 is expected to be 23.25%. The 
deferred tax rate is expected to be 21.0% for the tax year ending 5 April 
2014.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share of 11.0 pence for the year on continuing 
operations is calculated by dividing the profit attributed to ordinary 
shareholders of £26.3m (31 December 2011: £230.0m loss) by the 
weighted number of shares in issue during the year. This compares to a 
loss per share of 95.9p for the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share for continuing operations was 26.8 pence 
(31 December 2011: 22.3 pence). Adjusted earnings per share on 
continuing operations has been calculated by dividing the adjusted 
earnings (defined as Trading profit less net regular interest payable and 
notional taxation) attributed to ordinary shareholders of £85.2m (31 
December 2011: £72.6m) by the weighted number of ordinary shares 
in issue during each period. These earnings have been calculated by 
reflecting tax at a notional rate of 24.5% (31 December 2011: 26.5%).
At the Annual General Meeting held on 3 May 2012, a resolution was 
passed for a 10:1 share consolidation of the issued share capital of the 
Company. Accordingly, the weighted number of shares in issue for the 
period reduced from 2,398.0 million to 239.8 million; the latter being 
used for earnings per share calculations.

Financial review
Cash flow and borrowings
Company net borrowings as at 31 December 2012 were £950.7m, a 
decrease of £44.4m since 31 December 2011. Of the movement since 
31 December 2011, the cash and non-cash elements were £250.0m 
inflow and £205.6m outflow respectively. The non-cash movement 
principally reflects the conversion of the previous mark to market swap 
liabilities to additional term loan, which amounted to £188.1m.
The cash inflow from operating activities to 31 December 2012 was 
£4.2m (31 December 2011: outflow of £29.1m). This included cash 
inflow from continuing operations of £54.8m (31 December 2011: 
£134.6m) and cash inflow from discontinued operations of £1.6m (31 
December 2011: £47.9m outflow). Additionally, net cash interest paid 
was £52.5m (31 December 2011: £113.4m) due to lower bank margins 
following the re-financing agreement concluded in March 2012. Tax 
received in the year was £0.3m (31 December 2011: £2.4m paid).
Sale of subsidiaries and property, plant and equipment in the year 
amounted to £312.2m following the completed disposals outlined above. 
Net capital expenditure on tangible and intangible assets in the year 
was £66.4m (31 December 2011: £73.5m), of which £56.4m relates to 
Underlying business.
Net proceeds from borrowings and the debtors securitisation programme 
were £1.5m and £72.4m respectively, reflecting the conversion of the 
debtors securitisation programme to Net debt. Financing fees associated 
with the re-financing agreement in March 2012 were £24.0m.
Pension schemes
At 31 December 2012 the Company’s pension schemes under the IAS 
19 accounting valuation showed a gross deficit of £466.8m, compared 
to £282.4m at 31 December 2011. The valuation at 31 December 2012 
comprised a £131.6m deficit in respect of the RHM schemes and a 
deficit of £335.2m in relation to the Premier Foods schemes. 
The deficit increase reflects an increase in the scheme liabilities of 
£237.7m to £3,676.1m, partly offset by an increase in the valuation of 
assets of £53.3m to £3,209.3m. The adverse movement in liabilities is 
predominantly due a reduction in the discount rate from 4.80% at  
31 December 2011 to 4.45% at 31 December 2012. The increase in the 
valuation of the scheme assets is due to investment performance.
In 2012, the Group and trustees of the RHM Pension Scheme agreed 
to change the inflation assumption used in calculating certain scheme 
liabilities, for the majority of scheme members, from an RPI to CPI basis, 
following a similar move by the Premier Foods Schemes in 2011. The 
impact of this change was to reflect a credit of £44.0m, and is partially 
offset by an equalisation charge of £12.3m, resulting in a net credit of 
£31.7m.
Following the re-financing package concluded with the banking 
syndicate, swap counterparties and pension schemes in March 2012, 
pension deficit contribution payments were suspended from March 2012 
to December 2013; deficit contribution payments resume from January 
2014.
The next triennial actuarial valuation date of the pension schemes is on  
5 April 2013, the outcome of which is expected in early 2014.

Premier Foods Annual Report 2012-front.indd   37 15/03/2013   15:02:48 Chairman’s introduction
As highlighted earlier in this report, a lot has happened in 2012 as we have moved to stabilise and turnaround the business. At the same 
time, it is also important to ensure that sound governance principles underpin the way we operate, both at Board level and throughout the 
organisation. This section of the annual report sets out our governance framework, the work of our Committees and our Risk Management 
framework. We believe in transparency in governance and in maintaining the highest ethical standards in all our business dealings. As 
corporate governance continues to evolve, we will continue to monitor our procedures to respond to new issues and strive for best practice. 
Board changes
In addition to Gavin Darby’s appointment as Chief Executive in February 2013 there have been a number of changes to the Board over the 
course of 2012. Following Ronnie Bell’s retirement from the Board it was agreed that I would become Chairman to ensure continuity during the 
period of rapid change that the business is going through. Ian McHoul who has served on the Board for 8 years took over from me as Senior 
Independent Director. In addition, Louise Makin advised that she would be stepping down as a director at the end of her second 3 year term in 
September. I would like to thank both Ronnie and Louise for their contribution to the Company.
Following these changes the composition of the Board was carefully reviewed and it was agreed that it would be appropriate to appoint two new non-
executive directors. Jennifer Laing, who has extensive brand building and communications experience, joined the Board in October and Ian Krieger, who 
has considerable business and financial expertise having worked with a wide variety of companies throughout his finance career, was appointed as a 
director in November.
Geoff Eaton was appointed as Chief Operating Officer in October 2012. However, following the appointment of Gavin Darby a flatter executive 
management structure has been implemented, that will enable commercial and functional management to report directly to the CEO. As a 
consequence Geoff left the Company in February 2013.
Following these changes we now have in place a strong and effective Board. The Board is fully engaged and there is lively debate, and where 
necessary, robust challenge to management and the Group’s business plans. There is open and transparent dialogue between executive 
management and non-executive directors producing strong alignment on delivering the strategy and driving long term sustainable growth. 
There is now an appropriate combination of executive and non-executive directors on the Board with at least half the Board (excluding 
myself) comprising non-executive directors. The independence, external experience and challenge non-executive directors bring to the Board 
is essential to its effective operation. The current non-executive directors bring an extensive and broad ranging mix of experience which is 
highlighted in the biographies on pages 40 to 41. The Board considers that all the non-executive directors, with the exception of Charles Miller 
Smith, are independent in character and judgement. Charles Miller Smith, whilst fully independent of management, is a shareholder appointed 
director representing our largest shareholder, Warburg Pincus.
During October 2012 the number of non-executive directors temporarily fell below the required number. In addition the number of independent 
members of the Audit and Remuneration Committee fell from three members to two for a short period of time. Both were essentially timing 
issues during a period when the membership of the Board was being refreshed and were remedied with the appointment of Ian Krieger in 
November. Details of the executive director/non-executive director split can be found on page 44. 
Board effectiveness
The Board believes that keeping up-to-date with developments in corporate governance is important and therefore it is a regular item on the 
Board agenda. The General Counsel & Company Secretary prepares a regular Board paper and present updates on recent legal, regulatory 
and governance issues including relevant case law. During the year this has included updates on the government’s draft Remuneration 
Reporting Regulations and the FRC’s 2012 revisions to the UK Cororate Governance Code (“the Code”). 
The Board has a policy to conduct performance reviews on its own performance and that of its committees. Alongside this review each 
director receives an appraisal. Appraisals are conducted by the Chairman for the CEO and by the Senior Independent Director (following 
discussions with the other non-executive directors) for the Chairman.
In December 2011 one-to-one interviews were undertaken by the General Counsel & Company Secretary and a written report was presented 
to the Board. During the year, the Board has received updates on the progress made on the action plan for 2012 and is satisfied with the 
progress which has been made.
Changes to the Board process during the year have included strengthening communication and alignment between the Board and senior 
management with greater attendance of Group Executive members at Board meetings. The Board and Group Executive have also met a 
number of times over dinner to allow a more informal opportunity for discussion. There has also been an increased focus on brand strategy 
and I expect this to continue as priorities move from restructuring to growth. For 2013 a number of two day meetings have been introduced to 
allow more time to review the business in depth.

Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (“the Code”)
During 2012, except as highlighted above with regard to the temporary fall in the number of independent directors and the deferral of our 
external Board evaluation, the Company complied with all of the provisions of the Code. 
In September 2012 the FRC published changes to the Code (which will apply to the Company for the financial year ending 31 December 
2013) and companies are encouraged to consider early adoption of the new requirements. The Board is committed to good governance and 
we believe we are compliant with a number of the new requirements, namely: effectiveness of the external audit process; length of tenure of 
auditors; and Boardroom diversity.
Governance Focus: Code of Conduct
Q: What has the Company done to improve its 
governance structure during the year?
A. During 2012 we launched the Company’s first code of conduct 
(Code of Conduct) with the aim of communicating expected standards 
of behaviour, building a common sense of ethics and integrity, providing 
some practical guidance to all Premier Foods’ employees in the event 
of uncertainty, highlighting additional responsibilities of managers to 
uphold the Code of Conduct and helping to protect the Company’s 
external reputation and provide assurance to stakeholders.
We communicated the Code of Conduct via our internal intranet 
site, PremierNet, and management grades were asked to confirm 
their acceptance of the policy when logging onto their computers. 
Additionally printed copies were distributed to all staff and copies of 
the Code of Conduct are now included in induction materials for new 
staff. A copy of the Code of Conduct can be found on our website: 
www.premierfoods.co.uk/about-us/corporate-governance/code-
of-conduct.cfm
2012 Review
In line with the recommendations of the Code we conduct an annual effectiveness review and every three years this is conducted by an 
external firm. The last external review was undertaken in 2009 by Boardroom Review and we are therefore due to undertake another external 
review in respect of 2012. However, given the changes in Board membership over the last few months, the Board agreed to defer the 
evaluation exercise until the first half of 2013. This evaluation will be undertaken by an external facilitator.
Remuneration strategy
There was a significant vote against the Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2012. Over the course of the year David Wild (Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee) and myself have met with a number of major shareholders and investor representative bodies to listen to their views 
and explain the reasons behind the remuneration decisions we made in 2011 and 2012. These meetings were very constructive and we have 
continued to engage with stakeholders in 2013. A full review of our remuneration strategy is set out in the Remuneration report on page 56.
Audit independence and non-audit fees
The independence of the external audit is an essential element of our overall governance framework and allows shareholders to gain comfort 
that the financial statements give a fair and understandable view of the Group’s affairs and have been prepared in accordance with applicable 
standards. The Board is sensitive to investor body guidelines on non-audit fees; however, non-audit fees for 2012 have again been significant 
and have exceeded the audit fee. 
We believe it is important to recognise that Premier Foods is not a “steady state” company; but is in the process of a significant transformation. In 
2011 and 2012 this resulted in significant work being undertaken by PwC in respect of the Group’s re-financing and over the course of the year 
PwC have also been engaged to undertake working capital reports in connection with two Class 1 disposals which required shareholder approval.
The Audit Committee monitors non-audit spend closely in accordance with the Group’s internal policy and procedures. The Committee also 
received updates from the external audit’s lead partner on PwC’s internal controls to safeguard their independence. On this basis we remain 
satisfied that PwC were best placed to undertake the work, given the time constraints and the likely cost of the work and that the engagement 
of PwC for the non-audit work was in the best interests of shareholders. Additional safeguards to the independence of the auditors are given 
by the fact that in 2012 a new lead audit partner was appointed (as part of PwC’s normal rotation process) and that since 2011 there has been 
a complete change in the executive management team at the Company. Further disclosure on auditor independence and non-audit fees is set 
out on page 54. We believe that with the stabilisation of the business, the level of non- audit fees will reduce significantly going forward.

Q: What is the Company’s approach to diversity?
A: The Board aims to have at least two female Board directors by 2015. 
The Board believes in the importance of diversity in its widest sense and 
the benefits that it can bring to the operation of an effective Board. This 
is taken into account whenever a new appointment is undertaken with 
the aim to have individuals with a broad range of skills, backgrounds and 
experience reflecting both the type of industry and the geographical locations 
in which we operate. Since adopting this policy four additional appointments 
have been made to the Board: three male and one female. Following the 
departure of Geoff Eaton, female representation on the Board is currently 
13%.
We are also focusing on opportunities to drive gender diversity at 
levels below the Board, both within the organisation as a whole and 
particularly within senior management. During the year a number of 
appointments have been made to strengthen the Group’s capabilities 
particularly within the commercial team. This has resulted in an increase 
in female representation at the senior management level.

Q: Does the Chairman meet with the non-executive 
directors in the absence of the executive directors?
A: Yes, this is one of the Chairman’s responsibilities and is essential 
to maintain transparency and independence in the governance 
process. Over the course of the year the non-executive directors met 
independently on a regular basis both after Board meetings and also 
over dinner. Topics discussed included key strategic issues, succession 
planning, a review of key risks facing the business, Board effectiveness 
and a review of the external auditor’s performance. 
Q: What is the average length of time directors are 
appointed to the Board?
A: The Board believes it is important to maintain an appropriate 
balance between length of service, to ensure independent judgement, 
and an appropriate level of experience and skill. The Board regularly 
undertakes a review of succession plans for both executive and non-
executive directors with consideration of the need to refresh Board 
and Committee membership and the Board’s gender diversity targets. 
A succession plan is under consideration for Ian McHoul whose third 
term of appointment automatically expires in July 2013. As at year end 
the length of service of the current non-executive directors is shown in 
the graph below against the average length of service, which currently 
stands at  
three years.

Q: Does the Company offer the directors access 
to independent professional advice?
A: Yes, procedures are in place which allow directors to take 
independent professional advice in the course of their duties. In 
addition, all directors have access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel & Company Secretary. If any director were to have 
a concern over any unresolved business issue following professional 
advice, they are entitled to require the General Counsel & Company 
Secretary to minute that concern. Should they later resign over a 
concern, non-executive directors are asked to provide a written 
statement to the Chairman for circulation to the Board.
Q: How does the Board keep up-to-date with  
business developments?
A: The main source of information is via the Board pack provided to 
directors. These cover the following standing items which are designed 
to keep directors up to date with all material business developments:
•	 CEO introduction; 
•	 Commercial review of brand and sales; 
•	 Customer service levels; 
•	 H&S and employee issues; 
•	 Restructuring projects; 
•	 Capital expenditure; and 
•	 CFO report.
A detailed strategy review took place over a two day meeting in June 
and there was a comprehensive review of 2013 brand, sales and 
supply chain plans as part of the approval of the 2013 business plan in 
October and November 2012.
Q: What committees does the Board have?
A: The Board has three committees which assist in the discharge of its 
responsibilities: 
•	 Audit Committee;
•	 Nomination Committee; and
•	 Remuneration Committee.
A Finance Committee was established in 2011 to provide additional 
Board oversight of the Group’s financing arrangements. The Finance 
Committee met twice in 2012 and following the successful completion 
of the Group’s re-financing in March 2012 the Finance Committee was 
disbanded in April 2012.
In addition executive management are assisted by the work of the 
Group Executive and its sub-committees. Together these form part of 
the Company’s corporate governance framework, but are not formally 
appointed committees of the Board.
Group Executive Committee— Responsible under the leadership 
of Gavin Darby for the day-to-day management of the business, 
setting performance targets and implementing the Group’s strategy 
and direction as determined by the Board. The Committee is also 
responsible for the effective implementation of policies taking into 
account changes in regulations and other business risks. The 
Committee drives effective risk management throughout the business 
and makes recommendations to the Audit Committee as appropriate; 
monitoring and reporting on all material business risks which might 
impact the delivery of the Group’s strategic goals and objectives; and 
agreeing with management appropriate mitigating actions.
Members of the Committee include Gavin Darby, Mark Moran and 
members of the Group Executive.
Sustainability Steering Group — Responsible for providing direction 
to, and oversight of, the implementation of the Group’s sustainability 
programme which is built around the five core themes, these being; 
Buying Responsibly, Sustainable Manufacturing, Nutrition & Quality, 
Our People and Giving. Its objective is to identify and mitigate, both 
environmental and social risks in order to protect and enhance the 
Group’s reputation and build trust amongst its many stakeholders. The 
Sustainability Steering Group is made up of members from the Group 
Executive and senior operational management.
Treasury Risk Management Committee — Responsible for the 
oversight of designated material foreign currency and commodity 
exposures and agreeing with senior management appropriate mitigating 
actions. Members of the committee include members of the Group 
Executive and senior operational management.

Q: What are the Board’s responsibilities for  
Risk Management?
A: Effective risk management is integral to the achievement of 
the Group’s strategic objectives. The Group has a well established 
governance structure which was operated throughout 2012 that 
identifies and monitors the key risks, puts in place mitigating activities 
and reports on their effectiveness.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for ensuring that business risks 
are effectively managed. The Board has considered and approved 
the risk management policy, the risk appetite of the Group and has 
delegated the review of the risk management process to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee receives regular reports from 
management, internal and external auditors, detailing the effectiveness 
of our internal controls applied to the relevant risk and any required 
remedial actions along with an update on their implementation.
The day to day risk management is the responsibility of senior 
management as part of their everyday business processes and is 
underpinned by the Group’s policies and procedures to ensure this is 
fully embedded. There is a structured business review process that 
operates across all business areas which ultimately reports to the 
Board and this along with the corporate governance framework further 
underpins the ongoing management of risk.
Q: What are the aims of the internal  
control system?
A: The internal control system provides senior management with an 
ongoing process for the identification, evaluation and management of 
the risks that could impact on the fulfilment of the Group’s business 
objectives. The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate risk 
and provides reasonable but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The system also supports senior management’s 
decision making processes improving the reliability of business 
performance.
Q: How is the Group’s internal audit  
programme decided?
A: The Audit Committee meets annually to review and approve the 
internal audit programme for the year. The Committee reviews progress 
against the plan on a quarterly basis considering the adequacy of audit 
resource, the results of audit findings and any changes in business 
circumstances which may require additional audits.
Q: How are internal controls monitored?
A: Annually comprehensive internal control assessment questionnaires 
are submitted by senior management from all areas of the Group. 
These give an assessment of the effectiveness of controls to mitigate 
key risks to an acceptable level. The results of these assessments  
are reviewed by executive management and presented to the  
Audit Committee. 
The results of internal audits are reported to the Group Executive and 
senior management and where required corrective actions are agreed. 
The results of all audits are summarised for the Audit Committee 
meetings along with progress against agreed actions.
Q: Does the Board conduct an annual review of 
internal controls?
A: In accordance with the Turnbull Guidance an annual review of 
internal controls is conducted. The Board has delegated authority to 
the Audit Committee to regularly monitor internal controls and conduct 
the full annual review. This review covers all material controls such as 
financial, operational and compliance, and also the risk management 
system in place throughout the year under review up to the date of the 
annual report. The Committee reports the results of this review to the 
Board for discussion and agreement on the actions required to address 
any material control weaknesses. 
Q: What financial reporting controls are in place?
A: The Group maintains a strong system of accounting and financial 
management controls.
Our accounting controls ensure data in the Group’s financial statements 
is reconciled to the underlying financial systems. A review of the data 
is undertaken to ensure that the true position of the Group is reflected, 
through compliance with approved accounting practices.
The Group has a dedicated team of finance managers aligned to 
business areas, supported by systems to provide the best available 
decision making information to management on an ongoing basis. 
This is reflected in an annual budgeting process, monthly management 
reporting and ongoing investment appraisal.

Q: Does the Group have a formal risk  
management process?
A: The Group operates a formal risk management process designed 
to provide assurance to the Board and support the executive and 
senior management in identifying and mitigating the key risks facing the 
business on an ongoing basis.
There are four key elements to the process; 
1. The executive’s collective top down review of risks, facilitated by the 
Director of Internal Audit and Risk creating the corporate risk register; 
2.  The bottom up view of risk is determined by management for each 
key business area supported by a member of the Group Executive.
Both elements above are captured in risk registers and for each risk 
identified an owner assigned, mitigating actions are developed and 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
3.  Appropriate operational procedures and controls have been put in 
place to mitigate these risks and all employees are provided with 
appropriate information training and supervision; and
4.  Our control environment is regularly audited by internal audit, third 
parties with specific experience in systems, (e.g. health & safety food 
hygiene requirements) and by our external auditors.  
The Group Executive provide the link between the Corporate and 
individual risk registers ensuring that a consistent view is maintained 
and major risks to the business are appropriately identified. This is 
reviewed as a standing item in the monthly Group Executive meetings.
The corporate risk register is presented to the Audit Committee for 
consideration on behalf of the Board twice per annum. Included within 
this review is a session of the non-executive directors without the 
presence of management but including both the Director of Internal 
Audit and Risk and the external audit partner. The purpose of this 
session is to provide additional challenge to the internal risk process. 
The Audit Committee also review the effectiveness of the controls 
designed to mitigate the risks identified through the activities of the 
various audit functions.
Q: What are the current principal risks facing  
the Group and what actions have been taken to 
manage them?
A: The business monitors and manages the principal (high Gross) 
risks facing the business. Over the page we highlight these risks, what 
activity we have in place to mitigate them, as well as those activities 
that we have completed in order to reduce the risk to an acceptable 
level.
Risk Management
Case study  — Managing Business Separation Risk
We have undertaken a significant number of business disposals amounting to £369.5m in value in 2012. This will allow the business to focus 
on its core Power Brands and also aids business simplification and drives the reduction in overhead costs. The disposals involve complex 
transitional services between the Company and buyer to ensure an orderly separation of the business. To manage this effectively we have 
established a dedicated project team involving Sales, Finance, Technical, Logistics, Procurement, ISC and HR. This ensures that orders, 
production and delivery standards are maintained for our customers. Transitional arrangement typically involve 3 phases.
sCoping – pre signing
Initial process to understand potential 
separation complexities with the disposal 
and agreeing the approach with the 
business. Working with the purchaser to 
establish likely requirements for assistance 
during the transitional service and 
designing detailed service scope, duration 
and costs which complement their existing 
infrastructure.
pro Cess Design – post signing
Establishing a joint steering team to manage 
the process for both parties and jointly agree 
and design operational processes to support 
the transitional services. This is the critical 
phase and a single disposal can involve over 
120 specific process designs. Service users 
are provided with comprehensive training 
to ensure seamless business as usual 
operation from day 1. 
transitional serviCes –  
post C ompletion
Operation of transitional services begins 
on a business as usual basis. We jointly 
execute plans with the buyer and monitor 
progress against plan. We work with the 
buyer to agree the approach and timing 
of the final separation and ensure this 
is communicated and coordinated with 
customers and suppliers.

Risk Management
Business Strategy and reliance on business recovery
1. Power Brands and restructuring
Risk
The Group has strategically focused on its eight Power Brands which 
management believes has the strongest potential for long term sustainable 
growth. This strategy relies on simplification and cost saving initiatives to improve 
the underlying performance of the business. All or any of these initiatives may 
fail to improve performance and consequently have an adverse impact on the 
Group’s financial position.
Mitigation 
The strategy is clear and a strong management team is in place to execute it. 
There is continuous review of progress against key milestones and regular 
engagement with all stakeholders.
Trading
2. Market place risks 3. Changes in the cost and availability of raw materials
Risk
The Group operates in a highly competitive environment, exacerbated by 
continued difficult general economic conditions, and in fast moving sectors of the 
food industry. 
If we are unable to respond to consequent changes in consumer requirements 
on price or quality, the demands of our customers in supporting our products 
with sales and marketing spend and the reactions of our competitors on 
innovation and profitability this could adversely impact the Group’s performance. 
Risk 
The Group purchases its raw materials, many of which are commodities, from 
numerous suppliers and many of these raw materials are subject to potentially 
significant price fluctuations. If the costs of raw materials were to rise and 
the Group was unable to absorb/mitigate or pass such increases on to its 
customers in full or in a timely manner, then its operating profits and cash flow 
would be adversely affected. If the supply of any of the Group’s raw materials 
is constrained for any reason this could also have an adverse impact on the 
business.
Mitigation
For the consumer the Group will focus on brand differentiation, demonstrating 
quality, taste and more convenient packaging. We will drive investment in new 
product development, where we have a good track record, anticipating 10% 
of sales in FY13 from this activity. We regularly monitor consumer trends and 
consumption habits to inform this activity. We will focus our marketing activity in 
support of our core brands. 
With our customers we will use our new organisation structures in sales and 
marketing to continue to work collaboratively with appropriate strategies for each 
channel. With the major retailers we develop joint business plans aligning our 
pricing and promotional activities.
We will maintain our competitiveness through our restructuring of the Group, in 
FY12 we announced ongoing annual costs savings exceeding £40m. In FY13 we 
will focus on the supply chain within the Bread division and continue to challenge 
costs throughout the business. 
Mitigation
We have experienced continued inflation in raw materials throughout FY12. 
However our targeted forward buying of products through the centralised 
procurement function has effectively managed our exposure to these increases. 
We have also used our supplier relationships to manage our raw materials supply 
protecting quality whilst effectively managing cost. We will continue with this 
effective approach through FY13. 
Financing
4. Banking covenants 5. Pensions liability
Risk
The Group continues to operate with a high level of debt (£0.9bn) and is subject 
to operating within banking covenants set out in its re-financing agreement 
agreed with its bank syndicate in March 2012. This includes net debt/EBITDA 
and EBITDA/interest covenant tests. In the event these covenants are not met 
then the Group would be in breach of its financing agreement and, as would be 
the case in any covenant breach, the banking syndicate could withdraw their 
funding to the Group.
In addition to covenant compliance the Group must ensure that it manages its 
liquidity such that it has sufficient funds to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Company does not pay dividends and this is a restriction under the terms of 
its financing arrangements. The Group is also restricted from raising additional 
forms of debt finance (other than a basket of c.£20m) and is not able to use free 
cash flow for acquisitions.
Risk 
The Group supports three defined benefit pension schemes in the UK. All three 
schemes have significant technical funding deficits which could have an adverse 
impact on the financial condition of the Group. The level of deficit fluctuates 
with changes to the underlying assumptions in calculating both the assets and 
the liabilities of the schemes. Adverse movements in these assumptions could 
impact on the level of deficit.
Mitigation
The Group successfully finalised financing arrangements in March 2012 which 
will provide funding until June 2016. The Group achieved its trading expectations 
for FY12, its lender agreed divestment programme and successfully implemented 
a debtor securitisation program to provide additional funding and liquidity. 
The Group reviews it’s performance on an ongoing basis and formally tests and 
reports on covenant compliance to the Group’s banking syndicate every six 
months as well as providing forecast covenant compliance tests twice a year. 
In the event of a forecast covenant breach the Group would seek a covenant 
waiver or amendment from its banking syndicate, which it could obtain with a 
two-thirds majority vote.
The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance 
functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly basis, 
normally covering a period of three months. In addition, cash flow forecasts are 
prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and forecasting processes and 
performance is monitored against this each month.
Mitigation
Funding agreements have been reached with the trustees of the pension 
schemes which coupled with the changes to the schemes in the prior year 
mitigate our exposure in FY13. The Group continues to monitor the pension risks 
closely working with the trustees to ensure a collaborative approach.

Industry Risks
6. Health & safety 7. Food regulation
Risk
By the nature of production and warehouse environments the Group carries 
a level of intrinsic risk from these activities. The Group is subject to legislation 
and regulations in the UK with respect to the health & safety of its employees, 
permanent contractors and visitors. Violations of such laws could lead to 
significant fines and imprisonment of its directors.
Risk 
As a food manufacturer, the Group is subject to legislation and regulations in 
relation to food and its production. Violations of any laws could result in fines and 
sanctions as well as reputational risk with consumers and customers. Should 
any product contamination occur, it could lead to product recalls or liabilities to 
customers or consumers. Health scares can significantly impact demand for 
certain foods.
Mitigation
The Group maintains an excellent health & safety record by constantly re-
enforcing high standards of protection and creating a culture that ensures all 
personnel on site are made acutely aware of risks and procedures designed 
to mitigate them. Each site retains responsibility for its own health & safety 
supported by central co-ordination of monitoring and reporting and a training 
and education program. Through our Total Observation Process (TOPs) we make 
health & safety an inherent part of each employee’s day to day responsibility.
Mitigation
The Group has developed and implemented a policy to ensure that its entire 
business understand and comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Group 
has an excellent food safety record and continues to focus on high levels of 
operational control and continued improvement in all related areas. We have a 
leading technical function which sets high standards for hygiene and product 
quality, and these processes are subject to internal review and frequent external 
monitoring.
Employee motivation and retention Business separation
8. Management and employee motivation and retention 9. Business disposals
Risk
The level of restructuring experienced by the Group has been significant 
over the past two years. Poor management of this restructuring and lack 
of effective succession plans could lead to a loss of critical knowledge and 
a lack of continuity damaging our operating performance. In addition poor 
employee engagement could adversely impact our ongoing change programme. 
Degradation of our control processes due to a lapse in management controls 
could lead to reputational damage to the business as well as financial loss 
suffered through areas such as breaches, bribery and corruption or unfair 
competition regulations.
Risk 
Our business disposals have involved complex transitional service arrangements 
between the company and respective buyers to ensure an orderly separation 
over a 6 to 12 month period. These arrangements include us providing 
indemnities and warranties in favour of the purchasers which if breached 
may result in financial claims against the Group, and continuing to service 
customer needs in various product categories for the period of transition. Poor 
management of these activities could result in financial loss and reputational 
damage with our customers.
Mitigation
We have put in place a program of communication covering our vision, values 
and behaviours as well as clearly re-enforcing our strategy to our employees. 
Our restructuring has been managed in a manner which treats those impacted 
with respect, has ensured appropriate compensation and support in areas 
such as outplacement advice whilst also ensuring that those individuals who 
we wish to retain in the business to drive and deliver our strategy understand 
and are enthused about their new or ongoing roles. We continue to provide all 
our employees with learning and development opportunities supported with an 
ongoing personal performance management process. We have implemented 
a policy and relevant procedures to deal with the requirements of the Bribery 
Act 2010. These are regularly communicated and in FY13 we will conduct a full 
review of the effectiveness of this process.
Mitigation
We have established dedicated project teams drawn from various functions 
of the business to manage these transitional arrangements to ensure that 
orders, production and delivery standards are maintained to our customers. We 
have placed a significant emphasis on ensuring the arrangements have been 
properly scoped and designed working with the buyer in joint steering teams. 
We have developed joint operating plans with the buyers and ensured these are 
communicated and co-ordinated with customers and suppliers. 
Our legal team have a good record of transactional management and in each 
sale have undertaken an appropriately thorough disclosure process and 
negotiated robust legal documentation to mitigate the risks of claims from the 
purchasers.
Systems infrastructure Communication
10. Systems infrastructure 11. External communications
Risk
Disruption to systems as a result of new implementations, natural disasters, 
systems failures or breaches in systems security may result in a significant loss of 
operation or of competitive advantage. Breaches in systems security could also 
result in breaches of data protection regulation.
Risk
If the Group does not effectively communicate with its external audiences, 
shareholders, analysts, our financing partners, customers, suppliers and the 
media it may impact on our share price or result in reputational damage. 
Mitigation
During the course of our core systems implementation, the majority of which is 
now complete, we have developed a well established and tested implementation 
process which will be applied to the few remaining areas of the business. We 
have in place a robust disaster recovery process which is regularly tested 
and the lessons learnt incorporated into our procedures. The Group operates 
an IT governance framework including relevant policies, has put in place 
a management structure to effectively monitor systems performance with 
structured change management, systems lifecycle and capacity planning. We 
also have a dedicated systems access process which is managed within our IT 
function but also works in conjunction with the business to ensure appropriate 
controls are maintained to minimise the risks of unauthorised access.
Mitigation
The Group has a dedicated in-house Corporate Affairs department and a 
professional PR agency who work with management and the Group Executive 
to ensure all external communications are appropriately addressed. All significant 
corporate communications are reviewed by the Group Executive and where 
appropriate by the Board prior to release.

RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Q: How does the Company engage with  
shareholders?
A: An important role of the Board is to represent and promote the 
interests of its shareholders as well as being accountable to them for 
the performance and activities of the Group.
The Board believes it is very important to engage with its shareholders 
and does this in a number of ways through presentations, conference 
calls, investor roadshows, face-to-face meetings and the AGM. 
Following the announcement of the Group’s half year and year-
end results, presentations are made to analysts, banks and major 
shareholders to update them on the progress the Group has made 
towards its goals and invite them to ask questions. 
Currently around eight sell-side research analysts publish research on 
the Group. Full details on results presentations, RNS releases, interim 
management statements and conference calls are available on the 
Group’s website:
www.premierfoods.co.uk/investor-relations/
The Company Chairman and Senior Independent Director speak 
with major shareholders on a regular basis and brief the Board to 
ensure that they are aware of the views of shareholders. In addition 
meetings were held over the year with many of the Company’s largest 
shareholders as part of a review of Remuneration arrangements (see 
page 56 for further information).
The main channel of communication to institutional investors is through 
the CEO, CFO and Head of Investor Relations. The CEO and CFO are 
available to meet with shareholders during the year; the Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director are also available to discuss any issues 
and concerns of shareholders and welcome questions posed to the 
Board and committees. 
Q: How does the Company engage with other 
stakeholders?
A: The Company holds meetings throughout the year with key 
stakeholders.
Pensions
The Group has established a Pensions Liaison Forum which meets 
quarterly. This is attended by the CFO, General Counsel & Company 
Secretary, Group Pension Manager and Chairmen of the Group’s 
pension schemes. The CEO attends the Forum twice yearly. The Forum 
discusses and develops funding and investment strategies for the 
Group’s pension schemes and any other pension issues that might 
impact the schemes and/or the Group.
Banks
Members of the Group Executive hold regular meetings with the 
Company’s banking syndicate to update them on the Group’s financial 
performance and management were able to confirm the completion of 
the planned divestiture programme at the end of 2012, well in advance 
of the June 2014 timetable.
Suppliers
The Group holds a conference with the Group’s leading suppliers on an 
annual basis which is attended by executive directors and members of 
the Group Executive. This is an opportunity to update suppliers on the 
Group’s strategy and growth plans. Due to the focus on the Group’s 
restructuring during 2012, no supplier conference was held; however a 
conference is being planned for 2013.
Sustainability
We work with a number of Government departments, non-ministerial 
Government departments (such as the Food Standards Agency) and 
other regulatory agencies as well as trade associations (such as the 
Food and Drink Federation). We engage with these bodies in order to 
identify and understand key issues facing the food industry and listen to 
their opinions and guidance — all of which helps to inform our internal 
policy making.
Q: How is the Board updated on the latest  
shareholder information?
A: The Board receive a detailed investor relations update at each 
Board meeting which covers (amongst other things) share price 
movements, shareholder register movements, analyst reports, a 
summary of investor meetings and other recent activity. The Board 
also receives comprehensive feedback from the Company’s brokers, 
following investor roadshows after half year and year-end results.

Corporate Governance Committees
Over the course of the year there have been a number of significant 
one off items which have required careful consideration by the 
Committee to ensure that the appropriate accounting treatment 
has been adopted and that clear disclosure has been given in the 
financial statements.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
Ian McHoul
Senior Independent Director/Chairman  
of the Audit Committee
The Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the Group’ s website: 
www.premierfoods.co.uk/about-us/corporate-governance
The Committee has responsibility, on behalf of the Board, for reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s financial reporting systems and the 
internal control policies and procedures for the identification, assessment 
and reporting of risk. The Committee also keeps under review the 
relationship with the external auditors, including the terms of their 
engagement and fees, their independence and expertise, resources and 
qualification, and the effectiveness of the audit process.
Q: Who is on the Audit Committee and how  
frequently did they meet in 2012?
A: The Committee held four scheduled meetings in the year and an 
additional meeting was convened for specific business. The Committee 
met with the internal and external auditors on two occasions in the year 
without the presence of management. The Committee members are set 
out in the table below, together with detail of their meeting attendance 
during the year.

Ian McHoul and Ian Krieger both have recent and relevant financial 
experience, Mr McHoul as the Chief Financial Officer of AMEC plc 
and Mr Krieger as Vice-Chairman of Deloitte until his retirement in 
2012. David Beever was also a member of the Committee until June 
2012, however, following his appointment as Chairman it is no longer 
considered appropriate for him to be a member, although he will still 
attend meetings by invitation.
In addition to the Committee members, the following individuals are 
regularly invited to the Committee’s meetings; the CFO, Director of 
Internal Audit and Risk, External Audit Lead Partner and CEO. The 
General Counsel & Company Secretary attends in his capacity as 
Secretary of the Committee.
Q: What is the role of the Committee?
A: The Committee has been delegated authority by the Board to:
•	 Monitor financial reporting, including the annual and interim reports, 
preliminary results announcements and formal announcements 
relating to financial performance and reporting;
•	 Ensure the effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and risk 
management systems;
•	 Review and update the whistleblowing arrangements;
•	 Monitor and review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit 
function, including the approval of any appointment or removal of 
the head of the internal audit and risk function;
•	 Consider and make recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of external auditors 
including the setting of their remuneration; 
•	 Review the external auditors’ independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit processes. 
Q: Who are the Group’s auditors and how long 
have they held office?
A: Since the Company was listed on the London Stock Exchange 
in July 2004 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) have been the 
Group’s auditors. Following revisions to the Code in 2012, going 
forward large listed companies will be required to put an external audit 
contract out to tender every ten years or explain why it has not. 
The external auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years and a 
new lead audit partner was appointed in 2012. The FRC’s transitional 
arrangements guidance suggest that if an audit partner rotation has 
recently occurred, it may be appropriate for a listed company to 
conduct its next audit tender towards the end of the current audit 
partner rotation, i.e. in 2017. There are no contractual obligations 
restricting the Group’s choice of external auditors.

Committees
Q: How does the Committee monitor the  
effectiveness of the external auditor?
A: Annually the Committee reviews the relationship the Group has 
with PwC. The review is conducted by a questionnaire addressed 
to key management following the year end audit. The responses are 
collated and reviewed by the company secretariat and the results are 
categorised, prioritised and presented to the Committee for their review. 
While there were no significant failings or weaknesses identified in the 
external audit process for 2012, there were areas where improvement 
could be made and these recommendations were included in the 2012 
external audit plan. The Committee conducted a follow up review and 
was satisfied that the recommendations had been addressed following 
the half year audit process.
For the year ended 31 December 2012 the Committee was satisfied 
with the effectiveness of the external auditor. At the 2013 AGM 
the re-election of PwC as the Group’s auditors will be proposed to 
shareholders.
Q: What non-audit services were provided by the 
Group’s auditors during the year?
A: There is an established policy governing the engagement of 
PwC for non-audit services designed to ensure that any non-audit 
services provided do not impair the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditors. The policy includes a fee limit for the provision 
of non-audit services; above which a formal tender process must 
normally be undertaken. During the year PwC was engaged to provide 
advice on the re-financing agreement and working capital statements 
in connection with two disposals. The Committee regularly reviews 
the level of non-audit fees throughout the year. The Committee also 
received an update from the external auditors lead partner on their 
internal controls to safeguard their independence.
Before commissioning PwC to undertake this work the Committee 
reviewed the proposal in detail with both management and PwC to 
assess any potential threat to their independence. The Committee is 
aware of, and sensitive to, investor body guidelines on non-audit fees. 
However, given the nature of work required in connection with the 
re-financing of the Group in 2011/2012 and subsequent disposals it 
was assessed that PwC were best placed to perform these additional 
services in view of their knowledge of the business, the time constraints 
in completing the work and the likely cost. 
Following the signing of the re-financing package in March 2012 
and early completion of the planned disposals programme, the 
Committee believe the level of non-audit fees will be significantly lower 
in the current financial year and within a level acceptable to investor 
guidelines. As at the date of this report PwC have not been engaged to 
undertake any further non-audit work. 
Q: What significant issues did the Committee  
discuss during the year?
A: During the year the Committee:
•	 Considered a number of key accounting matters including matters 
relating to pensions, accounting for disposals and impairment;
•	 Received regular reports from the internal audit function, 
ensured it was adequately resourced, monitored its activities and 
effectiveness, and agreed the annual internal audit plan; 
•	 Conducted a review of the effectiveness of the internal control 
system including Internal Control Self Assessments;
•	 Agreed the appointment of a new Director of Internal Audit  
and Risk;
•	 Reviewed operational accounting issues including the shared 
service centre in Manchester, the processes for reviewing and 
recovering commercial debtors and the control and accounting for 
inventory;
•	 Received updates on the Group’s whistleblowing arrangements;
•	 Reviewed the non-audit services spend and approved the 
engagement of PwC as an adviser in relation to disposal projects;
•	 Conducted an internal review of the Group’s external auditors 
which included a review of the auditors’ independence, objectivity 
and the effectiveness of the audit process; and
•	 Considered the external auditors’ report for the year ended  
31 December 2011 and recommended the reappointment of the 
external auditors.
Going concern
The Group entered into a revised facility agreement in March 2012 which 
provides financing to 2016. There are a number of covenants to which 
the Group must adhere including financial measures and an undertaking 
to generate disposal proceeds of £330m by 30 June 2014 (which has 
been met). The Committee regularly monitors covenant and liquidity 
headroom in light of trading performance and the potential impact of a 
range of downside scenarios. The assessment of going concern also 
takes into account the work undertaken by PwC as part of the working 
capital exercise for the disposal circulars that were sent to shareholders 
in 2012. The Group’s auditors are also required to form their own 
assessment of going concern as part of their ongoing audit work. 
Following review the Committee is satisfied with the going concern basis 
of preparation.

Committees
There have been a number of changes in the Board’s composition 
in 2012 and I am delighted that Jennifer Laing and Ian Krieger have 
joined the Board as non-executive directors to ensure we maintain 
an appropriate balance of skills, experience and independence on 
the Board.
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
David Beever
Non-executive Chairman/Chairman  
of the Nomination Committee
The Committee’ s terms of reference are available on the Group’ s website: 
www.premierfoods.co.uk/about-us/corporate-governance
The Committee is responsible for considering the size, structure and 
composition of the Board, retirement and appointment of additional 
directors, and making appropriate recommendations so as to maintain 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience on the Board. The 
Committee reviews the succession requirements of the Board and senior 
management (including the need for diversity) on an annual basis and 
makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate.
Q: Who is on the Nomination Committee and how 
frequently did they meet in 2012?
A: The Committee held six scheduled meetings during the year. The 
Committee members are set out in the below table, together with detail

  Ian McHoul missed the November 2012 Committee meeting due to a business 
commitment with AMEC plc.
Q: What is the role of the Committee?
A: The Committee has been delegated authority by the Board to:
•	 Lead the formal, rigorous and transparent process for Board 
appointments including a review of the skills, experience and 
knowledge of the existing directors to ensure any potential 
shortlisted candidates will benefit the balance of the Board;
•	 Give full consideration to succession planning taking into account 
the challenges and opportunities facing the Group and what skills 
and expertise would benefit the Board in the future; 
•	 Regularly review the structure, size and composition (including 
independence, knowledge, diversity) of the Board and make 
recommendations to the Board regarding changes; and
•	 Agree the job specification for the Chairman, including an 
assessment of the time commitment expected, recognising the 
need for availability in the event of a crisis.
Q: What key issues did the Committee discuss 
during the year?
A: As highlighted on page 38 there have been a number of changes 
to the Board in 2012 and most significantly the appointment of a new 
CEO in January 2013. Following Ronnie Bell’s decision to step down 
as Chairman in June 2012, the composition of the Board was reviewed 
and a number of appointments made to ensure orderly succession 
planning and that the balance of skills on the Board was refreshed. As 
required by good governance, Ronnie Bell did not participate in the 
process to appoint his successor.
Changes in the year included the appointment of myself as Chairman, 
the appointment of Jennifer Laing and Ian Krieger as non-executive 
directors. The Committee also reviewed the appointment of Geoff 
Eaton as Chief Operating Officer and in 2013 the appointment of Gavin 
Darby as Chief Executive Officer. External search agencies were used 
for all appointments to ensure that a rigorous and transparent process 
was undertaken. These agencies were independent of the Company 
and their engagement was conducted on an arms length basis.
In addition the Committee reviewed the talent management process 
and succession plans for each member of the Group Executive.
As noted earlier a succession plan is under consideration for Ian 
McHoul whose third term of appointment automatically expires in July 
2013.

Chairman of the Nomination Committee
Premier Foods Annual Report 2012-front.indd   55 15/03/2013   15:03:01 David Wild
Chairman of the  
Remuneration  
Committee
“over the last few months we have met with our 
key shareholders to listen to their views, explain the 
remuneration decisions we made in 2012 and outline 
our proposals for 2013.”
Dear Shareholder
This is my first report as Chair of the Remuneration Committee having served as a member since March 2011. We have made a number of 
significant decisions as a result of recent Board changes and an overview of these are set out below. The Committee’s overall remuneration 
strategy remains broadly unchanged and recognises the complexity of the business, the challenges it faces and the need for executive 
directors with significant experience to continue the business turnaround. Our focus is on rewarding performance – the majority of executive 
remuneration (approximately 70%) is variable and only payable if demanding performance targets are met. These performance targets are 
firmly linked to our strategy and ultimately aligned with shareholders’ interests in delivering earnings growth and improved shareholder value in 
the medium term. 
CEO change and implications for Remuneration
As indicated in the Chairman’s statement on page 10 on 28 January 2013 we announced a change of Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Michael 
Clarke, having delivered the initial turnaround of the Company and positioned the Company for future sustainable growth, indicated to the 
Board that he wished to pursue other business opportunities. 
The Board was pleased to announce the appointment of Gavin Darby in succession to Michael Clarke. He has a strong background in 
consumer goods and an exceptional management track record. The remuneration package that we have agreed reflects his experience and 
was necessary to secure an individual with his talent.
Michael Clarke’s arrangements
•	 He will be employed by the Company to ensure a smooth transition until 30 June 2013. During this time he will receive his salary, benefits 
and a cash allowance in lieu of pension. No payment will be made in respect of the unexpired portion of his notice period.
•	 No bonus will be payable in respect of the period of 2013 that he works. His 2012 award under the Premier Foods Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) of 1,304,347 shares issued in March 2012 will lapse on 30 June 2013.
•	 He was given two deferred awards in 2012 in recognition of bonuses/incentives forfeited from his previous employer. The first of these 
awards comprising 500,000 shares and a cash payment of £241,500 has vested and will remain exercisable for 12 months. The second of 
these awards comprising 375,000 shares and a cash payment of £181,125 will lapse.
•	 He earned a bonus equivalent to 100% of salary for 2012 (out of a maximum bonus opportunity of 150% of salary); this amounts to 
£750,000. The performance targets for 2012 contained two elements specific to him to reflect the challenges facing the business: firstly 
50% relating to the re-financing of the Company and; secondly 50% relating to various financial targets and other strategic measures.  
The Committee considered that the completion of the re-financing in March 2012 was of critical importance to the business, protecting  
the interests of all stakeholders and providing the necessary space for the business to execute its turnaround plans. It was agreed that  
this element had been fully achieved. In addition it was agreed that he had successfully delivered on a range of key strategic priorities in  
the year and therefore one third of the second element of the performance condition had been met. 
•	 No other payments will be made.

Remuneration report
PART 1: UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The directors’ remuneration report provides information on the Group’s overall remuneration strategy as well as detailed disclosure of directors’ 
remuneration and long-term incentive arrangements. A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Company’s 2013 AGM inviting them to approve 
this report.
Premier Foods Annual Report 2012-front.indd   56 15/03/2013   15:03:01 Gavin Darby’s arrangements
Gavin Darby’s remuneration reflects the calibre of the individual the Board has recruited.
•	 Annual base salary of £700,000, to be reviewed in April 2015, has been set at a level below that of his predecessor.
•	 Cash allowance in lieu of pension (due to the restrictions of the Lifetime Allowance) of 20% of base salary.
•	 Annual bonus opportunity of 150% of salary, 75% payable in cash and 25% in shares.  Payment of the bonus will be dependent on the 
following conditions:
 — Half of the bonus will be dependent on performance against turnover, gross profit, trading profit and cashflow targets subject to 
achievement of a threshold level of trading profit.  
 — One third will be dependent on the achievement of short and medium term strategic objectives which are specific to his role as 
CEO, subject to achievement of a threshold level of trading profit. For 2013 the Remuneration Committee has determined that these 
objectives include Power Brand development, defining a strategic plan for Bread and delivery of cost reduction plans.
 — The remaining one sixth will be dependent on personal performance focused on the creation of a cohesive high performing leadership 
team and the development of effective relationships with key stakeholders.
•	 Annual grant of shares with a face value of 200% of salary under the Premier Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan subject to the same 
conditions as for the other executive director. For 2013 the award will be dependent on the Company’s average Total Shareholder Return 
over the three months following the announcement of the 2015 results and the adjusted EPS achieved for the 2015 financial year. These 
measures were used for 2012, however, the Remuneration Committee has decided that for 2013, as it is critical that executives should be 
focused on improving the Company’s share price, the weighting applied to each measure should be altered so that two-thirds of the award 
will be dependent on absolute TSR performance and one-third on adjusted EPS performance. The precise targets are set out on page 62. 
Adjusted EPS and absolute share price performance are considered the most appropriate measures of the Company’s performance by 
reflecting profitability as well as measuring the recovery in the Company’s share price.
•	 It was agreed that on appointment Gavin Darby would acquire shares in the Company worth 100% of his salary and on 21 February 2013 
he acquired 750,268 shares. In return it was agreed that the Company would make a matching award of shares to him worth 200% of his 
salary (the Co-investment award). This enables Gavin to satisfy the Company’s share ownership guidelines at the start of his appointment 
and aligns his personal interests with shareholders’ interest from early in his tenure to focus on delivering share price growth. A third of these 
matching shares will vest on each of the first, second and third anniversaries, subject to a bonus having been paid for the relevant financial 
year and continued employment. These shares will vest in specified circumstances or on a change of control. Further details of the Co-
investment award are set out on page 62.
David Beever
Mr Beever was appointed as Chairman in June 2012, having served as a non-executive director since 2008 and as Senior Independent 
Director from April 2011. His fee has been agreed as £265,000 which reflects the significant time commitment required to fulfil the role.
Engagement with shareholders
There was a significant vote against the Remuneration Report at the AGM in 2012 and it was therefore important for me to meet with our key 
shareholders to listen to their concerns and also explain the reasons behind the remuneration decisions we made in 2011 and 2012. As a result 
I held a number of meetings with both shareholders and investor representative bodies over the course of 2012 which were very constructive. 
We have continued this dialogue with shareholders in 2013 to discuss remuneration arrangements for Gavin Darby and also our plans for the 
coming year. 
Remuneration strategy and proposals for 2013
The strategy and structure of remuneration is broadly in line with that used for 2012 with the exception that, as noted above, the weighting of 
the performance conditions for the LTIP have been amended. The performance conditions are linked to strategy and the targets are considered 
to be stretching. Full details are set out under their specific headings.

David Wild was appointed Chairman to the Committee in August 2012. 
Ronnie Bell and Louise Makin resigned as non-executive directors 
on 1 June and 30 September 2012, respectively. Jennifer Laing and 
Ian Krieger were appointed to the Committee on 1 October and 1 
November 2012, respectively. Following his appointment as Company

Q: Who advises the Committee?
A: New Bridge Street (NBS) (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd) 
have been appointed as advisers to the Committee. During the year 
NBS provided advice in connection with executive remuneration 
arrangements. NBS are signatories of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group Code of Conduct. The Trustees of the Group’s pension schemes 
have appointed the pension advisory team of Aon Hewitt Ltd  to act 
as Administrator of the schemes and have also appointed individuals 
within Aon Hewitt Ltd to act as Actuary to the schemes. NBS operates 
independently of the pension teams and the Committee is satisfied 
there is no conflict of interest.
Q: What is the role of the Committee?
A: The Committee has delegated authority from the Board to: 
•	 Determine and agree the overall remuneration strategy for executive 
directors and senior management;
•	 Review and approve the remuneration packages for the Chairman, 
executive directors, General Counsel & Company Secretary and 
senior management;
•	 Agree the terms of employment including recruitment and 
termination terms of executive directors, ensuring any payments on 
departure are fair to the individual and the Company, whilst avoiding 
payment for failure and recognising the departing individual’s duty 
to mitigate loss; 
•	 Approve the design of all share incentive plans including all-
employee share schemes and where appropriate oversee any 
subsequent changes; and
•	 Recommend appropriate performance conditions and targets for 
the variable element of remuneration packages and determine the 
extent to which performance targets have been achieved.

Remuneration Policy
Q:  What is the Group’s remuneration strategy? 
A: The Committee adheres to principles of accountability and 
transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a 
clear link between reward and performance. In its work, the Committee 
considers fully the relevant legal and regulatory requirements, provisions 
and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
“Code”) and associated guidance. 
The Remuneration Committee formulates remuneration strategy in line 
with the strategic objectives of the Group and ensures that performance 
targets, both at a personal level and a group level are sufficiently 
challenging. Remuneration for executive directors is intended to reward 
against criteria that are relevant and realistic but also stretching, so that 
superior performance is encouraged and the realisation of strategic 
targets is rewarded.
Executive directors should have sufficient focus on the long-term 
performance of the Group and be aligned with the interests of 
shareholders. We are therefore committed to the use of equity-based 
performance-related schemes and encourage executives to build up 
meaningful shareholdings in the Company. A significant proportion of 
remuneration is performance linked. 
During 2012 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the policy to 
ensure performance-related incentives, as well as annual salary, are 
supportive of strategic objectives and conducive to the delivery of 
shareholder value. It is considered that the policy continues to remain 
appropriate. 
Each year the Committee reviews the remuneration of senior 
management to ensure it remains competitive and challenging and 
satisfies the requirement to incentivise managers to deliver our 
challenging strategic objectives.
.
Q:  What does the Remuneration Committee plan 
to review in 2013?
A: The Committee believes that the current remuneration structure will 
continue to support the Group. However, we will continue to monitor 
developments to ensure our policy is aligned to our strategy and also 
ensure best practice in reporting to our shareholders, including the new 
reporting requirements introduced by BIS.
The Committee will ensure that the remuneration arrangements for 
2013 are affordable without excessive share dilution and that the 
performance conditions used in our plans are consistent with delivering 
strong returns to shareholders. The Committee has also committed to 
undertake a formal review of remuneration advisers in 2013.
The table on pages 58 and 59 provides an overview of all the elements 
of our remuneration policy for 2013 outlining how it links to strategy, 
performance conditions and changes from the prior year.
.
Q:  What is the balance between the fixed and 
variable elements of executive remuneration?
A: Executive directors are remunerated through a combination of 
base salary, annual bonus, pension supplements and share-based 
performance-related awards. The Committee believes that it is 
important for a significant proportion of their remuneration package to 
be performance-related. At maximum award levels (excluding share 
price movements) approximately 75% of the remuneration package for 
Gavin Darby and 70% of the remuneration packages for Mark Moran 
are based on variable elements.
Director remuneration: Fixed pay
.
Q:  What salaries do the executive directors 
receive?
A: The Committee continues to test, review and set salaries at levels 
not normally exceeding market rates against relevant comparator 
companies. This takes into account factors such as the Group’s 
revenue, market share and total enterprise value rather than just market 
capitalisation. It also recognises the complexity of the business taking 
into account the Group’s supply chain, logistics, pension schemes and 
business restructuring programme. 
However, in certain circumstances the Committee recognises that it 
may be appropriate to set salaries outside of the stated policy. Given 
the challenges facing the business in early 2013 the Board felt it was 
necessary to appoint a very experienced executive in Gavin Darby, as 
CEO in order to lead the Company in the next phase of its strategy and 
therefore it was necessary to provide a salary commensurate with this 
experience (albeit at a lower level than his predecessor).  
No increases in salary were made in 2012 and the CEO’s salary will not 
be reviewed until April 2015.
Q:  Does the Committee consider pay conditions 
for all employees within the Group when 
agreeing arrangements for executive directors?
A: In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive 
directors, the Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base 
salary increases and reviews the proposed pay awards for the Group at 
large with the CEO and Group HR Director.

Premier Foods Annual Report 2012-front.indd   60 15/03/2013   15:03:02 Director remuneration: Variable pay
Q:  How is executive variable remuneration 
structured and how does it align with the 
Group’s strategy?
A: The structure of incentives for the executive directors comprise of 
three elements which includes an Annual Cash Bonus, Deferred Share 
Bonus Plan (DSB) and LTIP Performance Shares. 
When determining the structure of variable pay the Committee is 
mindful of the need to maintain a good line of sight so that executive 
directors can clearly see how their actions lead to their reward and to 
have incentives that have specific and clear goals which are clearly 
linked to business strategy and the key priorities that have been 
outlined. 
Short and medium-term incentives
.
Q:  What annual cash bonuses do the executive 
directors receive?
A: Each year the Committee sets individual performance targets 
and bonus potentials for each of the executive directors. Annually the 
Committee reviews the level of achievement against the performance 
targets set and based on the Committee’s judgement approves the 
bonus of each executive director. Annual bonus payments are not 
pensionable. 
Annual bonus award and performance conditions for 2013
For 2013 the maximum bonus opportunities for executive directors 
remain unchanged. 
Gavin Darby 150%
Mark Moran 75% 
Details of the specific arrangements for Gavin Darby are set out in the 
Chairman’s introduction on pages 56 and 57.
Mark Moran’s bonus will be dependant on performance against 
turnover, gross profit, trading profit and cash flow targets.
Performance will be assessed on the financial achievement across 
all four elements each of which carries a 25% weighting. Personal 
performance against individual objectives is also factored into any 
year end bonus. These include a range of priorities directly linked to 
the Group’s strategy including delivery of cost savings and cash flow 
management. Any bonus payment is also subject to the delivery of a 
threshold level of trading profit.
Annual bonus award and performance outcome for 2012
Annual Bonus for Mark Moran
The Company made significant progress in delivering a number of 
financial and strategic objectives in the year, including improvements 
in the key measures of turnover, branded sales value growth, trading 
profit and cash flow. However, overall the performance was below the 
stretching targets set for 2012 and as a result no awards will be made 
under the Annual Bonus Plan in respect of 2012.
.
Q: What awards will be made under the Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan?
A: The Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSB) operates alongside the 
annual cash bonus. Awards are based on the achievement of a Group-
wide strategic target which will be set at the start of each financial year. 
If the objective is met, the bonus will be paid at the end of the financial 
year in shares deferred for a period of two years. These shares will 
be subject to forfeiture over the period of deferral. All shares for these 
awards will be sourced in the market. 
DSB award and performance conditions for 2013
The maximum award payable under the DSB remains unchanged at 
30% of salary; the CEO does not participate in the DSB. 
The targets that apply for the 2013 performance period remain 
unchanged from 2012 and are as follows:
50% Branded turnover
50% Trading profit
These conditions are fully aligned with the Group’s strategy to increase 
branded sales by focusing on and growing our Power Brands whilst 
emphasising the importance of profitability and margin performance. 
The performance conditions are subject to the delivery of a threshold 
level of trading profit.
DSB award and performance outcome for 2012
The Committee assessed performance against the targets for 2012. 
The Company made significant progress in delivering a number of 
strategic objectives in the year including branded turnover and trading 
profit. However, overall the performance was below the stretching 
targets set for 2012 and as a result no awards will be made under the 
DSB in respect of 2012. 
Long-term incentives
.
Q: How are the long-term incentives structured?
A: The awards under the LTIP approved by shareholders in 2011 has 
two elements: 
•	 Performance Shares
•	 Matching Shares (not used in 2012 or 2013)
The Matching Shares require participants to make an investment into 
Company shares in order to receive a match of up to 2:1 on shares 
invested into the scheme. The maximum grant of Performance Shares 
and Matching Shares is 200% of salary. The Committee determined 
in 2012 that whilst the business is in turnaround and the share price 
continues to be volatile, awards under the LTIP will take the form of 
Performance Shares only. 
LTIP award and performance conditions for 2013
For 2013 the value of LTIP awards made to executive directors remains 
unchanged from 2012 and is capped at 200% of salary for the CEO 
and 150% of salary for the CFO. Again, in 2013 awards will only be 
made in the form of Performance Shares.
The performance conditions attached to the 2013 LTIP awards are 
aligned with the strategy of the Group. The Company faces a number 
of challenges including delivering branded sales growth, improving 
relations with customers, reducing debt and pension liabilities. 
However, the Committee believes that successful delivery against 
all these strategic priorities will ultimately be reflected through share 
price performance and bottom line profit. The performance targets 
are therefore based on absolute share price and adjusted EPS 
performance which the Committee believes are fully aligned with the

gOVERNANCE
Premier Foods Annual Report 2012-front.indd   61 15/03/2013   15:03:02 interests of shareholders at this stage in the Company’s turnaround. 
These measures are unchanged from 2012, however, in view of the 
focus on improving shareholder return the Committee has determined 
that the weighting across each measure should be altered in favour of 
absolute share price. Awards will only vest following the achievement of 
stretching performance targets. 
The 2013 award will be subject to an absolute TSR condition (2/3rds of 
the award) and an adjusted EPS condition (1/3rd of the award) based 
on the following targets:

.
Q:  Are clawback provisions in place for the DSB 
and LTIP awards? 
A: Yes. In relation to awards granted under the LTIP the Committee 
may reduce unvested awards and seek repayment of vested awards 
if, by the second anniversary of vesting, the Committee forms the view 
that the vesting was determined based on materially misstated financial 
results or in the event of misconduct.
In relation to DSB awards the Committee may reduce unvested awards 
if, prior to vesting, the Committee forms the view that the number of 
shares over which awards were granted was higher than the number 
that should have been granted because of materially misstated 
financial results for the relevant bonus year, or the Committee relied on 
inaccurate or misleading information.
.
Q:  What were the details of Gavin Darby’s  
Co-investment award? 
A: In accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.3 a summary of the principal 
terms of the Co-investment award are set out below:
•	 The Co-investment award shall be satisfied using shares purchased in 
the market by the trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust;
•	 The Co-investment award is structured as a nil-cost option and no 
consideration is payable by Gavin Darby for the grant;
•	 The Co-investment award is non-transferable and shall not be 
pensionable;
•	 A third of the Co-investment award will vest on each of the first, 
second and third anniversaries of the date of grant subject to a bonus 
having been paid for the relevant financial year and subject to Gavin 
Darby’s continued employment;
•	 Once vested the Co-investment award will remain exercisable until 30 
June 2017;
•	 If he ceases employment before the relevant vesting dates by 
reason of death, injury, disability, redundancy or any other reason 
the Committee may, in its discretion, permit some or all of the 
Co-investment award to vest and become payable early subject to 
the satisfaction of the performance conditions and a time pro rata 
adjustment, unless the Committee determines otherwise. If he ceases 
employment for any other reason before the relevant vesting dates 
then the Co-investment award will lapse;
•	 In the event of a change of control of the Company (excluding certain 
internal reorganisations or restructurings) whether by way of a general 
offer or scheme of arrangement the Co-investment award will become 
exercisable in full and remain exercisable for a period of six months 
from the date of the change of control; 
•	 The Company may change the terms of the Co-investment award to 
get or keep favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment 
for Gavin Darby or the Company and may make minor changes to 
ease its administration. Except for such changes, no change can 
be made to Gavin Darby’s advantage without the prior approval of 
shareholders; and
•	 The Deed of Grant is available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
•	 .
Q:  What is the policy on dilution of share capital 
by employee share plans? 
A: Awards under all Group share plans may be satisfied using either 
newly issued shares or shares purchased in the market and held in the 
Company’s Employee Benefit Trust. The Group’s policy is to comply 
with the Association of British Insurers (“ABI”) guidelines in respect of 
newly issued shares.
Q: What are the terms of the executive directors’ 
service agreements?
A: Details of the service agreements of the executive directors appear

Q:  What is the Group’s policy on executive 
directors holding external appointments? 
A: The Group is supportive of executive directors who wish to take on 
a non-executive directorship with a publicly quoted company in order 
to broaden their experience and they are entitled to retain any fees they 
may receive. Michael Clarke received fees of £63,000 p.a. in 2012 in 
respect of his role as a non-executive director of Wolseley plc.  
The current executive directors do not have external appointments.

Michael Clarke received a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 20% of basic salary, a portion of which he voluntarily salary sacrificed into the 
Group’s defined contribution pension scheme. The Company did not make any contribution to this pension scheme on Michael Clarke’s behalf.

Geoff Eaton was appointed as Chief Operating Officer in October 2012 on a salary of £450,000, however, following the appointment of Gavin Darby 
a flatter executive management structure has been implemented, that will enable commercial and functional management to report directly to the 
CEO, and as a consequence Geoff left the Company in February 2013. All payments are in accordance with his contract i.e. payment in lieu of 
notice equivalent to 12 months base salary, benefits and pension. These payments will be made on a monthly basis and are subject to mitigation. 
No annual bonus payment will be made in respect of 2012 or 2013 and there are no rights to any share based awards.

Other statutory information
Pages 1 to 67 and 125 (together with the sections of the annual report 
incorporated by reference) constitute the Directors’ Report. The financial 
statements are presented on pages 70 to 124.
Principal activities
Premier Foods plc (the “Company”) is the holding company of 
the Premier Foods Group of companies (the “Group”). The Group 
manufactures processes and distributes some of Britain’s favourite food 
brands. We employ around 9,000 people and operate from over 40 sites 
in the UK.
General
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles may only be amended by a special resolution at 
a general meeting. The Articles are available on the Group’s website:
www.premierfoods.co.uk/about-us/corporate-governance/articles-
of-association.cfm
Profit and dividends
The profit on continuing operations before tax for the financial year was 
£4.4m (2011: £259.1m loss). The directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend for 2012 (2011: £nil).
Research and development
Applied research and development work continues to be directed 
towards the introduction of new and improved products; the application 
of new technology to reduce unit and operating costs; and to improve 
service to customers. Research and development costs of £7m (2011: 
£8.4m) were incurred in continuing operations during the year.
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance
This insurance covers the directors and officers against the costs of 
defending themselves in civil proceedings taken against them in their 
capacity as a director or officer of the Company and in respect of 
damages resulting from the unsuccessful defence of any proceedings. 
Employment of disabled persons
It is our policy to give full and fair consideration to applications for 
employment received from disabled persons, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities; and wherever possible to continue the 
employment of, and to arrange appropriate training for, employees who 
have become disabled persons during the period of their employment. 
Premier Foods provides the same opportunities for training, career 
development and promotion for disabled people as for other employees.
Employee Communication
We recognise the value of good communication in engaging our 
employees in order to achieve common goals and we have a number of 
established employee communication mechanisms in place to achieve 
this goal, including: regular communication meetings; the Group’s 
intranet site; the quarterly Group magazine; and specific consultation and 
involvement regarding major changes to the business.
Significant agreements
The following significant agreements contain provisions that take effect, 
alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a 
takeover bid.
The Group has a term and revolving facilities agreement originally for 
£2.1bn entered into in 2006 and a receivables purchase agreement and 
guarantee dated 30 December 2007. In 2012 unanimous consent from 
the Company’s banking syndicate, swap counterparties and pension 
schemes led to a restated re-financing package. The current and new 
facilities agreements contain customary change of control provisions 
which allow the lenders or an individual lender to demand repayment of 
the facilities in full on a change of control. The new receivables purchase 
agreement contains change of control provisions which allow the provider 
of the funding to terminate or suspend the operation of the agreement 
and demand payment of all amounts outstanding under the agreement 
on a change of control. 
The Group entered into a Relationship Agreement with Warburg Pincus LLC 
in March 2009 setting out the terms and conditions under which Warburg 
Pincus have the right to appoint a director to the Board and also governing 
the retention of its shareholding in the Company and the purchase of 
further shares. Under the Relationship Agreement, Charles Miller Smith was 
appointed to the Board on 16 June 2009. In the event of a change of control 
or if the shareholding of Warburg Pincus falls below 23,980,215 shares the 
Company may give notice to terminate the appointment of Charles Miller 
Smith.
The Company’ s share schemes may cause options and awards granted under 
such schemes to vest as a result of a successful takeover bid.
Substantial Shareholdings
Details of substantial shareholdings are set out on page 125.
Financial
Charitable and political donations
During the year the Group made charitable donations to the following 
charities: Help for Heroes £32,106, Carnwath Community School £5,000 
and Stourscombe Residents Association. Total charitable donations 
during the year amounted to £60,022 (2011: £85,097). In line with Group 
policy no political donations were made during the year (2011: £nil).
Financial instruments
The financial risk management objectives and policies of the Group, and 
its exposure to price, credit, liquidity and cash flow risk are set out in note 
21 to the Group financial statements.
Going concern
The Group has obtained consent from its banking syndicate, swap 
counterparties and pension schemes on a re-financing package in March 
2012.
The directors are confident that the Group has adequate resources to 
operate in the ordinary course of business and to meet its obligations 
as they fall due. Thus the financial statements have been prepared on a 
going concern basis.
Supplier payment policy
The Company had no amounts owing to trade creditors at 31 December 
2012 (2011: £nil). The Group’s creditor days outstanding at 31 December 
2012 were 74.5 days (2011: 72.7 days) of purchases, based on the 
ratio of average Group trade creditors in the current financial year to the 
amounts invoiced during the year. The Group has standard payment 
terms of end of the month plus 60 days. Our terms and conditions are 
available on the Group’s website:
www.premierfoods.co.uk/about-us/our-supply-chain/our-suppliers_
home.cfm
Payment terms for purchases under major contracts are agreed as part 
of the contract negotiations.

Other statutory information
Statement of directors’ responsibilities for the annual 
report
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, the 
directors’ remuneration report and the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU, and the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (UK Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the Group or 
Company financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company 
and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
•	 Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
•	 State whether IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent 
company financial statements respectively; and
•	 Prepare the Group and Company financial statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the Group’s website: www.premierfoods.co.uk. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Information made available on the website does not constitute part of 
this annual report. The information has been prepared under the relevant 
accounting standards and legislation.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 40 
to 41, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:
The Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Group; and
The Directors’ Report contained on pages 1 to 67 & 125 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces.
Subsequent events
Since the balance sheet date the Group has continued to progress its 
strategy. In line with this, details of post-balance sheet events are set out 
in note 30 of the Group financial statements.
Auditors
Independent auditors
The Audit Committee has recommended PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP’s (“PwC”) reappointment and PwC has indicated its willingness to 
continue as auditors. The reappointment of PwC and the setting of their 
remuneration will be proposed at the 2013 AGM.
Auditors and the disclosure of information to auditors
The Companies Act requires directors to provide the Group’s auditors 
with every opportunity to take whatever steps and undertake whatever 
inspections they consider to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling 
them to give their audit report. The directors, having made appropriate 
enquiries, confirm that:
•	 So far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and 
•	 Each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken 
as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Group’s auditors are aware of 
that information.

for the year ended 31 December 2012 which comprise the consolidated 
income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of cash flows, 
consolidated statement of changes in equity and the related notes. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on page 67, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
Annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements

31 December 2012 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then 
ended; 
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union; and 
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.

which the Group financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the Group financial statements.

set out on pages 38 to 67 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems and about share capital structures is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion: 
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not 
made; or 
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•	 the directors’ statement, set out on page 66, in relation to going 
concern; 
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review; and
•	 certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.

statements of Premier Foods plc for the year ended 31 December 2012

Notes to the financial statements
1. General information
Premier Foods plc (the “Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, registered number 5160050, 
with its registered office at Premier House, Centrium Business Park, Griffiths Way, St Albans, Hertfordshire AL1 2RE. The principal activities of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) are food manufacturing, processing and distribution. Further information about the Group’s activities can 
be found in the Group at a Glance section of this annual report on pages 6 to 7. Copies of the annual report and accounts are available from this 
address.
These Group consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 1 March 2013.
2. Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
2.1 Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of Premier Foods plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union (EU) (“adopted IFRS”) in response to IAS regulation (EC1606/2002), related interpretations and the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS, and on the historical cost basis, with the exception of derivative financial 
instruments which are incorporated using fair value. Amounts are presented to the nearest £0.1m.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 
3.
The following accounting standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) or IFRIC (as endorsed by 
the EU), are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group:
International Financial Reporting Standards
IFRS 7 (Amendment) ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ on transfers of financial assets
 
The application of these standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group. 
New standards and interpretations not applied
The following standards have been endorsed by the EU but have not been applied. 
International Financial Reporting Standards
IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’
IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of interest in other entities’
IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
Effective for periods on or after 1 January 2013. 
The following standards and amendments to published standards have not been endorsed by the EU: 
IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’
IAS 32 (Amendment) ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures and Presentation’ – offsetting financial assets and liabilities
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’
With the exception of IAS 19 (Revised) it is not expected that any of the new standards will have a material impact on the results or net assets of 
the Group. Application of IAS 19 (Revised) in 2012 would have increased the operating profit charge in relation to pensions by £40m.

Notes to the financial statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Basis for preparation of financial statements on a going concern basis
In March 2012 the Group signed a re-financing package with its banking syndicate, swap counterparties and pension schemes whereby the term 
loan and revolving credit facility were extended from 31 December 2013 to 30 June 2016. The current margin of 2.25% will increase to 3.25% on  
1 January 2014.
This facility includes net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest covenant tests and a requirement to realise disposal proceeds of £330m by 30 June 
2014. In the event these covenants are not met then the Group would be in breach of its financing agreement and, as would be the case in any 
covenant breach, the banking syndicate could withdraw their funding to the Group.  
Following the completion of the disposal of the Sweet Pickles and Table Sauces business on 2 February 2013 the Group has successfully met the 
disposal proceeds target. It is also in compliance with covenant tests at 31 December 2012. The Group’s forecasts, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities including covenant 
tests.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its bank facilities. The current economic conditions continue to create 
uncertainty particularly over (a) the level of demand for the Group’s products; and (b) the availability of bank finance for the foreseeable future. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. In addition, comparatives are also restated to reclassify material disposed 
businesses into discontinued operations and to align logistics cost classification across the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
2.3 Revenue
Revenue comprises the invoiced value for the sale of goods net of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable 
to revenue and after eliminating sales within the Group. Revenue is recognised when the outcome of a transaction can be measured reliably and 
when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue is recognised on the following 
basis:
(i) Sale of goods
Sales of goods are recognised as revenue on transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership, which typically coincides with the time when the 
merchandise is delivered to customers and title passes.
(ii) Sales rebates and discounts
Sales rebates and discount reserves are established at the time of sale based on management’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet 
claims by the Group’s customers in respect of these rebates and discounts. These estimates are based on experience and history. A provision is 
made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.
2.4 Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. The Chief 
Operating Decision Maker is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. See note 4 for further details. 
2.5 Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense over the vesting period. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting 
period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, 
profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected 
to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest and recognises the impact 
of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

2. Accounting policies continued
2.6 Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are translated into sterling, the Group’s presentation currency, at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. 
The results of overseas subsidiaries with functional currencies other than in sterling are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange 
ruling in the year. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising from 
retranslation at year end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of equity in other 
reserves. When a foreign operation is sold exchange differences previously taken to equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the 
gain or loss on sale. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate.
All other exchange gains or losses are recorded in the income statement.
2.7 Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”)
Property, plant and equipment is initially recorded at cost. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to 
bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure is added to the carrying value of the asset when it is 
probable that incremental future economic benefits will transfer to the Group. All other subsequent expenditure is expensed in the period it is 
incurred.
Differences between the cost of each item of PPE and its residual value are written off over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-
line method. Reviews of the estimated remaining useful lives and residual values of individual productive assets are performed annually, taking 
account of commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear. Freehold land is not depreciated. The useful economic 
lives of owned assets range from 20 to 50 years for buildings, and 3 to 35 years for vehicles, plant and equipment.
All items of PPE are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. 
Assets under construction represent the amount of expenditure recognised in the carrying amount of an item of PPE in the course of its 
construction. When the item of property, plant and equipment is brought into use, it is depreciated.
The cost and depreciation relating to disposed assets is written off on disposal.
2.8 Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of 
the acquisition date fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control 
of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Goodwill arises 
when the fair value of the consideration for a business exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is 
capitalised and subject to impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that 
is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest 
level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
The Group has applied IFRS 3 (Revised) ‘Business Combinations’ to business combinations after 1 July 2009. The accounting for business 
combinations transacted prior to this date have not been restated. 
2.9 Intangible assets
In addition to goodwill the Group recognises the following intangible assets: 
Acquired intangible assets
Acquired trademarks, brands, customer relationships, licences, recipes and similar assets that are controlled through custody or legal rights 
and that could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured. All of these assets are 
considered to have finite lives and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives that range from 7 to 40 years.
Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Costs incurred in developing a product, typically its recipe or packaging, are charged to income in the year in which they are incurred unless the 
product or process is technically and commercially feasible in which case they are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic lives in 
accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.

Notes to the financial statements
2. Accounting policies continued
Software development costs
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are 
recognised as intangible assets when the project or process is technically and commercially feasible. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised 
as part of the software product include the software development employee costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads.
Software development costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis over a range of 3 to 10 years. 
The useful economic lives of intangible assets are determined based on a review of a combination of factors including the asset ownership rights 
acquired and the nature of the overall product life cycle.
2.10 Impairment 
The carrying value of non-financial assets, other than goodwill and inventories, are reviewed at least annually to determine whether there is an 
indication of impairment. Where such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated based on the greater of its value in use and its fair 
value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, adjusted for the risks specific to each asset, are discounted to 
their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and the general risks affecting the 
food manufacturing industry.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the year in which they occur.
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing 
use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. 
2.11 Financing cost
(i) Finance cost
Borrowing costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method.
(ii) Finance income
Finance income is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable, 
taking into consideration the interest element of derivatives.
2.12 Leases
Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group, are capitalised and 
included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of the present value of future minimum lease payments or fair value. Each asset is 
depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or its estimated useful life on a straight-line basis. Obligations relating to finance leases, net of 
finance charges in respect of future periods, are included under borrowings. The interest element of the rental obligation is allocated to accounting 
periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each accounting period. 
Leases in which a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rental costs 
under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
period.
2.13 Inventories
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead 
expenses as described in IAS 2 ‘Inventories’. Cost is calculated on a first-in, first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and 
attributable costs of bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where the estimated selling price is lower than cost.
Provision is made for slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory where appropriate.

2.14 Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity in which case it is 
recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax
Deferred taxation is accounted for in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in computation of taxable profit. Deferred taxation is not provided on the initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than in a business combination, if at the time of the transaction there is no effect on either accounting or taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled based on tax rates (and 
tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It is recognised in the income statement except when it 
relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised in equity.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and when the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
2.15 Employee benefits
Group companies provide a number of long-term employee benefit arrangements, primarily through pension schemes. The schemes are generally 
funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds determined by periodic independent actuarial calculations. The 
Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. 
Defined benefit plans
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent 
on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. 
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the 
balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses and past service costs. Defined benefit 
obligations are calculated using assumptions determined by the Group with the assistance of independent actuaries using the projected unit credit 
method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using yields of high-
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to 
the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of 
comprehensive income in the year in which they arise.
Current service costs, past service costs, administration costs, expected return on assets and interest costs are recognised immediately in the 
income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the 
vesting period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Curtailments are recognised when the Group is demonstrably committed to make a significant reduction in the number of employees covered 
by a plan or amends the terms of a defined benefit plan so that a significant element of future service by current employees no longer qualifies or 
qualify for reduced benefits.
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity, which then invests 
the contributions to buy annuities for the pension liabilities as they become due based on the value of the fund. The Group has no legal or 
constructive obligations to pay further contributions.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they fall due. 
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are recognised as either accruals or prepayments in the 
balance sheet.

2.16 Provisions
Provisions for restructuring and property exit costs are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past 
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made. Where 
the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset 
when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Where material, the Group discounts its provisions using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the 
passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
2.17 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and the existence of which will only be confirmed by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or the amount of obligation cannot be measured 
reliably. A contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. When an outflow becomes probable, it is 
recognised as a provision. 
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of one or more uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are not recognised but are disclosed in 
the notes to the financial statements when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. When inflow is virtually certain an asset is recognised.
2.18 Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment. A 
provision is made for impairment when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms 
of the receivables. Trade and other receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material. 
The rights and obligations relating to those trade receivables that have been sold to third parties are de-recognised from the balance sheet where 
the risks and rewards of ownership are considered to have transferred. Cash received from third parties in exchange for the transfer of ownership 
is recorded within cash and cash equivalents with the cost of financing prior to settlement by the customer recorded as interest on an accruals 
basis.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents, with original maturities at inception of less than 90 days, comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in 
value.
For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash in hand, short-term deposits with an 
original maturity of three months or less held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and bank overdrafts.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into 
and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets 
of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out 
below.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate 
method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs and inclusive of debt issuance costs) and the settlement or redemption of 
borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for borrowing costs.
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost. Trade payables and other liabilities are 
discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised gains or losses reported 
in the income statement. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. Movements in fair value of foreign exchange derivatives are recognised within other operating income and expense 
and those relating to interest rate swaps are recorded within the net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments.

2. Accounting policies continued
Other items at fair value through profit or loss
Other items at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value. Movements in fair value are recorded within the net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments. 
See notes 7 and 21 for further details.
2.19 Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets and associated liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than continuing use are classified as 
held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets and associated liabilities are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policies. Thereafter the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses 
on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised 
in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. 
3. Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements
The following are areas of particular significance to the Group’s financial statements and include the use of estimates and the application of 
judgement, which is fundamental to the compilation of a set of financial statements.
3.1 Employee benefits
The present value of the Group’s defined benefit pension obligations depends on a number of actuarial assumptions. The primary assumptions 
used include the discount rate applicable to scheme liabilities, the long-term rate of inflation and estimates of the mortality applicable to scheme 
members.
At each reporting date, and on a continuous basis, the Group reviews the macro-economic, Company and scheme specific factors influencing 
each of these assumptions, using professional advice, in order to record the Group’s ongoing commitment and obligation to defined benefit 
schemes in accordance with IAS 19. Key assumptions used are mortality rates, discount rates and inflation set with reference to bond yields. If 
the Group’s assumption on the mortality of its members was amended to assume an increase of a further one year improvement in mortality, total 
liabilities would increase by approximately 3.1%. Each 0.1% decrease/increase in bond yields would increase/decrease the deficit by a further 
£62m/£60m. Each 0.1% increase/decrease in the assumed inflation rate would increase/decrease the deficit by a further £27m/£26m. Each of 
the underlying assumptions is set out in more detail in note 23.
 
3.2 Goodwill and other intangible assets
Impairment reviews in respect of goodwill are performed annually unless an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary. Impairment 
reviews in respect of intangible assets are performed when an event indicates that an impairment review is necessary. Examples of such triggering 
events include a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market conditions or technology, expectations of future operating losses, or a 
significant reduction in cash flows. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units (“CGU’s”) are determined based on the higher of realisable 
value and value in use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.
The Group has considered the impact of the assumptions used on the calculations and has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests 
of the CGU’s carrying values. See note 14 for further details.
Acquired trademarks, brands, customer relationships, recipes and similar assets are considered to have finite lives that range from 7 to 40 years. 
The determination of the useful lives takes into account certain quantitative factors such as sales expectations and growth prospects, and also 
many qualitative factors such as history and heritage, and market positioning, hence the determination of useful lives are subject to estimates and 
judgement. For further details see note 15.
3.3 Advertising and promotion costs
Trade spend and promotional activity is dependent on market conditions and negotiations with customers. Trade spend is charged to the income 
statement according to the substance of the agreements with customers and the terms of any contractual relationship. Promotional support is 
generally charged to the income statement at the time of the relevant promotion. These costs are accrued on best estimates. The actual costs 
may not be known until subsequent years when negotiations with customers are concluded. Such adjustments are recognised in the year when 
final agreement is reached.
Expenditure on advertising is charged to the income statement when incurred, except in the case of airtime costs when a particular campaign is 
used more than once. In this case they are charged in line with the airtime profile.
4. Segmental analysis
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Group’s internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). 
The CODM has been determined to be the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of 
resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM has changed the measure used to assess segment performance in 2012. Divisional contribution is defined as gross profit after 
marketing and distribution costs and is a consistent measure within the Group and reflects the segments’ underlying trading performance for the 
period under evaluation. The reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to product types, 
has been used to identify and determine the Group’s operating segments. 2011 comparatives have been restated using the new measure.

4. Segmental analysis continued
The Group continues to use trading profit to review overall Group profitability. Trading profit is defined as operating profit before re-financing costs, 
restructuring costs, profits and losses associated with divestment activity, amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of 
foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension credits or charges in relation to the difference between the expected 
return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension liabilities.
The Group’s operating segments are “Grocery”, “Bread” and “Disposed of Canning Operations”. In 2011 the Group completed its disposal of the 
Meat-free business and the Retailer Branded Chilled business which had previously been aggregated into an “Other” segment, as they did not 
meet the relevant quantitative thresholds and did not have similar economic characteristics and therefore could not be aggregated into their own 
separate reporting segment under IFRS 8. In 2011 these were presented as discontinued operations.
During 2012 the Group completed the disposal of the four Irish Brands (Chivers, Gateaux, McDonnells and the Erin licence), the Elephant Atta 
Ethnic Flour Business, the Vinegar and Sour Pickles business and the Sweet Spreads and Jellies business; the results of these businesses have 
not been reported separately as they were fully integrated within the Grocery and Bread segments. 
The Grocery segment sells ambient food products. The Bread segment sells bread, morning goods, flour products and frozen pizza bases and the 
Disposed of Canning Operations segment sold canned goods. 
The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2012 and for the year ended 31 December 2011 and the reconciliation of the segment 
measures to the respective statutory items included in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:

 Comparatives have been restated to reflect a change in the measure used to asses segment performance.
Revenues, on a continuing basis, of approximately £329.1m and £213.1m (2011: £333.5m and £274.9m) are derived from two external 
customers. These revenues are attributable across the grocery and bread segments.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions are entered into under the same terms and conditions that would be available to unrelated third parties. 
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, inventories and receivables and exclude cash and cash 
equivalents, derivative assets and certain Corporate assets that are not able to be allocated to the Group’s reporting segments. 
Unallocated assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, taxation balances, derivative financial assets, Group-wide software and hardware and 
head office assets. 
The Group primarily supplies the UK market, although it also supplies certain products to other European countries and a number of other 
countries. The following table provides an analysis of the Group’s revenue, which is allocated on the basis of geographical market destination and

 For 2012 this relates to the write-off of debt issuance costs relating to the Group’s previous financing agreement.
2012
The net movement on fair valuation of interest rate financial instruments relates to £9.5m favourable movement on swaps held before re-financing 
in March 2012 offset by adverse movement of £19.2m on swaps entered into as part of the re-financing package.
2011
The fair value of interest rate swaps and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss has decreased from a £234.5m liability at  
31 December 2010 to a £197.6m liability at 31 December 2011 resulting in a net movement of £36.9m for the year. The change in fair value in the 
year is due to a change in the yield curve offset by amortisation (refer to note 21). The liability at 31 December 2011 represents the net present 
value of the interest cash flows calculated using the contracted fixed rates compared to the net present value of interest cash flows that would 
arise if the interest was calculated on a floating basis. 
The total facility as at 31 December 2012 was £1,142.4m (2011: £1,233m).

The Finance Act 2012, enacted on 3 July 2012, reduces the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012. This gives rise to an 
effective rate of corporation tax for the year of 24.5%.
Deferred tax balances at 31 December 2011 were calculated at 25%, the rate applicable at that time. The Finance Act 2012 also reduces the 
main rate of corporation tax to 23% from 1 April 2013. This 2% reduction for the 2012 financial year has been reflected in the financial statements 
by restating the deferred tax liability at 31 December 2011 giving a credit of £5.4m to continuing operations, off-set by a charge to equity of £4.5m 
to reflect where the charges and credits were originally made. In addition, the deferred tax movements in the period have been reflected at 23%, 
being the rate at which the liabilities are expected to reverse, which has resulted in a £1.0m decrease to the income tax credit.
A further 2% reduction to the main rate of corporation tax is proposed to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014. However, as this further 
reduction in the main rate of corporation tax was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date it is not reflected in the deferred tax 
recognised on the balance sheet.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences using the tax rate appropriate to the jurisdiction in which the asset/(liability) arises and the 
tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. In all cases this is 23.0% (2011: 25.0%) except for an 
asset of £1.7m (2011: £0.7m) relating to Irish retirement benefit obligations where the local rate of 12.5% has been used.

The increase in the deferred tax asset in the year is driven by a credit to equity relating to the actuarial loss in the year and credit to income 
statement as a result of the recognition of an asset for a portion of tax losses.
Due to the level of taxable profits anticipated the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of £20.5m (2011: £27.6m) relating to capital 
losses, £33.9m (2011: £23.4m) relating to UK corporation tax losses and £28.6m (2011: £31.1m) relating to ACT. Under current legislation these 
losses can generally be carried forward indefinitely.

Where there is a legal right of offset and an intention to settle as such, deferred tax assets and liabilities may be presented on a net basis. This 
is the case for most of the Group’s deferred tax balances and therefore they have been offset in the tables above. Substantial elements of the 
Group’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, primarily relating to the defined benefit pension obligation, are greater than one year in nature.
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses are only recognised to the extent that it is anticipated they will be utilised in the foreseeable future. During 
the year an asset was recognised for losses forecast to be utilised by taxable profits.

Dilutive effect of share options
The dilutive effect of share options is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are share options. A calculation is performed 
to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the 
Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options. 
For the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, there is no dilutive effect as the outstanding share options that could have been 
acquired at fair value is less than the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to these options. 
No adjustment is made to the profit or loss in calculating basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share.

Adjusted earnings per share (“Adjusted EPS”)
Adjusted earnings per share is defined as trading profit less net regular interest payable, less a notional tax charge at 24.5% (2011: 26.5%) divided 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares of the Company. There is no difference between basic and diluted adjusted EPS
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before re-financing costs, restructuring costs, profits and losses associated with divestment activity, 
amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, the revaluation of foreign exchange and other derivative contracts under IAS 39 and pension 
credits or charges in relation to the difference between the expected return on pension assets, administration costs and interest costs on pension 
liabilities.

  £44.8m of assets were classified as intangible assets at 31 December 2011. These have been reclassified as property, plant and equipment during 2012.
The net book value of the Group’s vehicles, plant and equipment includes an amount of £0.7m (2011: £0.4m) in respect of assets held under 
finance leases. None of the additions of £43.4m for the year related to assets held under finance leases. The increase in the year is due to a 
reclassification between categories.
The Group’s borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group including property, plant and equipment.
Impairment
An impairment charge of £12.5m was recognised in the year due to planned site closures and restructuring from the Group’s decision to exit a 
branded and own label contract in the Bread division.
An impairment charge of £27.2m was recognised in 2011 against assets relating to the Retailer Branded Chilled business as a result of an 
impairment review carried out in light of the decision to sell this business. (Refer to note 14).

Net carrying value of goodwill 713.9 856.2 
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired. The recoverable amount of 
a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations or fair value less costs to sell, depending on the way in which the value of the CGU is 
expected to be recovered.
Key assumptions
The key assumptions for calculating value in use are those relating to the cash flows, long-term growth rate and discount rate.
Cash flow assumptions
The cash flows used in the value in use calculation are pre-tax cash flows based on the latest approved management forecasts in respect of the 
following four years. These are calculated as trading profit before depreciation. Assumptions regarding these future cash flows are based upon actual 
results in prior periods adjusted for expected developments in the following years with reference to market conditions and reasonable management 
expectations for the businesses including short-term growth projections where appropriate. All income and costs are taken into account. 
An estimate of capital expenditure required to maintain these cash flows is also made. 
Long-term growth rate assumptions
The four year management forecasts are extrapolated in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector. The growth rate 
applied is 2.25% (2011: 2.25%) and is not considered to be higher than the average long-term industry growth rate.
Discount rate
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is calculated using a pre-tax rate based on the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) which 
would be anticipated for a market participant investing in the Group. The directors believe it is appropriate to use a single common discount rate 
for all impairment testing as each CGU shares similar risk profiles.
The Group has considered the impact of the current economic climate in determining the appropriate discount rate to use in impairment testing. 
At 31 December 2012, the pre-tax rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows has been determined to be 11.2% (2011: 12.1%).
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash flow 
projections, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence results.
Impairment
A total impairment charge of £23.7m was recognised in the year against intangible assets allocated to the Bread CGU. 
The impairment has arisen as a result of adverse trading conditions experienced during the year. Further impairment would be required in the 
future if performance fell below that which was used in the value in use calculation or the discount rate were to increase. A increase of 0.5% in 
the pre-tax discount rate would decrease the recoverable amount by £13m. A reduction of 1% in the perpetual growth rate would decrease the 
recoverable amount by £20m. Lastly, a 5% decrease in cash flows after the fifth year would decrease the recoverable amount by £17m. Current 
forecasts project revenue growth in the Bread business of 8% over the next four years. Taking into account a reasonable possible change in 
circumstances, for example, a loss of a major contract in 2014, revenue could fall by 5% resulting in a further impairment of £15m.
A total impairment charge of £362.4m was recognised in 2011 against goodwill, other intangible assets and tangible fixed assets. £282.0m was 
recognised against the goodwill and intangible assets allocated to the Bread CGU.
With regards to the Grocery CGU, the directors believe no reasonable change in circumstances that would impact the key assumptions used in 
the impairment testing would cause the carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
Also included within this charge was £80.4m recognised against the assets allocated to the Retailer Branded Chilled CGU which was recorded within 
discontinued operations. This reduced the goodwill and intangible assets to £nil and also reduced the value of tangible fixed assets to their recoverable 
amount. The remaining assets and associated liabilities attributable to the Retailer Branded Chilled business were sold on the 30 December 2011.

20. Bank and other borrowings continued
The borrowings are secured by a floating charge over all assets of the Group.
Cash and bank deposits and short-term borrowings have been offset to the extent possible in accordance with the Group’s banking agreements.
(a) Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement — 2012
In March 2012 the Group signed a re-financing package with its banking syndicate, swap counterparties and pension schemes. This amended 
certain terms of its Senior Term Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility Arrangement of 16 March 2007.
The existing term loan and revolving credit facility, previously due to mature on 31 December 2013, have been extended to a new maturity date of  
30 June 2016. The current applicable bank margin of 2.25% will increase to 3.25% with effect from 1 January 2014.
Additionally, the current amortisation payment schedule has been amended, with amortisations to occur semi-annually from 30 June 2014. 
Banking covenants of net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest remain in place; they will continue to be tested biannually and have been re-set to 
reflect the Group’s strategic plan. 
The total interest rate swap portfolio, including previously restructured swaps, was restructured into additional term loan totalling £188m. Of this 
additional term loan, £106m of the previously restructured swaps will be interest bearing with immediate effect. The remaining £82m of previously 
restructured swaps will attract interest from 1 January 2014. These new tranches of additional term loan will attract the same interest margin as 
the main term loan. The previously arranged agreed swap settlements of £35m in 2012 and £82m in 2013 are no longer applicable. A new floating 
to fixed amortising swap commencing in July 2012, with an initial nominal value of £745m is in place, attracting a swap rate of 1.59%.
All term loan and securitised debt attract interest charges based on LIBOR.
A sliding scale of new deferred fees at market rates will be applicable from 2014 through to 2016, which are payable on a subsequent re-
financing. Planned disposal proceeds are shared between the banks in the banking syndicate (including those swap counterparties whose swaps 
have been restructured into additional term loans as described above).
(b) Other loans
Other loans falling due within one year includes amounts drawn under the debtors securitisation facility, which in 2012 is secured against the 
Group’s trade receivables.
21. Financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (arising from adverse movements in interest rates, commodity prices, and 
foreign currency), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage certain of these risks. The 
management of these risks, along with the day-to-day management of treasury activities is performed by the Group Treasury function. The policy 
framework governing the management of these risks is defined by the Board. The framework for management of these risks is incorporated into a 
policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw material requirements, some of which are considered commodities, and 
also diesel and energy. These commodity and energy contracts are part of the Group’s normal purchasing activities. Some of the risk relating to 
diesel is mitigated with the use of derivative financial instruments. The Treasury Risk Management Committee monitors and reviews the Group’s 
foreign currency exchange, commodity price and energy price exposures and recommends appropriate hedging strategies for each.
(a) Market risk
i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s main operating entities’ functional currency and the Group’s presentational currency is sterling although some transactions are 
executed in non-sterling currencies, including Euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Japanese yen. The transactional 
amounts realised or settled are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies against sterling. Management of these exposures 
is centralised and managed by the Group’s Treasury Function. It is the Group’s policy to manage the exposures arising using forward foreign 
currency exchange contracts and currency options. Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions. 
The Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, principally the Euro. 
The principal foreign currency affecting the translation of subsidiary undertakings within the Group financial statements is the Euro. The rates 
applicable are as follows:
Principal rate of exchange EUR/£

The majority of the Group’s assets and liabilities are denominated in the functional currency of the relevant division or subsidiary.

In addition the Group also has forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at the year end in order to manage the exposures above

Euro (48.6) (54.3)
US dollar (15.2)  (7.8) 
Total (63.8) (62.1)
Sensitivities are disclosed below using the following reasonably possible scenarios.
If the US dollar were to weaken against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would decrease by 
£1.3m (2011: £0.7m decrease).
If the US dollar were to strengthen against sterling by 20 US dollar cents, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would increase by 
£1.6m (2011: £0.9m increase).
If the Euro were to weaken against sterling by 10 Euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would decrease by £2.9m 
(2011: £2.7m decrease).
If the Euro were to strengthen against sterling by 10 Euro cents, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would increase by £3.4m 
(2011: £3.2m increase).
This is primarily driven by the effect on the mark to market valuation of the foreign exchange derivatives of the Group where the hedged rates differ 
from the spot rate. 
(ii) Commodity price risk
The Group purchases a variety of commodities for use in production and distribution which can experience significant price volatility, which 
include, inter-alia, wheat, cocoa, edible oils, diesel and energy. The price risk on these commodities is managed by the Group through the 
Treasury Risk Management Committee. It is the Group’s policy to minimise its exposure to this volatility by adopting an appropriate forward 
purchase strategy or by the use of derivative instruments where they are available.

(iii) Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowing facilities comprise term debt and a revolving facility, principally in sterling. Interest is charged at floating rates plus a margin on 
the amounts drawn down, and at half the margin for the non-utilised portion of the facility, hence the borrowings are sensitive to changes in interest 
rates.
The Group then seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments that reduce the 
level of exposure to floating rates. The target of fixed/capped debt is defined in the Group Treasury policy and procedures however the amount 
hedged can be amended subject to agreement by the Board. Hedge accounting is not sought for these transactions.
The gross cash flows on the interest rate derivatives are sensitive to changes in interest rates as they are driven by three month LIBOR which is 
re-set on a quarterly basis. As at 31 December 2012 the re-set rate was 0.515% (2011: 1.08006%).
The weighted average interest rate for these derivative financial instruments is as follows:

Currency: Sterling
At 31 December 2012 1.6
At 31 December 2011 5.7
The following table reflects the likely contractual maturity date of the interest rate derivative contracts taking into account zero cost call features, 
where market rates at the balance sheet date indicate they will be triggered by the banks. As part of the revised re-financing package the maturity

Fixed rate derivative financial liabilities constitute one swap with a nominal value of £700m which is an amortising floating to fixed interest rate 
swap maturing in 2016.
2011
Fixed rate derivative financial liabilities constitute one swap with a nominal value of £50m which is a conventional interest rate swap maturing in 
2013. It has a callable option whereby the counterparty bank can cancel the swap at nil cost at certain specified dates from June 2011 onwards.
The cap and floor structures have a nominal value of £350m with caps set at 6.15% to 6.25% and floor rates between 4.31% and 4.55%. In 
addition, when LIBOR rates are beneath the floor strike price, a digital option is triggered which results in the Group paying interest at 5.75% on all 
of these instruments for three months.
In 2011 the fixed rate ‘other financial liabilities through profit or loss’ comprised six fixed rate swaps with a nominal value totalling £675m, all due to 
mature in 2013 and other callable swaps comprising a single swap with an optional break at August 2012 and a mandatory break at June 2013. 
These were restructured into additional term loan as part of the March 2012 re-financing.
Cash and deposits earn interest at floating rates based on banks short-term treasury deposit rates. Short-term trade and other receivables are 
interest-free.

The Group’s provisions of £73.9m as at 31 December 2012 (2011: £46.9m) include £18.7m relating to onerous leases (2011: £11.7m) which are 
considered to be floating rate financial liabilities. These cash flows are discounted where the effect is material. 
At 31 December 2012, for every 50 basis points reduction in rates below the last floating re-set rate of 0.515% (based on three month LIBOR), 
with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would decrease by £1.1m (2011: £0.4m increase). 
At 31 December 2012, if interest rates were 200 basis points higher than the last floating re-set rate of 0.515% (based on three month LIBOR), 
with all other variables held constant, annualised net interest expense would increase by £4.5m (2011: £1.6m decrease). 
The Group’s other financial assets and liabilities are not exposed to material interest rate risk.
(b) Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions 
and trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers (though it is the Group’s policy to insure trade debt).
At 31 December 2012, trade and other receivables of £77.9m (2011: £85.8m) were past due but not impaired. These relate to customers with 
whom there is no history of default.

At 31 December 2012, trade and other receivables of £16.3m (2011: £27.5m) were determined to be specifically impaired and provided for. The 
total includes receivables from customers which are considered to be experiencing difficult economic situations.

(c) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly 
basis, normally covering a period of three months.
In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and forecasting processes and performance is monitored 
against this each month. This is intended to give the Board sufficient forward visibility of debt levels.
The Group’s net debt level can vary significantly from month to month and there is some volatility within months. This reflects trading patterns, 
timing of receipts from customers and payments to suppliers, patterns of inventory holdings and the timing of the spend on major capital and 
restructuring projects. For these reasons the debt levels at the year end date may not be indicative of debt levels at other points throughout the 
year.

Fair value estimation
Derivatives
Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Hedge accounting has not been applied to forward contracts 
and as a result the movement in the fair value of £1.9m has been credited to the income statement in the year (2011: £0.9m charge). 
Commodity derivatives are marked to market using prevailing prices and are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the fair value 
movement of £0.2m (2011: £0.8m charge) has been credited to the income statement. 
Interest rate swaps are marked to market using prevailing market prices. Interest rate swaps are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a 
result the movement in the fair value of £14.8m has been charged to the income statement in the year (2011: £17.6m credit). 
Interest rate swaps classed as “Other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” are also marked to market using prevailing market 
prices. These are also not designated for hedge accounting. As a result the movement in the fair value of £5.1m has been credited to the income 
statement in the year (2011: £19.3m credit). 
Short and long-term borrowings, loan notes and interest payable
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest rate cash flows. The fair value of the floating rate debt 
approximates the carrying value above. 
Finance lease liabilities
The fair value of finance lease liabilities approximates book value.
Trade and other receivables/payables
The carrying value of receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to reflect the fair value given their short maturity. The 
fair values of non-current receivables/payables are also considered to be the same as the carrying value due to the size and nature of the balances 
involved.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain items of plant and equipment under finance leases. The average lease term is 3 years, the longest being  
6 years. 
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the average effective borrowing rate was 3.8% (2011: 3.9%).
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date, and thus expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and 
no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying value. The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the 
lessor’s title to the leased assets.
(f) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to reduce debt. 
In order to bring gearing down the Group is in the process of an asset reduction programme aimed at reducing debt. During the year the Group 
has used disposal proceeds of £312.2m to repay borrowings.
As part of the renegotiated banking facilities the Group was required to repay £330m of disposal proceeds by 30 June 2014 to the banking 
syndicate. As at the date of this report this has been exceeded and completed ahead of schedule. (Proceeds of £92.5m from the sale of the 
Sweet Pickles and Table Sauces business was received on 4 February 2013). 
The directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend for the year then ended 31 December 2012 (2011: nil).

21. Financial instruments continued
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by 
total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 were as follows:
2012
£m
2011
£m
Total borrowings (1,003.9) (1,040.9)
Less cash and bank deposits 53.2 45.8
Net borrowings (950.7) (995.1)
Total equity (404.9) (572.7)
Total capital (1,355.6) (1,567.8)
Gearing ratio 70% 63%
Under the Group’s financing arrangement, the Group is required to meet two covenant tests which are calculated and tested on a 12 month rolling 
basis at the half year and full year, each year. The Group has complied with these tests at June and December 2012. 
(g) Financial compliance risk
Risk
The Group continues to operate with a high level of debt (£0.9bn) and is subject to operating within banking covenants set out in its re-financing 
agreement agreed with its bank syndicate in March 2012. This includes net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/interest covenant tests and a requirement 
to realise disposal proceeds of £330m by 30 June 2014. In the event these covenants are not met then the Group would be in breach of its 
financing agreement and, as would be the case in any covenant breach, the banking syndicate could withdraw their funding to the Group.  
In addition to covenant compliance the Group must ensure that it manages its liquidity such that it has sufficient funds to meet its obligations as 
they fall due.
It also supports three defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, all three schemes have significant technical funding deficits which could have an 
adverse impact on the financial condition of the Group. The Company does not pay dividends and is restricted from paying dividends under the 
terms of its financing arrangements. The Group is also restricted from raising additional forms of debt finance (other than a basket of c.£20m) and 
is not able to use free cash flow for acquisitions.
Mitigation
The Group successfully finalised financing arrangements in March 2012 which will provide funding until June 2016.  Following the completion of 
the disposal of the Sweet Pickles and Table Sauces business on 2 February 2013 the Group has successfully met, and indeed exceeded, the 
disposal proceeds target.  In addition the Group achieved its trading expectations for 2012, and successfully implemented a debtor securitisation 
programme to provide additional funding and liquidity. The Group reviews its performance on an ongoing basis and formally tests and reports on 
covenant compliance to the Group’s banking syndicate every six months as well as providing forecast covenant compliance tests twice a year. In 
the event of a forecast covenant breach the Group would seek a covenant waiver or amendment from its banking syndicate that it could obtain 
with a two-thirds majority vote.
The Group manages liquidity risk through both the treasury and finance functions. Cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed on a weekly 
basis, normally covering a period of three months. In addition, cash flow forecasts are prepared as part of the Group’s overall budgeting and 
forecasting processes and performance is monitored against this each month.
Funding agreements have been reached with the trustees of the pension schemes which coupled with the changes to the schemes in the prior 
year mitigate our exposure in 2013. The Group continues to monitor the pension risks closely working with the trustees to ensure a collaborative 
approach.

Restructuring provisions at 31 December 2012 primarily represent provisions in respect of the restructuring of the Bread business and programmes 
aimed at reducing the Group’ s overhead cost base including the closure of the Irish office.
At 31 December 2011, restructuring and redundancy provisions have been raised mainly in respect of various programmes aimed at reducing the 
Group’s cost base in line with the Group’s strategy. The charge in the year relates to the closure of the Group’s Windsor office and reduction of 
headcount in overhead functions. It is expected that the majority of these provisions will be utilised in 2012. The remaining provisions largely relate 
to onerous leases that have arisen due to exiting certain of the Group’s premises, which range from 2 to 21 years.
Other provisions at 31 December 2012 and 2011, primarily relate to insurance claims and dilapidations against leasehold properties. The costs 
relating to dilapidation provisions will be incurred over a number of years in accordance with the length of the leases. These provisions have been 
discounted at rates between 0.54% and 2.82%. The unwinding of the discount is charged to the income statement under interest payable.

23. Retirement benefit schemes
Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes under which employees are entitled to retirement benefits which are based on career 
average salary on retirement. These are as follows:
(a) Premier schemes
The Premier Foods Pension Scheme (“PFPS”) was the principal funded defined benefit scheme within the old Premier Group which also operated 
a smaller funded defined benefit scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme (“PAPPS”) for employees acquired with the Ambrosia 
business in 2001. As a result of the acquisition of Campbell’s in 2006, the Group inherited the Premier Grocery Products Pension Scheme 
(“PGPPS”) covering the employees of Campbell’s UK business, and the Premier Grocery Products Ireland Pension Scheme (“PGPIPS”) covering 
the employees of Campbell’s Ireland. The Group also acquired two further schemes with the acquisition of Chivers Ireland in January 2007, the 
Chivers 1987 Pension Scheme and the Chivers 1987 Supplementary Pension Scheme. These schemes are presented together below as the 
Premier schemes.
(b) RHM schemes
As a result of the acquisition of RHM plc, the Group also acquired the RHM Pension Scheme, the Premier Foods Ireland Pension Scheme (1994), 
the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme and the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements. These schemes are presented together below 
as the RHM schemes, with the exception of the French Termination Indemnity Arrangements which were disposed of with the speciality bakery 
businesses in 2009, and the Premier Foods Ireland Van Sales Scheme which was wound up in 2010. 
The most recent full actuarial valuation of both the PFPS and RHM pension schemes was carried out on 5 April 2010.
The exchange rates used to translate the overseas Euro based schemes are £1.00 = 1.2317 Euros for the average rate during the year, and  
£1.00 = 1.2257 Euros for the closing position at 31 December 2012.
Until 30 June 2011, the employees of the above schemes accrued retirement benefits which varied as a percentage of final salary on retirement. 
On 30 June 2011 the link to final salary was closed to future accrual for UK schemes and members’ retirement benefits will now be linked to their 
salary on that date, index linked at Retail Price Index (subject to a 5% cap) until retirement date. From 1 July 2011 employees accrued career 
average benefits or chose to transfer to the new defined contribution scheme. Those contributing members of the PAPPS and PGPPS choosing 
career average benefits joined the PFPS on 1 July 2011 and transferred their past service entitlements to the scheme. Membership of the Group’s 
defined benefit pension schemes is now closed to new employees, who are entitled to join the Group’s main defined contribution scheme, the 
Group Personal Pension Plan. The closure of the final salary schemes resulted in a past service credit of £12.1m in 2011. 
In July 2010, the UK government announced changes to the inflation index used for statutory pension increases (both for pensions in payment 
and pensions in deferment) to apply to private sector pension schemes. This resulted in a credit to past service costs of £46.4m in respect of the 
RHM Pension scheme during the year. In 2011 a credit of £29.9m in respect of the Premier pension schemes was recognised. 
In March 2012, as part of the Group’s re-financing package, trustees of the Group’s UK pension schemes agreed to defer deficit contribution 
payments until 1 January 2014.
The assets of all defined benefit schemes are held by the trustees of the respective schemes and are independent of the Group’s finances.
The schemes invest through investment managers appointed by the trustees in UK and European equities and in investment products made up 
of a broader range of assets. The plan assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other 
assets used by, the Group. The pension schemes hold a charge over the assets of the Group.
At the balance sheet date, the combined principal actuarial assumptions used for all the schemes were as follows:

Expected salary increases 4.15% 4.15%
Future pension increases 2.10% 2.10%
For the smaller overseas schemes the discount rate used was 3.40% (2011: 5.45%), expected salary increases of 3.00% (2011: 3.00%), and 
future pension increases of 1.75% (2011: 1.75%).

The actual return on plan assets was a £169.0m loss (2011: £417.5m gain), which is £13.3m less (2011: £226.4m more) than the expected return 
on plan assets of £182.3m (2011: £191.1m) at the start of the relevant periods. 
The actuarial loss on liabilities of £218.3m (2011: £305.7m loss) comprises a loss on member experience of £33.6m (2011: £3.5m gain) and an 
actuarial loss due to changes in assumptions of £184.7m (2011: £309.2m loss).
The net actuarial loss taken to the statement of comprehensive income was £231.6m (2011: £79.3m loss). These were £192.5m (2011: £83.4m) 
net of taxation (with tax at 24.0% for UK schemes, and 12.5% for Irish schemes).
The Group expects to contribute approximately £25.6m (2012: £31.9m) to its defined benefit plans in 2013, £23.6m (2012: £26.4m) of regular 
contributions and expenses and £2.0m (2012: £5.5m) of additional contributions to fund the scheme deficits. The decrease in future deficit 
funding is a result of the revised re-financing package whereby the Trustees of the Group’s UK pension schemes have agreed to the suspension of 
deficit contribution payments until 1 January 2014.

of schemes providing life assurance benefits only are operated. The total expense recognised in the income statement of £0.8m (2011: £0.3m) 
represents contributions payable to the plans by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.

 2011 comparatives have been restated following the 10:1 share consolidation effected during 2012.
During 2012, 404 ordinary shares of 10p each were issued to certain employees at a price of 95.5p per ordinary share pursuant to exercise of 
share options.
Share option schemes
The Company has share option schemes for certain senior executives and key individuals. The employees involved in the schemes hold options to 
subscribe for up to 11.6m ordinary shares of 10 pence each between 2010 and 2015, granted at prices ranging between 10 pence per ordinary 
share and 1,860 pence per ordinary share. The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in 
which they may be exercised are given below. For 2012, a summary of the Company’s schemes is as follows:
1.  The Company adopted an Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS”) at the time of admission for executive directors. A portion of the options 
granted under the ESOS have now vested and are exercisable between three and ten years after grant as certain performance criteria have 
been met. These options are equity-settled and the number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the 
periods in which they may be exercised are given below. No further awards are anticipated under this scheme.
2.  A Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees. The employees involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 6.0m 
ordinary shares. The number of shares subject to options, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be 
exercised are given below. These options are equity-settled, have a maximum term of 3.5 years and generally vest only if employees remain in 
employment to the vesting date.
3.  A Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for senior managers. The individuals involved in the scheme have the right to subscribe for up to 0.2m 
ordinary shares at 10 pence per ordinary share. The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the 
periods in which they may be awarded are given below. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of three years. No further 
awards are anticipated under this plan.
The performance and vesting conditions of the scheme have been aligned with those of the Co-Investment Plan below. Since the Company 
was positioned below the median TSR performance target, the required performance conditions were not met and the 2009 award lapsed in 
full. 
4.  A Co-Investment Plan (“CIP”) for directors and senior managers. The scheme is structured as a share matching plan and the individuals 
involved in the scheme are required to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods’ shares. The number 
of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be awarded are given below. These 
awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of three years. No further awards are anticipated under this plan.
The vesting of matching awards is conditional on achievement against a combination of EPS and TSR performance targets. During the year 
performance conditions were not met and so the 2009 CIP award lapsed in full.

5.    A Long-Term Incentive Plan (Performance share award) for directors and senior managers. The individuals in this scheme have the right to 
subscribe to ordinary shares at nil cost. The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in 
which they may be awarded are given below. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of three years. 
 
The vesting of the 2011 award is conditional on achievement of an EPS performance target.
6    A Long-Term Incentive Plan (Matching share award) for directors and senior managers. The scheme is structured as a share matching plan 
and the individuals involved in the scheme are required to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of Premier Foods’ 
shares. The number of shares subject to awards, the periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be awarded are 
given below. These awards are equity-settled and have a maximum term of three years.  
 
The vesting of the 2011 award is conditional on achievement of an absolute share price target.
7.  Deferred share bonus plan for directors. This will operate alongside the cash annual bonus. Growth of branded market share must be 
achieved for the bonus to become payable and the Group trading profit target must be met. 
 
In 2012 two new schemes were introduced: 
8.  A Long-Term Incentive Plan for directors and senior managers. There are two performance conditions applying to the Award. Two thirds of 
the Award is subject to a performance condition based on absolute adjusted earnings per share targets. The remaining third of the Award is 
subject to a performance condition based on the achievement of an average share price target. The number of shares subject to awards, the 
periods in which they were granted and the periods in which they may be awarded are given below. These awards are equity-settled and have 
a maximum term of three years. 
9.  An executive scheme share option plan. Members of the executive scheme are awarded share options subject to varying performance 
conditions including continued employment over a certain time period.

Leases primarily relate to the Group’s properties, which principally comprise offices and factories. Lease payments are typically subject to market 
review every five years to reflect market rentals, but because of the uncertainty over the amount of any future changes, such changes have not 
been reflected in the table above. Within our leasing arrangements there are no significant contingent rentals, renewal, purchase or escalation 
clauses.
The Group sub-lets various properties under non-cancellable lease arrangements. Sub-lease receipts of £1.2m (2011: £1.4m) were recognised in 
the income statement during the year. The total future minimum sub-lease payments at the year end is £3.4m (2011: £4.5m).

1.  Accounting policies
Basis of preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable 
accounting standards in the United Kingdom (“UK GAAP”), under the historical cost convention. The loss for the year of £246.4m (2011: 
£1,017.5m) is recorded in the accounts of Premier Foods plc. The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below are the most appropriate and have been consistently applied.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS (revised 1996) on the grounds 
that the Group includes the Company in its consolidated financial statements that are publically available.
The Company is exempt under the terms of Financial Reporting Standard 8 “Related Party Transactions” (“FRS 8”) from disclosing related party 
transactions with entities that are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Premier Foods plc Group or investees of the Premier Foods plc Group.
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their value.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account deferred taxation. The Company provides in full for deferred tax 
arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their inclusion in tax computations to 
the extent that a liability or an asset is expected to be payable or recoverable in the foreseeable future. The Company discounts its deferred tax 
liability as appropriate.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each balance sheet date on the same basis.
Cash and liquid resources
Short-term cash deposits, which can be called on demand without any material penalty, are included within cash balances in the balance sheet.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using an option-pricing model. In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 20, 
Share-Based Payment (“FRS 20”), the resulting cost is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the options for employees 
employed by the Parent Company, or treated as an investment in subsidiaries in respect of employees employed by the subsidiaries where the 
cost is recharged. The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders, and for interim dividends in the period in which they are paid.
Operating lease agreements
Leases in which a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rental costs 
under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease 
period.
2. Operating profit
Audit fees in respect of the Company are £nil (2011: £nil). Note 5b of the Group consolidated financial statements provides details of the 
remuneration of the Company’s auditors on a Group basis.
At 31 December 2012, the Company had three employees (2011: two), and their remuneration totalled £2.3m (2011: £2.3m). This excludes the 
Company’s eight (2011: six) non executive directors whose remuneration totalled £0.7m (2011: £0.7m). Directors’ emolument disclosures are 
provided in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 56 to 65 of this annual report.

The directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets.
Impairment
An impairment charge of £254.0m (2011:  £1,024.2m) was recognised in the year against the value of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries.
During 2012, a capital contribution of £3.4m (2011: £4.2m) was given in the form of share incentive awards to employees of subsidiary companies 
which were reflected as an increase in investments. See note 16 in the Group financial statements for a list of the principal subsidiary undertakings. 
The companies listed in note 16 in the Group financial statements are those that principally affect the results and assets of the Company. The 
directors consider that to give full particulars of subsidiary undertakings would lead to a statement of excessive length. A full list of subsidiary 
undertakings is available from the Company Secretary.

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (AGM)
The AGM usually takes place in London and is an opportunity for all 
shareholders to ask questions and vote on the resolutions put forward by 
the Board. At least 20 working days before the AGM the Notice of AGM, 
a copy of this annual report (if they request a copy in writing) and a Form 
of Proxy are issued to shareholders. All documents relating to the AGM 
are available on the Group’s website.
The Notice of AGM sets out the proposed resolutions and a brief 
synopsis of each of them. Shareholders are invited to either attend the 
AGM in person or appoint a proxy to vote on their behalf. Voting at the 
AGM is by poll as this gives a more democratic outcome given that 
the proxy votes are added to the votes cast in person. Details of the 
proxy votes for, against and withheld are made available on the Group’s 
website after the AGM.
The Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration committees 
are normally available at the AGM to take any relevant questions and all 
other directors are expected to attend. All directors attended the 2012 
AGM.

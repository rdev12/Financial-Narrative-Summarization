addressed the market changes in order to have a
soundly based build and sales programme for
future years.
We offer a range of incentives available to attract
sales and importantly a comprehensive product
range to address the density requirements of
Planning Consents and the needs of the first time
buyer. The features of the current market and
planning requirements have impacted on the
average selling price of dwellings which fell to
£150,466 from £154,650 in 2004. However, the
price per square foot of units sold rose by 3.0% in
the year.
I believe that a very significant factor in the year’s
achievements has been the increase in the number
of plots held for future development, which has
risen to 2,030 (2004: 1,770) with a further 1000
plots under contract. Whilst borrowings have had
to increase in pursuing this policy, these are
satisfactorily matched against the value of the land
held for development.
We have recruited additional skilled personnel into
our management team and I wish to thank all our
employees for their assistance and efforts during
the year.
Future Prospects
Whilst economic factors and movement in interest
rates will always play a role in our industry, your
Board feels that the increased critical mass of the
Company in terms of sites under development and
future land bank, place it in a strong position to
continue the momentum of its growth programme.
The increased flexibility afforded by the enlarged
land bank and product range give the Board
confidence in delivering satisfactory returns to
shareholders whilst maintaining the resource for
future growth.
Dividend
The Board will recommend a final dividend for
2005 of 10p per share, which together with the
interim dividend of 5p per share paid in September
2005, will make an unchanged total of 15p based
on the 2005 results.
Ordinary Shareholders on the register at the close
of business on 7 April 2006 will receive the final
dividend of 10p per ordinary share on 5 May 2006.
Results
I am pleased to report continued growth in the level
of our activities in terms of volume output of new
homes, turnover and increases in our land bank.
Inevitably, profitability declined in our sector as
the price inflation experienced over recent years
levelled out and increased build costs were
experienced.
T urnover increased by 26.6% to £103.2m from
£81.5m from the sale of 686 plots as against 527
in 2004.
Profit before taxation was £12.7m compared to
£16.4m in 2004, this result being partly influenced
by additional interest charges of £1.6m, incurred in
financing the strengthening of our future land
bank. At the operating level, margins declined to
15.6% from 22.3% and Operating Profits to
£16.1m from £18.2m.
As a result of the above, Earnings per Share fell by
24.8% to 75.2p (2004: 100.0p).
Review of Operations
As reported in my last Statement, national monetary
policy began to have a dampening effect on house
prices in the latter half of 2004. Additionally, there
followed a period of considerable uncertainty as
to the future direction of prices and thereby in
customer confidence. I am pleased to say that
price levels in our area appear to have stabilised
and that we have been able to achieve our projected
volumes and continue a policy of enhancement to
the land bank.
Profitability has declined from the unsustainable
levels of recent years but I feel that we have

Ben Bailey Plc
2005 was a year in which further significant
progress was made by the Company. T urnover and
output reached record levels and illustrated that
the Company is well placed to increase its scale of
operations further. Once again, 2005 saw
significant increases in the Company’s land bank,
which leaves the company well placed to further
increase output in 2006 and subsequent years.
The Market
There was no doubt that a number of adverse
factors affected the housing market in our area of
operations. Adverse comments regarding house
prices which led to a loss in consumer confidence
dampened the market particularly following the
General Election in May.
Increased sales incentives, in common with other
housebuilders assisted in increasing our volume
output during the year, albeit at a lower margin
than previous years.
Financial Review
Reporting Requirements
The 2005 Accounts have been prepared under
International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). The main impact of adopting IFRS has
been in three areas, namely:- accounting for
dividends when the company has a current
obligation to pay them; charging the value of share
options to the income statement; and changing
the method of accounting for financial
instruments in the balance sheet.
T urnover
T urnover increased by 26.6% to £103.2m (2004:
£81.5m) all of which was derived from sales of
new houses. The number of legal completions
increased by 30% in the year to 686 plots (2004:
527 plots). The average selling price per house fell
in 2005 to £150,466 (2004: £154,650), largely as a
result of changes in product mix from 3/4
bedroomed homes to smaller dwellings and
apartments.
Profits
Profits before taxation declined to £12.7m, (2004:
£16.4m), due to the lower operating margins
achieved and the higher incidence of interest
charges incurred in financing expansion of our
land bank. Operating Margins also declined to
15.6% (2004: 22.3%). This reduction was caused
by a number of factors including levelling out of
selling prices, product mix and higher build costs. 
The taxation charge for the year was £3.69m
(2004: £4.64m). This charge represents 29.2% of
the pre-tax profits.
Balance Sheet
2005 saw a further increase in the Company’s
capital employed from £67.9 m to £95.5m,
reflecting the increase in the value of development
land and work in progress to £112.9m from
£83.8m.
The Company’s land bank has increased further
to 2,030 plots (2004: 1,770 plots) with detailed
planning permission granted. A further 1,000 plots
are held where contracts have been exchanged.
The investment in 2005 in development land of
£39.4m has resulted in a net cash outflow of
£19.1m. Borrowings increased during the year to
£54.8m, giving a gearing ratio, expressed as a
percentage net debt to shareholder funds of
134.6% (2004: 99.5%).

Chief Executive’s Review
4
Treasury and Interest Rate Risk
During the course of 2005, the Company re-
negotiated its borrowing facilities from its banker.
The borrowing facilities now comprise a
committed five year facility of £58 million
together with an overdraft and other short-term
facilities of £13.5 million.
In order to mitigate the potential implications of
adverse interest rate movements, the Company
entered into an interest rate swap agreement,
whereby £30 million of the Company’s
borrowings has been fixed at a rate of 5.2% for a
period of five years. Under IAS 39, this
investment is deemed to be a fully effective cash
flow hedge.
Health and Safety
The Company is committed to the objective of
creating an accident free working environment.
Risk Assessments continue to be carried out on all
developments with particular emphasis to ensure
that all Health & Safety issues have been
identified and addressed. External consultants are
employed to carry out independent Health &
Safety audits on all developments.
T raining
The Company continues to provide a high level of
training to all staff including management
development programmes for Middle Managers,
Health & Safety training for all site based staff and
NHBC Site Managers Accreditation courses for
Site Managers. The Company continues its
significant investment in apprentice schemes for
both bricklayers and joiners.
Following the success of the development
programme which enables apprentices to train as
Site Managers, the Company has decided to
increase its investment in this key area.
Design and Development
During the year a complete review of the
Company’s product range has been implemented
with regard being paid to customer feedback and
changes in planning requirements. These new
designs are being incorporated in developments to
achieve greater flexibility in the utilisation of land.

Ben Bailey Plc
Land
Considerable progress has been made during the
year in enhancing and expanding the land bank.
Expenditure in 2005 amounted to £39.4million
which has resulted in an increase in the land bank
to 2,030 plots. In line with Government
requirements 77% of the expenditure was on land
classified as brownfield. Further investment in
land is expected in 2006 which will further
enhance our land bank, enabling the Company to
plan ahead with certainty whilst mitigating the
potential adverse impact of planning delays.
Construction
During 2005, the number of completed houses
has increased significantly. Although the shortage
of skilled craftsmen remains a factor within our
industry, the Company believes that the steps
taken in increased training and enhanced benefits
is now paying dividends.
Quality
The quality of our product continues to be a key
issue in the development of our business.
Customer feedback from post completion
customer questionnaires reveals that in 2005 95%
of our customers would recommend our product.
It is a testament to our commitment to quality that
the recommendation rate is still in excess of 90%
despite the significant increase in volume output.
Our high level of quality was also recognised in
2005 by the Company achieving the runner-up
position in the ‘Housebuilder of the Year’ award
run by the Building Magazine. This result was
based on a number of criteria including customer
feedback, charitable work in the community and
development of brownfield sites.
Ben Bailey in the Community
Once again in 2005, Ben Bailey’s contribution to
local communities has been recognised by the
Business in the Communities Per Cent Standard
Award, which is given to companies who
contribute at least 1% of their profits to charities
and local community projects.
Employees and Sub-Contractors
Once again, this result would not have been
achieved without the effort and support from all
our employees and sub-contractors. On behalf of
the Board, I thank them for their efforts and
commitment.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Derivatives and other Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings and other items such as trade debtors and
trade creditors which arise directly from operations. It is, and has been throughout the period under
review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Detailed

Taxation status
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the Income and Corporation T axes Act
1988 and there has been no change in this respect since 31 December 2005.
Independent Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed
at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
A notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 12 noon on 28 April 2006 at the
Doncaster Holiday Inn (formerly Doncaster Moat House) is set out on pages 46 to 47, and a proxy form
for use in relation to such meeting accompanies this document. Your attention is drawn to the items of
special business, being resolutions 8 to 10 set out in such Notice of Meeting.
Resolution 8
Under Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985, if the directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares
for cash, they must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they
each hold at that time. Resolution 8, a special resolution, proposes to grant limited power to the directors
to allot shares for cash without the need to first offer them to existing shareholders. The power being
sought will permit the directors to deal with problems arising from fractional entitlements in any rights
issue, to allot shares pursuant to the Company’s Executive and Savings-Related Share Option Schemes
and to allot up to 597,169 shares (representing approximately five per cent of the current issued share
capital as at the date of this document) and will expire no later than fifteen months from the passing of
the resolution. The directors intend to comply with the cumulative limits on exercise of the
disapplication entitlement which are contained in the Pre-Emption Group guidelines of the Investment
Committees.
60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 9 Directors’ Report (continued)
Resolution 9
This resolution seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to purchase up to 1,194,339
ordinary shares, an aggregate nominal amount of £119,434, which is equivalent to approximately 10% of
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at 31 December 2005. The authority will expire at the end
of next year’s Annual General Meeting and the resolution specifies the maximum and minimum prices
at which the shares may be bought. Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the
overall financial position of the Company will be taken into account before deciding upon this course of
action. Any shares purchased in this way will be cancelled and the number of shares in issue will
accordingly be reduced. The directors have no immediate intention of exercising the proposed authority
when it becomes effective, but believe that the ability of the Company to buy its own shares if, in the
directors’ opinion, market prices do not reflect the Company’s worth, will be in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders. The directors intend to exercise this power only if they believe the effect
of such purchases will increase earnings per ordinary share.
The authority will expire on whichever is the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting or 28 October 2007.
Resolution 10
Resolution 10, an ordinary resolution, proposes the approval of the renewal of the annual and long-term
bonus scheme.  As explained on page 12 in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Company proposes
to renew the annual and long-term bonus scheme. This scheme, which has been in operation for a
number of years, is designed to encourage long-term achievement by its executive directors and to link
the performance of those directors to the long-term financial performance of the Company. Further
details of the scheme are set out in the Appendix on page 48.

60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 10 Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors who are B Leesing
(Chairman of the Committee), A M Peacock and R M T eare.  
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) decides the remuneration policy that
applies to executive directors and the Group’s other senior management. In determining that policy, it
has given full consideration to the principles of the Combined Code.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee considers the basic salary and benefits available to
executive directors of comparable companies both in size and within the house building sector.  
The Remuneration Committee takes into account the need to attract and retain directors of an
appropriate calibre and the need to ensure the commitment of executive directors to the continued
success of the Company. No external consultants were used by the Committee in the year in advising
the Remuneration Committee on remuneration policy. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee will be available for inspection at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each receive a fee for their services which is approved by the Board,
following recommendation by the Chairman of the Company. The level of remuneration paid to non-
executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities required by the role.
The non-executive directors do not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor do
they participate in any of the bonus or incentive schemes or share option schemes.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company . They are appointed on the
basis of serving at least a period of one year.
Remuneration policy for all executive directors
The Group provides competitive remuneration packages in order to attract, retain and motivate
executives who are expected to meet high levels of performance. The structure of the remuneration
package has been designed to:
• ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term
incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executive’s performance criteria, which are
aligned to the interests of shareholders; and
• provide employment related benefits including the provision of a company car, life assurance,
medical insurance and pension.
Salaries and benefits
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive
directors.

60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 11 Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 
Share options
Throughout the year the Company has operated an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and an Unapproved Executive Scheme. All of these
arrangements, which were established in 1998, were approved at the 1998 Annual General Meeting of
the Company.
Following changes to the relevant legislation in 1996, the maximum value of shares over which options
may be granted under an Inland Revenue approved scheme to any one individual may not exceed
£30,000. The Unapproved Scheme will enable additional options to be granted to employees and
directors on an unapproved basis in excess of this limit. However, the Remuneration Committee has
imposed a limit on the grant of options under this scheme to any one individual. T aking into account
options granted to an individual in the previous ten years, under any option scheme of the Company,
options granted under the Unapproved Scheme to that individual may not exceed four times his
remuneration for the current or preceding financial year. 
Options granted under the Approved Scheme will normally be exercisable within the period of between
three to ten years after the date of grant and, for options granted under the Unapproved Scheme, within
three to seven years. In establishing the executive schemes, the Committee has decided to subject grants
made under the Approved and Unapproved Schemes to performance criteria, such that options may
only be exercised if, over a consecutive three year period, there has been a growth in the Company’s
earnings per share in excess of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum. Options granted under the
Approved Scheme are not offered at a discount.
Under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, employees who are eligible to participate in the
Sharesave Scheme will be invited to enter a savings contract the proceeds of which, after three, five or
seven years, can be used to exercise share options granted at the start of the contract. The Sharesave
Scheme gives the Board discretion to offer a discount on the exercise price of up to 20% of the relevant
middle market price at the date of grant.
The Committee supports employee participation in the Company through employee share schemes and
believes that these schemes play a useful role in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
Annual and long-term bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual and long-term bonus scheme (“the Bonus Scheme”) for the executive
directors, including B R Bailey, the Chairman of the Company. The Bonus Scheme has run for a fixed
three year period to 31 December 2005.  It is linked to the amount by which the average annual growth
in the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeds the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum over
the three year period from a base point of 34.0p per share. Earnings per share is believed to be an
appropriate measure for growth given the size and structure of the Company. Annual bonuses are
payable under the Bonus Scheme amounting to the relevant EPS growth factor for that year applied
to 60% of basic annual salary.  The final bonus is paid at the end of the three year period and will be
based upon the average annual EPS growth factor for the period and applied to basic annual salary, less
any annual bonuses paid under the Bonus Scheme. Over the three year period, the maximum bonus
payable to each director shall not exceed two and half times the executive director’s basic salary for the
three year period.
The Remuneration Committee has recommended that the Group should extend the existing scheme for
a further period of three years with the following amendments:
a) A discretionary annual bonus based upon the achievement of certain financial and operational
targets set by the Remuneration Committee. The amount of such bonus shall not exceed 20% of
the executive director’s basic salary for the year.
12 Ben Bailey Plc
60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 12 Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 
b) The bonus payable will be based on the percentage increase in the Group’s earnings per share.
The percentage bonus payable will be reduced by the percentage increase in the Retail Price
Index for the same period plus 3%. The bonus so calculated shall be reduced by the amount of
any bonus awarded under a) above.
c) The maximum amount payable under this bonus scheme payable to any executive director will
not be more than three times the executive director’s average basic salary for the three year period.
The Remuneration Committee has recommended that this amended scheme be put before members at
the Annual General Meeting for approval. Further details of this scheme are given in the Appendix to
these financial statements on page 48.
Service contracts
The service contract of B R Bailey is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
one year’s notice of termination by B R Bailey.
The service contract of P A Russell is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
six months’ notice of termination by P A Russell.
The service contract of S W North is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
six months’ notice of termination by S W North.
All of the service contracts are rolling one year contracts.
Total Shareholder Return
Schedule 7A to the Companies Act requires the Company to publish in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report a line graph which shows the total shareholder return on a holding of the Company’s shares
against a holding of hypothetical shares measured by reference to a broad equity index. T otal shareholder
return is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders reflecting share
price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. It is, therefore, considered to be a good
indicator of a company’s overall performance.
The performance chart shown below illustrates the Company’s total return over the past five years
compared to the performance of the Small Capital Index, which the Remuneration Committee believes
to be the most appropriate index to be used given the size of the Company.

Corporate Governance
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
Following the publication of the Combined Code which is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority (“the Code”), the Board has continued to review its Corporate Governance practices and
an explanation of how the Principles of Good Governance have been applied are contained in this report and
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 11 to 16.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good governance and this statement describes
how the relevant principles of governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with
the code provisions set out in Part 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board considers that, throughout the period under review, the Company has complied with the
provisions recommended in Section 1 of the Combined Code with the following exception:
• B R Bailey, Chairman and executive director of the Board has been a member of the Audit
Committee.
Group Objectives and Board of Directors
The objective of the Group is to build quality homes at realistic prices for its customers whilst securing the
optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders.
The Board comprises three Non-Executive Directors who are all considered to be independent. B Leesing
was appointed to the Board in 1989.  Notwithstanding this fact the Board considers that he is independent
and his knowledge and experience of the Company and the house building sector are invaluable. The Board
considers that this composition now provides an appropriate segregation of responsibilities, and independent
non-executive director representation for the current size of the Group. One third of directors, including
Non-Executive Directors, are subject to retirement by rotation annually .
Individual profiles of the directors are given on page 6. The Board has the necessary knowledge and
experience to achieve the stated objectives of the Group and retain effective control over the Group.
Board Practices
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and not less than eight times per annum to monitor the
performance of the Group, to authorise capital expenditure and purchases of land, to approve annual budgets
and to monitor business performance. Strategy on interest rate exposures is approved by the Board. In the
year ended 31 December 2005, the Board met eight times. Information is provided to the Board in a detailed
and timely manner in order to allow informed decisions to be taken on all matters.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of reserved powers as well as an agreed procedure for a director
to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense, and to have full access to the
services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that the Board procedures
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with. Directors’ and Officers’ Liability
Insurance is in place for directors and officers.
The Board is scheduled to hold ten meetings in 2006 and adhoc meetings may be convened to deal with
urgent matters.

B R Bailey
A M Peacock
R M T eare
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee, which meets three times a year, include the appointment of
and liaison with external auditors, the review of annual and interim financial statements and the review of
the suitability and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls. The Committee reviews the findings of the
external auditors and reviews key accounting policies and judgements. It also reviews the independence of
the external auditors on an annual basis.
The fees relating to non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are disclosed in Note 6 to
the accounts. The main area of non-audit work relates to the provision of taxation compliance work and
taxation advice. The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of non-audit work and has concluded that this
level of fee does not affect the independence of the Audit.
Remuneration Committee B Leesing (Chairman)
A M Peacock
R M T eare
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include the recommendation of terms of
employment, including remuneration, and grant of bonuses and share options for all executive directors, as
may be appropriate from time to time.
Under Resolution 2 the Remuneration Committee report will be put before shareholders for approval at the
Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2006.

60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 18 Board Remuneration
The Group’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration policy that applies to executive directors
and senior management of the Group. In setting the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee
considers the basic salary and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies, the need to
attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre, and the need to ensure the commitment of executive
directors to the continued success of the Group. Bonus packages for executive directors are linked to the
Group’s objective of securing optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders.
Shareholder Communication
The majority of the shareholders of the Group are private individuals. Presentations to City Analysts have
been made in the past year by the Chief Executive and Finance Director. All shareholders are welcome to
attend the Annual General Meeting at which they have the opportunity to ask questions of the Board.
Performance Evaluation
During 2005, the Board undertook performance evaluations for the Board and its principal committees.
This process will be repeated on an annual basis.
This performance evaluation covered assessment of the working of the Board and assessment of each
individual director’s contribution to the working of the Board. The appraisals of Non-Executive Directors
were carried out by the Chairman.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director are subject to an appraisal of their performance as executive
directors which is conducted by the Chairman and the Chief Executive respectively .
Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
Internal Control
The Group’s control environment is the responsibility of the Group’s directors and managers at all levels.
The Board is, therefore, responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Although no control system can provide absolute protection against material mis-statement or
loss, it is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide the directors
with reasonable assurance that problems should be identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately .
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control throughout the period
and up to the date of this report. In accordance with the T urnball Guidance the Group has reviewed its
operations and identified risk areas, which have been assessed for their potential impact on the business. The
size of the Group, together with the fact that virtually all of the Group’s operations derive from one
company , Ben Bailey Homes Limited, allows the Executive Directors of the Group to monitor performance,
evaluate and manage on a continual basis the risks faced by the Group. No internal audit function is
considered necessary . The need for an internal audit function is reviewed annually .

Corporate Governance (continued) 
60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 19 Corporate Governance (continued)
The key features of the Group’s internal controls are as follows:
• Defined authorisation levels for the purchases of land and capital expenditure.
• Defined authorisation levels for the placing of orders and contracts.
• A formalised reporting structure which includes the setting of detailed annual budgets, which are
updated on a regular basis to form forecasts, which are reviewed at both Group and Subsidiary
Company Board level.
• Monthly Board/Executive Meetings are held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited at which all key
aspects of the business are discussed including comparison of actual performance compared with
budgets.
• A monthly meeting is held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review the production progress on
all sites, sales position, technical and development issues arising from each development.
• All sites are visited on a monthly basis by the Group Chairman together with the Construction,
Development and Sales Directors of Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review progress on site. During
2005, the Non-Executive Directors have on one occasion attended these site visits.
• The Group’s reporting systems provide weekly updates on key statistics including sales, production
and gross margin analysis by development.
• Daily cash movements are reconciled and monitored by the Finance Director. The Group’s cashflow
is also monitored monthly in comparison to budget and forecast.
The Board reviews management letters prepared by the external auditors and considers the suitability of
suggested improvements to the system of internal financial controls.

60227 Ben Bailey 07-40  24/2/06  11:37 am  Page 20 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
• State that the financial statements comply with IFRS.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial
statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements are also published on the Company’s website, the maintenance and integrity of
which is the responsibility of the directors. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of

We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’)
of Ben Bailey Plc for the year ended 31 December 2005 which comprise the Consolidated Income
Statement, the Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group and Parent Company Cash
Flow Statements, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income and Expense and the related
notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having
been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985
and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We
also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the company’s compliance with the
nine provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the
Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited financial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the
unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Corporate Governance Statement and the other items
listed in the contents section. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Shareholders of
Ben Bailey Plc (continued) 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of its profit
and cash flows for the year then ended;
• the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies
Act 1985, of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 and cash flows for
the year then ended; and 
• the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out
below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been
prepared under the historical cost convention. A summary of the more important Group accounting
policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous
policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount,
event of actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the audited financial statements of the
Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to the year-end. Intra-group sales and profits
are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Revenue
Revenue, which excludes value added tax, sales between Group companies and trade discounts,
represents the invoiced value of new houses and land, less any allowances given, and relates wholly to
operations in the United Kingdom. Proceeds from the sales of part exchange houses and undeveloped
land, purchased for immediate resale are excluded from turnover.
Revenue and profits on house-building sales are recognised in the financial statements on legal
completion.
The purchase and disposal of land held for development is recognised when unconditional contracts
have been exchanged.
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of
acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated at rates intended to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment on a
straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The principal useful lives used
for this purpose are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings 2 to 5 years
Showhouse furniture 2 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is charged on property, plant and equipment from when the asset is available for use.
Investments
Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost less any provision for impairment which is charged
to the income statement.

29 Ben Bailey Plc
Land held for development, stocks and work in progress
Land held for development, stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct expenditure together with an appropriate proportion of production
overheads. The cost of land held for development is transferred into housing developments in progress
as building work on each unit commences.
Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which stock could be realised after allowing for
costs of realisation. Provision is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
Deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial
statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither
accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred income tax is determined using
tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are
expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax
liability is settled. 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will
be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and
associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor
are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the
income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a Group Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution scheme, which was
established on 1 April 1997. Pension contributions made to this and other personal pension plans, on
behalf of employees, are charged to the income statement in the year in which the contributions become
payable.
Financial risk management
The Group’s significant debt financing exposes it to the effects of changes in interest rates. The Group
has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial
performance of the Group by using financial instruments to fix interest rates.
a)  Interest rate risk
The Group has interest bearing liabilities. The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 50% of
interest bearing liabilities at fixed rates by utilising interest rate swaps. At the year end 54.7% of interest
bearing liabilities were at fixed rates. The Group has used interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of
future interest payments, which have the effect of increasing the proportion of fixed interest debt.
b)  Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has implemented policies that
require full settlement for the property before the property is handed over for occupation by the customers.
c)  Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are
designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
During the year, the Group entered into a new £58 million facility expiring in May 2010, of which
£13.45m remained undrawn at the year end. In addition, there are other facilities totalling £13.5m, of
which £3.21m remained undrawn at the year-end.

Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities for the year ended
31 December 2004
Where financial instruments are used as hedges against financial risks, they are matched at their inception
to the specific exposures they are designed to reduce. Gains and losses are released to the income
statement in the same period as the income and costs of the hedged transactions. Outstanding contracts
used to hedge against items which themselves will be accounted for in the profits and losses of a future
period, are not recognised, or are deferred when they mature and are carried forward to match against
corresponding gains and losses when they occur.
Had IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ been adopted for the year ended 31
December 2004, the movement in the fair value of cash flow hedges would have been reported in the
income statement as the Group had not complied with the hedge documentation criteria of IAS 39.
These fair value movements are not considered material.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities under IAS 39
Derivatives are initially accounted and measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered
into and subsequently measured at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement is taken to the income
statement except where the derivative is a designated cash-flow hedging instrument. The Group
designates derivatives as a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or
commitment (‘cash flow hedge’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship
between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document
and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an on-going basis. This effectiveness
testing is re-performed at each period end to assess whether the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. Where
the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability only gains or losses previously recognised
in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the asset or liability affects the profit or
loss. If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses
deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income
or expenditure. The ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised in
profit and loss.
For the portion of hedges deemed ineffective or transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting
under IAS 39, any change in assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only
transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the
income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in
equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the
balance sheet date if they are publicly traded.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are
assumed to approximate to their book values. In the case of bank loans and other loans due in more than
one year the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the
future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.
Share based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees. In accordance with IFRS 2,
‘share based payments’, equity-settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of
grant, in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested at 31 December
2004. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will
eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to
become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, of any, in the income
statement, and a corresponding adjustment over the vesting period.

20 OPTIONS IN SHARES OF BEN BAILEY PLC
Executive Share Option Scheme
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, directors and senior employees of Group Companies have
options to subscribe for ordinary shares of 10p each. Share options were exercised by seven senior
employees for 75,000 shares during the year. No options were granted in the year.  Excluding options
held by the directors, options outstanding in respect of senior employees under the share option scheme
at 31 December 2005, together with the option prices and dates, were as follows:
2005 2004 Date 
Date of Number of Number of Exercise from which Expiry

The mid-market share price at 31 December 2005 was 453.5p per share and the range during 2005 was
344.5p to 511.5p per share. The interests of the directors in share options are disclosed on page 15 in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report.
21    SHARE BASED PAYMENTS 
Options are granted under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme and are exercisable at a price equal
to the average quoted market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period of
the grant is 3 years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the
options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Options were valued using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model. The fair value per option granted
and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:-
Date of Grant 07.08.2003 19.04.2004
Share price at grant date 273.5p 464.0p
Exercise Price 273.5p 464.0p
Number of employees 3 29
Shares under option 28,793 84,168
Under option vesting period (years) 3 3
Expected volatility 43% 47%
Option life (years) 10 10
Expected life (years) 3 3
Risk Free Rate 5.0% 5.0%
Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 3.3% 3.3%
Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting nil nil
Expectations of meeting performance criteria 90% 90%
Fair value per option 94.7p 172.8p
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over
the previous 3 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimates, for the
effect of non-transferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Explanation of reconciling items between UK GAAP and IFRS
Under UK Company law, companies were required to provide for their final dividend in their closing
balance sheet and in advance of the dividend being declared and approved by the Annual General
Meeting. Under IAS 10, ‘Events after the balance sheet date’, the dividend did not represent a liability.
At 31 December 2004 accrued dividends of £1,187,000 were removed from other liabilities.
In the parent company an adjustment of £8,000,000 was made to amounts owed by Group undertakings
in respect of dividends receivable from subsidiary companies.
Under IFRS 2 a charge is required for all share-based payments including share options. The charge in
the income statement is based on the fair value of the options at grant date. Under UK GAAP , the profit
and loss charge, if any, is based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the
date of issue. In the year ended 31 December 2004, a charge of £55,000 was required under IFRS 2.
There is no impact on net assets.  
The adjustments set out above are those that were included in the 2005 interim financial statements sent
to shareholders in August 2005.

2 An award will entitle the executive director to:
2.1 A discretionary annual bonus based upon the achievement of certain financial and operational targets set by the
Remuneration Committee. The amount of such bonus shall not exceed 20% of the executive directors’ basic salary for
the year.
2.2 A long-term cash bonus, payable after the announcement by the Company of its results for the accounting period to 31
December 2008, equal to a certain percentage of the executive directors’ average basic salary for the three year period to
31 December 2008, that percentage being equal to three times the amount by which the average percentage increase in
the Company’s earnings per share for the three year period exceeds the average percentage increase in the Retail Price
Index plus 3% for the same period, less the amounts of the annual bonuses (if any) paid as mentioned in 2.3 and 2.4
below. The maximum amount payable may not exceed three times the executive directors’ average basic salary for the
three year period.
2.3 The annual bonus for the accounting period ended 31 December 2006 to be paid after the announcement by the
Company of its final results for that year. The amount of the annual bonuses will be 60% of the executive directors’ basic
salary for the accounting period multiplied by the percentage by which the Company’s earnings per share for the year
ended 31 December 2006 exceeds 75.2p. The percentage bonus payable will be reduced by the percentage increase in
the Retail Price Index for the same period plus 3%. The bonus so calculated shall be reduced by the amount of any bonus
awarded under 2.1 above.
2.4 An annual bonus for the accounting period ended 31 December 2007 to be paid after the announcement by the
Company of its final results for that year. The amount of the annual bonuses will be 60% of the executive directors’ basic
salary for that accounting period multiplied by the percentage by which the Company’s increase in earnings per share
for that period exceeds the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index for the same period plus 3%. The bonus so
calculated shall be reduced by the amount of a bonus awarded under 2.1 above.
For this purpose, earnings per share means the Company’s earnings per share as shown in the audited accounts of the
Company for the relevant accounting period subject to such adjustments as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate
to take account of variations in the Company’s share capital, exceptional items and disposals of shares or assets by the
Company.
3 In the event that any of the executive directors ceases to be an executive director of the Company before the end of the three
year period:
3.1 He may retain any annual bonus which has already been paid. Where he leaves after the end of an accounting period but
before the Company has announced its final results for that year, he will be entitled to the payment which he would
have received once that announcement has been made had he remained as an executive director.
3.2 The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the executive director shall be entitled to any payment in respect
of the accounting period in which he ceases to be employed, but this shall not exceed the amount which he would have
received for that accounting period had he remained an executive director throughout, reduced pro rata by reference to
his period of service in that accounting period.
4 If an executive director is appointed during an accounting period, he will be entitled to join the scheme with effect from the
beginning of the next accounting period.  At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, he may be paid a bonus in
respect of the accounting period in which he joins, but not in excess of the amount of the annual bonus he would have
received for that period had he been appointed at the beginning of that accounting period, reduced pro rata to reflect his
period of service.
5 In the event of a takeover of the Company during any accounting period, a pro-rata share of the award which would otherwise
have been payable for that accounting period, based on the number of days from 1 January in that accounting period to the
date of change of control, will be payable. In this event earnings per share (for the purposes of calculating the amount of
bonus) will be determined by reference to the latest available management accounts.
6 Any cash award which is payable will not be pensionable.
7 The rules of the scheme may be amended by the Remuneration Committee as it thinks fit, but certain amendments cannot
be made without shareholder approval, being to the class of participants, the method of calculating the amount of an award
and the performance targets (in the latter case if it would be beneficial to the participants). However, minor amendments to
benefit the administration of the scheme, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax,
exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants in the Scheme or for the Company or any company within the Ben
Bailey Group may be made without further shareholder approval.

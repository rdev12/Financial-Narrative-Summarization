01 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report another outstanding year 
for Burren both in terms of the performance of 
its existing assets and expansion into new and 
potentially profitable theatres of operation.  
In light of the excellent results the Board is 
recommending a final dividend of 9.5 pence  
per share, making a total dividend in respect  
of 2005 of 12.0 pence per share, a fourfold 
increase in the dividend relating to 2004  
(3.0 pence per share).
Burren’s earnings per share tripled to 159.0 cents 
(2004: 50.1 cents), representing net profit of 
US$220.9 million (2004: US$68.4 million). Pretax 
profit rose by 196% to US$254.6 million (2004: 
US$86.2 million) and net operating cash flow 
increased by 167% to US$277.8 million, while free 
cash flow* was US$97.4 million (2004: negative 
US$1.0 million) despite an 84% increase in capital 
investment. This result was driven by a 58% 
increase in entitlement production to 22,440 bopd 
(2004: 14,170 bopd) and by higher oil prices.  
The continuing increase in production reflected 
successful development drilling and workover 
activity in Turkmenistan and, even more 
significantly, successful development drilling  
in Congo, where 20 new wells were brought  
into production. 
* See definition in Glossary 
This is the fourth year in succession of more than 
doubled profits, positioning the Group as a top 
performer in the oil and gas sector. Among the 
factors behind this success is our emphasis on 
cost control, where over a three year period we 
have brought down our production cost per 
barrel, on a working interest basis, by some 27% 
to US$2.27 per barrel in 2005. At these levels  
we are among the lowest cost operators in 
the industry.
Driven by our development drilling success our 
proven reserves have grown in 2005 by 14% to 
84.6 million barrels on a working interest basis, 
which, excluding production/disposals for the year, 
represents growth of 34%. Our working interest 
proven & probable reserves, however, reduced by 
13% to 214.2 million barrels, although excluding 
production/disposals the reduction is only 7%.  
The reduction was primarily due to a  downward 
revision to our assumptions as to probable oil in 
place in the M’Boundi field in Congo following the 
results of the MBD1204 and 1401 wells, which 
together have helped to redefine the northern 
boundary of the field. It also reflects the impact  
of the conditional sale of a 3.5% interest in the 
M’Boundi field to the Congolese national oil 
company SNPC. However if the 60,000 bwpd 
M’Boundi water injection programme, which is 
due to start in the fourth quarter of the year, is 
successful this could have a material beneficial 
impact on the reserves in the field.
The Group’s proven & probable reserves 
represent an 18 year reserve life based on 2005 
working interest production, and seven years for 
proved reserves alone. 
Over the past year the focus of our activities has 
extended outside our key producing Burun and 
M’Boundi fields towards exploration of new areas. 
Extensive seismic surveys have been carried out 
over the past two years in Turkmenistan and 
Congo, and a new survey is about to commence 
in Egypt. Exploration drilling is continuing in 
Turkmenistan, Congo and Egypt, and eight heavy 
rigs have been secured for the 2006 exploration 
and development programme between these 
three countries.  We plan to drill up to 20 
exploration wells over the course of this year to 
evaluate an unrisked prospect inventory of over 
400 million barrels, all located in established 
hydrocarbon provinces.
During the year we made good progress in 
acquiring a portfolio of assets in the Middle East, 
in line with Burren’s strategy of growth into new 
frontier areas. In Egypt, a production sharing 
contract for the shallow water North Hurghada 
block in the Gulf of Suez was signed in August 
2005. Burren was also awarded the onshore 
North Lagia block, north of the Gulf of Suez, 
subject to government ratification which is 
expected in the first half of 2006. We acquired 
significant new licence interests in Yemen and 
Oman, subject to government ratification. Block 6 
in Yemen consists of 3,911 km² of onshore 
located in the prolific Shabwa Basin between 
commercially productive oil fields to the west and 
east. Burren’s working interest will be 92%. Block 
50 in Oman consists of 16,680 km² offshore in 
water depths of up to 100 metres. Burren has 
acquired a 40% non-operated interest in this high 
reward, high risk block, which is operated by 
Oman Hunt.
In India, the market value of our 26% equity share 
of HOEC has nearly doubled since its acquisition 
in February 2005. Negotiations are under way 
with a local electricity generator on a gas sales 
contract so that development of the PY-1 gas field 
can begin. 
In January 2005, 22 million shares held by 
pre-flotation shareholders, representing 16.0%  
of the Company, were placed by the Company 
brokers with institutional investors in response to 
market demand. In September 2005, a further  
12 million shares (8.8% of the Company) were 
placed in a similar way. As a result, the free float 
has increased to 71.9% of Burren’s share capital, 
thus improving the market liquidity of the shares. 
Following a comprehensive review during 2005,  
a combined Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community (HSEC) framework was established, 
co-ordinating a revised set of HSEC policies, 
principles and standards. HSEC managers have 
been appointed in London, Turkmenistan and 
Egypt. I am pleased to report that there were no 
serious accidents in Burren-operated locations 
during the period. An HSEC audit has been 
“This is the fourth year in succession of more 
than doubled profits, defining Burren as a top 
performer in the oil and gas sector”

projects in Turkmenistan, including the award  
of six postgraduate scholarships in the UK to 
Turkmen nationals, and supporting a European 
Union sponsored conservation programme for 
wildlife in northern Congo. 
There has been one addition to the Board since 
the beginning of the period: Keith Henry was 
appointed an Independent Non-executive 
Director on 31 March 2005 and was subsequently 
designated Senior Independent Director in 
September 2005. 
Having reached the age of 70, I shall be stepping 
down as Chairman at the Annual General Meeting 
on 24 May 2006 although I am delighted to 
continue to serve as a member of the Board.  
I have had the great privilege of fulfilling the 
Chairman’s role for over seven years during which 
time Burren has developed from a relatively small 
private company to one of the largest independent 
oil companies on the London Stock Exchange  
by market capitalisation. My successor will be 
Keith Henry, who has immense knowledge and 
experience of our industry, and I commend him  
to you. 
In conclusion, I believe that your Company is  
well placed to enjoy continued growth from  
its development programmes in Congo and 
Turkmenistan, from the extensive exploration 
programme on which it is now embarking, and 
from exciting new business opportunities in 
Egypt, Yemen, Oman and India. Finally, I would 
like on behalf of the shareholders and the Board 
to express my gratitude to the executives, 
managers and all employees, especially those in 
the field, for their dedication, resourcefulness and 
hard work in achieving such successful results.

The Nebit Dag PSA area  
(1,050 km²) is located onshore  
in western Turkmenistan and 
contains five developed oil and 
gas fields. Burren has production 
rights to the Burun field, at the 
western end of the area, as 
operator with a 100% working 
interest. The other four fields within 
the PSA area (Kyzl Kum, Kum Dag, 
Kara Tepe and Nebit Dag) are 
operated by the state oil company 
Turkmenneft. Burren has 
exploration rights over the rest of 
PSA area under an exploration 
licence which expires in February 
2007. The PSA term runs until 2022, 
and may be extended for a further 
10 years by mutual agreement with 
the Turkmenistan government. 
Burren has been the operator of  
the PSA since 2000.
At the end of 2005, the Burun field 
was producing approximately 
19,000 bopd from 135 wells. 
Development to date has been 
primarily on the north flank of the 
field whilst the south flank remains 
to be appraised. Prior to 2004, well 
activity consisted of workovers to 
return shut-in wells to production. 
Development drilling commenced  
in 2004. Average working interest 
production during 2005 increased 
by 35% to 15,410 bopd (2004: 
11,430 bopd).
Gas-lift is now installed on most of 
the Burun field wells. Oil separation, 
treatment and storage facilities were 
upgraded during 2005. A pilot water 
injection scheme is expected to be 
implemented during 2006 which,  
if successful, will be rolled out 
across the field to provide reservoir 
pressure support and enhance oil 
recovery rates.
Burun crude is a light high quality 
low sulphur crude with an API 
gravity of 33º. Burren has 
unrestricted rights to the export of 
its share of crude, which is sold on 
an FOB basis from Turkmenistan 
Caspian Sea ports.
Exploration drilling outside Burun 
began in late 2005 and is expected  
to continue throughout 2006.
The Kouilou and Kouakouala 
licence areas, located onshore 
along the Atlantic coast of the 
Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), 
extend over an area of about 
2,600 km² and contain three 
producing fields: M’Boundi, 
Kouakouala and Pointe Indienne, 
of which M’Boundi is by far the 
largest. The operator in each case 
is Maurel & Prom, the French 
independent oil company. Burren 
has a 35% interest in the Kouilou 
licence that includes the M’Boundi 
field and a 25% interest in 
Kouakouala. In 2005 Burren entered 
into an agreement to sell a 3.5% 
interest in M’Boundi to the state oil 
company SNPC, this transaction is 
still  subject to ratification by the 
Congolese parliament. Burren has 
entered into an agreement for the 
sale of its interest in the insignificant 
Pointe Indienne field which was also 
sold to the operator Maurel & Prom 
subject to government approval.
Recent appraisal and development 
activity has centred on the M’Boundi 
field where production as at the end 
of 2005 was 57,340 bopd from 39 
wells. 24 wells were drilled in 2005, 
of which 20 were brought into 
production, with four rigs in 
operation. The capacity of the oil 
processing facilities at M’Boundi is 
being expanded to handle gross 
field production of 90,000 bopd  
and a 60,000 bwpd water injection 
scheme will be initiated during  
H2 2006. 
The Kouakouala field was producing 
1,100 bopd from four wells at the 
end of 2005. The Kouakouala 
development licence expires in 2008 
and may be extended by mutual 
consent for a further five years. Total 
Burren working interest production 
in Congo averaged 15,970 bopd  
in 2005, an increase of 135% 
compared with 2004.
The fields are connected by 
pipelines to the Total-operated 
export terminal at Djeno on the 
Atlantic coast, a distance from 
M’Boundi of about 40 km, where 
the crude is blended for export. The 
M’Boundi and Kouakouala crudes 
are very light low sulphur crudes 
with an API gravity of around 40º. 
An exploration programme over 
prospects within the Kouilou licence 
area commenced in Q1 2006 with 
up to six exploration wells planned 
during the year.
Parliamentary approval ratifying 
Burren’s 37% interest in the 2,830 
km² La Noumbi licence, which lies 
adjacent to and north of the Kouilou 
block, is expected during 2006. The 
first actions following approval will 
be to acquire 2D seismic data over 
leads and prospects.

In February 2005 Burren 
purchased a 26% stake in 
Hindustan Oil Exploration 
Company (‘HOEC’), an 
independent Indian E&P 
company listed on the Mumbai 
stock exchange. 
HOEC’s main focus of activity  
is in the Cauvery basin offshore 
Chennai where it holds interests  
of 100% in the undeveloped PY-1 
gas field, 80% in an adjacent 
exploration block (CY-OSN-97/1) 
and 21% in the producing PY-3 oil 
field. In addition, HOEC is operator 
of other onshore production and 
exploration licences in Assam and 
in the Cambay basin, Gujarat. 
Preparations for development and 
exploration drilling in Cauvery and 
negotiations with the Tamil Nadu 
Electricity Board (TNEB) for a long-
term gas contract for PY-1 gas  
are continuing.
Burren’s right to acquire the 
shareholding in HOEC is subject to 
legal challenge by Hardy Oil & Gas 
Limited which alleges that it has 
rights of pre-emption in relation to 
the sale of shares. The existence of 
such rights and the validity of the 
agreement purported to give rise to 
such rights are disputed by Burren.
Egypt: Burren has interests in three 
blocks, East Kanayis (4,300 km² 
onshore Western Desert), North 
Hurghada Marine (240 km² shallow 
water Gulf of Suez) and North Lagia 
(1,460 km² onshore northern Gulf  
of Suez basin). The award of the 
North Lagia block is still awaiting 
parliamentary ratification. Burren’s 
working interest is 100% in all blocks 
except North Lagia (90%).
The East Kanayis block is believed  
to contain both Cretaceous (oil) and 
Jurassic (gas and condensate) 
prospects. Immediately to the east  
lies a chain of producing Cretaceous 
oilfields, and other discoveries have 
been made in the surrounding areas, 
notably to the west where Apache  
has found significant quantities of gas. 
Exploration drilling commenced in 
March 2006, initially targeting small 
prospects in the Cretaceous horizons. 
3D seismic will be acquired in 2006 to 
delineate deeper Jurassic prospects.
The North Hurghada Marine block lies 
along a trend of oil and gas fields from 
Zeit Bay and Geisum to the north to 
the large Seabird field to the south-
east. Water depths are less than 50 
metres. Burren intends to acquire 3D 
seismic over part of this block.
The North Lagia block contains four 
producing fields (all excluded from  
the licence awarded to Burren). The 
existing dataset indicates the possible 
presence of several structures, but 
data acquisition will be necessary  
to delineate these.
Yemen: Burren has a 92% operated 
working interest in Block 6, an 
onshore area of 3,911 km², The  
PSA was signed in December 2005 
and is subject to parliamentary 
ratification. Block 6 is located in the 
prolific Shabwa basin and lies between 
the major oil and gas producing areas 
to the west, previously operated by 
Hunt, and Block S2 to the east 
operated by OMV.
Burren intends to acquire 3D seismic 
data over the southern part of the 
block during 2006 with a view to 
exploration drilling in 2007.
Oman: Burren has a 40% non-
operated interest in offshore  
Block 50 (16,690 km²), operated  
by Hunt Oil. The farm-in agreement 
was signed in January 2006 and is 
subject to government approval. 
Block 50 is located in the Masirah 
Basin, which demonstrates  
similarities to the prolific oil and gas 
basins onshore Oman, with water 
depths of up to 100 metres. A 2D 
seismic programme is intended in 
2006 to plan for a drilling programme  
in 2007.

07 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
Chief Executive’s review
2005 was another year of exceptionally strong 
growth for Burren. t he tripling in our net profits 
came from the combination of increased 
production, higher oil prices and tight cost 
controls. Burren’s net production has increased 
by an average compound annual rate of 70% 
per annum over the last four years, an enviable 
record, which has driven our net profit from 
u S$3.7 million in 2001 to u S$220.9 million  
in 2005. 
REVIEW OF t HE YEAR
Over the year we accelerated development  
drilling on our two main assets and prepared  
for a significant exploration programme in 2006. 
We drilled 38 appraisal and development wells  
on the Burun and M’Boundi fields, compared with 
27 in 2004. Of these 38 wells, 33 were placed  
on production and a further two are awaiting 
workover. Working interest production increased 
by 72% to 31,380 bopd (2004: 18,270 bopd), 
whereas our entitlement production increased  
by 58% to 22,440 bopd (2004: 14,170 bopd), as 
stronger crude prices increased the government 
share of production under the terms of our PSAs. 
We finished the year with average December 
working interest production of 35,150 bopd 
compared with 26,450 bopd in January 2005. 
During the year we completed seismic 
interpretation in Turkmenistan, Congo and Egypt 
giving us a prospect inventory going forward 
totalling 400 million barrels of potential unrisked 
working interest reserves across 15 different 
prospects. This has the potential to add material 
value to Burren. We are now actively exploring in 
all three countries and will be drilling the large part 
of this inventory over the next 18 months. 
Exploration drilling in Turkmenistan commenced 
in October last year with two deep wells on the 
Nebit Dag East prospect, located toward the 
middle of the PSA area. NDE001 failed to 
encounter commercial hydrocarbons, yet 
NDE002 flowed on test at over 400 bopd from  
a shallow horizon that is now a focus for further 
appraisal drilling. The 2006 deep drilling 
programme will target several potentially high-
impact prospects lying closer to Burun field.  
The first two of these wells, on the south flanks 
of the Burun and Nebit Dag fields, were spudded 
in March. 
In Congo we have identified six targets within the 
Kouilou licence area for exploration drilling this 
year, following the proven oil trend indicated by 
the M’Boundi and Kouakouala fields. In addition, 
we will test the potential extensions of the 
M’Boundi field to the south-east and north-west. 
The first of these step-out wells, to the south-east 
of the M’Boundi field, was spudded in March.
In Egypt, the first exploration well on the East 
Kanayis block, Washka Southwest, spudded and 
completed in March 2006, was dry. The second 
well, Washka South, targeting a neighbouring 
prospect, has just spudded. Seismic acquisition  
is about to commence over a 540 km² area to  
the south of the block with a view to identifying 
deeper Jurassic targets for drilling in 2007. 
We currently have eight rigs contracted and in 
operation in these three countries. However, given 
that we see rig availability as a potential constraint 
to growth, we have decided to purchase two of 
our own drilling rigs. The first of these is currently 
under construction in China and is expected to  
be available in Q3 2006: it is likely that this rig will 
initially be deployed in Turkmenistan. The second 
rig will be available early in 2007.
Finally, in February 2006 we completed the partial 
sale of our shipping business to the Italian shipping 
group Pietro Barbaro SPA for a cash consideration 
of US$4.6 million. The sale involved three tug and 
barge combinations together with associated 
leasing obligations, and relieves the Group’s 
balance sheet of all shipping related liabilities other 
than working capital. Burren retains its interest  
in eight bareboat chartered vessels for a further  
10 years, which have 12 month charters for 2006  
in place and continue to operate profitably in the 
Black Sea and Russian river system.
St RAt EGY AND OBJECt IVES
Burren’s strategy is to build a valuable portfolio of 
oil and gas assets in four key hydrocarbon regions 
of the world: the Caspian and Southern Russia, 
West Africa, Middle East and India. We seek to 
strike a balance between diversity and materiality, 
in order that individual assets can significantly 
impact shareholder value, whilst avoiding an 
undue concentration of political and geological 
risk. We also aim to achieve a balance in terms  
of the portfolio life cycle, acquiring early stage 
exploration and appraisal opportunities in order  
to provide future growth potential to complement 
more mature production assets. 
We seek to build close relationships with 
governments and with domestic partners, often 
involving joint ventures with established local 
entities who can provide local knowledge and 
support. We aim to achieve sufficient critical mass 
in each region to leverage these relationships  
into new opportunities. We have a preference for 
majority stakes in our assets, to provide control; 
where only a minority stake is available this  
should generally be of a sufficient size to give  
us material influence. 
Burren aims to add value to assets by applying 
our technical, commercial and operational 
Finian O’Sullivan
Chief Executive Officer
“Our corporate culture is one of cost 
efficiency and we are proud of our  
record as a low cost operator”
08 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
A Burren geologist  
conquered Everest and 
raised the t urkmen flag
expertise. The production growth achieved in the 
Congo and Turkmenistan is a testament to this. 
Our philosophy is simple: we look to acquire 
assets below their potential value and to monetise 
them at the appropriate point in the development 
cycle when their value to prospective purchasers 
materially exceeds our own risked valuation. If 
suitable re-investment opportunities cannot be 
found we would look for tax-effective ways to 
return such proceeds to shareholders.
Our corporate culture is one of cost efficiency  
and we are proud of our record as a low cost 
operator. We have reduced the Group’s 
production cost per barrel on a working interest 
basis by some 27% over the last three years to 
US$2.27 / bbl in 2005. In Turkmenistan, where we 
are operator, our working interest production cost 
was US$1.73 / bbl last year. We consider control  
of costs to be a key part of shareholder value 
generation and do not intend to lose sight of  
this goal in an era of high oil prices. 
In pursuit of this strategy our operational 
objectives for the coming year are as follows:
Drilling of up to 20 exploration wells on 
prospects in Turkmenistan, Congo and Egypt.
Implementation of pilot water injection 
programmes on the Burun and M’Boundi 
fields to assess the potential for enhanced  
oil recovery.
Acquisition of seismic data on the North 
Hurghada Marine block in Egypt and on the 
new blocks in Yemen and Oman, with a view 
to identifying prospects for drilling in 2007.
Progress in negotiations with government 
agencies and other regional operators on the 
construction of a gas pipeline with a view to 
commercialising our Turkmen gas resources 
by 2008.
Continued search and evaluation of new 
development and exploration opportunities 
within our stated geographic focus regions. 
Over the past few years we have hedged a small 
percentage of our production against oil price 
•
•
•
•
•
movements, with the objective of providing some 
protection against a possible oil price collapse. 
Now that these hedges have finally run off, we are 
entirely unhedged going into 2006 and, unless 
circumstances change, we intend to remain  
that way. It is our belief that our shareholders  
wish to retain exposure to the oil price and it  
is not our role to take views on future oil prices  
on their behalf.
Burren’s principal internal resource in achieving 
our goals is its people, and we place great 
emphasis on recruiting and retaining the best 
individuals. To this end we attach importance  
to individual career development and provide 
appropriate training, both internally and using 
external sources, to allow them to achieve their full 
potential. We aim to provide all employees with a 
competitive remuneration package, benchmarked 
against peers and participation in an incentive 
scheme which offers annual awards in cash and 
deferred shares related to the performance of  
the Company.
Out LOOK
We expect working interest production this year 
to average between 36,000 and 37 ,000 bopd, 
compared with 31,380 bopd in 2005. Whilst 
production growth this year will continue, 
exploration drilling will be a key area of focus. The 
introduction of secondary recovery water injection 
programmes in both the Burun and M’Boundi 
fields, should increase well productivity. If these 
water injection programmes prove successful it 
should enable us to raise the recovery factor on 
these two fields, with a consequential positive 
impact on our booked reserves. 
Our principal challenge this year will be to deliver 
success from our exploration drilling programme, 
which is a key driver for Burren’s future value 
growth. We intend to drill at least six deep 
exploration wells in 2006 on each of our core 
assets, the Nebit Dag and Kouilou licences. In 
Egypt, we have commenced a four well exploration 
programme on the East Kanayis block, which will 
be expanded in 2007 to all three of our Egyptian 
operated licences. The addition of Yemen and 
Oman broadens our exploration portfolio and 
extends its potential into 2007 and beyond. 
 
In relation to HOEC, Burren continues to monitor 
its investment and support the company, and 
considers that HOEC will provide valuable 
exposure to oil and gas investment opportunities 
in India. 
With net cash of US$125 million at year end  
and 2006 operating cash flow at current oil  
prices expected to be well in excess of that  
in 2005, Burren has the financial strength  
to allow us to pursue our business agenda  
with confidence.

09 Review of operations
t urkmenistan
Caspian
Operations during year
During 2005 we continued our programme of workovers and 
development drilling on the Burun field, whilst at the same time beginning 
the exploration of the remainder of the Nebit Dag PSA area.
On the Burun field, gross production in 2005 averaged 19,240 bopd,  
an increase of 24% over 2004 (15,500 bopd). On an entitlement basis 
production averaged 12,430 bopd in 2005 compared with 9,300 bopd  
in 2004, a 34% increase. 
The production increase was driven by the continuous programme of 
workovers and development drilling, with 14 new development wells 
drilled, 13 of which were put on production. Together with wells added 
from successful workovers, this led to a producing well count at the end 
of the year of 135 wells compared with 111 at the end of 2004.
We continued to upgrade our field processing facilities over the year, 
successfully commissioning new three-phase separation units and 
additional gas-lift compressors. The commissioning of produced water 
treatment and pilot water-injection facilities is in process.
 
During the year we completed the interpretation of the 540 km² of 3D 
seismic over the remainder of the Nebit Dag PSA area outside the Burun 
field and mapped five prospects for drilling. 
Four exploration wells (three shallow and one deep) which were drilled  
in 2005 on the Nebit Dag East prospect failed to find commercial 
hydrocarbons, but in March 2006 the second deep well on this prospect, 
NDE002, successfully tested oil at a rate of 400 bopd on a ¼" choke from 
a shallow reservoir at a depth of 1,385 metres. Our intention is to perform 
an extended test followed by further appraisal drilling. 
 
Future plans
The focus of 2006 will be on continuing the programme of workovers and 
development drilling on Burun whilst accelerating the exploration drilling. 
As well as five workover rigs, one of which will be used for shallow drilling, 
we now have two deep drilling rigs in operation with exploration wells  
on the south flanks of the Burun and Nebit Dag fields recently spudded. 
Our aim is to drill all our identified exploration targets before the 
exploration area relinquishment deadline of February 2007 . The pilot 
water-injection scheme on Burun should also provide useful data on the 
longer term viability of secondary recovery and if successful will have a 
beneficial impact on field production.
Discussions will be continued with the international operators of 
neighbouring PSAs and the Turkmen government concerning a joint gas 
export scheme in western Turkmenistan.

10,100 bopd, up 106% over 2004 (4,870 bopd)”
Congo
Operations during year
The main focus of activity was development drilling on the M’Boundi field, 
where 24 wells were drilled during 2005 compared with 17 in 2004, with 
four rigs in operation during the year. 20 of these wells are on production 
and two are awaiting workover (the remaining two were non-commercial). 
Gross M’Boundi field production during the year averaged 44,400 bopd, 
an increase of 137% over 2004 (18,720 bopd). Production in December 
was 57 ,250 bopd with 39 wells on production at year end. Burren’s 
entitlement production from Congo, including a contribution of 340 bopd 
from the Kouakouala and Pointe Indienne fields, was 10,010 bopd, up 
106% over 2004 (4,870 bopd). The slower growth rate for entitlement 
production compared with gross production was due to the M’Boundi 
field reaching payback (i.e. full recovery of historic costs) in mid year, as a 
result of which the state share of the gross oil has increased.
Work began on the expansion of the processing facilities to increase their 
capacity from 60,000 bopd to 90,000 bopd with the addition of a third 
processing train, which is expected to be completed in the second half  
of 2006. 
The throughput agreement at the Djeno terminal, operated by Total, has 
been renegotiated so that Burren’s crude now forms part of the N’Kossa 
blend rather than the Djeno blend. N’Kossa (API 41º) is a lighter crude 
than Djeno, and the result is expected to be an improvement in the sales 
price to Brent less around US$1.00 / bbl compared with Brent less 
US$6.90 / bbl in 2005.
Interpretation was largely completed of the 3D seismic acquired over the 
potential extensions of the M’Boundi field and the 2D seismic acquired 
over certain other targets within the Kouilou licence area. During 2005, 
two exploration wells were drilled along the Mengo reservoir trend some 
25 km south-west of the M’Boundi field. One of these, Diosso, was 
plugged and abandoned as a dry hole whilst the other, Tchianimbi, 
although initially put on long-term production test, was unable to sustain 
production at commercial rates and was suspended.
The small Kouakouala field saw minimal activity during the year. As at 
March 2006, production from the field had declined to about 1,000 bopd 
from four wells. 
Finally, Burren has entered into an agreement for the sale of its 35% 
interest in the Pointe Indienne field to the field operator, Maurel & Prom, 
subject to government approval. The field, which produced last year at  
a gross rate of 150 bopd from two wells and is immaterial to the Group.
Future plans
Activity this year will comprise continued development and appraisal 
drilling on M’Boundi coupled with exploration drilling within the Kouilou 
licence area. A fifth rig has been contracted for the exploration 
programme which, spudded an exploration well in March 2006 in the 
Kouakouala area targeting the Djeno reservoir formation. A sixth rig is 
scheduled to arrive in mid 2006 and up to six exploration wells are 
planned over the year.
Preparations are under way for a 60,000 bwpd pilot water injection 
project on the M’Boundi involving the drilling of water source and  
injector wells, with the aim of increasing well productivity. The project  
is scheduled to start operation towards the end of 2006.

Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005 Egypt, Yemen and Oman
Middle East
Egypt
Following evaluation of the existing 2D and 3D seismic and well data  
on the East Kanayis block several attractive Cretaceous prospects at 
depths of between 6,000 and 9,000 ft have been identified. Drilling was 
originally scheduled to commence in Q4 2005, but difficulty in securing  
a rig delayed the start. A rig has now been contracted for the entire 
programme. The first well, Washka Southwest, was spudded in early 
March 2006, but was found to be water-bearing and was plugged and 
abandoned. The second well, Washka South, targeting the same trend, 
spudded at the end of March.
The acquisition of 3D seismic over a 540 km² area along the Qattara 
ridge to the south of the block has commenced and is expected to be 
completed by the end of May. This will assist in determining targets in  
the deeper Jurassic horizons for drilling in 2007 . 
The PSC for the offshore North Hurghada Marine block in the southern 
Gulf of Suez was signed in September and planning is under way for the 
acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic over the licence area.
The North Lagia block, onshore in the northern Gulf of Suez, is awaiting 
parliamentary ratification which is anticipated in Q2 of this year.
Yemen
In January of this year Burren signed a PSA on Block 6, an onshore area 
of 3,911 km
2
, as operator with a 92% working interest. Parliamentary 
ratification is expected before mid year. Block 6 is located in the prolific 
Shabwa Basin and lies between the major oil and gas producing  
areas to the west, previously operated by Hunt, and Block S2 to the  
east, where OMV is developing a 170 million barrel oil field in fractured 
basement reservoirs. 
Our focus will be on the basement potential in Block 6 which has not 
been explored by previous operators. We intend to acquire 3D seismic 
over the most prospective area in 2006 and target the basement 
structures for drilling in 2007 .
Oman
Also in January 2006 Burren signed a farm-in agreement with Oman 
Hunt, a subsidiary of Hunt Oil, on offshore Block 50 to acquire a 40% 
non-operated interest. The assignment is awaiting government approval. 
Block 50, which has water depths of up to 100 metres, covers 16,680 
km² of the offshore Masirah Basin which demonstrates similarities to the 
prolific oil and gas basins onshore Oman. Previous drilling in Block 50 
demonstrated the presence of an active petroleum system, but poor 
seismic data quality has prevented the confident definition of drillable 
structures in the potentially prospective part of the basin. 
In 2006 the partners intend to acquire detailed, high quality 2D seismic 
over potentially large structures in order to prepare for a decision 
regarding a drilling programme at the end of the year.

Financial review
Operating profit
Cost of sales increased by 35% to US$118.4 
million (2004: US$87.9 million), resulting in  
a gross profit for the year of US$271.9 million, 
(2004: US$97.9 million).
Within cost of sales, depreciation comprised  
US$66.1 million, equating to US$8.07 / bbl 
compared with US$5.82 in 2004. The increased 
rate of depreciation arises almost entirely from  
the reduction in entitlement reserves at year-end 
compared with 2004. Net losses from oil price 
hedges, at US$13.8 million, were lower than the 
US$31.0 million in 2004, owing to lower hedged 
volumes (1.0 million barrels vs. 2.5 million barrels 
in 2004) and to the early recognition of losses  
on 2005 hedges in the 2004 income statement 
under IFRS. There were no hedges still 
outstanding as at 31 December 2005. The 
remaining costs of sales, comprising production 
costs and costs of shipping operations, 
amounted to US$38.6 million (2004: US$26.7 
million) representing US$3.18 / bbl (2004: 
US$2.81 / bbl) on entitlement basis when 
shipping costs of US$13.7 million (2004: US$12.5 
million) are excluded. On a working interest basis 
production costs were US$2.27 / bbl (2004: 
US$2.18 / bbl), believed to be one of the lowest 
among our peers.
Administrative expenses including incentive 
scheme charges rose by 44% to US$15.4 million. 
Pre-licence expenses of US$1.4 million were 
offset by a first time contribution from associates 
(HOEC) of US$1.6 million.
Operating profit amounted to US$256.7 million, 
an increase of 194% over 2004 (US$87.2 million).
Net profit and earnings per share
Interest and finance charges, net of interest 
earned, were US$2.1 million in 2005 compared 
with US$1.0 million in 2004, as a result of all  
up-front costs relating to the arrangement of a 
new US$80 million standby loan facility being 
expensed in the year.
The taxation charge increased by 90% to 
US$33.7 million (2004: US$17.7 million), all of 
which relates to Turkmenistan. In Congo the 
state’s share of oil under the PSA satisfies all tax 
liabilities. US$7.7 million of the tax charge was 
deferred tax.
Profit after tax increased by 223% to US$220.9 
million, compared with US$68.4 million in 2004. 
Earnings per share were 159.0 cents basic (154.1 
cents diluted) compared with 50.1 cents basic 
(47.9 cents diluted) in 2004.
Cash flow and capital expenditure
Net cash from operations in 2005, after payment 
of US$1.6 million of tax, was US$277.8 million, an 
increase of 167% over 2004 (US$103.9 million). 
This is net of an increase of US$38.6 million in 
working capital investment. 
Investment expenditure totalled US$176.5 million 
(2004: US$95.7 million). Within this figure capital 
expenditure on upstream assets accounted for 
US$142.0 million, cash pledged as collateral to 
guarantee minimum work obligations under new 
licenses in Egypt accounted for for US$8.8 million 
and the balance of US$25.7 million represented 
the cost of acquiring a 26% stake in HOEC net of 
dividends received. The expenditure on upstream 
assets breaks down into US$55.3 million in 
Turkmenistan and US$75.5 million in Congo, with 
the balance being primarily in Egypt. US$18.6 
million out of the total was spent on exploration. 
Interest and finance charges paid on loans and 
finance leases, net of interest received, were 
US$2.0 million and a further US$13.7 million was 
paid in dividends. The exercise of options brought 
in US$1.5 million and US$1.9 million of debt 
(including the capital element of finance leases) 
was repaid.
The above elements resulted in a net increase  
in cash balances of US$85.2 million.

t RADING PERFORMANCE
Revenue
Revenue grew by 110% to US$390.3 million due 
to a combination of increased sales volumes and 
higher realised prices. Sales volumes increased 
by 55% to 7.8 million barrels (equivalent to 21,440 
bopd). The average sales price rose by 39% to 
US$47.82 / bbl (2004 : US$34.40 / bbl). 
The average price discount to Brent in 2005 was 
US$7.22 / bbl compared with US$5.35 / bbl  
in 2004. The discount increased in both 
Turkmenistan and Congo: in Turkmenistan 
primarily owing to higher transportation costs to 
western European refinery destinations; and in 
Congo as a consequence of pricing differentials 
affecting the heavier crudes with which our 
crude was blended prior to export. Following  
the renegotiation in late 2005 of the blending 
arrangements at the Djeno terminal, the discount 
to Brent in Congo is expected to improve by 
some US$6.00 / bbl in 2006 to around Brent  
less US$1.00 / bbl.

FINANCIAL POSIt ION
Liquidity
At 31 December 2005 Burren had cash balances 
of US$124.8 million and debt (in the form of ship 
finance leases) of $2.8 million. Since year end 
these leasing liabilities have been assumed by  
the purchaser of part of our shipping business, 
leaving the group debt-free. Cash surplus to 
immediate requirements is invested in a US$ AAA 
rated money market fund, from which it can be 
withdrawn at short notice. In 2005 Burren put  
in place a US$80 million four year standby loan 
facility secured on our two principal assets in 
Turkmenistan and Congo, to replace an existing 
US$20 million facility and afford the Group additional 
financial flexibility for future investment opportunities.
Capital structure
Burren is currently financed entirely from 
shareholders’ equity and retained earnings, with 
no debt. Based on discussions with our bankers, 
we estimate our borrowing capacity, both in  
terms of prudent debt service limits and in terms 
of market availability of loan finance, to be 
considerably greater than our current US$80 
million committed loan facility. 
In 2005 there were two placings of existing shares 
by pre-flotation shareholders: 22.0 million shares 
in January and 12.0 million shares in September. 
Together these placings represented 24.8% of  
the Group’s issued share capital at the beginning 
of the year. Following the September placing  
the combined stake held by pre-flotation 
shareholders, all of whom have board 
representation, and management reduced to 
28.1%, leaving a free float of 71.9%.
RISK AND INt ERNAL CONt ROL
A comprehensive review of risk and internal 
controls was carried out in 2005 by the Audit 
Committee, whose terms of reference include the 
responsibility for the review of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management systems and 
procedures. Potential risks were assessed and 
ranked as to potential impact on financial 
statements, impact on business value, probability 
of occurrence, shareholder tolerance level and 
cost of mitigation. Policies and measures in  
place were reviewed and any necessary actions 
recommended to the Board. Review of risk and 
internal controls matters is included as an agenda 
item at every Board meeting and any control 
failures or weaknesses are reported. 
Further details on Burren’s internal control 
processes may be found in the Directors’ 
statements concerning Corporate Governance  
on pages 27 to 29.
Burren maintains accident and liability insurance 
for its upstream operations in line with prudent 
international oilfield practice. It also maintains hull 
and machinery, and protection and indemnity 
insurance policies in respect of its shipping fleet, 
in accordance with international shipping practice. 
Burren has a policy not to insure against political 
risk and therefore provides shareholders with 
exposure to risks and rewards of investing in 
frontier markets.
Burren’s oil price hedging policy is only to hedge 
where necessary to ensure the sufficiency of  
future cash flows to finance anticipated future 
expenditure and debt service. As our business is 
transacted primarily in US dollars and largely debt 
free, the potential impact of currency and interest 
rate fluctuations on our profits and cash flows is 
negligible and it is not considered necessary to 
hedge such exposures.
CHANGE IN ACCOu Nt ING POLICIES
The 2005 Financial Statements have been 
prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and in  
US dollars. During the year Burren elected to 
change its reporting currency to US dollars, the 
functional currency of almost all companies within 
of the Group, having in prior years reported in 
pounds sterling. The 2004 Group and Company 
Financial Statements were restated in US dollars 
and in accordance with IFRS during 2005, and 
this restated financial information, together with a 
commentary on the principal changes, is included 
in Note 32 to the financial statements.
Burren has elected to continue to follow a full  
cost approach to accounting for exploration  
and appraisal activities, whereby exploration  
and appraisal expenditures are capitalised and 
assessed for impairment together with the 
development and production assets within the 
cost pool with which they are associated. We 
consider that a full cost approach better reflects 
the medium term nature of exploration projects 
where the success or failure of individual wells 
does not necessarily reflect the value impact on 
the project taken as a whole.

Health, safety, environment 
and community
During 2005 a corporate review of health, 
safety and environment (HSE) and corporate 
and social responsibility (CSR) issues was 
undertaken, resulting in these responsibilities 
being combined into a Health, Safety, 
Environment and Community (HSEC)  
approach, to achieve a greater management 
focus. A revised set of corporate HSEC  
policies, principles and standards has also 
been developed, based on the vision statement 
on the page opposite.
POLICY
Burren’s policy is to conduct all its operations, 
and to encourage its partners to conduct  
their operations, in line with the following  
10 HSEC principles:
(1)  Management and Responsibility – 
demonstration of responsible HSEC 
leadership through committed line 
management.
(2)  Identifying Hazards and Reducing Risks – 
ongoing evaluation of hazards and associated 
risks and recovery mechanisms e.g. via 
Environmental Impact Assessments.
(3)  Policies and Standards – establishment of 
HSEC procedures which, as a minimum, 
meet local laws.
(4)  Training and Competency – provision of 
appropriate training to increase HSEC 
competence and local awareness. 
(5)   Safety Management and Emergency 
Preparedness – provision of safety, incident 
reporting, emergency response and 
contingency planning procedures.
(6)  Managing Contractors and Partners – 
selection of contractors with acceptable 
HSEC standards and working with partners 
to influence their HSEC policies and 
aspirations.
(7)  Audits and Inspections – implementation of 
procedures for active monitoring via the use 
of key performance indicators and regular 
external audits.
(8)  Community Relations – active management 
through expertise building, consultation and 
liaison with local communities.
(9)  Employment Practices – instigation of clear 
employment and staff welfare procedures.
(10)  Security – maintenance of security systems 
and procedures for both assets and people.
We have embarked on a phased implementation 
of this updated approach across our operating 
units (Turkmenistan and Egypt) and are increasing 
efforts to ensure that non-operated activities 
(Congo and India) have appropriate systems in 
place. This process has been assisted by the 
appointment of an HSEC co-ordinator in London, 
to ensure consistent implementation of the 
corporate objectives, and an experienced  
HSEC manager in Cairo, to handle the growing 
operated portfolio in Egypt. These positions will 
build upon the experience of our existing HSEC 
superintendent in Turkmenistan and the 
continuing liaison with our partners’ HSE 
managers in Congo and India.

In addition to implementing the above policy 
changes, we are expanding our reporting to 
include safety and environmental statistics  
and key performance indicators (KPIs), and 
information concerning our community, social  
and audit activities during 2005.
Health and safety
Our three key performance measures for accident 
statistics are:
Fatal Accident Rate, determined by the 
number of workplace fatal accidents in a year 
divided by the number of 100 million man-
hours worked;
Lost Time Incident Frequency (LTIF), 
determined by the number of Lost Time 
Incidents (LTIs) in a year divided by the number 
of million man-hours worked; and
Lost Time Incident Severity Rating (LTI SR), 
determined by the number of days lost 
through LTIs divided by the number of LTIs.
These measures have been calculated for our 
Turkmenistan operations from 2004 onwards  
and results for 2005 (covering both staff and 
contractors) are shown below. There have been 
zero fatalities since the commencement of 
operations in Turkmenistan and we are working 
(through increased training) to bring our LTIF and 
LTI SR measures down to more standard industry 
levels for the Former Soviet Union. These 
benchmarks have been taken from the Safety 
Performance Indicators (2004) report, published 
by the International Association of Oil and Gas 
Producers in May 2005.

Shipping continues to operate under the

that sets out internationally accepted procedures 
related to HSE and other matters. In this regard, 
we are pleased to report that during 2005 all our 
vessels were certified under the International 
Safety Management (ISM) code, there were no 
fatalities and no reportable incidents or violations 
associated with our shipping operations.
Environment
As required by the European Union Accounts 
Modernisation Directive, we have now collected a 
preliminary set of quantitative environmental data 
and are reporting them this year as a ‘baseline’ for 
comparative analysis from 2006 onwards.
Based on the UK Government’s proposed set of 
environmental KPIs for oil and gas companies, we 
have decided to report on oil and gas production, 
oil spills, gas flared or vented, water abstraction 
use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  
(mainly CO
2
 ). As recommended, these KPIs  
are reported by operating unit plus an allowance 
for administrative activities, with ‘activity data’,  
in the form of electricity, gas, fuel and transport 
usage, being used as a proxy to determine  
the emissions levels for the GHG KPI. The 
following table relates solely to our activities  
in Turkmenistan, Egypt and London.
As expected, Turkmenistan dominates this 
dataset and shows minimal oil spills (given the 
production level) and no environmental fines or

penalties. Flaring of gas (produced in association 
with oil) at approximately 25% of production is 
recognised as high but we are actively working 
with other producers in the area to develop a 
viable scheme to export this gas.
As this is the first time that we have reported  
such environmental data, it is difficult to draw 
conclusions from these figures, and to 
benchmark our performance against peer 
companies. Data validity should improve, with 
trends and reduction target analysis becoming 
possible, as our reporting procedures and the 
database expand.
Community and society
Projects
Burren continues to engage actively with the local 
communities where it operates, via both direct 
investment and community relations projects.
In Turkmenistan, we have contributed over 
$250,000 to the supply of cleaning and heavy 
construction vehicles for the city of Balkanabat, 
where we also sponsor the National Flag Day 
celebrations each year at Uzboy town. In 
Ashgabat, we have continued our annual 
sponsorship of the national Saz Orchestra and 
have recently supported the Ashgabat Children’s 
Invalid Sports Club.
In Congo, where we are not the operator, we 
consider it important to promote community 
engagement via the operator, M&P . In 2005, they 
have continued to drill and equip water wells for 
villages in the M’Boundi area and allow local 
residents to consult the Company doctor and 
nurse in medical emergencies.
In addition, in January 2006, Burren committed 
over $80,000 to the European Union-sponsored 
Ecosystemes Forestieres d’Afrique Centrale 
(‘ECOFAC’) conservation programme in Congo, 
whereby an extension is planned to the Odzala-
Kokoua National Park in northern Congo, which 
contains an important reserve for lowland gorillas 
and forest elephants.
Business ethics
Burren strives to conduct all its business activities 
with integrity, honesty and fairness and, in this 
regard, the paying or receipt of bribes in any form 
is unacceptable. We support the aims of the 1997 
OECD Convention on Combating Bribery in 
International Business Transactions and, in 
particular, endorse the UK Government-
sponsored Extractive Industries Transparency 
Initiative (‘EITI’), designed to promote 
transparency over payments for, and revenues 
from, petroleum extraction in countries which rely 
heavily on such mineral resource development.
Throughout our countries of operation, to the best 
of our knowledge, no payments have been made 
to individuals, organisations or political parties 
whose prime function is to fund political causes  
or initiatives.
Employment practices
Burren is an equal opportunity employer, with 
recruitment, remuneration and career progression 
not influenced by race, sex, marital status or any 
disability. We promote and support workforce 
diversity, as evidenced by our extensive 
recruitment of local staff in Turkmenistan  
(where we now employ approximately 850 
personnel) and in Egypt. Our stated aim is  
to promote competent local personnel into 
managerial positions.
In order to promote career development and 
enhance competencies and job skills, we offer 
our staff access to relevant external training 
schemes and courses and encourage 
membership of appropriate professional bodies. 
As the Company grows, we shall continue to 
encourage team performance whilst recognising 
individual contributions.
Security and human rights
Burren is committed to safeguard the integrity of 
the Company’s reputation, personnel and assets 
through appropriate security arrangements.  
In this regard, we are supportive of the ‘Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights’ which 
resulted from dialogue between the governments 
of the United States and the United Kingdom and 
companies in the extractive and energy sectors 
concerning human rights and corporate social 
responsibility which principally involve appropriate 
risk assessments of the security of personnel,  
local communities and assets, and the active 
monitoring and adapting of operations to meet 
changing political and social conditions in 
countries of interest.
We employ guards at our field facilities in 
Turkmenistan and Egypt and have established 
relationships with local police and/or military. In 
cases of security or medical emergencies, the 
Company also has an international evacuation 
process in place.
While governments have the prime responsibility 
for protecting and promoting human rights,  
we also recognise that the private sector has  
a role in respecting human rights as part of its 
contribution to a more stable and productive 
business environment.
External audits
One of the key tools used to measure the HSEC 
performance of our operations is independent, 
external field audits.
In early 2005 we commissioned an internationally-
recognised environmental consultancy to conduct 
a detailed HSEC audit of our field operations in 
Turkmenistan. The audit observed a number of 
positive initiatives giving a clear commitment to 
ongoing improvement of HSEC performance and 
recognised that plans were in place to address 
the majority of the outstanding action items from 
the 2004 audit. We are happy to report that the 
vast majority of the 2004 audit recommendations 
have now been implemented and progress will be 
further reviewed once this year’s audit is 
conducted in March.
In January 2006 the same environmental 
consultancy undertook, at Burren’s request  
and with the full cooperation of the field operator, 
Maurel and Prom, an HSEC audit of operations  
in Congo. The draft recommendations are  
being reviewed with M&P to assist the operator  
in its continuing programme to develop HSEC 
reporting management systems.

Working Interest reserves represent the proportion of future production, before deducting government share of that production, attributable to the Group’s 
joint venture participating interest. Entitlement reserves represent the Group’s share of future production net of government share in that production under 
the terms of the PSAs in question. Government share is impacted inter alia by assumptions as to future oil prices. Burren’s PSAs all provide for the 
Operator’s costs to be substantially recovered via a priority allocation of oil production (the ‘Cost Oil’). As oil prices increase, so the amount of Cost Oil 
required to recover past costs reduces, thereby reducing the Operator’s share of production and so entitlement reserves. Entitlement reserves are the basis 
on which the Group’s depreciation charge is calculated.
The Group’s entitlement reserves at 31 December 2005 were 104.2 million barrels compared with 145.7 million barrels at 31 December 2004. Entitlement 
reserves at 31 December 2005 were computed using an assumed long term Brent oil price of US$40 / bbl, compared with a long term price assumption  
of US$25 / bbl at 31 December 2004. The effect of this increase in assumed oil prices has been to significantly reduce Group entitlement reserves although 
the potential future monetary value of those reserves has increased as a result. 
In 2005 the Group entered into an agreement with Société Nationale des Petroles du Congo (‘SNPC’) to sell to SNPC a 3.5% participating interest in the 
M’Boundi field, thereby reducing its participating interest from 35% to 31.5%, subject to certain conditions among which was an increase in the term of the 
development license. Although as at 31 December 2005 these conditions had not been met, it is management’s expectation that they will be met in the 
foreseeable future. The reserves in the table above have therefore been calculated on the basis of a 31.5% interest in M’Boundi, assuming the transaction 
had been completed with effect from 31 December 2005. 
The above table does not include any reserves attributable to the Group’s 26% holding in HOEC. As at 31 March 2005, according to HOEC management 
estimates, HOEC’s proven and probable reserves were 40 million boe and 34.0 million boe on a working interest and entitlement basis respectively.

Corporate governance
APPlic Ation o F com Bin ED co DE Princi Pl Es
The Directors are committed to the principles of corporate governance 
contained in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘the Code’) 
for which the Board is accountable to shareholders. The Company has 
applied the principles of section 1 of the Code, including both the main 
principles and the supporting principles, by complying with the Code 
except in respect of certain matters as reported below. Further explanation 
of how the principles and supporting principles have been applied is set 
out in the Directors’ remuneration report and Audit Committee report.
th E Bo Ar D o F Dir Ectors
As of 1 January 2005 the Board comprised three Executive Directors and 
five Non-executive Directors including the Chairman, Brian Lavers. Alan 
Cole was the only Non-executive Director considered to be independent in 
accordance with the Code. A second Independent Non-executive Director, 
Keith Henry was appointed to the board on 31 March 2005. He was 
appointed to the Audit and Remuneration Committees at this date and  
was designated Senior Independent Director (‘SID’) on 14 September 
2005. As SID he was responsible for leading the evaluation of Board 
effectiveness in 2005.
Brian Lavers has announced that he will be stepping down as Chairman as 
at the date of the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 24 May but 
will continue to serve as a Non-executive Director. The Board considers 
that he will be independent in accordance with the Code. He will be 
replaced as Chairman by Keith Henry.
The Non-executive Directors bring varied commercial experience  
to Board and Committee deliberations. They are appointed, subject to 
election by shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’)  
after their appointment.
Biographical details of the Directors, are set out in pages 18 to 19. 
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year and a number  
of additional meetings. The attendance record of the Directors is shown  
to the right. 
The Board approves the Group’s strategy, investment plans and annual 
budget, and regularly reviews operational and financial performance, risk 
management and investment controls, and health, safety, environment  
and community matters. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to 
the Board for decision including expenditure commitments over certain 
specified minima, investments, disposals, borrowings and hedging policy. 
The Audit Committee has responsibility for scrutinising the integrity of 
financial information and the effectiveness of the Group’s financial controls 
and the internal control and risk management systems. The Board  
has delegated authority to the Remuneration Committee to set the 
remuneration policy for Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee 
recommends the appointment of Board Directors and has responsibility  
for succession planning at Board level. 
c hairman and c hief Executive
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and  
the Chief Executive. The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the 
Board, setting its agenda and ensuring its effectiveness, facilitating the 
contribution of the Non-executive Directors. The Chief Executive is 
responsible for formulating strategy and objectives and for their delivery 
once agreed by the Board.

briefed on issues arising at Board meetings and that they have full and 
timely access to relevant information.
Members of the Board may take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. During the year  
the Company Secretary, Hywel John, has provided updates to the Board 
on relevant governance matters, whilst the Audit Committee regularly 
considers new accounting developments through presentations from 
management and the external auditors. The Board programme includes 
presentations from management at every meeting which increases the 
Non-executive Directors’ understanding of the business and the sector.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary. He has responsibility for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and for governance matters. The appointment and removal of  
the Company Secretary is one of the matters reserved for the Board.
27 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
Performance evaluation
During the year the Board has undertaken a formal evaluation of its 
performance and effectiveness, and its Committees. Directors were asked 
to complete an extensive questionnaire, to provide comments on Board 
and Committee procedures and effectiveness, and to assess their own 
contributions to discussions and decision making. The questionnaires were 
then reviewed by the Senior Independent Director and key themes were 
discussed at a subsequent Board meeting. The evaluation process will be 
reviewed and developed over the current year. 
r e-election
The Memorandum and Articles of Association require that at least one  
third of the Board must go forward for reappointment at the AGM each 
year, together with all new Directors appointed since the previous AGM. 
Accordingly, no Director will serve a term in excess of three years without 
presenting themselves for re-election. The Directors who are due to go 
forward for reappointment in the forthcoming AGM are Michael Calvey, 
Brian Lavers and Finian O’Sullivan.
Board committees
The Board has delegated certain responsibilities to the Audit,  
Nomination and Remuneration Committees as set out below.  
The terms of reference of these Committees may be found on  
the Group’s website: www.burren.co.uk.
Audit c ommittee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Alan Cole and further comprises Brian 
Lavers, Michael Calvey and, Keith Henry (appointed 31 March 2005). The 
Board has determined that Michael Calvey has recent and relevant financial 
experience. Representatives of senior management and the external 
auditors are usually invited to attend Committee meetings. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee. The external auditors have 
unrestricted access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The role of the Audit Committee is to scrutinise the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements, review the Group’s risk management and internal 
controls procedures, monitor the independence and objectivity of the 
external auditors and to approve their engagement to supply non-audit 
services. During the year the Committee has met on four occasions.  
It reviewed the annual 2004 and interim 2005 financial statements  
and the restatement of the 2004 financial information according to 
International Financial Reporting Standards together with accompanying 
announcements paying particular attention to the sufficiency and clarity  
of disclosure and any significant matters of judgement. The Committee  
has also reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s financial controls  
and the internal control and risk management systems, as set out in  
more detail below.
During the year, the Committee considered in detail the results of the  
2004 audit, reviewed the external auditors’ overall audit plan for 2005 and, 
approved their remuneration and terms of engagement. Subsequent  
to year-end the Committee has also assessed in detail the results of the 
2005 audit. Having deemed the audit to be effective, and considered their 
independence in the context of the non-audit remuneration, the Committee 
recommended to the Board Deloitte’s re-appointment as auditors.
In addition, the Committee made its annual review of the necessity for  
the establishment of an internal audit function but currently considers that, 
given the extent of central control of the operations of the Group and the 
direct involvement of senior management in control activities, there is no 
requirement for such a function.
r emuneration c ommittee
This Committee, which comprises Brian Lavers (Chairman), Alan Cole, 
Michael Calvey and Keith Henry (appointed 31 March 2005), determines 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors. Non-executive Directors’ fees 
are considered and agreed by the Board. Further details of the Company’s 
policies on remuneration are given in the Remuneration Committee’s report 
on pages 30 to 34.
n omination c ommittee
The Nomination Committee meets when necessary and during 2005 
comprised Brian Lavers (Chairman), Alan Cole and Michael Calvey.  
Keith Henry was appointed to the Committee on 28 March 2006 and 
nominated Chairman of the Committee from that date. Finian O’Sullivan  
is not a member of the Committee although he is usually invited to  
attend meetings.
The Committee led the recruitment process for the appointment of Keith 
Henry as a Non-executive Director on 31 March 2005 which involved the 
use of external search consultants. 
int Ern Al controls
The Board has established a continuous process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been  
in place from the start of the financial year to the date of approval of this 
report. The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the system of 
internal controls for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. Any 
system of internal control can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated.
The Group’s risk and controls framework covers all material risks and 
controls including those of an operational, financial, and compliance nature. 
Internal control procedures consist, inter alia, of formal delegations of 
expenditure authority by the Board to executive management, and controls 
relating to key stages of transactions including supplier approval, contract 
signature, and payment release. Expenditure delegations are reviewed by 
the Board at least annually and approved together with the annual budget.
A Risk Committee comprising the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating 
Officer and the Company Secretary is charged with identifying, monitoring 
and managing risk generally and is required to review and formally approve 
all material contracts. The Risk Committee meets on an ad hoc basis as 
necessary. These control processes are complemented by effective 
monitoring at each stage in the cycle of transactions and by a regular 
detailed reporting system.
The Audit Committee conducted its annual review of risk and controls prior 
to year-end and reported its findings to the Board. Each potential risk was 
assessed and ranked in terms of potential impact on financial statements, 
Corporate governance continued
28 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
impact on business value, probability of occurrence, shareholder tolerance 
level and cost of mitigation. Policies and measures in place were reviewed 
and recommended actions identified. 
The Directors consider that the frequency of Board meetings and level  
of detail presented to the Board for its consideration in relation to the 
operations of the Group provide an appropriate process to identify, evaluate 
and manage significant risks relevant to its operations on a continuous 
basis, and this process is considered to be in accordance with Internal 
Control Guidance for Directors contained in the Code (‘Turnball Guidance’). 
In order to achieve a greater formalisation of the review process a policy 
was adopted early 2005 for risk and internal controls matters to be 
included as a specific agenda item at every Board meeting, when  
any control failings or weaknesses are reported on by management.
The Directors, having reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal 
controls and risk management during the year, consider that the system  
of internal control operated appropriately throughout the financial year and 
up to the date that the financial statements were signed.
c ommunic Ation with sh Ar Ehol DErs
Burren Energy attaches great importance to shareholder communication 
and maintains a dialogue with institutional shareholders, including 
presentations following announcements of annual and interim results. 
Burren has a website which contains a range of corporate information  
and is updated regularly.
During 2005 several of the major shareholders had direct representation  
on the Board. Communication with other major shareholders occurred  
via meetings during the year. The Board is kept informed by the Chief 
Executive and the Chief Financial Officer as to the views of the  
Company’s shareholders.

Directors’ remuneration report
intro Duction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Company’s 
shareholders on the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been 
properly prepared. The report has therefore been divided into separate 
sections for audited and unaudited information.
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and  
has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
u n Au Dit ED in Form Ation
r emuneration c ommittee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised solely of non-executive 
directors. The members of the Remuneration Committee are Brian Lavers 
(Chairman), Alan Cole, Keith Henry and Michael Calvey. The Chief 
Executive Officer is not a member of the Remuneration Committee but may 
attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of its proposals. 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making recommendations 
to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, regarding the framework 
and broad policy for remuneration matters. None of the members of the 
Remuneration Committee has any personal financial interest (other than as 
shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-
to-day involvement in running the business. The Remuneration Committee 
makes recommendations to the Board. No director plays a part in any 
discussion about his own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants  
to provide advice prior to the flotation of the Company in December 2003. 
The advice focused, in particular, on share incentive schemes to be 
implemented at that time. New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide 
any other services to the Group. The Remuneration Committee sought  
the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants on certain specific matters 
during 2005.
r emuneration policy
The Group’s policy is to maintain levels of remuneration sufficient to attract, 
motivate and retain directors of the highest calibre who can deliver growth 
in shareholder value. Executive remuneration currently consists of basic 
salary, benefits and performance related incentive schemes.
Basic salary and benefits
The Remuneration Committee reviews basic salary annually, taking into 
account any changes in responsibilities and competitive market practices. 
Benefits available to executive management comprise the payment of 
premiums for private health insurance, personal life insurance, disability  
and death in service benefit.
incentive schemes
The Company adopted four new schemes on flotation in December 2003: 
the Annual Profit Sharing Scheme, the Performance Share Plan, the Capital 
Enhancement Plan, and the Share Incentive Plan (together, the ‘New 
Incentive Schemes’). The Remuneration Committee has committed to 
review the operation of the New Incentive Schemes during 2006.
The key features of each of the incentive schemes are set out below:
Annual Profit s haring s cheme (the ‘APss ’)
(a) Under the APSS, the Company pays 5% of the Group’s operating profit 
on ordinary activities (after interest, financing charges, taxation and the 
payment of this sum, but before the deduction of  
any exceptional items as disclosed in the Company’s accounts) to its 
employees as an annual bonus. The level of bonuses is determined  
by reference to the annual audited results of the Group. 
(b) The Remuneration Committee determines individual bonus entitlement.
(c) In the event of any future acquisition by the Company funded by the 
issue of shares, the 5% bonus pool will be reduced proportionally by 
reference to the number of shares issued.
(d) Any amounts payable in excess of 50% of annual base salary with 
respect to Executive Directors and Senior Managers and 100% of base 
annual salary for all other staff, are made as a right to acquire shares  
in the Company, the exercise of which is deferred for a period of three 
years (a ‘Deferred APSS Award’). No payment is required upon exercise 
of any Deferred APSS Award.
(e) The number of shares in the Company subject to a Deferred APSS 
Award is normally calculated using the Company’s average share price 
over the last 30 days of the financial year to which the Deferred APSS 
Award relates.
(f) A Deferred APSS Award is normally capable of exercise in the six 
months commencing from the third anniversary of the end of the 
financial year to which the deferred bonus relates.
(g) Upon leaving the Group by reason of resignation or dismissal for cause 
any Deferred APSS Award will lapse. For all other leavers, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, awards will vest  
on a time-apportioned basis by reference to the actual period of 
employment. A change in control of the Company, but not an internal 
reorganisation, will also trigger the right to exercise Deferred APSS 
Awards early.
Performance s hare Plan (the ‘Ps P’)
(a) An award comprises an option to acquire shares in the Company.  
No payment is required from the option holder upon exercise.
(b) Prior to and conditional upon Flotation, one set of awards was made 
under the PSP on 12 November 2003 in respect of an aggregate of 
481,922 ordinary shares. The Company’s current policy is that other 
than those original awards, which were made to members of the 
executive management team at flotation in December 2003, no  
further awards will be granted under the PSP . In any event, should the 
Remuneration Committee decide to change that policy, no awards  
may be granted after 31 March 2013.
(c) Awards vest on the third anniversary of grant to the extent that the 
applicable performance condition has been satisfied and provided  
that the participant is still employed by a Group company. It will remain 
capable of exercise for a period of six months.
(d) An award will lapse upon the participant’s resignation or dismissal  
for cause. For all other leavers, awards can be retained to the extent 
30 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
that the performance condition is met at the time of cessation of 
employment and will vest as described above. However, unless  
the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, awards  
will vest on a time-apportioned basis by reference to the actual  
period of employment.
(e) In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding up of the 
Company, an award will vest early to the extent that the performance 
condition has been satisfied.
(f) The award was subject to a number of share price targets. These were 
all met in full during 2004.
c apital Enhancement Plan (the ‘c EP’)
General
The CEP is a long-term incentive plan under which cash payments may  
be made to senior executives following a strategic sale or return of capital  
to shareholders. It provides no entitlement to shares in the Company.  
The rationale for the CEP is that if significant shareholder return can  
be delivered through a sale of the Company, management should be 
encouraged to proceed with such a sale even though it may not otherwise 
be in their personal longer-term interests.
Eligibility
The Remuneration Committee, following consultation with the Chief 
Executive Officer from time to time, will select participants in the CEP  
and, subject to the total limit described below, will decide the quantum  
of these individual payments.
Payment
(a) Participants in the CEP will receive payment in the event of a sale of the 
Company to a third party provided that the annual average compound 
rate of return for shareholders from the date of flotation in December 
2003 is at least 10%. Amounts payable under the CEP will be equal to 
a percentage of the Company’s value as determined by the total sale 
consideration calculated as follows:
 r elevant percentage  
 of sale consideration  
 payable under the c EP
Annual rate of return for shareholders
Less than 10% 0%
10% or greater but less than 20% 0.5%
20% or greater but less than 30% 1.0%
30% or greater 1.5%
(b) Alternatively, if capital is returned to shareholders via the payment of a 
special dividend or share re-purchase, in whatever form, for example, 
following the sale of a material subsidiary or asset, an amount equal to 
1% of the total special dividend will become payable. The Board will be 
responsible for determining whether a return of capital constitutes a 
special dividend for these purposes.
s hare incentive Plan (‘the si P’)
For UK employees, including executive directors, the Company operates  
a tax favoured share plan under which shares are allocated to individuals 
annually up to a value of 10% of salary, subject to a cap of £3,000. Such 
shares are held in trust for the individual for a minimum of three years and  
if held for five years no income tax is payable.
Dilution
The rules of the APSS and the PSP permit awards to be over new issue 
shares, shares purchased in the market or treasury stock. The number of 
new shares that may be issued by the Company in the 10 years following 
the date of flotation in December 2003 to satisfy awards granted after 
Admission under the New Incentive Schemes and any other future 
employee share scheme operated by the Company will be restricted to 
10% of the issued share capital of the Company from time to time. The 
number of new shares that may be issued in the same period under the 
New Incentive Schemes other than the SIP and any other all-employee 
share scheme operated by the Company in respect of awards granted  
after Admission will be restricted to 5% of the issued share capital of the 
Company from time to time.
o ld incentive schemes
The incentive schemes existing prior to Flotation have been discontinued 
and no further awards will be made under these schemes. The schemes 
and their key features are set out below:
Executive s hare o ption s cheme 1998
All options became exercisable following Flotation and expire after seven 
years from the date of grant.
l ong t erm incentive Plan 1998
Under the terms of the Long Term Incentive Plan, executive directors and 
other senior managers received awards of ordinary share s in the form  
of nil priced options. Awards vest two years after the end of the initial 
performance year. Subsisting awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan 
have now vested according to the relevant performance conditions.
Pensions
The Company meets its statutory obligations by providing all personnel 
with access to stakeholder pension arrangements. The policy of the 
Company is not to make any contributions and to permit individuals  
to be responsible for their own pensions.

s ervice contracts
The Company’s policy is for all Executive Directors and executive managers to have permanent contracts of service that can be terminated by either the 
Director or the Company upon 12 months’ notice. Under these contracts compensation on termination may be negotiated individually but will not exceed  
12 months’ base salary plus a sum representing benefits and any bonuses that may be applicable. The Independent Non-executive Directors and the 
Chairman have letters of appointment that can be terminated by either the director or the Company upon one month’s notice. There is no legally binding 
commitment as to the terms of office though any appointment or reappointment would be subject to the Company’s Articles of Association that provide for 
retirement by rotation at least every three years. The letters of appointment applicable to the other non-executive directors can be terminated with immediate 
effect, appointment or reappointment being subject to the Company’s Articles of Association.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements. The Directors are required to prepare financial 
statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) and have also chosen to prepare accounts  
for the Company in accordance with IFRSs. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial  
statements in accordance with IFRSs, the Companies Act 1985 and  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year  
the Company’s financial position, financial performance and cash flows. 
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions,  
other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and 
recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out  
in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with  
all applicable IFRSs. 
Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies;
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; and 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the 
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of  
the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps  
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for 
the preparation of a Directors’ report and Directors’ remuneration report 
which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of  
the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing  
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

35 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
We have audited the Group and individual Company financial statements 
(the ‘financial statements’) of Burren Energy plc for the year ended  
31 December 2005 which comprise the consolidated and individual 
Company income statements, the consolidated and individual Company 
balance sheets, the consolidated and individual Company cash flow 
statements, the consolidated statement of recognised income and 
expense and the related notes 1 to 46. These financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also 
audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited. 
 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or  
for the opinions we have formed.
rE s PEctiv E r Es Ponsi Biliti Es o F Dir Ectors An D Au Ditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the Directors’ 
remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  
as adopted for use in the European Union are set out in the statement of 
Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of  
the Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited  
in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give  
a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting 
framework and whether the financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985  
and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We report to you if, in our opinion, the 
Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements. We also 
report to you if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if  
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is not disclosed.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not complied with 
any of the four Directors’ remuneration disclosure requirements specified 
for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. These 
comprise the amount of each element in the remuneration package and 
information on share options, details of long term incentive schemes, and 
money purchase and defined benefit schemes. We give a statement, to  
the extent possible, of details of any non-compliance.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 FRC 
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of  
the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We  
are not required to consider whether the board’s statements on  
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on  
the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures  
or its risk and control procedures.
Independent auditors’ report to the 
members of Burren Energy plc
We read the Directors’ report and the other information contained in the 
annual report, as described in the contents section, including the unaudited 
part of the Directors’ remuneration report and we consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or 
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
BAsis o F Au Dit o Pinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes  
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the 
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information  
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us 
with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report described  
as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we  
also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in  
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
described as having been audited.
oP inion
In our opinion:
the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted for use in the European Union, of the state of the 
Group’s and the individual company’s affairs as at 31 December 2005 
and of the Group’s and the individual company’s profit for the year then 
ended; and
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report described as having been audited have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation.
sEPA r At E o Pinion in r El Ation to iFrs
As explained in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Group and 
Company, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to comply  
with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union, has also complied with 
the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
Accordingly, in our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair  
view, in accordance with IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s and Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2005 and of the Group and the Company’s profit 
for the year then ended.

Notes to the Group financial statements
1 GENERAl I NFORmATION
Burren Energy plc is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office is given on the inside 
back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Review of Operations and the Financial Review on 
pages 10 to 17.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars for the first time because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IAS 21 (revised) The effects of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates 
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease
IFRIC 5 Right to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements  
of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when IFRS 7 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after  
1 January 2007.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POl ICIES
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB), for the first time. The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given  
in note 32.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4  
of the EU IAS Regulation. The financial statements have been prepared on a historic cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial 
instruments. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made 
up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so 
as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary  
are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill, any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition)  
is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the 
consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group records any fair value uplift on piecemeal acquisition of a subsidiary within the relevant fixed asset caption, with the related balance being 
transferred to a revaluation reserve. Where depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are increased following such a fair value uplift, an amount  
equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings as a movement in equity.
(c) Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the 
financial and operating policy decisions of the investee. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of  
the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Investments in 
associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less  
any impairment in the value of individual investments.
40 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POl ICIES continued
(d) Oil and gas assets: exploration and evaluation
The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 ‘Exploration 
for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources’, which it adopted early, from the date of transition to IFRS. Under the full cost method of accounting, costs of 
exploring for and evaluating oil and gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate cost pools. Such cost pools are based  
on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment. The Group currently has four cost pools: the Caspian, West Africa, the Middle East and India.
E&E costs are initially capitalised within ‘Intangible assets other than goodwill’. Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical services 
and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, 
which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred. 
Tangible assets acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to the extent that such a tangible asset  
is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence/prospect are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence (or otherwise) of 
commercial reserves has been determined. The Group’s definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proven and probable reserves on an 
entitlement basis.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cost pool basis as set out below and any impairment 
loss is recognised in the income statement. The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and 
production assets within property, plant and equipment.
Intangible E&E assets that relate to E&E activities that are determined not to have resulted in the discovery of commercial reserves remain capitalised 
as intangible E&E assets at cost less accumulated amortisation, subject to meeting a pool-wide impairment test as set out below. Such E&E assets 
are amortised on a unit of production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount. Such 
indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist. Where the E&E assets concerned fall within  
the scope of an established full cost pool, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets associated with 
that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally 
by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves. Where the E&E assets to be 
tested fall outside the scope of any established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will generally be 
written off in full. 
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement as additional depreciation and separately disclosed.
(e) Oil and gas assets: development and production
Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered  
and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as 
outlined above.
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production 
in the period to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those 
reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value 
of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount. The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of 
commercial reserves. The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be 
grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
(f) Decommissioning
Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field exists, a provision for 
decommissioning is recognised. The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local 
conditions and requirements. A tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created and depreciated on a unit of production  
basis. Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset.

2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POl ICIES continued
(g) Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets
Property, plant and equipment other than oil and gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation 
is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows:
Plant and equipment        4 years
Office furniture        4 years
Barges and tugs        20 years
(h) Oil and gas overlift and underlift
Underlifts of entitlement to crude oil production are recorded as a debtor and measured at the lower of production cost, including depreciation, and market 
value, whereas overlifts are recorded as a creditor and measured at market value.
(i) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable direct labour 
costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the 
estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for obsolete, 
slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
(j) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts invoiced (exclusive of sales related taxes) for the Group’s share of oil sales or charter revenue in the year. Oil sales revenue is 
recognised when the oil has been lifted and title has passed. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the 
effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset  
to that asset’s net carrying amount.
(k) Shipping repairs and renewals
Ships are dry-docked periodically and the costs are expensed as incurred. Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
(l) Foreign currencies
Transactions in currencies other than US dollars (‘foreign currencies’) are recorded in US dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the 
transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into US dollars at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated 
at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, 
except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts and options (see below for details of the Group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments).
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s subsidiaries which do not use US dollars as their functional currency are translated into US dollars 
at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless 
exchange rates fluctuate significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s profit and loss reserve. 
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 cumulative foreign exchange translation differences for all subsidiaries which do not use US dollars 
as a functional currency have been set to zero.
(m) l eases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other 
leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
42 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POl ICIES continued
(n) Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas profits tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from 
the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
(o) Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts 
where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Bank borrowings and loan notes
Interest-bearing bank borrowings and loan notes are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the profit and loss account using the effective 
interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company and Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to fluctuations in the price of crude oil. From time to time, the Group uses forward crude oil sales contracts,  
swaps and options to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles and limits  
on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly  
in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised within cost of sales in the income 
statement as they arise.
(p) Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the  
date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate  
of the number of shares that will eventually vest. Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating fair value.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model where there are conditions attached to the vesting and exercising of equity instruments. The expected life 
used in the model is adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

3 CRITICAl ACCOUNTING j UDGEmENTS AND k Ey SOURCES OF ESTImATION UNCERTAINTy
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, management has made the following judgements that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimations, which are dealt with below).
(a) Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
Under the full cost method of accounting for exploration and evaluation (‘E&E’) costs, such costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to 
appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value. This 
assessment involves judgement as to (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be determined, and (ii) future 
revenues and costs pertaining to any wider cost pool with which the asset in question is associated, and the discount rate to be applied to such revenues 
and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. Note 13 discloses the carrying amounts of the Group’s E&E assets.
key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
(b) Decommissioning
The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in Turkmenistan and the Republic of Congo. The extent to 
which a provision is required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, 
the cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to such costs. In addition, in certain jurisdictions 
the local authorities assume liability for such costs if they elect to continue production activities at the end of the licence or Production Sharing 
Agreement (PSA) period, which in turn depends on the level of commercial reserves remaining at the time of expiry. Based on these factors, the 
Directors do not believe that there is a material decommissioning liability at 31 December 2005 or 31 December 2004.
(c) Reserves
Development and production assets within Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated by reference to 
proven and probable entitlement reserves (‘commercial reserves’) and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and extracting those reserves. 
Commercial reserves are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery factors and future oil prices, the latter having an impact on the proportion of 
the gross reserves which are attributable to the host government under the terms of the PSA. Future development costs are estimated using assumptions 
as to numbers of wells required to produce the commercial reserves, the cost of such wells and associated production facilities, and other capital and 
operating costs. The current long-term Brent oil price assumption used in the estimation of commercial reserves is US$40.00. The impact upon commercial 
reserves and the aggregate depletion charge for the year of a +/– US$5.00 variation in the long term Brent oil price assumption is shown in the table below. 
The carrying amount of development and production assets at 31 December 2005 is shown in note 14.
       Commercial Depletion 
       reserves charge 
Long term Brent Price       (million barrels) (US$ million)

US$40       104.2 65.5
US$45       102.6 66.0
The level of estimated commercial reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Group’s development and 
production assets has been impaired.

The Group’s operations are conducted primarily outside the UK. Accordingly, the applicable tax rate used above is the average statutory rate of tax, 
weighted in proportion to accounting profits, applicable across the Group. The Group’s tax liability in the Republic of Congo is settled out of its share of oil 
under the terms of PSA and, as such, is not reflected in the tax charge for the year. During 2004 the statutory tax rate in Turkmenistan was reduced from 
25% to 20%.
The deferred tax provision at 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2004 is made up solely from accelerated tax depreciation and the movement in both 
years has been charged to the income statement.
A deferred tax asset of US$20.9 million at 31 December 2005 in the UK (2004: US$3.2 million), principally relating to carried forward tax losses, deferred 
share scheme deductions and foreign tax credits, has not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable UK taxable profits  
in the foreseeable future to enable the asset to be recovered. UK tax losses do not have an expiration date.
Deferred tax assets of US$0.7 million at 31 December 2005 in Cyprus (2004: US$0.4 million) and US$1.4 million at 31 December 2005 (2004: 
US$0.9 million) in Russia relating to tax losses, have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable taxable  
profits in the foreseeable future to enable the assets to be recovered. Cypriot tax losses do not have an expiration date, however, Russian  
tax losses expire after 10 years.
There are no material unrecognised temporary differences associated with the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of  
all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

(a) Held under finance leases
During 2003, certain of the Group’s property, plant and equipment were revalued due to the piecemeal acquisition of a subsidiary relating to the Group’s 
West African operations. On an historical cost basis, the carrying value of the Group’s development and production assets – West Africa would have been 
US$137 ,541,000 (2004: US$111,417 ,000).
The Group has pledged all its development and production assets in Turkmenistan and Congo, which account for substantially all of the development and 
production assets in the above table, as security for a medium-term loan facility granted to the Group.
15 ACq UISITION OF ASSOCIATE
On 14 February 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Unocal Bharat Limited (‘UBL ’), a company incorporated in Bermuda, for cash 
consideration of US$26,010,000. The principal asset of UBL is a 26% interest in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited (‘HOEC’), a publicly quoted Indian 
oil and gas exploration and production company. An analysis of the Group’s 26% share of HOEC’s assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is shown below.

The fair value of the Group’s interest in HOEC at 31 December 2005 was US$55,408,000.
Hardy Oil and Gas Limited (‘Hardy’), a company incorporated in the Isle of Man, has instigated legal action asserting that the acquisition of UBL by Burren 
infringed upon its rights, principally those of pre-emption, under a shareholder agreement signed in 1997 amongst the major shareholders of HOEC at that 
time. The Group is disputing that Hardy is party to the shareholder agreement and that the acquisition of UBL infringed upon the terms of that agreement. In 
the opinion of the Directors, it is not probable that the outcome of these actions will result in any material adverse change to the reported financial position of 
the Group.

with certain exploration commitments together with US$nil (2004: US$7 ,000,000) arising from margin calls related to oil price derivative contracts.
The average credit period given on sales of crude oil is 30 days from bill of lading. No interest is charged on the receivables. An allowance has been made  
for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of crude of US$103,000 (2004: US$222,000). This allowance has been determined by reference to past 
default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade debtors and other debtors approximates their fair value.
Credit risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade debtors and other debtors.
Trade debtors are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an 
identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered by management to be limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with  
high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk within its trade debtors since its Turkmenistan production and its Congo production are each all sold 
to a single purchaser. However in each case the purchaser is part of a major global oil group, and therefore the credit risk is considered by management to 
be acceptable.

Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs. The average credit period taken for trade 
purchases is 68 days (2004: 46 days).
During 2005, the third and final threshold was reached in relation to certain deferred purchase payments resulting from the Group’s purchase of its interest  
in Turkmenistan during 2000. Accordingly, an amount of US$23,333,333 (2004: US$11,666,666) in respect of the resulting deferred payment has been 
included in trade creditors and accruals, and capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
19 DERIvATIvE FINANCIAl INSTRUmENTS
The Financial Review contains a summary of the objectives and policies for holding or issuing oil price derivative instruments and similar contracts and the 
strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
At 31 December 2005, there were no open derivative positions. At 31 December 2004, the Group had hedged 1,000,000 barrels of crude oil via a cap and 
collar agreement with a maximum Dated Brent price of US$30.15/bbl and a minimum of US$28.00/bbl. The fair value of such open derivative positions, 
based on third party forward prices, amounted to a liability of US$nil (2004: US$10,528,000).
These derivative contracts were not designated as accounting hedges and accordingly the movement in fair values, amounting to a gain of US$10,528,000, 
has been taken to the income statement during the year. Together with realised losses of US$24,288,000 (2004: US$25,903,000) this resulted in a total loss 
on oil price derivatives contracts of US$13,760,000 (2004: US$30,964,000).

in note 31.
On 11 August 2005 the Group entered into a facility agreement with Natexis Banques Populaires (‘Natexis’) for a US dollar revolving borrowing base loan 
facility of up to US$150 million for a term of four years. The amount of the facility currently available is US$80 million. Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR 
plus an applicable margin and the facility is secured via a charge over the Group’s shares in (i) Burren Resources Petroleum Limited, which holds the Group’s 
interests in Turkmenistan, and (ii) Burren Energy Congo Limited, which holds the Group’s interests in Congo. No amounts were drawn under this loan facility 
at the year-end.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the Group’s borrowings approximates the fair value.

The finance leases relate to tugs and barges in the shipping segment. The average lease term is three to four years. For the year ended 31 December 2005, 
the average effective borrowing rate was 18.3% (2004: 18.3%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no 
arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. All lease obligations are denominated in US dollars. The Group’s obligations under 
finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.
The Directors consider that the fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying amount.

29 Sh ARE BASED PAym ENTS AND OTh ER INCENTIvE SCh EmE ARRANGEmENTS
A summary of the Group’s employee incentive schemes is set out below. In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied  
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The schemes accounted for under IFRS 2 are as follows:
Performance Share Plan (the ‘PSP’)
One set of awards comprising an option to acquire shares in the Company for nil payment was made on 12 November 2003 in respect of an aggregate  
of 481,922 ordinary shares. Vesting of these awards was dependent on a number of share price performance targets being met in the three year period 
following the Company’s flotation in December 2003. All such performance conditions have been met and the shares will vest on 12 November 2006.
Burren Energy Annual Profit Sharing Scheme (the ‘APSS’)
Under the APSS, 5% of the Group’s operating profit on ordinary activities after interest, financing charges, taxation and the payment of this sum, but before 
the deduction of any exceptional items as disclosed in the Group’s accounts, is paid to its employees as an annual bonus. Any amount payable in excess of 
50% of annual base salary with respect to Executive Directors and Senior Managers and 100% of base annual salary for all other staff, are made as a right  
to acquire shares in the Company, the exercise of which is deferred for a period of three years (a ‘Deferred APSS Award’). No payment is required upon 
exercise of any Deferred APSS Award. No payment is required from the option holder upon exercise. The number of shares in the Company subject to a 
Deferred bonus will normally be calculated using the Company’s average share price over the last 30 days of the financial year to which the Deferred bonus 
relates. The Deferred bonus will normally be able to be exercised in the six months commencing from the third anniversary of the end of the financial year to 
which the deferred bonus relates.
The share based elements of the above schemes are substantially similar, involving the award of equity settled share options at a nil exercise price, and 
accordingly the information for the schemes has been aggregated.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year in respect of these two schemes are as follows:
       2005 2004 
       Number of Number of 
       share options share options
Outstanding at beginning of period       608,459 481,922

Outstanding at the end of the period       873,644 608,459

No share options were exercised during the year in respect of the above schemes. Options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 1.71 years (2004: 2.37 years). As all of the share options have a nil exercise price the fair value at the date of grant was assumed  
to be equal to the share price on that day.
For share options granted in the year, the weighted average fair value of the options at measurement date was US$8.88 per share (2004: US$2.39 per share) 
based on the Group’s share price on the date of grant. During 2005, a charge of US$1,261,000 (2004: US$476,000) was recorded in respect of equity 
settled share payments accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
Under IFRS 2, charges in relation to equity settled share based payments are credited to a ‘Shares to be Issued Reserve’, therefore no liabilities have been 
recorded in respect of these schemes.
Executive Share Option Scheme (‘ESOS’) and  l ong-Term Incentive Plan 2003 (‘l TIP’) 
The share options in these schemes were all either granted prior to 7 November 2002 or had vested by 1 January 2005 and therefore do not fall within the 
scope of IFRS 2. Accordingly, the only charges arising in 2004 and 2005 in relation to these schemes relates to National Insurance Contributions (‘NICs’), 
based on the Company’s share price at the balance sheet date (see below).
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, awards may be taken in the form of shares or cash consideration at the discretion of the employee. The award is 
dependent on meeting performance criteria as set out and determined by the Remuneration Committee. The amounts in place at 31 December 2005  
relate to awards in respect of the performance year ended 31 March 2003, which have fully vested. 
Summary of charges to the income statement 
The total charge in relation to the Group’s share based payment arrangements was as follows:
       2005 2004

NICs on LTIP       927 1,177
Total       7,431 5,518
Included in charges for incentive schemes is $US3,632,000 (2004: $US1,736,000) relating to the cash element of the APSS which does not fall within the 
scope of IFRS 2 and is charged to the profit and loss account in the year of award.
30 EvENTS AFTER Th E BAl ANCE Sh EET DATE
The Group has signed agreements to acquire exploration interests in Yemen and Oman. The interest in Yemen comprises a 92% working interest in a new 
onshore production sharing agreement designated Block 6 on which Burren will be operator. In Oman, Burren is acquiring a 40% non-operated interest in 
the offshore Block 50. Both transactions are subject to approvals by the host governments that are expected shortly. Minimum expenditure commitments 
for Yemen and Oman are respectively US$5,000,000 and US$4,000,000.
The Group concluded the sale of its ship management business effective 28 February 2006 for cash consideration of US$4.6 million. The sale included 
three tug and barge combinations that Burren operated under finance lease purchase arrangements. The purchaser is assuming all continuing lease 
obligations relevant to these vessels. No material gain or loss will be recognised upon sale.

32 ExPl ANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS
This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements under IFRS. The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 
31 December 2004 and the date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 January 2004. Previously the Group presented its accounts in sterling, but because 
US dollars is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates, the Directors took the decision to present the Group’s 
accounts in US dollars with effect from 2005.

Notes to the reconciliation of equity at 1 j anuary 2004
The following notes explain the reconciliation between the UK GAAP consolidated transition date balance sheet as derived from the 31 December 2003 
annual report and translated into US dollars, and the IFRS transition date balance sheet.
(a) Intangible assets other than goodwill
Under UK GAAP, intangible fixed assets represented pre-licence acquisition costs and exploration and evaluation (‘E&E’) costs of individual licence interests 
held outside the depreciable cost pools pending determination of commerciality. Under IFRS, intangible assets have been adjusted to write off cumulative 
pre-licence acquisition costs of US$507 ,000 and to include E&E costs of US$2,836,000 that under UK GAAP had been capitalised in a full cost pool within 
tangible fixed assets, resulting in a net increase of US$2,329,000.
(b) Property, plant and equipment
Under UK GAAP, tangible fixed assets comprised:
Oil and gas properties for which the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves had been established, recorded by reference to broad, geographic 
cost pools. This caption also included certain exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred within the cost pools.
Other fixed assets, including non oil and gas specific plant and equipment, office furniture, barges and tugs.
Under IFRS, all amounts previously classified as tangible fixed assets have been recorded as Property, Plant and Equipment except for exploration and 
evaluation expenditure of US$2,836,000 in relation to non-producing fields for which the existence of commercial reserves has not yet been determined 
(reclassified to intangible assets). Additional accumulated depreciation of US$284,000 has also been charged under IFRS, as described in note (b) to the 
reconciliation of profit for 2004. This has resulted in a net decrease at 31 December 2003 of US$3,120,000.

•
57 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2005
32 ExPl ANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS continued
(c) Trade and other payables
The decrease of US$4,171,000 results from the de-recognition of an accrual under UK GAAP for the deferred share element of the 2003 APSS award which, 
under IFRS, will be accrued over the 36 month vesting period beginning 1 January 2004 and the reclassification of an accrual for existing share schemes to 
a shares to be issued reserve in line with IFRS.
(d) Unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts
The liability of US$5,467 ,000 recognised under IFRS represents the mark-to-market liability (unrealised loss) of the Brent collar contracts that were open at 
year end based on market quotations.
(e) Shares to be issued
The difference between the measurement and accounting treatment of share incentive scheme awards is described in note (d) to the reconciliation of profit 
for 2004. Under both UK GAAP and IFRS charges made to income in respect of share incentive scheme awards are credited to a ‘Shares to be Issued’ 
reserve. The US$3,888,000 addition to this reserve reflects the cumulative increase in share incentive scheme charges prior to transition date and 
reclassification as discussed in note (c) above.
(f) Profit and loss account
The above adjustments result in a US$5,975,000 reduction in retained earnings.

Notes to reconciliations for the year ended 31 December 2004
The following notes explain the reconciliations between the UK GAAP financial statements, as derived from the 31 December 2004 annual report and 
translated into US dollars, and the IFRS comparative financial information.
Consolidated income statement
(a) Oil price derivative contracts
Under UK GAAP realised losses on oil price derivative contracts were netted off against turnover. Under IFRS hedge accounting treatment for the 
outstanding contracts is not achievable owing to the absence of documentation demonstrating the effectiveness of the contract from the outset.  
Realised losses on these contracts, amounting to US$25,903,000, have therefore been included in cost of sales and revenue has been increased  
by an equivalent amount.
Under UK GAAP unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts relating to expected future sales of crude were only accounted for when the 
related physical transaction occurred. However under IFRS such contracts are marked to market and the fair value recognised in the balance sheet. The 
resultant movement in fair values is recognised in the profit and loss account: this amounted to a loss of US$5,061,000. Together with realised losses of 
US$25,903,000 this resulted in a total loss on oil price derivatives contracts of US$30,964,000.
(b) Depreciation
Under UK GAAP costs carried within each regional cost pool, which may contain a number of individual fields, were depreciated on a unit of production 
basis by reference to that cost pool. Under IFRS costs are still depreciated on a unit of production basis but by reference to specific fields. The accounting 
change has increased depreciation by US$569,000 for the year ended 31 December 2004.
(c) Pre-licence costs
Under UK GAAP all costs incurred prior to having obtained the licence rights were included within intangible fixed assets. Under IFRS such expenditure has 
to be written off in full in the year in which it occurs. Cost of sales has therefore increased by US$12,000.

(d) Charge in respect of share incentive schemes
The Group operates a number of share incentive schemes. Under UK GAAP deferred share awards were valued at their intrinsic value at the balance sheet 
date (having no regard to potential future share price movements) and charged to the income statement in the financial year to which the award related.
IFRS requires deferred share awards granted by the Company to employees to be valued at fair value at the grant date. Such fair value should be based on a 
model appropriate to value the inherent optionality of the incentive schemes including but not limited to potential future share price movements, and charged 
to the income statement pro rata over the vesting period of the related awards.
The transitional provisions of IFRS 2 allow that share incentive options granted before 7 November 2002 or which vested before 1 January 2005 are exempt 
from restatement. On this basis restatements have only been required for the following two schemes:
Performance Share Plan
The cost in relation to this plan, which consists of share options granted before the Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’), and vesting over a three year period, was fully 
charged to the income statement in 2004 under UK GAAP as the related performance criteria had been met in full. Under IFRS this charge is spread over 
the vesting period. This has resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$772,000.
Annual Profit Share Scheme (APSS)
This scheme includes both a cash and a deferred share element, with shares issued under the latter vesting over a three year period. The cost of both 
elements of this scheme was fully charged to the income statement in 2004 under UK GAAP . However under IFRS the deferred share element of this charge 
is spread over the vesting period. This has resulted in a credit to the income statement of US$2,038,000.
This accounting change has therefore reduced the charge in respect of share incentive schemes by US$2,810,000.
(e) Dividends declared
Under UK GAAP proposed dividends were recognised in the financial year in respect of which they relate, even if such dividends were declared subsequent 
to the balance sheet date. Under IFRS they are recognised in the period in which they are formally declared.
The change in timing of recognising proposed dividends increased reported retained earnings of the Group as at 31 December 2004 by US$7 ,550,000, 
being the 2004 dividend proposed in 2005.
(f) Taxation
There was no impact on current or deferred tax charges for the year ended 31 December 2004. This was because the adjustments either increased  
the size of a deferred tax asset that has not been treated as recoverable or because they arose in a jurisdiction with a zero percentage tax rate.
Consolidated balance sheet
(g) Intangible assets other than goodwill
For the reasons described in note (a) to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004, intangible assets have been adjusted to write off cumulative pre-
licence acquisition costs of US$519,000 and to include E&E costs of US$5,104,000 that under UK GAAP had been capitalised in a full cost pool within 
tangible fixed assets, giving a net increase in intangible assets of US$4,585,000.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
For the reasons described in note (b) to the reconciliation of equity at 1 January 2004, all amounts previously classified as tangible fixed assets have been 
recorded as property, plant and equipment except for exploration and evaluation expenditure of US$5,104,000 in relation to non-producing fields for which 
the existence of commercial reserves has not yet been determined (reclassified to intangible assets). Additional cumulative depreciation of US$853,000 has 
also been charged under IFRS, for the reasons described in (b) above. Following reclassification of casing and tubing on hand US$3,189,265 has also been 
transferred from fixed assets to stock.
(i) Trade and other payables
The decrease of US$7 ,550,000 results from the proposed dividend being recognised under IFRS in the period in which it was formally declared, being 2005, 
instead of in 2004.
(j) Unrealised gains and losses on oil price derivative contracts
The liability of US$10,528,000 recognised under IFRS represents the mark-to-market liability (unrealised loss) of the Brent collar contracts that were open  
at year end based on market quotations. Of this US$ 5,467 ,000 was recognised in the restated balance sheet at the transition date. The difference of 
US$5,061,000 has been charged to the 2004 income statement.
(k) Shares to be issued
The difference between the measurement and accounting treatment of share incentive scheme awards is described in note (d) above. Under both UK GAAP 
and IFRS charges made to income in respect of share incentive scheme awards are credited to a ‘Shares to be issued’ reserve. The US$3,093,000 
reduction in this reserve reflects the cumulative reduction in share incentive scheme charges to income, of which US$2,810,000 was credited to the 2004 
income statement.

(l) Profit and loss account
The above adjustments result in a US$1,257 ,000 reduction in retained earnings.
Consolidated cash flow statement
(m) Reclassifications from UK GAAP
The UK GAAP £ denominated figures are shown after reclassifying certain standard headings under UK GAAP (being taxation, returns on investments  
and servicing of finance and capital expenditure) to their equivalents under IFRS.
(n) Reclassification of pre-licence expenditure
Pre-licence costs were shown within ‘Capital expenditure’ under UK GAAP . Since such costs are being expensed under IFRS, they have been classified 
within operating cash flows under IFRS.
(o) Reclassification of fixed asset expenditure
Purchases of tangible fixed assets under UK GAAP have been reclassified to purchases of intangible assets and purchases of property, plant and 
equipment under IFRS.
(p) Reclassification of casing and tubing
Casing and tubing on hand of US$3,189,265 has been reclassified from fixed assets to stock. Accordingly, payments made in respect of such assets  
have been reclassified from investing to operating cash flows.
(q) Reclassification of exploration commitments
Deposits made in relation to exploration commitments of US$7 ,000,000 have been reclassified from operating to investing cash flows.

The effect of the transition to IFRS on the Company balance sheet at 31 December 2004 was to increase its net equity by US$7 ,550,000 due to the 
requirement to recognise dividends in the period in which they are formally declared rather than the period to which they relate. Net equity at 1 January 2004 
was increased by US$4,171,000 due to the de-recognition of an accrual under UK GAAP for a deferred share award, as described in paragraph (c) of the 
notes to the reconciliation of Group equity at 1 January 2004 in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.

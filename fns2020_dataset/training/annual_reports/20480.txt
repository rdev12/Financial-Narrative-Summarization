03 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 “ I have thoroughly enjoyed every year I have chaired Admiral.  
It is a special business”
Chairman’s statement
Succession
As announced recently this will be my last 
statement as Chairman as I shall be retiring 
at the forthcoming AGM. Given Admiral’s 
distinctive culture which underpins the 
success the business has achieved I have 
considered it my responsibility to ensure 
the Board should have a choice of strong 
internal candidates as my successor. I am 
very grateful to Penny James for leading the 
selection process which confirmed that the 
Board already had within its ranks individuals 
with the skills and experience to lead the 
Board through the challenges of the next 
five to ten years. I am delighted that as the 
outcome to that process the Board has 
selected Annette Court as my successor  
and I wish her every success. 
If I may be excused a little nostalgia, when 
I became Chairman in June 2000 Admiral 
provided private car insurance in the UK to 
512k customers with a 3% market share and 
employed 1,270 people just in Cardiff and 
Swansea. Turnover and profitability in 2000 
were £262 million and £24 million respectively. 
We now have 5.2 million customers across 5 
countries and employ almost 9,000 people 
across 16 sites and 8 countries. 2016 turnover 
and profits achieved £2.6 billion and £284 
million, or £390 million if we back out the 
impact of the Ogden rate change – that’s 
almost a 10-fold increase in turnover and a 
16-fold increase in profitability in 16 years. 
We are valued at over £5 billion and are ranked 
84 in the FTSE. We have 5 motor insurance 
businesses; 4 price comparison businesses; 
a household insurance business; 2 legal 
businesses; a start-up loans business and not 
to mention a price comparison incubator. 
The essence of Admiral
On the one hand Admiral has changed 
enormously, on the other not very much 
at all. Fundamental to our success remains 
our culture – Admiral is different in the way 
in which we engage and lead our people: in 
demonstrating in so many practical ways that 
everyone matters regardless of their role: in 
how we motivate their aiming for continuous 
improvement in everything they do: in our 
use of teamwork and our openness to share 
and support others to do a great job, whether 
or not they are in the same department, 
business, or even country: in our use of wide 
share ownership, both actual and potential, 
as a driver of common purpose. To maintain a 
culture requires it to be continually reinforced 
– to be lived by our leaders in the way in 
which they interact with those they lead: 
to be trained into our people as part of our 
development plans: to be the basis on which 
we select those who should be promoted 
to greater responsibility. I consider one of 
our management’s greatest achievements 
to be that as we have broadened our base, 
both geographically and by business-line, we 
have been able to establish that culture in 
these new businesses. Whichever of Admiral’s 
offices I visit, from Seville to Swansea, I know 
I am in Admiral because of the way in which 
our people interact with our customers and 
with each other; their quest to identify the 
small changes in what we do and how we do it 
that, taken together, create a big competitive 
difference; and their openness to discuss 
problems and willingness to embrace the 
thoughts of others. 
Test and learn has always been core to 
Admiral’s culture. Rather than spending a 
lot of time analysing an opportunity from 
every perspective and then committing 
a large investment we would rather make 
a small investment of time and/or money 
quickly and learn by doing. Partnering test 
and learn is the willingness to acknowledge 
openly when something hasn’t worked 
and either change or move on recognising 
these as opportunities to improve rather 
than mistakes for which blame should be 
attributed. This approach of test and learn is 
central to our assessing which we will pursue 
seriously amongst the other business lines 
that could complement our core strengths in 
car insurance, either because our customers

Alastair Lyons, CBE  
Chairman
04 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Chairman’s statement would view the new products as relevant 
to their existing relationship with Admiral 
or because the new line of business uses 
experience and skills that we have developed 
for car insurance. Our current piloting of 
personal loans is a case in point here, whilst 
our UK household insurance portfolio of 
470,000 policies and already profitable three 
years after launch is a great example of a line 
of business that has passed successfully from 
pilot into full production. 
Whilst we devote time and resource to 
exploring new opportunities outside of 
car insurance we also recognise fully that 
this remains our core focus with significant 
potential for growth beyond our current 
13% market share as and when it is the 
right point in the cycle to grow. So the 
capability required to develop our business 
must be, and is, incremental to, rather than 
dilutive of, our core. We continue to invest 
as much thought and resource as we ever 
have in improving the effectiveness of our 
motor insurance proposition, whether it be 
in pricing analytics, claims management, 
or customer self-service. However we 
also recognise that if we are to develop 
successfully new lines of business such as 
personal loans we need to add new skills and 
experience to our existing management 
whilst at the same time assimilating this new 
talent within our distinctive culture. 
We are also strong believers in the potential 
of partnership to combine the skills, 
experience and resources of others with 
those that Admiral has developed and to 
share both risk and reward when entering 
new markets, particularly those that require 
material levels of investment. Our long term 
partnership with Munich Re has lasted for 
17 years and is committed through to at 
least 2020 in the UK: we are partnering with 
Mapfre in Spanish and US price comparison 
and in Preminen, our price comparison 
incubator: White Mountains, the US 
insurance venture capital specialist, is also 
invested alongside Admiral in compare.com

“The agent who set up my policy, Kath, was excellent. She was 
extremely efficient and was able to quickly sort out a quote for me 
based on two vehicles and a household on a multi-product policy. 
She was also able to cancel the previous two policies. I don’t know 
what you’re feeding these folks, but these aren’t just normal agents, 
they’re some kind of ‘super-agents’”
UK New Business
A great customer experience
which has made strong progress again 
this year, increasing the number of insurer 
partners and, therefore, the number of 
quotes returned to customers, driving down 
cost per sale, and raising its penetration of 
its target markets. But changing the pattern 
of distribution in US auto insurance is a big 
nut to crack and we may take others into 
partnership along this journey. 
2016 in overview
This year’s performance is testament to  
our focussing successfully on our core UK 
motor business, our book growing by 11%  
to 3.6 million cars, a 13% market share  
whilst UK motor generated profits of  
£441 million (before the impact of the 
Ogden rate change), maintaining last year’s 
level. The UK motor profit after the impact 
of the Ogden change is £336 million. We 
have continued to take advantage of firm 
market conditions to move prices ahead 
a little more slowly than the average of 
the market allowing us to grow our book 
whilst returning a good underwriting result 
for Admiral and its reinsurance partners. 
Effective pricing supported by data analysis 
and predictive modelling, and really 
insightful claims management underpin our 
success and we are always looking for new 
ways to make risk analysis more reflective 
of the characteristics of the individual 
driver. In this vein we believe we are now the 
largest deployer of telematics in the UK. 
2016 was broadly a year of growth across 
our insurance businesses outside the UK, 
taking advantage of the sound platforms 
that have now been created in Italy, the US, 
and Spain and the move in France last year to 
in-source all our operations as the precursor 
of growth. In the US we had 20% more 
customers at the end of 2016 than at the 
beginning, whilst our European operations 
grew by 31%. The insurance business model 
in the US is different to Europe with much 
higher new business acquisition costs, so 
growth requires investment. In Europe, there 
will also be periods when countries decide 
the market conditions are right to accelerate 
which may in turn justify further investment, 
as in Spain this year.
Our price comparison sector combines a 
highly competitive operation in a largely 
mature market (Confused); market-leading 
players with large market shares but whose 
challenge is growth in markets where there 
is little incentive for customers to look to 
switch insurers (Rastreator and LeLynx); 
and a business that is seeking to rewrite the 
rules of insurance customer engagement 
(compare.com). Across the piece our 
combined price comparison operations made 
a small profit, supported by encouraging 
progress by Confused as it seeks to establish 
a differentiated market positioning as ‘No. 1 
for car savings’. 
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Introduction
05 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report  For the last couple of months the resetting 
of the Ogden rate by the Ministry of 
Justice has represented a significant area 
of uncertainty outside of our control. The 
announcement on 27 February 2017 by the 
Lord Chancellor of the new rate of minus 
0.75% has allowed this to be reflected 
within our 2016 accounts and represents a 
very material reduction from the previous 
2.5% rate, increasing claims reserves by 
more than we would want to absorb within 
the, albeit significant, margin that we hold 
over best estimate. We have, therefore, 
reduced our second half reported results 
by £105 million, and to a much lesser 
extent the profits of subsequent years 
will also be reduced as the affected claims 
settle. Given, however, our strong capital 
position, this has not impacted our ability 
to maintain our 2016 final dividend at the 
level we declared in 2015. We anticipate 
that if market pricing adjusts future 
premiums to reflect the lower discount 
rate, there will be no significant impact on 
future business and its profitability after 
the change. We strongly support the ABI’s 
call for a fundamental review of the basis 
on which the Ogden rate is set in order to 
ensure that the relevant compensation 
awards are set appropriately and welcome 
the intent of the Lord Chancellor and the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer to implement 
this review expeditiously.
A proposed final dividend of 51.5 pence per 
share brings dividends for the year to 114.4 
pence per share, a yield of 6.3% on the £18.18 
share price at the 2016 year end. 
The team
May last year marked the retirement 
of Henry Engelhardt after 25 years as 
Chief Executive albeit I am delighted he 
is continuing to give us some of his time 
working in the UK and overseas. That the 
transition from Henry to David Stevens 
has been seamless is itself testament to 
Admiral’s culture of teamwork and open 
management. Henry always said that he 
would time his retirement when he judged 
the business had the required depth of 
management and over the years the Board 
has focussed on understanding the talent 
emerging within the business and how it 
has been, and is planned to be, developed. 
It is, therefore, very gratifying to see David 
now ably supported by Cristina Nestares 
leading the UK Insurance business, with 
Alistair Hargreaves working alongside her, 
and by Milena Mondini leading the European 
insurance businesses. Cristina and Milena 
have both been with Admiral for 11 years 
having founded, and successfully developed, 
our Spanish and Italian insurance businesses 
and then broadened their management 
responsibilities leading to their current 
roles. Alistair has been with Admiral eight 
years, having begun his career in finance 
and investor relations and then taken 
increasingly significant management roles 
within the UK motor business. Development 
and recruitment of management talent is a 
core enabler of Admiral’s continued growth 
and development and I am very encouraged 
by the quality and potential of those I meet 
in middle and senior management positions 
as I spend time across our various businesses. 
Thank you
I have thoroughly enjoyed every year I have 
chaired Admiral. It is a special business 
because of the way in which it does business, 
its absolute focus on delivering what the 
customer wants, and its beliefs that if people 
enjoy what they are doing and own part of 
the business that employs them they will 
do a better job. In the same way as Admiral 
seeks to assess the right price for each 
driver as an individual so it respects the 
contribution of each individual who works 
with us, caring about their well-being and 
giving them the opportunity to develop and 
progress to fulfil their individual potential. It 
is a company with which I am very proud to 
have been associated and I thank everyone 
in Admiral with whom I have worked for a 
great experience. 
With a core business in such good form, a 
nursery of other businesses at varying stages 
of maturity, and a hothouse of opportunities 
which may or may not take root and get 
planted out, but most of all with the people 
we have in the business, I am confident that 
Admiral will continue to develop and prosper 
over the next 16 years as it has over the last.

A great customer experience
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
11 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Every day revolves around attracting, keeping and satisfying 
customers. We value customers above everything else and strive  
to design products that customers want and that represent value  
for money.
How we do it – our model
We go out of our way 
to make Admiral a 
GREAT place to work 
and believe that if 
people like what they 
do, they’ll do it better. 
We have created an 
environment where 
Admiral employees 
look forward to coming 
to work and providing 
great service to 
customers. 
Sharing risk with co- and 
reinsurance partners 
is an important part of 
Admiral’s business and 
these relationships are 
underpinned by strong 
underwriting results. 
Sharing risk allows 
Admiral to only provide 
capital backing for a 
minority of its business; 
this results in a superior 
return on capital for 
Admiral shareholders 
whilst also providing 
protection for losses.
We are committed to 
returning excess capital 
to shareholders. We 
believe that keeping 
management hungry 
for cash keeps them 
focused on the most 
important aspects of 
the business. We don’t 
starve our businesses, 
but neither do we allow 
them the luxury of 
excess capital.
Admiral continues to 
focus on bottom-line 
profitability both in 
the short, medium and 
long term, and this 
perspective guides 
the decisions we 
make across all of our 
business operations. 
The Group’s strategy is 
to build profitable and 
sustainable business 
operations for the  
long term.
All our growth, at home 
and overseas, has been 
organic. We have built 
each business from the 
ground up, identifying 
and understanding the 
opportunity, taking 
measured steps to test 
how well we understand 
the challenge ahead 
and the effectiveness 
of our solutions, and 
then to learn from that 
experience and from 
the experience of those 
who have tried other 
strategies.

pre Ogden
post Ogden What a great… performance
Very few people can claim to have contributed 
as much to Admiral’s success as Alastair Lyons. 
So it’d be wrong to start my first Chief Executive 
report with anything other than a tribute to his 
contribution over the last 16 years. The Board 
collectively, Admiral’s senior managers, and Henry 
and myself in particular, have benefitted from his 
wisdom, experience and thoughtfulness, and during 
our (occasional) moments of crisis, his composure.
Perhaps most importantly, notwithstanding an 
apparently conservative profile as a Chartered 
Accountant and financial services veteran, Alastair 
has consistently been an encouraging supporter of 
Admiral’s distinctiveness rather than an advocate 
of the apparently safe option of convergence to 
industry norms.
In his statement, Alastair has laid out the 
transformation, in scale and breadth, of Admiral 
over the 16 years of his stewardship. He describes 
how 2016 has been another year of substantial 
growth both in our core UK car insurance business 
and across the Group as a whole.
Rather than re-visit 2016 myself (and to duck 
the challenge of trying to find a pithy culinary 
metaphor to describe the year – see previous Chief 
Executive Statements), I’ll look forward and answer 
a question some shareholders may be asking. 
Namely: “Should I sell Admiral and buy Insurtech?”
For those of you with limited time, or for whom the 
suspense is too much, the short answer, in my view, 
is “no”. Read on for a longer answer.
Insurtech is generating lots of excitement. Visiting 
investment bankers, who historically would have 
arrived with fat packs on attractive big ticket 
acquisitions, now also include charts showing 
the explosive growth in Insurtech, along with a 
busy “Insurtech landscape” page, packed with 
the colourful logos of whizzily named Insurtech 
start-ups, bunched (sometimes shoe-horned) 
into helpful categories (“sharing economy”, 
“P2P”, “mobile insurance”, “telematics”, “auto 
comparison”, “short term cover”). A big brand 
consulting firm recently shared the results of a 
survey suggesting that “insurance CEO’s” expect 
new entrants to capture 30% of the insurance 
market over the next five years.
I disagree. 
I say that not because the ideas emerging aren’t 
interesting, far from it. Nor because many of the 
Insurtech pioneers aren’t very bright and creative 
(and it’s great to see that creativity focussed 
on insurance).
I disagree for two reasons.
The first reason is that many of the ideas won’t 
work in practice. Many, while technologically 
feasible, even impressive, involve an under-
appreciation of the complexity of insurance; the 
importance, for example, of avoiding customers 
you really don’t want to insure or the challenge 
of engaging policyholders in a deeper interaction 
with their insurance when, in truth, most of our 
customers want the opposite. Insurtech start-
ups promising on-again, off-again, item by item 
insurance are offering a consumer “benefit” that 
most of our customers wouldn’t recognise as such.
The second reason is that Admiral already, in many 
important respects, is “Insurtech”. The two most 
fundamental Insurtech sectors; “fundamental” in 
terms of their ability to transform the competitive 
landscape and substantially re-distribute market 
share, are “auto-comparison” and “telematics”. 
On “auto-comparison” we are leading players with 
established businesses in the UK, Spain and France 
and a pioneering, potentially transformational US 
price comparison business in compare.com. And 
as for “telematics”, we sell telematics-based car 
insurance in three countries and in the UK we are, by 
some margin, the largest player in the market with 
over 200,000 live policies. Beyond those sectors, 
our ever-evolving range of products (“Airbnb” home 
insurance, Admiral short-term cover, insurance 
cover for the peer to peer car sharing sites) show 
we’re not neglecting the interesting, if at this point 
more marginal, emerging opportunities. Admiral’s 
success has always been about embracing change 
when that’s in the interest of our customers and 
shareholders. So stick with us and enjoy the best  
of insurance, and Insurtech, all in one bundle.

16 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Chief Executive’s Statement My priorities for the forthcoming year are  
set out below. I expect them to remain my 
priorities for a number of years to come.
Ensure Admiral remains one of, if not the, best car 
insurers in the UK
Admiral has built its success on doing car insurance more 
effectively that its peers. Maintaining our lead in cost 
efficiency, rigorous risk selection and effective claims 
management has required Admiral to keep evolving and 
innovating and we need to continue to do so in the future.
Demonstrate Admiral can be a great car  
insurer beyond the UK
Our insurance operations beyond the UK are at 
different stages of development and relative 
competitive competence. Mobilising, ideally, all the 
collective talents of the Group, to ensure most, or all, 
of these operations become sources of sustainable 
profitable growth is a priority.
Develop sources of growth and profits  
beyond car insurance
Admiral’s first major diversification from car insurance 
was household insurance, launched three years ago in the 
UK. I expect the second will be personal lending in the UK. 
Both take us into huge markets and in both cases our car 
insurance heritage provides some of the necessary skills 
and assets to succeed. Our priority will be to grow both, 
focussing on a long term objective of developing sources  
of competitive advantage, not short term top or bottom-
line objectives.
Ensure Admiral stays a great place to work
I don’t run Admiral purely for the benefit of shareholders. 
It’s important that those of us who work for Admiral are 
glad we do, most of the time. Happily, what’s good for 
staff is normally good for shareholders. A key reason 
for Admiral’s success over the last 25 years has been the 
loyalty of talented staff to the company, and the collective 
sense of shared endeavour that has helped us do lots of 
things a little better than our competitors.
My priorities
17 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction  
It’s tempting to focus almost entirely on 
Ogden in writing a review of 2016’s results, 
but whilst it deserves attention (and it’s 
coming), there is more to talk about.
Given Ogden, the Group’s share of pre-tax 
profit reduced materially to £284 million 
from £377 million last year. On a statutory 
basis, the reduction is similar, with Group 
profit before tax at £278 million compared 
to £369 million in 2015. 
Without the Ogden change, the Group’s 
share of pre-tax profit would have been 
£390 million, of which the UK Car Insurance 
business would have contributed £441 
million, in line with last year. Our combined 
international insurance businesses improved 
their result (£19 million loss v £22 million 
loss) whilst the comparison operations 
recorded a profit of £3 million after making 
losses of £7 million in 2015. On a statutory 
basis, the price comparison result is a loss of 
£3 million compared to a loss of £16 million 
last year.
Notwithstanding the Ogden impact, the 
strength of the Group’s capital position has 
allowed us to propose a final dividend of 51.5 
pence per share, in line with the final 2015 
dividend (before adding the return of surplus 
capital that was paid a year ago).
If forced to describe the year in one word, 
for me it would be Growth. 2016 saw very 
strong advances in turnover (a record and 
22% higher than 2015), customer numbers 
(another record at 5.2 million) and net 
revenue (up 13% to £1 billion). Whilst UK 
motor grew healthily, our businesses in other 
markets (including UK household) grew very 
nicely and continue to represent a bigger 
share of the Group’s KPIs.
Our international operations in insurance and 
comparison continued to make meaningful 
and pleasing progress against their objectives. 
It’s inevitably hard to pick highlights, but 
some of mine would be:
• 720,000 – the number of new 
customers we welcomed to the  
Group in 12 months.
• 1,035,000 – customers beyond UK 
Insurance, up 215,000 in a year. 
• 212% – solvency ratio after the Ogden 
impact and proposed final dividend. 
• 100% – all UK insurance new business  
now transacted on the new policy  
system, Guidewire.
• Record profits at Rastreator in Spain and 
another profit (for the third successive 
financial year) from ConTe in Italy.
Full detail on the results follows but let  
me cover a couple of things:
Ogden (inevitably), capital  
and dividend 
Readers will be aware I’m sure, but in 
December 2016 we heard that a new Ogden 
discount rate was imminent (the first change 
since 2001). The announcement came at 
the end of February 2017 that the new 
rate would be minus 0.75% – a substantial 
reduction on the previous rate of 2.5%. 
We estimate that the ultimate cost (net 
of reinsurance and tax) on open claims and 
claims arising on business written to the date 
of change of a move to minus 0.75% from 
2.5% will be approximately £150 million.

“ If forced to describe the year in one word, for me it  
would be Growth”
Geraint Jones  
Chief Financial Officer
18 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Chief Financial Officer’s review The reduction in profit in 2016 means that a 
large portion of the impact of the change has 
been recognised already, with the balance 
(something in the order of £65 million post-
tax) to be reflected in the coming years in 
the form of lower reserve releases and profit 
commission than would otherwise have been 
the case with an unchanged rate.
Ogden is of course only one variable involved 
in estimating the reserves, and as you would 
expect of Admiral, our booked reserves in the 
financial statements continue to include a 
prudent and significant margin above best 
estimates, the size of which is largely in line 
in relative terms with a year earlier.
The Solvency II balance sheet technical 
provisions are also now on a minus 0.75% 
Ogden basis.
After accounting for the proposed final 
dividend, the Group solvency ratio is a very 
satisfactory 212%. Excluding amounts 
relating to return of surplus capital, full year 
dividends for 2016 are held at their 2015 
level of 102.5 pence per share. 
The solvency ratio is above where we expect 
to operate in the medium to long term (no 
change on our previously indicated 125%-
150%). However we consider it prudent to 
maintain a higher ratio in the near term as we 
move towards submission of our application 
to use an internal model to calculate our 
solvency capital requirement later in the 
year (we’re still hoping to ‘go live’ with the 
model in 2018). For the foreseeable future, 
we envisage dividends will be in the order of 
90-95% of earnings. 
In terms of the future impact of higher injury 
costs resulting from the substantially lower 
discount rate, we expect that pricing action 
(including our own material pre-emptive rate 
changes in December 2016 and most likely 
more to follow) should mean profitability on 
business written after the date of the change 
will not be materially adversely affected. 
Brexit
Another 2016 surprise (in a year full of them) 
was the result of the EU referendum in June.
Admiral currently has three insurers and 
two comparison businesses in continental 
Europe, all benefitting from passporting 
arrangements. Although the UK is very early in 
the process of extricating itself from the EU, 
there is clearly a risk we lose access to these 
markets via the passporting mechanism. 
We are planning for potential outcomes and 
expect to be able to establish new entities 
and/or arrangements which should result 
in minimal disruption to our businesses and 
customers in those markets. 
We also currently enjoy free movement of 
staff between our sites in Europe which 
might also be restricted. Again we’ll work to 
ensure the impact on our staff is minimised 
to the extent possible under whatever 
arrangements are put in place.
Chairman
Finally, at the 2017 AGM we will say 
farewell to Alastair, our Chairman of over 
16 years. David’s tribute sums up Alastair’s 
contribution eloquently so I’ll just say that 
I’ve hugely admired Alastair as a Chairman 
and colleague since I’ve worked with him. We 
will miss him greatly. We’re fortunate to have 
an extremely capable successor in Annette 
who’s been on the Board since 2012. My best 
wishes go to both. 
 
Geraint Jones 
Chief Financial Officer 
7 March 2017
“Ben was extremely helpful and covered all the policy options with 
me without pushing any covers or excesses that I did not want – I told 
him, as I now tell you, that he provided me with the best customer 
service from a call centre environment that I have ever had...and 
that’s in 46 years!”
 UK New Business
A great customer experience
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
19 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 2016 Group overview
The Group has seen strong growth in 2016 
with turnover up 22% to £2.58 billion (2015: 
£2.12 billion). Net revenue increased by 
13% to £1.02 billion (2015: £0.90 billion). 
Customer numbers were 16% higher at  
5.15 million (2015: 4.43 million).
The Group’s share of pre-tax profits of £284.3 
million (2015: £376.8 million) and statutory 
profit before tax of £278.4 million (2015: 
£368.7 million) have both been materially 
affected by the impact of the change by 
the UK Government to the UK discount 
rate (commonly referred to as the ‘Ogden 
discount rate’), used to value personal injury 
claims, which has reduced UK Insurance 
profits. See below for further information. 
If the rate had remained unchanged, the 
Group’s share of pre-tax profit would have 
been approximately £390 million.
During 2016, the Group’s UK Insurance 
business, consisting of UK Car and UK 
Household, enjoyed favourable market 
conditions and delivered strong growth in 
turnover to £2.06 billion (2015: £1.76 billion). 
Net revenue increased by 8% to £770.9 
million (2015: £711.2 million). Customer 
numbers reached 4.1 million (2015: 3.6 
million). The UK Insurance business accounts 
for 80% of Group turnover and customers 
(2015: 83% and 81% respectively).
Outside the UK, Admiral’s International 
Insurance businesses grew combined turnover 
by 57% to £365.9 million (2015: £232.4 
million). Net revenue increased by 49% to 
£107.3 million (2015: £72.2 million). Customer 
numbers grew by 28% to 864,000 (2015: 
673,000). Encouraging progress was made in 
combined ratio terms, and in aggregate the 
segment recorded reduced losses of £19.4 
million (down from £22.2 million) with the 
Group’s Italian insurer ConTe recording a profit 
for the third consecutive year.
Finally, Admiral’s Price Comparison 
businesses made a combined profit, again 
excluding minority interests’ shares, of £2.7 
million (2015: loss £7.2 million). Confused.
com in the UK grew revenue and saw a 29% 
increase in profit to £16.1 million from £12.5 
million. The international price comparison 
businesses reported a reduced aggregate 
loss of £13.4 million (2015: loss £19.7 
million) with growing profit in the European 
operations (£2.8 million, up from £1.8 million) 
offset by the loss in compare.com of £16.2 
million (2015: loss £21.5 million). 
Other Group key performance  
indicators include:
• Group loss ratio 72.0% post Ogden, 64.2% 
pre Ogden (2015: 65.1%) – an improved 
international ratio offset by an Ogden-
impacted higher UK car insurance ratio;
• Group expense ratio 22.4% (2015: 20.5%) 
– an increased UK ratio reflecting an 
increase in acquisition costs resulting from 
growth offset by a small improvement in 
the international ratio; and 
• Group combined ratio 94.4% post Ogden, 
86.7% pre Ogden (2015: 85.6%).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share decreased by 27% to 78.7 
pence (2015: 107.3 pence), reflecting the 
decrease in Group profit as a result of the 
change in the Ogden discount rate. If the rate 
had remained unchanged, earnings per share 
would have risen to 109.6 pence per share.
Dividends
The Group’s dividend policy is to pay 65% of 
post-tax profits as a normal dividend and to 
pay a further special dividend comprising 
earnings not required to be held in the Group 
for solvency or buffers. 
Notwithstanding the lower second half 
profits, the strength of the Group’s capital 
position has allowed the Board to propose a 
final dividend of 51.5 pence per share (£144 
million), as follows:
• 15.0 pence per share representing a 
normal element, based on the dividend 
policy of distributing 65% of post-tax 
profits; and
• A special element of 36.5 pence per share.
The final dividend is in line with the final 2015 
dividend (excluding the return of surplus 
capital of 11.9 pence per share that was paid 
with the final 2015 dividend).
The total dividend for the 2016 financial 
year is 114.4 pence per share (including 11.9 
pence return of surplus capital), in line with 
2015 (which also included 11.9 pence return 
of surplus capital).
The payment date is 2 June 2017, ex- 
dividend date 11 May 2017 and record  
date 12 May 2017.
Return on equity
The impact of the changed Ogden discount 
rate on profit has led to a reduction in return 
on equity to 37% from 49%. Had the rate 
remained unchanged, return on equity would 
have been in line with 2015.
A key part of Admiral’s business model is 
the extensive use of co- and reinsurance 
across the Group which provides both loss 
protection and capital relief and, when 
combined with high levels of profitability, 
leads to a superior return on equity.
Change in UK discount rate (‘Ogden’) 
On 27 February 2017, the UK Government 
announced the outcome of the review of 
the discount rate (referred to as the Ogden 
discount rate) used for calculating the value 
of lump sum personal injury compensation. 
The new rate is minus 0.75% and will apply 
to all unsettled and new claims from 
20 March 2017.

Money market funds, fixed income and debt securities comprise the majority of the total;

Investment and interest income in 2016 was £53.1 million, an increase of £20.5 million on 2015 
(£32.6 million). £9.2 million of the increase is due to a release of an accrual relating to quota 
share reinsurance arrangements, whilst £4.9 million of the increase relates to unrealised gains 
on forward foreign exchange contracts. The balance is due to additional investment income 
earned on higher average balances. 
The underlying rate of return for the year (excluding the reinsurance accrual) on the  
Group’s cash and investments was 1.4% (2015: 1.3%).
The Group continues to generate significant amounts of cash and its capital-efficient 
business model enables the distribution of the majority of post-tax profits as dividends.

Operating cash flow, before transfers to investments 521.9 487.2 525.1
Total cash plus investments increased by £158 million or 6% (2015: £139 million, 6%). 
The estimated total impact, net of 
reinsurance and post tax, of the change to 
minus 0.75% from 2.5% is approximately 
£150 million. 
The change in rate has been treated as an 
adjusting post balance sheet event and 
the UK motor actuarial best estimates and 
Solvency II technical provisions have been 
prepared on the basis of the new rate. The 
booked reserves in the financial statements 
continue to include a prudent and significant 
margin above the actuarial best estimates in 
line with the Group’s reserving policy.
The majority of the financial impact in 
respect of premiums earned up to the date 
of change (£105 million pre-tax, £87 million 
post-tax), has been recognised in the form 
of reduced 2016 profits. The balance, along 
with the impact on business written but 
unearned at the date of change, will be 
recognised in the form of lower reserve 
releases and profit commission over the 
subsequent three to five financial years as 
the affected claims settle. 
The Group anticipates that if UK market 
pricing adjusts future premiums to reflect 
the lower Ogden rate, there will be no 
significant impact on future business and 
its profitability after the change. The 
Group is confident that its strong capital 
position, along with its prudent approach to 
claims reserving, will allow it to manage the 
outcome without significant change to its 
business or long term financial outlook.
Investments and cash
Investment strategy
Admiral’s investment strategy was unchanged 
in 2016 and the Group continued to invest in 
the same asset classes as previous years.
The main focus of the Group’s strategy 
is capital preservation, with additional 
priorities including low volatility of returns 
and high levels of liquidity. All objectives 
continue to be met. 
The Group’s Investment Committee performs 
regular reviews of the strategy to ensure it 
remains appropriate.

The Group’s capital includes £200 million 10 year dated subordinated bonds. The rate of 
interest is fixed at 5.5% and the bonds mature in July 2024. The bonds qualify as tier two

Taxation
The tax charge reported in the Consolidated Income Statement is £64.3 million (2015: £76.9 
million), which equates to 23.1% (2015: 20.9%) of profit before tax. The higher effective rate 
of taxation compared to 2015 results from the unrecognised deferred tax asset arising on 
losses in the Group’s US businesses. 
The Group’s results are presented in the following sections as UK Insurance, International 
Car Insurance and Price Comparison. 
Capital structure and  
financial position
A key feature of the business model is the 
extensive use of co- and reinsurance across 
the Group. The Group’s co-insurance and 
quota share reinsurance arrangements for 
the UK Car Insurance business are in place 
until at least the end of 2018. In 2017 and 
2018, the Group will reduce its net share of 
that business from 25% to 22%.
Similar long term arrangements are in place in 
the Group’s International Insurance operations 
and UK Household Insurance business. 
The Group continues to manage its capital 
to ensure that all entities within the Group 
are able to continue as going concerns and 
that regulated entities comfortably meet 
regulatory capital requirements. Surplus 
capital within subsidiaries is paid up to 
the Group holding company in the form 
of dividends. 
The Group’s regulatory capital from 
January 2016 is based on the Solvency II 
Standard Formula, with a capital add-on 
to reflect recognised limitations in the 
Standard Formula with respect to Admiral’s 
business (predominantly in respect of 
profit commission arrangements in co- and 
reinsurance agreements and risks arising 
from claims including Periodic Payment 
Order (PPO) claims). 
The capital add-on to the Standard Formula 
for 2017 is subject to the usual regulatory 
approval process. The Group plans to submit 
an application for approval to use an internal 
model to calculate capital requirements 
during 2017.
The majority of the Group’s capital 
requirement is derived from its European 
insurance operations, Admiral Insurance 
(Gibraltar) Limited (AIGL) and Admiral 
Insurance Company Limited (AICL). The 
estimated (and unaudited) Solvency II 
position for the Group at the date of this 
report was as follows:

It’s always fun to write an annual review like 
this – and always surprising when we look 
back and remember how much has happened 
and changed in just 12 months. 
Clearly the reported results of the UK  
Car insurance business have been  
impacted by the change in the Ogden 
discount rate, but Alastair and Geraint  
have covered this in detail, so I will focus  
on the underlying business.
One of the more obvious achievements is the 
rate of growth of the car insurance segment. 
We grew by 11% during 2016, adding almost 
350,000 to the customer base, which is about 
the same as we added in the previous four years 
combined. But the more encouraging aspect 
is that this wasn’t achieved through chasing 
volume through price cuts and acquisition 
spend, but through sensible underwriting and 
leveraging the still-growing price comparison 
distribution channel that has facilitated our 
growth over the last ten years and more.
What do I mean by sensible underwriting? 
We’ve always approached pricing in a rational 
way, growing when we think it’s the right time, 
and holding back when the market is looking 
less attractive. That means that we grew very 
modestly (in Admiral’s historical context at 
least) over the previous two or three years, 
but grew significantly more during 2016 as 
the market continued to increase prices quite 
significantly. We’ve also seen some slight 
de-risking in our portfolio as some of our 
competitors have been changing prices to 
attract higher-premium (higher risk) drivers, 
and we’ve consciously decided not to follow.
Increasing market prices, whilst good for 
profitability, does however bring some 
additional scrutiny both from the media and 
regulators. Following the focus during the 
previous hardening part of the cycle, the 
Government announced a number of changes 
in February 2017, which are aimed at reducing 
the costs of small bodily injury claims and 
therefore the cost of motor insurance. 
The Prisons and Courts Bill included a number 
of changes that will affect the process 
of dealing with minor whiplash claims, 
Investing in our core
“ We’ve always approached pricing 
in a rational way, growing when 
we think it’s the right time, and 
holding back when the market is 
looking less attractive.”
including tariff-based damages that award 
compensation based on the severity of the 
injury, and the banning of offers before medical 
evidence is obtained. The Government also 
announced its intention to increase the small 
claims limit for motor accident claims from 
£1,000 to £5,000. All of these changes will 
bring down the cost of claims, but will level 
the playing field and make it a little harder for 
insurers to obtain a competitive advantage. 
However, we think that Admiral is well placed 
because of the increased importance of a quick 
and efficient claims handling process, which is 
one of Admiral’s historical strengths.
Whilst the return to growth in our car 
insurance business was encouraging, the 
50% growth of our household business was 
particularly impressive, to end the year with 
nearly 470,000 customers. A key driver of that 
growth was an improvement in our online 
customer journey, but equally pleasing was 
that growth was driven both by a growing price 
comparison market and more customers being 
drawn directly to our household product.
Aside from top line growth, we benefitted 
from another relatively benign year in terms 
of weather events, and an improvement in 
claims frequency. We made some efficiency 
gains from our increased size and website 
development, and the small decrease in 
the underlying expense ratio (despite the 
addition of the Flood Re levy in the year) 
contributed to another improvement in the 
reported result. We expect distribution to 
continue moving towards price comparison 
in 2017, which will enable us to continue 
growing our book in a very familiar channel.
Finally, the mention of efficiency and an 
ability to react to changes (whether externally 
or internally driven) brings me onto the IT 
transformation process we have undertaken 
to replace the insurance policy system that 
we selected before we launched back in 
1993. It served us amazingly well for the first 
20+ years, but the Guidewire platform we’ve 
successfully rolled out over the last 12 months 
is a key development that will enable us to 
continue testing, learning and growing and 
succeeding. In summary, a big change that 
will paradoxically allow us to remain the same 
innovative company we’ve always been.

23 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 UK Insurance financial performance
UK insurance includes the results of the UK 
Car and UK Household insurance segments.
Admiral delivered strong growth in turnover 
and customers in its UK Insurance business 
in 2016, taking advantage of favourable 
market conditions with increasing prices and 
shopping activity. UK insurance turnover of 
£2.06 billion increased by 17% (2015: £1.76 
billion) primarily due to growth in customer 
numbers in both UK Car and UK Household. 
Net revenue increased by 8% to £770.9 
million (2015: £711.2 million). Increases 
in average premiums in UK Car insurance 
also contributed to a 17% increase in total 
premiums written to £1.86 billion (2015:  
£1.59 billion). 
Profit was lower in 2016 at £338.5 million 
(2015: £444.2 million) due to the impact of 
the change in the Ogden discount rate which 
is discussed above. If the rate had remained 
unchanged, UK Insurance profit would have 
been £444 million.

UK Car Insurance financial 
performance
UK Car Insurance benefited from continued 
success in attracting and retaining motor 
customers in a competitive UK market and 
this, together with higher average motor 
premiums, contributed to an increase in UK 
Car turnover of 16% to £1.99 billion (2015: 
£1.71 billion). Net revenue increased by 7% 
to £748.6 million (2015: £700.3 million). The 
number of vehicles insured in the UK business 
increased by 11% to 3.65 million (2015: 3.30 
million). Admiral continued to increase its 
prices during 2016 and saw average premiums 
written increase by approximately 4%.
24 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: UK Insurance review Claims reserving
Admiral’s reserving policy (both within 
the claims function and in the financial 
statements) is initially to reserve 
conservatively, above internal and 
independent projections of actuarial 
best estimates. This is designed to 
create a margin held in reserves to allow 
for unforeseen adverse development 
in open claims and typically results in 
Admiral making above industry average 
reserve releases. Admiral’s booked claims 
reserves continue to include a significant 
margin above projected best estimates 
of ultimate claims costs. 
As profit commission income is 
recognised in the income statement 
in line with loss ratios accounted for 
on Admiral’s own claims reserves, the 
reserving policy also results in profit 
commission income being deferred and 
recognised over time.

Profit
As a result of the impact of the change in Ogden, profit was lower in 2016 (£335.8 million v 
£443.0 million in 2015). Excluding the Ogden impact, profit would have been £441 million.  
The combined ratio increased to 87.5% (2015: 78.2%), or 77.8% pre Ogden. The underlying  
UK Car insurance profit was also impacted by a number of other factors:
• Significantly higher net insurance premium revenue (£437.4 million v £386.5 million)  
resulting from the growth in the portfolio over the past year
• Underlying positive back year claims development, though lower reserve releases on the 
portion of reserves originally reinsured but now commuted
• Higher expense ratio of 17.5% (2015: 16.9%) as a result of strong growth in new business
• Higher contribution from Other Revenue sources (£172.1 million v £158.6 million) resulting 
from growth in the portfolio, with Other Revenue per vehicle stable when compared 
with 2015
• Higher investment return (£39.3 million v £26.1 million) as explained in the Investments  
and Cash section on page 21.
The projected ultimate loss ratio for Admiral 
for the 2016 accident year is 82%, which is in 
line with the projection of the previous year 
at the same point in its development despite 
the Ogden discount rate change. 
The earned motor expense ratio increased 
modestly to 17.5% from 16.9% mainly 
reflecting the increase in acquisition costs 
resulting from the strong growth in the 
business. The written basis expense ratio 
also increased to 16.5% from 16.3% for 
similar reasons.
The projected ultimate combined ratio 
(ultimate loss ratio plus written expense 
ratio) for Admiral for the 2016 accident year 
is 98%. The reported combined ratio for 
the UK market (excluding Admiral) for 2015, 
excluding reserve releases was 115%.
The reported motor combined ratio was 90.8% (2015: 81.0%) (both figures exclude the impact 
of reserve releases from commuted reinsurance contracts) and was materially impacted by 
the change in Ogden discount rate and the resulting increase in ultimate loss ratios. Despite 
the Ogden impact, the Group continued to see positive claims development during 2016 that 
resulted in improvements in the projected ultimate loss ratios, especially for the 2012 to 2015 
underwriting years. 
Excluding reserve releases, the loss ratio remained flat at 87.7% (2015: 87.7%). Excluding the 
Ogden impact, the loss ratio before reserve releases would have improved to 85.6% as a result 
of the more favourable loss ratio assumptions for business earned during 2016 compared 
to 2015.

25 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 UK Insurance review continued
UK Car Insurance – co-insurance and reinsurance
Admiral makes significant use of proportional risk sharing agreements, where insurers 
outside the Group underwrite a majority of the risk generated, either through co-insurance 
or quota share reinsurance contracts. These arrangements include profit commission terms 
which allow Admiral to retain a significant portion of the profit generated.
The two principal advantages of the arrangements are:
• Capital efficiency: a significant proportion of the capital supporting the underwriting 
is held outside the Group. As Admiral is typically able to retain much of the profit 
generated via profit commission, the return on Group capital is higher than in an 
insurance company with a standard business model.
• Risk mitigation: co- and reinsurers bear their proportional shares of claims expenses and 
hence provide protection should results worsen substantially.
The Munich Re Group will underwrite 40% of the UK motor business until at least 2020. 
30% of this total is on a co-insurance basis, with the remaining 10% under a quota share 
reinsurance agreement from 2017 onwards.
The Group also has other quota share reinsurance arrangements confirmed to  
the end of 2018 covering 38% of the business written. 
The Group has reduced its net underwriting share from 25% to 22% with effect from 2017.
The nature of the co-insurance proportion underwritten by Munich Re (via Great Lakes, 
a subsidiary of Munich Re) is such that 30% of all motor premium and claims for the 
2017 year will accrue directly to Great Lakes and will not appear in the Group’s income 
statement. Similarly, Great Lakes reimburses the Group for its proportional share of 
expenses incurred in acquiring and administering the motor business. This share was 
40% previously.
Admiral has options to commute quota share reinsurance contracts and typically 
does so after two or three years of an underwriting year’s development when there  
is a reasonably certain view on the year’s outcome. 
After commutation, movements in booked loss ratios result in reduced or increased  
net claims costs (and not profit commission).
At 31 December 2016, all material UK quota share reinsurance contracts for  
underwriting years up to and including 2014 had been commuted. All reinsurance  
for the 2015 and 2016 years remain in effect.
UK Household Insurance – reinsurance 
The Group’s Household business is also supported by proportional reinsurance arrangements 
covering 70% of the risk. For the 2016 year the business is shared between Munich Re, 40% and 
Swiss Re, 30%. The arrangements for 2017 will remain the same. In addition, the Group has non-
proportional reinsurance to cover the risk of catastrophes stemming from weather events.
Commutations of quota share 
reinsurance
Admiral tends to commute its UK Car 
Insurance quota share reinsurance 
contracts for an underwriting year 
24 months from inception, assuming 
there is sufficient confidence in the 
profitability of the business covered by 
the reinsurance contract.
After the commutation is executed, 
movements in booked loss ratios result 
in reserve releases (or strengthening if 
the booked loss ratio were to increase) 
rather than reduced or increased 
reinsurance claims recoveries or  
profit commission. 
During 2016, reinsurance contracts 
covering the 2014 underwriting year were 
commuted. Whilst there is a satisfactory 
level of confidence in the ultimate 
outcome of that year, Admiral’s prudent 
approach to booking loss ratios, which 
tend to improve over time from an initial 
cautious level to the ultimate outcome, 
has meant that the 2014 year is booked 
at a loss making combined ratio. Refer to 
note 5 (vi) of the financial statements for 
analysis of reserve releases on commuted 
quota share reinsurance contracts.
The ultimate projection of the 2014 year 
continues to show a profitable outcome. 
A further impact of the 2014 year 
commutation is a release of an accrual 
held for notional investment income 
relating to the funds-withheld nature 
of the contract. As noted on page 21, 
movements in the notional investment 
income accruals resulted in an increase 
in investment income of £9.2 million 
compared to 2015. 
Profit commission
Admiral is potentially able to earn material amounts of profit commission revenue from 
co- and reinsurance partners, depending on the profitability of the insurance business 
underwritten by the partner. Revenue is recognised in the income statement in line with the 
booked loss ratios on Admiral’s retained underwriting.
In 2016 Admiral recognised UK car insurance profit commission revenue of £52.7 million 
down from £85.2 million in 2015. If reserve releases from business that was originally ceded 
under quota share reinsurance contracts that have since been commuted, are added to profit 
commission, the total for 2016 would be £69.8 million compared to £174.0 million in 2015, a 
decrease of 60%. The decrease arose mainly due to less positive development of prior year 
booked loss ratios as a result of the change in Ogden discount rate.
Note 5c to the financial statements analyses profit commission income by underwriting year.

UK Household Insurance was launched in December 2012 under the Admiral brand. 
The number of properties insured increased by 51% to 469,000 (2015: 310,000) and turnover 
increased by 46% to £76.1 million (2015: £52.0 million). Net revenue increased by 72% to £22.3 
million (2015: £13.0 million). Profit from Household doubled from a year earlier to £2.7 million 
(2015: £1.2 million). Its expense ratio is already materially lower than the UK market ratio.
Other Revenue
Admiral generates Other Revenue from 
a portfolio of insurance products that 
complement the core car insurance 
product, and also fees generated over the 
life of the policy. 
The most material contributors to net Other 
Revenue are:
• Profit earned from motor policy upgrade 
products underwritten by Admiral, 
including breakdown, car hire and personal 
injury covers
• Revenue from other insurance products, 
not underwritten by Admiral
• Fees such as administration fees and 
referral income
• Interest charged to customers paying  
for cover in instalments
Contribution from Other Revenue (net of 
costs) increased by 9% to £189.5 million 
(2015: £174.6 million). Whilst there were a 
number of smaller offsetting changes within 
the total, the main reason for the increase is 
the growth in the portfolio in the year.
Other revenue was equivalent to £62 per 
vehicle (gross of costs; 2015: £63). Net Other 
Revenue (after deducting costs) per vehicle 
was £54, in line with 2015.
Instalment income
Instalment income reflects amounts 
charged to customers paying for cover in 
instalments. During 2016 Admiral earned 
£33.5 million from instalment income, up 
25% on the prior period (2015: £26.7 million) 
for a number of reasons including an increase 
in average premium, customer numbers 
and the proportion of customers paying 
by instalment. 
Additional products underwritten 
by Admiral
Besides car insurance, there are a number 
of other products underwritten by 
Admiral that are core to providing motor 
insurance to customers (personal injury 
insurance, breakdown cover and car hire 
cover). Contribution from these products 
underwritten by Admiral during 2016 was 
£17.4 million (2015: £16.0 million). This 
is included in underwriting profit in the 
income statement, but reallocated to Other 
Revenue for the purpose of management

Regulatory environment
The UK Insurance business operates 
predominantly under the regulation 
of the UK Financial Conduct Authority 
(FCA) and Prudential Regulatory 
Authority (PRA), and through a 
Gibraltar-based insurance company, 
under the Financial Services Commission 
(FSC) in that territory.
The FCA and PRA regulate the Group’s 
UK registered subsidiaries including EUI 
Limited (an insurance intermediary) and 
Admiral Insurance Company Limited 
(AICL; an insurer), whilst the FSC 
regulates Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) 
Limited (AIGL; also an insurer).
The Group is required to maintain capital 
at a level prescribed by the lead regulator 
for Solvency II purposes, the PRA, and 
maintains a surplus above that required 
level at all times.

Customer service
Our customers are the most important part 
of our business; without them, there would 
be no business. Our staff and departments 
are rewarded through incentive schemes

encourage customers to provide feedback, 
whether good or bad, so that we can 
continue to improve the level of service  
that we provide.
Value for money
We build insurance around our customers 
and strive to design and offer products that 
customers want and that provide the right 
level of protection at the right price.
Communication
We want our customers to feel fully 
informed; to know what the next step in the 
process is, whether that is making a payment 
for a policy or knowing which garage will be 
repairing their vehicle. At times of stress, 
clear communication is important and we 
want our customers to know that everything 
is under control. 
Peace of mind
You can rely on us. We have a tradition of

29 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 International Car 
Insurance strategy
Admiral’s strategy is to exploit the 
knowledge, skills and resources attached 
to the established UK businesses to 
promote expansion overseas in private 
car insurance. Admiral’s objective is 
to create profitable, sustainable and 
growing businesses.
Investing in our future
International Car Insurance review
After achieving breakeven on an 
underwriting year basis in 2015, our focus 
in Spain in 2016 has been on sustainable 
growth. We increased customer numbers by 
18% with pleasing technical results.
It was a year of change in the Spanish market, 
with the introduction of the new “Baremo” 
regulating indemnities paid in bodily injury 
cases. The Baremo change increases claims 
costs, especially for more serious injuries. It 
adds pressure to an auto-insurance market 
that reported underwriting losses in 2015 for 
the first time in more than a decade.
We had hoped that the Baremo would trigger 
a price reaction and insurance shopping. 
Many companies did raise prices towards 
the beginning of the year, but changes 
were muted and not enough to encourage 
consumers to shop around. We expect 2016 
will turn out to be another unprofitable year 
for the market as a whole. 
In this context we made strong progress 
against our growth objective. Both 
acquisition and retention processes were 
significantly improved. We modernised our 
website allowing customers to buy from 
us more easily. Investment in our Qualitas 
Auto brand – via a campaign starring Pierce 
Brosnan – raised brand awareness to 57%. 
Meanwhile, strong technical results allowed 
us to reduce prices and take a larger share of 
the price comparison channel. 
And the outlook for 2017? At a market level 
we don’t expect much change. Our focus will 
continue to be on scaling up the business in  
a sustainable way.
ConTe closed for the third year in a row in 
profit. Market average premium fell by 4.5% 
but in the last quarter we have seen timid 
signals of market cycle upturn including a 
slight increase in claims frequency and the 
end of the average premium downtrend.
Despite this scenario, we consciously decided 
to grow in 2016 and our active customer 
base grew by over 30% year-on-year up 
to 415,000. This result is a mix of three 
effects: an increase in quote volumes of 
price comparison sites; the improvement 
of our customer journey; and the growth in 
brand awareness generated by the new TV 
campaign and the second year of the Serie B 
Football League sponsorship. To better serve 
our customers, we are continuing to invest in 
technology and develop our services.
The direct channel now represents around 
12% of the overall motor market in Italy 
and the comparison sites are growing at an 
encouraging pace.
The back years continue to develop well 
and the latest actuarial projections indicate 
that 2011 was profitable on an underwriting 
basis as is already the case for 2012, 2013 
and 2014.
Putting together all the pieces of the puzzle, 
2016 was a good year, where ConTe grew 
again and invested to reinforce technological 
capabilities and brand awareness and, 
as a consequence, built a solid basis for 
sustainable growth in the future.

30 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: International Car Insurance review The US car insurance market grew again 
in 2016. Definitive numbers are not yet 
available, but general consensus is that 
premium increases are outrunning claims 
inflation following last year’s deterioration 
in the industry loss ratio. 
We estimate claims inflation to be running 
at circa 3–5% and premium increases at 
circa 5–7%. 2016 has seen claims frequency 
increasing across the industry as miles 
driven has increased. Texas in particular has 
seen some large price increases this year 
as unusually severe weather events in the 
first half of the year caused claims to spike 
in the state. 
Elephant also grew again in 2016. Written 
premium increased 46% to $198 million, 
as we increased our turnover in each of 
our existing states as well as launching 
into two new states in the year. Elephant 
started writing car insurance in Indiana and 
Tennessee in 2016. We continued to see 
very satisfactory results from our marketing 
initiatives and were able to increase our 
share of sales in both Texas and Virginia 
despite price increases applied to both 
states. The loss ratio improved nicely in 
the year. We also saw some expense ratio 
improvement from economies of scale, 
offset by an increase in our marketing 
investment. The combined effect of this was 
an improvement in the combined ratio on a 
written basis of 11 percentage points. 
Elephant expects to continue to grow in 
2017 and to see further improvement in 
the combined ratio as a result of further 
progress on each of the core metrics as 
we move the business towards the goal of 
profitability. We do not anticipate further 
new states in the next 12 months, rather an 
increased investment in our existing states 
and development of the marketing efforts in 
the two new states launched in 2016. 
“I called various insurance 
companies asking for a 
quote, and finally chose 
Balumba for the good 
treatment, the patience and 
clarity of the explanations 
of your employee. I got the 
feeling being a nuisance 
to the agents in the other 
companies, the Balumba 
agent was thoughtful, 
kind and professional, and 
repeated the information as 
many times as I needed. After 
that, I received a welcome 
call from another agent, and 
his manner was excellent 
too. Congratulations to your 
employees!!”

Pascal Gonzalvez  
CEO, L’olivier – 
assurance auto
Despite challenging market conditions 
(stable market prices and a flat aggregator 
market), L’olivier – assurance auto managed 
to play its cards right with strong growth.
We grew the business substantially again 
and we ended the year up, with 61% more 
customers. The effects of “Loi Hamon” (the 
law that made the switching process much 
smoother) are becoming more tangible. 
L’olivier accelerated its branding efforts with 
two new TV spots focused on service quality, 
helping to demonstrate to customers that 
direct insurance and good quality are not 
mutually exclusive. As a consequence, we 
managed to capture more customers than 
ever from traditional channels willing to 
switch to a direct insurer. On top of the 
branding efforts, we kept building strong 
foundations in 2016. Technical results 
improved significantly thanks to our 
distinctive pricing process in the market, 
helping us to build a clear competitive 
advantage in a high combined ratio market.
Market profitability didn’t improve in 
2016. Indeed, for the second consecutive 
year, the highly competitive environment 
hampered insurers’ willingness to increase 
motor insurance prices. Consequently, 
market combined ratio remained high (it is 
expected to be around 104–105%). In the 
past, weak technical results were offset 
by investment results but in a low interest 
rate environment, this is not sustainable 
anymore. In this context, motor insurance 
prices are expected to increase in 2017 
by 2–3% and several insurers have already 
announced some price increases (though 
more discreetly than in the previous years to 
avoid media noise).
With strong foundations, L’olivier – assurance 
auto is well prepared to scale up the business 
over the coming years and 2017 should be 
another year of strong growth.

financial performance
Admiral’s international insurance businesses 
continued to grow by 28%, adding over 
191,000 customers during the year. Turnover 
grew by 57% to £365.9 million (2015: £232.4 
million). Net revenue increased by 49% to 
£107.3 million (2015: £72.2 million). Turnover 
and customers in these businesses represent 
14% (2015: 11%) and 17% (2015: 15%) of the 
Group totals respectively.
The combined ratio improved marginally to 
125% (2015: 126%). Continued improvement 
in ConTe’s prior years claims development 
and higher net insurance premium revenue 
has been offset by continued investment in 
operations in France and the US, resulting 
in an decreased loss of £19.4 million in 2016 
(2015: £22.2 million). The expense ratio 
has remained level at 49% (2015: 49%). 
The expense ratio is high in comparison 
to Admiral’s UK business because of high 
acquisition costs as the businesses grow 
and also the continued need to build scale. 
There are also market specific reasons why 
the expense ratios are higher, for example 
higher acquisition costs in the US cause 
a strain on the expense ratio when the 
business is growing.
As the Group’s international insurance 
operations grow, it is expected that they will 
make losses until appropriate scale has been 
achieved. The Group is satisfied with the 
progress each business continues to make 
towards the goal of becoming a sustainable, 
growing, profitable operation.
Admiral Seguros (Spain) which launched in 
2006 is the oldest of Admiral’s international 
operations and operates under two brands, 
Balumba and Qualitas Auto. Admiral Seguros 
focused on growth in 2016, following 
the achievement of break-even on an 
underwriting year basis in 2015, and took 
advantage of market conditions resulting 
in growth of 18% and ending the year with 
189,200 customers at the end of 2016.

Elephant Auto Customer Service
The Group’s largest international operation is 
ConTe in Italy, which insured 415,500 vehicles 
at the end of 2016, up 32% on 2015. ConTe 
was launched in 2008 and in 2016 continued 
to experience positive development in 
the projected ultimate outcomes of most 
underwriting years allowing further reserve 
releases in 2016 and a third year of profits. 
Despite this, ConTe continues to hold a 
prudent margin in its claims reserves above 
actuarial best estimate.
Admiral’s youngest and smallest 
international insurance business is L’olivier 
– assurance auto, which launched in 2010 in 
France. L’olivier insured 91,500 vehicles at the 
end of 2016, up over 60% on the prior year 
and has focused on growth and accelerating 
brand development during the year. 
The consolidated result of Admiral’s 
insurance operations in Spain, Italy and 
France was a loss of £3.7 million, almost 
50% down on 2015 (2015: £7.0 million). 
The combined ratio net of other revenue 
(excluding the impact of reinsurer caps) 
improved to 99% from 103% primarily due 
 to improved claims experience.
In the USA, Admiral underwrites motor 
insurance in six states (Virginia, Maryland, 
Illinois, Texas, Indiana and Tennessee) 
through its Elephant Auto business, which 
launched at the end of 2009. At the end of 
2016 Elephant Auto insured over 168,000 
vehicles, up 20% year-on-year. Turnover was 
£159.6 million, up almost 70% on the prior 
year (2015: £94.7 million). Elephant’s result 
for the period was a loss of £15.7 million, 
which is broadly consistent with £15.2 
million in 2015, despite significant growth, 
and reflects the ongoing investment in the 
business. Elephant Auto’s combined ratio 
net of other revenue improved from 134% in 
2015 to 130% in 2016.

Regulatory environment
Admiral’s European insurance 
operations are generally subject to 
the same regulation as the UK Car 
Insurance business, details of which are 
summarised above, but also comply with 
local requirements as appropriate. The 
Group’s US insurer, Elephant Insurance 
Company, is regulated by the Virginia 
State Corporation Commission’s Bureau 
of Insurance. The Company is required to 
maintain capital at levels prescribed by 
the regulator and holds a surplus above 
these requirements at all times.
International Car Insurance  
co-insurance and reinsurance
As noted earlier, Admiral makes 
significant use of proportional risk 
sharing agreements, where insurers 
outside the Group underwrite a 
majority of the risk generated, either 
through co-insurance or quota share 
reinsurance contracts. 
For the 2016 year Admiral retained 
35% (Italy), 30% (France and Spain) 
and 33% (USA) of the underwriting risk 
respectively. The arrangements for 
2017 will remain the same. 
All contracts are subject to certain 
caps on the co-insurers and reinsurers’ 
exposures and all contracts have profit 
commission terms that allow Admiral to 
receive a proportion of the profit earned 
on the underwriting once the business 
reaches cumulative profitability. The 
contracts include proportional sharing 
of Other Revenue.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
35 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Confused.com has seen a lot of changes in 
the market since it pioneered insurance 
comparison back in 2002, creating a  
growing and profitable industry while 
offering transparency and savings to  
British consumers. 
The UK car insurance price comparison 
market is characterised as mature and highly 
competitive, with 70% penetration of annual 
new business car insurance sales and four 
leading players spending in excess of £150 
million on marketing each year.
In 2016 the high level of competition was 
further evidenced by the closure of Google’s 
comparison operation. However, 2016 was 
also a year of strong growth for the market. 
Rising car insurance premiums, +14% as per 
the Confused.com/Willis Towers Watson 
Car Insurance Price Index, coupled with an 
all-time high in car sales for both new and 
used cars, helped to stimulate shopping. 
Current estimates indicate the market grew 
by around 8% in the year.
Confused.com benefited from this market 
growth but also its new strategic direction, 
taken half way through the year, to focus on 
motor-related products and services. As a 
result, Confused.com’s revenue, profit and 
profit margin all increased to £86 million, 
£16.1 million and 19% respectively. (2015: 
£75 million; £12.5 million; and 17%).
A number of significant projects have been 
completed in the last 18 months, including 
investment in our platform to improve 
conversion with a redesign of our website 
to allow better customer experience. In 
addition, we have reviewed our online 
marketing capabilities and established a 
new brand position as a car savings specialist 
to improve acquisition costs and grow our 
customer base. 
The regulatory agenda was quite busy in 
2016 and we are constantly working with the 
regulator to build an even more consumer 
focused product and offer in an ever 
changing technological landscape.
2016 has seen Confused.com successfully 
focus its attention on what it does best: 
saving customers money on their car 
insurance. Looking to 2017, I know that every 
day, every week and every month is a battle 
that we must work hard to try and win.
Price Comparison review
Price Comparison 
strategy 
Admiral’s strategy is to develop websites 
that allow consumers to compare a range 
of general insurance, financial services 
and other products. The international 
strategy is to exploit the UK expertise in 
price comparison and export it overseas.
Investing in our future
During 2016 we continued with our growth, 
in terms of traffic, quotes and sales and 
therefore in results. We have consolidated 
our leadership position not only in car 
insurance comparison but also in other 
insurance products, and in our other 
verticals, telephony and finance.
We are already working with more than 150 
partners, which include most of the biggest 
service providers in Spain - insurers, telecoms 
and banks. We have increased our reach 
and site visit frequency across all product 
lines, building on our brand awareness 
and preference. 
We continue to work on our data strategy 
and we are well placed to be a strategic 
partner in terms of information and data 
not only for our partners, but also for other 
companies linked to our products. 
For 2017 we will continue working on 
growth, converting our leads into sales, 
consolidation of our role as the multiproduct 
price comparison leader of the market 
and improving our existing products and 
value proposition.

36 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Price Comparison review While there are some differences among 
the 51 distinct auto insurance markets, an 
overall steady economy with sustained low 
gas prices has led to an increase in miles 
driven among US consumers. In 2016, that 
led to higher frequency for many of our 
insurance partners and they took action 
with higher rates for consumers. This was 
both an opportunity as rate increases drive 
more consumers to shop and a challenge 
for us as carriers shrink risk appetite and 
convert at lower levels. We continued 
optimizing both our national and state-by-
state advertising investments in light of the 
market conditions and our product offering 
to take advantage of this swing in the auto 
insurance pricing cycle.
compare.com made significant strides this 
year on both the quality of our product 
offering and the efficiency of our customer 
acquisition. We nearly doubled our number 
of auto insurance brands under contract, 
our average number of rates returned 
nationwide and the number of policies we 
helped our carrier partners bind. We also 
launched a second product for customers 
looking for bundled auto and property 
policies, which is how many US consumers 
prefer to shop. Over the same period this 
year, our acquisition costs have dropped 
by nearly two thirds proving that we can 
compete on acquisition economics at a 
level only achieved by a few large personal 
lines insurance carriers in the US market. 
We outgrew our office building this year 
and moved our staff into a new space three 
times the size and customized to support the 
growth of our open and fun culture. 
In early 2016, we also saw our largest auto 
insurance comparison competitor – Google 
– make the decision to withdraw for their 
own strategic reasons, which gave us the 
opportunity to use earmarked IT resources 
to broaden our relationships with key 
partners into even more states. We even 
added a partner in Hawaii, so we can now 
quote in 50 of the 51 markets. Other players 
continued to press into the comparison 
market with similar, but different, models. 
The state-by-state and carrier-by-carrier 
nature of the US insurance market gives us a 
solid foothold as the largest auto insurance 
comparison site in the US.
While delivering a smaller than planned loss 
in 2016 it was on a smaller than planned 
business. We remain very cognizant that 
we are one of Admiral’s largest investments 
and while we do have the great opportunity 
to transform the US market we do not yet 
have the guarantee of doing so. In fact we 
anticipate delivering continued losses in 
2017 depending on the dynamics and scale 
of the business and the overall behavior of 
the market.
While the US price comparison market starts 
2017 still in its infancy, the potential remains 
enormous. A recent survey by Acxiom shows 
consumers are six times more likely to buy 
their insurance via a comparison site than 
in the past. compare.com has built the 
carrier network as well as the acquisition 
funnel to be the leading player as consumers 
continue to adopt this better way to shop for 
insurance products. We remain cautiously 
optimistic about our opportunity for success 
in transforming the landscape of the US 
insurance market.
2016 was a challenging year for LeLynx.fr.
Based on the 2015 results, our expectations 
of the impact of Loi Hamon, in terms of 
changing behavior in 2016, were optimistic, 
however, the aggregator market only grew 
by 1%. The French consumer has not yet 
taken advantage of the opportunity to 
change their insurance provider, even if the 
process has been simplified substantially.
In an effort to unblock the market and as 
a way to build trust, LeLynx launched a TV 
campaign based on a well known celebrity.
Our vision is still positive on the French 
market and we remain competitive in an 
increasingly crowded environment. We are 
focused on maintaining our position as one 
of the market leaders, based on delivering a 
superior product and customer experience.

37 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 UK Price Comparison – 
Confused.com
The UK price comparison market remained 
very competitive in 2016, but favourable 
market conditions (rising prices and more 
shopping activity) saw more visitors to 
Confused.com’s website and consequently 
higher quote volumes. Despite this 
competitive environment, Confused.com 
achieved a strong result, with revenue 14% 
higher than 2015 at £85.7 million (2015: £75.4 
million) from growth of 8% in the UK price 
comparison market as well as a new driver-
centric strategy supported by new marketing. 
Profit increased by 29% to £16.1 million (2015: 
£12.5 million). 
Confused.com’s operating margin improved to 
19% (2015: 17%).
International Price Comparison
Admiral operates three price comparison 
businesses outside the UK: in Spain 
(Rastreator), France (LeLynx) and the US 
(compare.com). Admiral Group owns 75% 
of Rastreator, with the remaining 25% 
owned by Mapfre. Admiral Group owns 71% 
of compare.com, with the remaining 29% 
owned by White Mountains and Mapfre.
The combined revenue from the European 
operations in 2016 increased to £36.2 million 
(2015: £28.6 million), reflecting nearly 10% 
more quotes provided to customers and 
improved conversion rates. Both Rastreator 
and LeLynx have strong brand recognition 
in their respective markets. The Group’s 
share of the combined result for Rastreator 
and LeLynx was a profit of £2.8 million 
(2015: £1.8 million), the increase reflecting 
strong performance from Rastreator which 
continues to build on its multi-product 
strategy covering insurance, telephony and 
utilities, amongst other product lines, and 
which doubled its profits in 2016, offset by 
marketing investment in LeLynx. Statutory 
profit before tax increased to £3.9 million 
(2015: £2.3 million).

The Group continues to invest in compare.
com, its US comparison operation based 
in Virginia. During 2016 Admiral’s share of 
compare.com’s loss reduced to £16.2 million 
before tax (2015: £21.5 million) reflecting a 
focus in key states on efficient advertising 
and reducing acquisition costs. Statutory 
loss before tax decreased to £22.8 million 
(2015: £30.3 million). The Group plans 
continued investment in compare.com 
during 2017 and anticipates that the Group’s 
share of compare.com’s losses for 2017 will 
be in the range of $15-25 million. 
The combined result for International Price 
Comparison was therefore a loss of £13.4 
million (2015: loss £19.7 million) – the profit 
from the European operations offset by 
investment in compare.com. Statutory 
loss before tax was £19.0 million (2015: 
£28.0 million).
Preminen, the Group’s newest price 
comparison operation continues to explore 
the potential of price comparison in new 
markets overseas, in partnership with Mapfre. 
Regulatory environment
Confused.com is regulated by the 
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as an 
insurance intermediary and is subject 
to all relevant intermediation rules, 
including those on solvency capital. 
The European operations are all 
structured as branches of UK 
companies, with the UK insurance 
intermediary permission passported 
into Europe. 
compare.com is a regulated insurance 
agency domiciled in Virginia, US, and 
licensed in all other US states.
38 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Price Comparison review The Group operates a UK Commercial Vehicle 
insurance broker (Gladiator) offering van 
insurance and associated products, typically 
to small businesses, via telephone and the 
internet, including price comparison websites. 
Gladiator has increased customer numbers 
from 146,600 to 170,800 at the end of 2016 
and operating profit increased to £2.0 million 
(2015: £1.5 million).
Other interest and investment income 
includes £4.9 million (2015: £nil) of unrealised 
gains on forward foreign exchange contracts 
which have been impacted during 2016 by 
downward movements in the value of sterling. 
These gains have the potential to reverse over 
time if the sterling rate recovers before the 
contracts expire.
Share scheme charges relate to the Group’s 
two employee share schemes (refer to note 
8 to the financial statements). The increase 
in the charge is due to an increase in the 
number of awards reflecting the increasing 
Group headcount.
Business development costs include 
costs associated with potential new 
ventures, including investment in Admiral 
Loans and Preminen, the Group’s price 
comparison incubator.
Finance charges of £11.4 million (2015:  
£11.1 million) mainly represents interest  
on the £200 million subordinated notes 
issued in July 2014 (refer to note 6 to the 
financial statements).
UK Exit from the European Union 
(‘Brexit’)
On 23 June 2016, the UK voted in a 
referendum to leave the EU. At the date of 
this report, the timetable for and details  
of the implementation of this decision 
remain unclear.
Market volatility, including that which 
resulted from the Brexit vote (notably very 
significant reductions in risk free interest 
rates) adversely impacted the Group’s 
solvency position reported in the interim 
results in August 2016. This was due to an 
increased regulatory valuation of claims 
liabilities, in particular in relation to longer 
dated potential PPO claims, and hence 
reduced capital. Since August 2016, market 
volatility has reduced, risk free interest rates 
have increased and the Group has received 
approval to use a volatility adjusted yield 
curve in discounting claim liabilities. This has 
led to a reduced regulatory valuation of claims 
liabilities and a stronger solvency position.
As discussed above, the solvency ratio 
remains very strong at 212% after the 
proposed final dividend is accounted for. The 
Directors are satisfied this represents a very 
satisfactory level of surplus above regulatory 
requirements and buffers.

UK New Business
A great customer experience
Brexit also brings additional risks including: 
• potential further market volatility, 
particularly in interest and exchange rates 
• the potential for the uncertainty or the 
emerging terms of exit regarding Brexit 
to trigger or exacerbate less favourable 
economic conditions in the UK and other 
countries in which Admiral operates 
(though it is worth noting that car 
insurance has tended to be resilient to 
economic downturns) 
• potential changes to or withdrawal of the 
right of UK financial services firms to trade 
in Europe without the need for locally 
regulated entities (‘passporting’) 
• potential changes to the rules relating  
to the free movement of people between 
the UK and EU member states
The Group is making plans to be able to deal 
with the withdrawal of passporting, should 
this transpire, after the UK’s exit from the 
EU is finalised and will continue to closely 
monitor developments over the coming 
months and years. 
At the current time the Group does not 
foresee a material adverse impact on day to 
day operations (including customers or staff), 
whilst recognising that other issues may 
emerge over time.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
39 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Principal risks and uncertainties
The Board, with support from the Group Risk Committee and the Group Risk 
Department, undertakes a regular and robust assessment of the principal 
risks. These risks have been summarised as those which would threaten its 
business model, future performance, liquidity and solvency.
The table below sets out the principal risks which Admiral has identified through its Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework (‘ERMF’). The impact of those risks and actions taken to mitigate 
them are explained below. 
Insurance Risk
Reserving Risk in UK and International Insurance
Admiral is exposed to reserving risk through its underwriting of motor and household insurance policies. Claims reserves in the financial statements may 
prove inadequate to cover the ultimate cost of earned claims which are by nature uncertain. 
This is a particular risk for motor insurance liabilities, where the amount payable for bodily injury claims (particularly large claims) can change significantly 
during the lifetime of the claim as a result of external risks such as changes in Ogden rates and impacts of increased levels of Periodical Payment Orders. 
Impact
Adverse run-off leading to higher claims  
costs in the financial statements. 
PPO claims are capital intensive owing  
to increased uncertainty of the cost of 
significant claims over a longer term.
Mitigating factors
Admiral has a conservative reserving policy and continues to hold a material margin in its financial 
statement claims reserves above actuarially determined best estimates. 
Best estimate reserves are estimated both internally and externally by an independent actuary. 
For very large claims Admiral purchases excess of loss reinsurance, which mitigates a portion  
of the loss.
Admiral holds a margin in booked reserves to cover changes impacting claims. Furthermore, Admiral 
continues to hold an additional margin in its reserves in excess of the projected ultimate outcomes 
to cover other potential claim shocks.
Regular reviews of both settled and potential PPO cases are undertaken by the Claims and Actuarial 
teams, with independent Actuarial opinions provided as part of the external reserving analysis.
Admiral’s investment portfolio is the result of a structured, disciplined and transparent investment 
process which considers settled and potential future PPOs.
Premium Risk and Catastrophe Risk
The Group is exposed to the risk that claims cost on future business is higher than allowed for in the premiums charged to customers. 
The group is exposed to the risk of increased claims and reduced business volumes following both a UK and European recession.
Catastrophe Risk: Admiral is exposed to the risk of high losses due to the occurrence of man-made catastrophes or natural weather events.
Impact
Higher claims costs and loss ratios, resulting  
in reduced profits or underwriting losses. 
A large flood or windstorm causes extensive 
property damage (both motor and household) 
to a significant proportion of the portfolio, 
leading to a large total claims cost in relation to 
the event.
Mitigating factors
There are a number of aspects which contribute to Admiral’s strong UK underwriting  
results, including:
• Experienced and focused senior management and teams in key business areas including  
pricing and claims management;
• Highly data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and  
underwriting performance;
• Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to  
key performance drivers, particularly pricing; and
• Continuous appraisal of and investment in staff, systems and processes.
Admiral purchases excess of loss reinsurance, designed to mitigate the impact of very  
large individual or catastrophe event claims. 
40 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Principal risks and uncertainties Group Risk
Erosion of competitive advantage in UK Car Insurance
Admiral typically maintains a significant combined ratio advantage over the UK market. This advantage and/or the level of underwriting profit  
(and associated profit commission) could be eroded. 
This risk could be exacerbated by irrational competitor pricing and/or new technologies used within the insurance market. It may arise from new  
or existing competitors.
Impact
A worse UK Car Insurance result and lower return 
on capital employed.
A sustained and uncorrected erosion of competitive 
advantage could affect the ability of Admiral to 
extend its reinsurance arrangements, which might 
in turn require Admiral to hold more capital.
Mitigating factors
Admiral’s focus remains on the wide range of factors that contribute to Admiral’s combined ratio 
outperformance of the UK market. Some are set out earlier in the Strategic Report, but in addition:
• Track record of innovation and ability to react quickly to market conditions and developments; and
• Keen focus on maintaining a low-cost infrastructure and efficient acquisition costs.
Failure of geographic and/or product expansion
Admiral continues to develop the UK household and overseas operations. 
One or more of the operations could fail to become a sustainable, profitable long term business. 
Product expansion into new areas could lead to unprofitable business and increased regulatory risk. 
Growth in business plans exceeds the scale of infrastructure of the operation.
Impact
Higher than planned losses (and potentially  
closure costs) and distraction of key management. 
A collective failure of these businesses  
would threaten Admiral’s objective to  
diversify its earnings by expanding into  
new markets and products.
Mitigating factors
Admiral’s approach to expansion and product development remains conservative, applying the 
‘test and learn’ philosophy that has proven successful for previous operations. International 
insurance businesses have generally executed cautious launch strategies and are all backed by 
proportional reinsurance support which provides substantial mitigation against start-up losses in 
the early years.
New price comparison businesses have aligned their marketing investment with the extent of 
improvement in key performance indicators such as average cost per quote and conversion ratio. 
The Group also accepts partial disposals of equity to share start-up losses with partners.
The Directors are mindful of management stretch and regularly assess the suitability of the 
infrastructure and management structure in place for Admiral’s new UK and international operations.
Reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements
Admiral uses proportional co-insurance and reinsurance across its insurance businesses to reduce its own capital needs (and increase return on the capital it 
does hold) and to mitigate the cost and risk of establishing new operations.
There is a risk that support will not be available in the future if the results and/or future prospects of either the UK business or (more realistically) one or more 
of the newer operations are not satisfactory to the co- and/or reinsurers.
Impact
A potential need to raise additional capital  
to support an increased underwriting share.  
This could be in the form of equity or debt. 
Return on capital might reduce compared 
to current levels.
Mitigating factors
Admiral mitigates the risk to its reinsurance arrangements by ensuring that it has a diverse  
range of financially secure partners. 
Admiral continues to enjoy a long term relationship with one of the world’s largest  
reinsurers, Munich Re, which has supported Admiral since 2000. 
Admiral also has relationships with a number of other reinsurers. 
As well as UK Motor, long term arrangements are also in place for UK Household and 
International businesses.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
41 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Principal risks and uncertainties continued
 Group Risk continued
Potential diminution of Other Revenue
Admiral earns other revenue from a portfolio of products and other sources. 
The level of this revenue could diminish due to regulatory or legal changes, customer behaviour or market forces.
Impact
Lower profits from insurance operations  
and lower return on capital.
Mitigating factors
Admiral continuously assesses the value to its customer of the products it offers, and makes 
changes to ensure the products continue to meet customer needs and offer good value. 
Admiral seeks to minimise reliance on any single source by earning revenue from a range of 
products. This would mitigate the impact of a regulatory change which might affect a particular 
product or income stream. 
Competition in UK Price Comparison 
Admiral is dependent on the four main UK price comparison websites as an important source of new business and growth. 
Growth in this distribution channel could slow, cease or reverse, or Admiral could lose one or more of the websites as a source of customers.
Impact
A potentially material reduction in UK Car 
Insurance new business volumes.
The impact on Confused.com of higher levels 
of competition in the price comparison market, 
either through the aggressive activities of existing 
players or the entry of significant new participants 
would be to lower profits. 
However, a more competitive market might 
benefit the car insurance business through lower 
acquisition costs.
Mitigating factors
Admiral’s ownership of Confused.com (one of the leading UK price comparison websites which 
operates independently of the UK Car Insurance business) helps to mitigate the risk of over-
reliance on this distribution channel. 
Admiral also contributes materially to the revenues of other price comparison businesses and 
therefore it is not considered probable that a material source of new business would be lost.
The management of Confused.com maintain a very keen awareness of the risks of  
continued competition. 
Legal and Regulatory Risk 
Failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and/or changes. 
Unexpected regulatory changes are introduced.
Impact
Exposure to regulatory intervention,  
censure and/or enforcement action  
through fines and other sanctions.
Mitigating factors
Mitigated by regular review of the Group’s compliance with current and proposed requirements 
(including the General Data Protection Regulation) and interaction with regulators by Executive 
Management and the Board.
There is investment in resources to prepare for a Partial Internal Model application, which is 
expected to be made during 2017. The project will have regular progress updates with the Board 
and Regulators.
Counterparty Risk
Admiral is primarily exposed to credit risk in the form of a) default of reinsurer; b) failure of banking or investment counterparty.
One or more counterparties suffer significant losses leading to a credit default.
Impact
Additional capital may need to be raised as a 
result of a major credit event, dependent on  
its nature and severity. 
Admiral would also need to ensure that it 
continues to have sufficient liquid assets to 
meet its claims and other liabilities as they  
fell due.
Mitigating factors
Admiral only conducts business with reinsurers of appropriate financial strength. In addition, most 
reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds-withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit 
risk, as Admiral holds the cash received as collateral.
Concentrations of credit risk are managed by investing in liquidity funds which invest in a wide range 
of short duration, high quality securities. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly 
rated credit institutions. Some long term investments are held in Government bonds to further 
mitigate the exposure to credit risk.
Admiral considers counterparty exposure frequently and in significant detail, and has in place 
appropriate triggers and limits, to mitigate exposure to individual investment counterparties. 
42 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Strategic Report: Principal risks and uncertainties Market Risk 
Market risk arises as a result of fluctuations in the value of market prices of investment assets, liabilities, or the income from our investment portfolio.
Impact
Market volatility (notably very significant 
reductions in risk free interest rates) can 
adversely impact the Group’s solvency due to 
an increased regulatory valuation of claims 
liabilities, in particular in relation to longer  
dated potential PPO claims.
Mitigating factors
The Group’s low appetite for market risk results in an investment strategy that focuses on capital 
preservation, low volatility of returns and strong liquidity. The majority of the portfolio is invested 
in high quality fixed income and other debt securities, and money market funds in order to achieve 
these objectives. 
The Group’s mitigation for interest rate risk resulting from long duration PPO liabilities includes a 
comprehensive level of reinsurance cover and continuing focus on strategies to ensure that the  
risks relating to both assets and liabilities are appropriately matched. 
The Group has relatively low exposure to net assets and liabilities in currencies other than 
pounds sterling.
Operational Risk 
People, processes, business continuity
Operational Risk arises within all areas of the business. The principal categories of operational risk for Admiral are: 
• People 
• Processes
• IT Systems 
• Information Security 
• Business Continuity 
• Customer Outcomes 
Impact
The risk of reductions in earnings and/or  
value, through financial or reputational loss, 
from inadequate or failed internal processes  
and systems, or from people related or  
external events. 
In particular:
Potential customer detriment and/or 
potential regulatory censure/ 
enforcement and/or reputational 
damage as a result of Admiral’s action.
Risk to Admiral occurs through the losses that 
could occur if the internal control framework  
to manage these business processes fails.
Availability of systems & data
Integrity of data
Confidentiality of data 
Mitigating factors
We aim to attract, retain and motivate quality staff to deliver quality customer service and  
achieve business objectives.
Succession planning is based on targeted recruitment, identifying potential leaders through  
internal development, talent management and retention processes.
Internal controls are in place and monitored to mitigate the risk and the control framework is 
regularly reviewed. 
The internal audit function has an agreed cycle of testing of the adequacy and effectiveness 
of controls. 
Regular review of the effectiveness of the Group’s IT capability by Executive Management and  
the Board.
Strong project governance and oversight of new systems implementations with external specialist 
review and assurance where required.
Admiral continues to invest in its Security Programme in order to mitigate Information Security risks.
Within IT there is a major incident team which is tasked with maintaining system availability, with 
business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place.
Data is backed up to allow for its recovery in the event of corruption.
Admiral operates the three lines of defence model for overseeing its products, processes and 
service. At each stage of the customer journey customer outcomes are monitored, managed and 
reported in order to mitigate customer detriment.
Admiral purchases a range of insurance covers to mitigate the impact of a number of operational risks.

Corporate Governance: Governance overview Governance overview
Succession planning has 
been a key area of focus 
for the Board in 2016
Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board I am 
pleased to present the Corporate 
Governance Report for the financial 
year ended 31 December 2016. The 
focus of the Board continues to 
be on maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance which 
it achieves by ensuring the 
appropriateness and effectiveness 
of the Group’s management and 
control framework. This Report 
sets out the Admiral framework 
of governance and the approach 
the Board has taken during 
2016 to promote the standards 
of good corporate governance 
that are rightly expected by 
our shareholders.
We believe that having a sound 
corporate governance framework 
enables effective and efficient 
decision making and promotes 
the right balance of skills and 
experience to assess and manage 
the risks in the markets in which 
the Group operates. 
Succession planning has been a 
key area of focus for the Board in 
2016. As you will have seen from 
my Chairman’s letter earlier in this 
report, I will be retiring as Chairman 
at the forthcoming AGM in April 
after serving for 16 years. I am 
delighted that Annette Court has 
been selected by the Board to take 
the chair as she has considerable 
experience, both of the industry 
and as a non-executive director of 
Admiral. As a consequence there will 
be review of the composition of the 
Group’s committees, in particular 
those of which Annette is currently 
a member, to ensure that they 
continue to comply with governance 
requirements. In May, Henry 
Engelhardt retired as Chief Executive 
although he continues to work 
with our businesses in the UK and 
overseas. The Group was fortunate 
to have someone of David Stevens’ 
capability and experience to pursue 
the Group’s successful development 
as CEO. In April, we also said goodbye 
to Non-Executive Directors Lucy 
Kellaway and Margaret Johnson who 
both stepped down at the AGM in 
April, each having served 9 years on 
the Board. 
In the context of the Board changes 
that occurred during the year 
and in order to ensure that the 
Board continued to represent 
the right mix of skills, experience 
and background, the Nomination 
Committee reviewed the balance 
and composition of the Board. 
Following this review, we were 
pleased to welcome Justine Roberts 
who joined the Board in June. Justine 
is CEO and co-founder of internet 
company, Mumsnet.com, which has 
grown into the UK’s biggest online 
network for parents. Justine has 
been responsible for the creation, 
strategic direction and overall 
management of Mumsnet, building 
it into one of the most recognisable 
internet brands in the UK. She brings 
a wealth of experience interacting 
with consumers across social media. 
Such experience will be invaluable as 
the Group seeks to grow its digital 
channels in the coming years.
As I highlighted in last year’s annual 
report, the Board undertook an 
externally facilitated evaluation 
this year, being three years after 
the last external evaluation. This 
was facilitated by Ian White, an 
independent external consultant 
with extensive experience of 
carrying out board evaluations of 
listed companies. The process of 
evaluating the Board’s performance 
this year consisted of each Board 
member completing a questionnaire 
detailing specific areas of focus 
for the Board including succession 
planning and Board composition, 
the priorities for change, the impact 
of previous evaluations, and board 
expertise to meet future challenges. 
The completed questionnaires then 
formed the basis for discussion 
during the separate meetings that 
Ian had with each Board member 
and attendee. Ian presented the 
results of the evaluation and areas 
for development to the Board at 
the meeting in February 2017. A 
summary of the outcomes of the 
Board’s discussion and consideration 
of the results of the evaluation are 
set out in more detail at page 49 of 
this report.
We confirm the Group’s compliance 
with the principles and provisions 
set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2014 (the Code) 
which is applicable to the year 
under review. A new version of the 
Code was introduced in September 
2016 and will apply to the Group’s 
2017 financial year: we will report 
on the implementation of the new 
responsibilities set out in the Code in 
next year’s report. 
This Corporate Governance Report is 
structured in order to demonstrate 
to shareholders that the Board 
has complied during 2016 in all 
respects with each section of the 
Code - Leadership; Effectiveness; 
Accountability; and Relations 
with Shareholders. Remuneration

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
47 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Leadership 
The role of the Board
The Board is the principal decision-
making forum for the Group providing 
entrepreneurial leadership, both directly 
and through its Committees, and delegating 
authority to the Executive team. The 
Board is responsible for organising and 
directing the affairs of the Group in a 
manner that is most likely to promote its 
success for the benefit of its members 
as a whole. The Board is accountable to 
shareholders for setting and achieving 
the Group’s strategic objectives; for the 
creation and delivery of strong sustainable 
financial and operational performance; for 
ensuring that in carrying out its duties the 
Group’s legal and regulatory obligations 
are being met; and for ensuring that it 
operates within appropriately established 
risk parameters. The Group’s UK regulated 
entities are responsible to the Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential 
Regulatory Authority (PRA) for ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s UK regulatory 
obligations and that dealings with the FCA 
and PRA are handled in a constructive, co-
operative and transparent manner. Similar 
provisions apply in respect of the Group’s 
international businesses with regard to the 
relevant regulatory authorities in those 
overseas jurisdictions in which the Group 
also operates.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board’s 
consideration. This is monitored by the 
Company Secretary and reviewed by the 
Board on an annual basis. Specific matters 
reserved to the Board include the approval of:
• The Group’s long term objectives and 
corporate strategy
• Operating and capital budgets, financial 
results, and any significant changes to 
accounting practices or policies
• The Group’s capital structure
• Results and financial reporting
• The system of internal control and  
risk management
• The Group’s overall risk appetite
• Changes to the structure, size and 
composition of the Board, including  
new appointments
• Succession plans for the Board and  
senior management
• Dividend policy and proposals for  
dividend payments
• Major acquisitions, disposals, and other 
transactions outside delegated limits 
• The annual review of its own performance 
and that of its Board Committees
• Annual review of the Group’s Board policies 
• The review of the Group’s overall  
corporate governance arrangements
Board activity during 2016
At each scheduled meeting the Board 
receives updates from the Chief Executive 
and Chief Financial Officer as to the financial 
and operational performance of the Group 
and any specific developments in the areas 
of the business for which they are directly 
responsible and of which the Board should 
be aware. Items that are considered on 
an annual basis are included in an annual 
schedule of rolling agenda items to ensure 
that they are considered at the appropriate 
point in the financial and regulatory cycle. 
Meetings are structured so as to allow for 
consideration and debate of all matters. 
The heads of the Group’s US and European 
insurance businesses and the head of UK 
Insurance (respectively Kevin Chidwick, 
Milena Mondini and Cristina Nestares) are 
invited to attend every Board meeting and 
Board dinner. This has proved an effective 
means of ensuring that senior managers 
below Board level have exposure to and gain 
experience of the operation of the Board. 
The Board met on seven occasions in 2016 
with all these meetings being held over two 
days and one of the meetings being a separate 
strategy meeting held offsite. In addition 
to the seven scheduled meetings, there 
were two additional unscheduled telephone 
meetings that were called at short notice. 
In addition to the regular consideration 
of financial and operating performance 
and risk management and compliance, the 
Board received presentations on a variety 
of topics including updates from the 
management teams of each of the Group’s 
businesses and regular reviews of Solvency II 
related activities.
In addition to his visits to the Group’s UK 
operations, the Chairman has sought to visit 
each of the Group’s overseas operations 
every year and Non-Executive Directors 
are invited to join either him or the Chief 
Executive on one or more of their overseas 
visits each year. In addition, the Non-
Executive Directors and the Chairman met 
during the year without the Executive 
Directors being present. Non-Executive 
Directors also attended briefing sessions in 
Cardiff on different aspects of the Group’s 
UK business. In order to increase their 
understanding of the depth and breadth 
of management across the Group below 
Board level, the Non-Executive Directors and 
the Chairman also attended a dinner with 
members of the Group’s senior management 
team without the Executive Directors  
being present. When management teams 
present to the Board on their operations 
they are invited to join the Board for  
dinner which gives the opportunity for 
informal interaction between directors  
and management. 
 
Governance Report

Corporate Governance: Governance Report Meetings and attendance
Directors are expected to attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees on which they serve and to devote sufficient time to 
the Group to perform their duties. Where Directors are unable to attend meetings they receive papers for that meeting giving them the 
opportunity to raise any issues with the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The number of scheduled Board meetings and Committee 
meetings of which they are a member attended by each Director during 2016 is provided in the table below.

*4 Justine Roberts joined the Board with effect from 17 June 2016.
Agendas and papers are circulated to 
the Board electronically in a timely and 
secure manner in preparation for Board 
and Committee meetings. The Board 
agenda is structured by the Chairman in 
consultation with the Company Secretary 
and Chief Executive. Routine Board 
papers are supplemented by information 
specifically requested by the directors 
from time to time. All Board and Committee 
meetings during the year were held in an 
open atmosphere conducive to robust 
and constructive challenge and debate. 
All Directors have, therefore, been able to 
bring independent judgement to bear on 
issues such as strategy, risk management, 
performance, and resources. Additional 
meetings are called when required and 
there is contact between meetings, where 
necessary, to progress the Group’s business.
The Company Secretary
All the Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. He 
has responsibility for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and for advising the 
Board, through the Chairman, on governance 
matters. The Company Secretary provides 
updates to the Board on regulatory and 
corporate governance issues, new legislation, 
and Directors’ duties and obligations. The 
appointment and removal of the Company 
Secretary is one of the matters reserved for 
the Board.
Board effectiveness
Having last carried out an external Board 
evaluation in 2013 and in accordance 
with the Code requirement that FTSE 
350 companies should carry out an 
externally facilitated evaluation of the 
Board at least every 3 years, this year the 
Board evaluation process was led by Ian 
White. Ian is an independent external 
consultant with experience of evaluating 
and making recommendations to improve 
Board effectiveness of a number of listed 
companies. Other than being a customer of 
one of the Group’s subsidiaries, Ian has no 
connection with the Group. 
The objectives of the evaluation were to 
provide an assessment of the effectiveness 
of the Board and make recommendations to 
improve the Board process; provide guidance 
for the new Chairman in leading the Board 
and working with the CEO; and establish a 
clear set of actions and objectives for the 
Board to prioritise and focus on in 2017. 
The Chairman, supported by the Company 
Secretary and in consultation with Ian, 
compiled a comprehensive questionnaire 
that was circulated by the Company 
Secretary for completion by all Directors 
and Board attendees. 
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
49 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The questionnaire considered:
• Time management of Board meetings;
• Board composition and dynamics;
• The effectiveness of the Board in 
considering the Group’s risk management 
framework and internal controls; 
• The Board’s strategic and operational 
oversight;
• Succession planning including the 
oversight of the Group’s processes for 
managing, developing and retaining talent; 
• Management of group subsidiaries;
• Content of discussion and focus at Board 
meetings; and
• Priorities for change that would improve 
Board performance.
The results of the review were presented 
by Ian to the Board in February 2017. Overall 
the review found that the Board continued 
to work effectively and that each Director 
demonstrates full commitment to his/
her duties and contributes in an open and 
transparent way, enabling a detailed level 
of debate and discussion around material 
matters affecting the Group. The review also 
identified good awareness by the Board of 
the governance and regulatory environment 
in which the Group operates and the main 
risks impacting the Group and how they 
should be managed and mitigated. 
The following recommendations were 
identified in review as areas to which the 
Board might give particular focus in 2017 in 
order to enhance the Board’s effectiveness: 
• Greater Board visibility of potential 
successors to key positions from within 
the business was an area of focus 
identified in last year’s Board evaluation. 
It was recommended that Non-Executive 
Directors spend time, on an informal 
basis, with the next level of management 
below Board level to ensure that these 
individuals are being developed as part of 
the Group’s longer term succession plans. 
Although some progress has been made 
in this area during 2016 with succession 
plans and talent management on the 
Board agenda, the evaluation this year 
recommended the development of a 
more structured and robust process for 
management development and succession 
planning identifying a greater number of 
potential future leaders of the business;
•  Keep strategic focus and development 
at the top of the Board’s agenda. This 
continues the theme identified in last 
year’s evaluation to ensure that more  
time is available in the Board agenda to 
discuss strategic topics in the context  
of the development of the Group;
• Standardising the format of reports 
that are presented to the Board was 
identified as an area for improvement in 
last year’s evaluation. Although progress 
had been made, it was identified this 
year that further improvements could 
be made to review the length and level 
of detail of some reports with more 
Executive Summaries, particularly for 
technical reports;
• Hold more Board meetings in Cardiff in 
order to give Non-Executive Directors 
greater exposure to more up and coming 
managers thereby helping with succession 
planning and management development. 
The introduction of sessions organised 
around Board meetings for Non-
Executive Directors to visit, and receive 
presentations from, the Group’s main UK 
business units now gives Non-Executive 
Directors more of an opportunity to see 
the Group’s main business units as part of 
their continuing induction and exposure  
to the Group’s culture;
• Develop a clear recruitment strategy for 
Board appointments to encompass future 
skills and identify the characteristics of 
directors that will be of benefit to the 
Board together with the development 
of a clear process to be adopted 
by the Nomination Committee in 
appointing directors;
• The Non-Executive Directors should meet 
in private on a more regular basis with 
the CEO also invited periodically to these 
sessions where matters such as succession 
planning and management development 
are being discussed;
• Consider in greater depth matters  
such as competitors, understanding  
the customers of today and tomorrow, 
digital, cyber and technical matters such 
as capital allocation, pricing analytics  
and operations.
The Chief Executive, to whom he reports, 
appraises annually the performance of 
the Executive Director. The Chairman, 
taking into account the views of the other 
Directors, reviews the performance of the 
Chief Executive. The performance of the 
Chairman is reviewed by the Board led by the 
Senior Independent Director (SID). Following 
the latest review, the SID considered and 
discussed with the Chairman the comments 
and feedback that had been received from 
the Directors as part of the Chairman’s 
evaluation questionnaire, and was able 
to confirm that the performance of the 
Chairman continues to be effective and that 
he continues to demonstrate appropriate 
commitment to his role. 
The roles of the Chairman  
and Chief Executive
The Board has approved a statement 
that sets out the clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive. The Chairman is 
primarily responsible for the leadership 
and workings of the Board, setting its 
agenda, and monitoring its effectiveness. 
The Chairman is not involved in the day-to-
day management of the business. Save for 
matters reserved for decision by the Board, 
the Chief Executive, with the support of 
the other Executive Director and the senior 
executives, is responsible for proposing the 
strategy to be adopted by the Group; running 
the business in accordance with the strategy 
agreed by the Board; and implementing 
specific Board decisions relating to the 
operation of the Group. The statements 
of division of responsibilities and matters 
reserved for decision by the Board are 
reviewed annually.
Governance Report continued
50 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: Governance Report Board balance and independence
In the context of recent and forthcoming Board changes, careful consideration continues to be given to the composition and balance of 
the Board. As a result the Group continues to monitor the need to refresh Board and Committee membership in an orderly manner so as to 
maintain the continuity of Board process and the strength of personal interaction which underlies the effectiveness of the Board as a team. 
The Board remains satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Group to enable it 
and its Committees to discharge their duties and responsibilities effectively, as required by the Code.
The table below details the length of service of the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors and illustrates the balance of 
experience and fresh perspectives.
The Board currently comprises 10 Directors, 
the Chairman (who was independent on 
appointment), two Executive Directors, 
and seven independent Non-Executive 
Directors. As can be seen from the Directors’ 
biographies on pages 46 to 47, the Directors 
have a broad range of skills and experience 
and can bring independent judgement to 
bear on issues of strategy, performance, risk 
management, resources and standards of 
conduct which are integral to the success of 
the Group.
Appointments to the Board are the 
responsibility of the Board as a whole, acting 
on the advice and recommendations of the 
Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee seeks to balance the retirement 
and recruitment of Non-Executive Directors 
ahead of their replacement so as to avoid 
dislocation of Board process by losing 
experience and skills. Appointments are 
made on merit and against objective 
criteria, having due regard to the benefits 
of diversity, including gender, with a view 
to ensuring the Board has the appropriate 
mix of personality, skills, and experience. 
Following a formal, rigorous and transparent 
process led by the Nomination Committee, 
the Board was delighted to appoint Justine 
Roberts as an independent Non-Executive 
Director with effect from 17 June 2016. 
Justine will be subject to election by 
shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
Manning Rountree is the Chief Executive 
Officer for White Mountains Insurance 
Group Limited (White Mountains) and acts 
as Board Observer for White Mountains on 
the Board of the Group’s US price comparison 
subsidiary, in which White Mountains has a 
minority shareholding. Given the relatively 
small size of White Mountains’ shareholding 
in an overseas Group subsidiary company, 
the Board has determined that Manning 
Rountree remains independent in character 
and judgement and that his attendance at 
Inspop USA LLC Board meetings does not 
affect his ability to present an objective, 
rigorous and constructive challenge to the 
assumptions and viewpoints presented by 
management and the Board. A process for 
managing any potential conflicts has been 
agreed by the Board such that Manning 
Rountree will recuse himself from any 
Group Board discussions where a potential 
conflict of interest with his role with White 
Mountains has been identified.

Date of Appointment Current length of service as a Non-Executive Director at 31 December 2016
The Board, having given thorough 
consideration to the matter, considers 
the seven Non-Executive Directors to 
be independent and is not aware of any 
relationships or circumstances, other than 
the above, which are likely to affect, or could 
appear to affect, the judgement of any of 
them. It is the view of the Board that the 
independent Non-Executive Directors are 
of sufficient calibre and number that their 
views carry significant weight in the Board’s 
decision making. 
Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are currently appointed for fixed periods 
of three years, subject to election by 
shareholders. The initial three-year period 
may be extended for two further three-
year periods subject to re-election by 
shareholders. Their letters of appointment 
may be inspected at the Company’s 
registered office or can be obtained on 
request from the Company Secretary.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
51 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Alastair Lyons has served in the role of 
Chairman since July 2000 and has already 
confirmed that he will not be seeking re-
election at the AGM in April. His successor 
as Chairman, Annette Court, along with 
all the Directors, seek re-election by 
shareholders annually. 
Colin Holmes is the Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director (SID). He has the requisite 
knowledge and experience gained through 
his Board position, his Chairmanship of the 
Audit Committee, and his appointments 
to the boards of other companies. He 
is available to shareholders if they have 
concerns that contact through the normal 
channels of Chairman, Chief Executive, or 
Chief Financial Officer have failed to resolve 
or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
He is also responsible for leading the Board’s 
discussion on the Chairman’s performance 
and the appointment of a new Chairman, 
as and when appropriate. Full details of the 
process of selecting a new Chairman are  
set out in the Nomination Report on  
pages 62 and 63. 
In accordance with the requirement under 
the Code for annual election of Directors, 
all Directors will be submitting themselves 
for re-election by shareholders at the 
forthcoming AGM. The Board is satisfied 
that all are properly qualified for their 
reappointment by virtue of their skills and 
experience and their contribution to the 
Board and its Committees.
The Directors are given access to 
independent professional advice at the 
Group’s expense, should they deem it 
necessary to carry out their responsibilities.
Professional development
On appointment, Directors take part in 
a comprehensive induction programme 
whereby they receive financial and 
operational information about the Group; 
details concerning their responsibilities 
and duties; as well as an introduction to 
the Group’s governance, regulatory and 
control environment.
This induction is supplemented by visits 
to the Group’s head office in Cardiff and 
certain overseas offices, and meetings 
with members of the senior management 
team and their departments. Development 
and training of Directors is an ongoing 
process. Throughout their period in office 
the Directors are regularly updated on the 
Group’s business; legal matters concerning 
their role and duties; the competitive 
environments in which the Group operates; 
and any other significant changes affecting 
the Group and the industry of which it is 
a part. 
The Board receives presentations from 
senior managers within the Group on a 
regular basis and Non-Executive Directors 
are encouraged to make informal visits to 
different parts of the Group to meet with 
local management.
Engagement with shareholders
The Company attaches considerable 
importance to communications with 
shareholders and engages with them 
regularly. Open and frequent dialogue with 
investors enables them to understand 
fully the Group’s strategy, objectives and 
governance. The Investor Relations team 
has day-to-day primary responsibility for 
managing communications with institutional 
shareholders through a combination of 
briefings to analysts and institutional 
shareholders, both at the half-year and 
full-year results. A number of analysts and 
investors visited the Group’s Cardiff office 
during the year to meet with the Executive 
Directors and senior management in order 
to get a better understanding of how the 
Group operates and how it intends to achieve 
its strategic and operational objectives. 
Senior executives from the Group’s overseas 
businesses also visit the UK in order 
to present to, and meet with, analysts 
and investors. Site visits and individual 
discussions with the Executive Directors 
are also arranged throughout the year with 
individual shareholders. 
In addition the Chairman had individual 
meetings during the year with major 
shareholders and reported to the Board  
on issues raised with him. 
This is supplemented by feedback to the 
Board on meetings between management 
and investors. In addition, the Investor 
Relations team produces a quarterly 
Investor Relations Report that is circulated 
to the Board for their consideration. 
The Report contains an analysis of share 
price performance; a summary of analyst 
reports received during the month and 
of meetings that have been held with 
investors and analysts; together with 
details of any significant changes to the 
shareholders’ register.
The Senior Independent Director has 
specific responsibility to be available to 
investors who have any issues or concerns, 
and in cases where contact with the 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer has either failed to resolve 
their concerns, or where such contact is 
inappropriate. No such concerns have been 
raised in the year under review.
All shareholders are invited to attend the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). 
The Chairs of the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nomination and Group Risk Committees 
attend the AGM along with the other 
Directors and are available to answer 
shareholders’ questions on the activities of 
the Committees they chair. Shareholders 
are also invited to ask questions during the 
meeting and have an opportunity to meet

(www.admiralgroup.co.uk) containing a 
wide range of information of interest to 
institutional and private investors. The major 
shareholders of the Company are listed on

Conflicts of interest
In compliance with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 regarding Directors’ 
duties in relation to conflicts of interest, 
the Group’s Articles of Association allow the 
Board to authorise potential conflicts of 
interest that may arise and to impose such 
limits as it thinks fit. The Company has put 
in place a Conflicts of Interest Policy to deal 
with conflicts of interest. These procedures 
include each Board member completing, 
annually, a conflicts of interest questionnaire 
that sets out any situation in which they, 
or their connected persons have, or could 
have, a direct or indirect interest that could 
conflict with the interests of the Company. 
Any current directorships that they, or their 
connected persons hold, any advisory roles 
or trusteeships held, together with any 
companies in which they hold more than 1% 
of the issued share capital are also disclosed. 
These procedures were reviewed by the 
Board in April 2016 and it was concluded that 
they continued to operate effectively.
Board committees
The Board has delegated authority to 
a number of permanent Committees 
to deal with matters in accordance 
with written Terms of Reference. The 
principal Committees of the Board - Audit, 
Remuneration, Group Risk and Nomination - 
all comply fully with the requirements of  
the Code. 
All Committees are chaired by an 
independent Non-Executive Director, except 
the Nomination Committee which is chaired 
by the Chairman of the Board, and comprise 
a majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. Appointments to the Committees 
are made on the recommendation of the 
Nomination Committee and are for a period 
of up to three years, which may be extended 
for two further three year periods, provided 
the Director remains independent. The 
Committees are constituted with written 
Terms of Reference that are reviewed 
annually to ensure that they remain 
appropriate and reflect any changes in good 
practice and governance. These Terms of 
Reference are available on request from the 
Company Secretary and can also be found on

The Audit Committee
54 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: The Audit Committee Dear Shareholder,
I’m pleased to provide an  
update on the main activities  
of Admiral’s Audit Committee  
in 2016.
During the year, the key areas 
of focus of the Committee 
have been to provide support 
to the Board in its oversight 
of financial reporting and the 
control environment across 
the Group. The setting of 
insurance claims reserves 
continues to be a key accounting 
judgement in the Group’s 
financial statements, and the 
Committee placed considerable 
focus on this subject. The 
analysis of outstanding claims 
by management was reviewed 
alongside that of the Group’s 
independent actuaries and 
external auditor. The impact of 
a change to the Ogden Discount 
Rate on outstanding claims 
was also carefully considered, 
with the Committee supporting 
management’s view that claims 
reserves remain prudent and 
appropriate at the revised rate 
of minus 0.75%. 
The Committee reviewed 
the Group’s reserving policy 
to ensure that it remained 
appropriate under the 
requirements of Solvency II. 
In addition, the Committee 
continued to monitor the 
appropriateness of the Group’s 
system of risk management and 
internal control as well as the 
robustness of the internal and 
external audit processes. 
During the year, Admiral’s UK 
operation completed the roll out 
of a new software system for 
all new business transactions. 
Updates were received from 
the Project Team and Internal 
Audit, with the Committee being 
satisfied with the controls in 
place during the implementation 
of the system. Given the 
importance of this new software 
platform it will remain a focus 
of the Committee in 2017. 
The Committee also studied a 
number of issues, particularly 
around IT Security and Controls, 
highlighted through a range of 
different sources including the 
Risk Register, Internal Audit and 
the Committee’s previous work. 
In each case the Committee 
was satisfied with the proposed 
management actions. 
Consideration of the impact 
of the Group’s new reporting 
requirements under Solvency 
II continued to take up a 
considerable amount of the 
Committee’s time in 2016. 
The appointment of Deloitte LLP, 
as the Group’s external auditor, 
was approved by shareholders at 
the AGM in April 2016. Deloitte 
have, therefore, led the audit 
process for the finalisation of 
the Group’s Half Year and Full 
Year 2016 financial statements. 
The transition from the Group’s 
previous external auditor, KPMG 
LLP, has occurred in an effective 
and seamless manner.
Finally, given that Annette 
Court will step down from the 
Committee at the AGM in April 
to take on the role of Chair of the 
Board, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank her for her 
important contribution. 
I hope you find the above 
summary, and the more  
detailed report, both useful  
and informative.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
55 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Membership
Membership of the Committee at the end of 
the year was: Colin Holmes (Chair), Annette 
Court, Penny James and Owen Clarke who 
joined the Committee with effect from 
1 January 2016. 
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary 
to the Committee. The Committee meets at 
least four times per year and has an agenda 
linked to events in the Company’s financial 
calendar and other important issues that 
arise throughout the year which fall for 
consideration by the Committee under 
its remit.
Mindful of the changes to the Code which 
will apply to the 2017 financial year and 
requires the Committee as a whole to 
have competence relevant to the sector 
in which the company operates, the Board 
considers that Committee members already 
have a broad range of skills, experience 
and knowledge of the insurance sector 
such that they are able to effectively 
analyse, challenge and debate the issues 
that fall within the Committee’s remit. 
The Board further considers that Colin 
Holmes (Committee Chair), as a Chartered 
Management Accountant, has appropriate 
recent and relevant financial experience 
having previously been the UK Finance 
Director for Tesco plc. 
The Committee is kept up to date with 
changes to Accounting Standards and 
relevant developments in financial reporting, 
company law, and the various regulatory 
frameworks through presentations from 
the Group’s external auditor, Chief Financial 
Officer and Company Secretary. In addition, 
members attend relevant seminars and 
conferences provided by external bodies. 
The Terms of Reference of the Audit 
Committee include all the matters  
required under the Code.
Other individuals such as the Chairman of 
the Board, Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Financial Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, 
Heads of Compliance and Internal Audit, and 
representatives of different parts of the 
Group may be invited to attend all or part of 
any meeting as and when appropriate. The 
external auditor was invited to attend all 
of the Committee’s meetings held in 2016, 
excepting those agenda items when its 
own performance/appointment was to be 
reviewed and provision of non-audit services 
 
discussed. In addition, a number of private 
meetings were held between members of 
the Committee and the auditor.
The Audit Committee’s primary 
responsibilities are to:
• Monitor the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcement relating to the Group’s 
financial performance, reviewing any 
significant financial reporting judgements 
which they contain;
• Keep under review the effectiveness 
of the Company’s internal financial 
controls, internal control and risk 
management systems;
• Review the Group’s procedures for 
handling allegations from whistleblowers 
and for detecting fraud;
• Monitor and assess the role and 
effectiveness of the Group’s Internal 
Audit functions in the context of the 
Group’s overall internal control and risk 
management systems;
• Consider and make recommendations to 
the Board, to be put to shareholders for 
their approval at the AGM, in relation to 
the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the Group’s external auditor;
• Review the external auditor’s 
independence and objectivity and the 
effectiveness of the audit process;
• Review the policy on the engagement  
of the external auditor to provide non-
audit services, considering the relevant 
regulatory guidance regarding the 
provision of non-audit services by  
the external auditor.
Significant issues considered  
by the Committee
After discussion with both management 
and the external auditor, the Audit 
Committee determined that the key risks 
of misstatement of the Group’s financial 
statements related to insurance liabilities 
and profit commissions. 
These issues were discussed with 
management during the year and with the 
auditor at the time the Committee reviewed 
and agreed the auditor’s Group audit plan; 
when the auditor reviewed the interim 
financial statements in August 2016 and also 
at the conclusion of the audit of these full 
year financial statements.
Insurance liabilities
Given the important judgements involved 
in estimating outstanding claims the 
Committee continued to spend significant 
time reviewing and challenging the approach 
and methodology adopted by management 
in setting reserves for insurance liabilities 
in the financial statements. The Committee 
noted the proposals of management to 
continue to enhance the methodology 
applied and were supportive of these plans. 
The Committee held separate meetings with 
the external actuaries at which there was 
challenge and debate on the best estimates 
developed by the external actuaries. At 
these meetings management provided 
further information on the reserving levels 
proposed and were challenged by the 
Committee as to their adequacy and level  
of inherent prudence. 
Prior to the announcement by the Lord 
Chancellor that revises the Ogden discount 
rate, the impact of potential various rate 
changes was studied by the Committee, 
including the review of the calculated impact 
of the change provided by both management 
and the external actuaries. Following the 
Lord Chancellor’s announcement of the 
revised rate, the Committee is satisfied that 
a comprehensive approach has been taken 
to calculating the impact, and also that 
following the change, the value contained 
in the balance sheet for future claims is 
appropriate and prudent. 
Whilst acknowledging that the setting of 
reserves to cover future claims is a complex 
and judgemental area and having had the 
opportunity at the separate meetings 
referred to above to consider and question 
the recommended best estimates, the 
Committee is satisfied that an appropriate 
process has been followed and that there 
has been scrutiny, challenge and debate to 
give confidence that the reserving levels 
set provide an appropriate margin above 
best estimates, though noted the continued 
high level of prudence that remains within 
the reserves. 
The Committee also received an update 
from the auditor regarding the procedures 
they had used to test management’s 
methodology in setting best estimates 
and considered the auditor’s assertion 
that they had challenged the reserving 
approach taken by management and were 
satisfied with management’s assumptions 
The Audit Committee continued
56 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: The Audit Committee and that the Group’s approach to setting 
reserves was in compliance with current 
accounting standards.
Profit commission
The Committee considered the impact on 
profit commission income of future changes 
in claims reserves as the recognition of 
this income is dependent on the loss ratio 
booked in the financial statements and 
cash receivable is dependent on actuarial 
projections of ultimate loss ratios. The 
Committee remained satisfied that profit 
commission was correctly accounted for by 
the Group and was in accordance with the 
contractual arrangements that were in place.
The Audit Committee considered the auditor’s 
overall findings on this area which indicated 
that it considered the profit commission 
recognised was appropriate in the context  
of the financial statements as a whole.
Misstatements
No material unadjusted audit differences 
were reported by the external auditor. The 
Committee confirms that it is satisfied that 
the auditor has fulfilled its responsibilities 
with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and 
reports from management and consulting 
where necessary with the auditor, the 
Committee is satisfied that the financial 
statements appropriately address the 
critical judgements and key estimates (both 
in respect to the amounts reported and the 
disclosures). The Committee is also satisfied 
that the significant assumptions used for 
determining the value of assets and liabilities 
have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are sufficiently robust. 
Non-audit fees
The Committee reviewed and approved its 
policy on non-audit services in February 
2017, and were satisfied that it was aligned 
with current regulatory guidance. Under the 
policy, the Group’s statutory auditor would 
only be engaged to carry out non-audit work 
in exceptional circumstances or where there 
was a regulatory or tax authority request and 
where agreed by the Committee.
Unless required by law, regulatory or tax 
authority any non-audit services will: a) be 
subject to prior approval from the Committee 
and b) in aggregate, shall not cost more than 
70% of the average statutory audit fee for 
the past three financial years. In considering 
whether to approve such non-audit services, 
the Committee shall ensure that:
• There is no direct effect, or in the view 
of an objective, reasonable and informed 
third party, would have an inconsequential 
effect, of the non-audit services on the 
Group’s financial statements;
• The estimation of the effect on the 
financial statements is comprehensively 
documented and explained in a report to 
the Committee;
• The non-audit services provided comply 
with the principle of independence; and
• The audit firm must not place significant 
reliance on the output of the non-audit 
services for the audit work.
The Committee will continue to monitor 
regulatory developments in this area to 
ensure that its policy on non-audit fees 
adheres to current guidance.
Effectiveness of the external  
audit process
The Committee undertakes an annual review 
to assess the independence and objectivity of 
the external auditor and the effectiveness of 
the audit process, taking into consideration 
relevant professional and regulatory 
requirements, the progress achieved against 
the agreed audit plan, and the competence 
with which the auditor handled the key 
accounting and audit judgements. Following 
this review the Committee concluded that the 
auditor, Deloitte LLP, remained independent 
and provided a service that was robust and fit  
for purpose. 
Audit tender
As noted in this report last year, and in 
compliance with the requirements of the 
Competition & Markets Authority’s Statutory 
Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive 
Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities) Order 2014, the Group 
completed a transparent and independent 
audit tender process in 2015. Following this 
process, Deloitte LLP was recommended to 
shareholders as the Group’s auditor at the 
AGM in April 2016 and a resolution passed to 
that effect. 
Internal audit 
The Group Head of Internal Audit attends 
all Audit Committee meetings and provides 
a range of presentations and papers to the 
Committee, through which the Committee 
monitors the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal controls. The Committee reviewed 
and approved the Group Internal Audit 
Terms of Reference which set out the role; 
objectives; reporting lines and accountability; 
authority; independence; and objectivity 
of the Internal Audit function. The role and 
competence of each Internal Audit function 
across the Group was also assessed and 
considered by the Committee. As agreed 
last year, the Group Head of Internal Audit 
continues to have responsibility to ensure the 
quality of the Internal Audit activities in the 
Group’s overseas locations.
Members of the Committee also receive 
all issued audit reports, enabling them to 
challenge the reports’ content and related 
recommendations. The Committee approves 
the Internal Audit programmes at the start of 
each calendar year whilst the effectiveness 
and workload of the Internal Audit functions 
and the adequacy of available resources are 
monitored throughout the year. 
In accordance with agreed parameters, the 
overseas operations in Spain, Italy and the 
US have their own locally based internal 
auditors, who report to their respective 
country heads. All reports are evaluated by 
the Group Head of Internal Audit to ensure 
the quality and effectiveness of the reported 
findings. In addition, the UK Internal 
Audit department carries out high level 
governance reviews of all foreign operations, 
assessing the internal control frameworks 
and system of risk management. The 
overseas internal auditors attend Committee 
meetings periodically. 
Committee effectiveness review
As part of the Committee’s detailed annual 
review of its performance and processes, 
each Committee member completed a 
comprehensive questionnaire designed 
to provide objective assessment of the 
Committee’s performance, including its 
effectiveness in monitoring internal and 
external audit. The Committee discussed 
the results of the review and it was 
concluded that, overall, the Committee 
and the audit process were effective; that 
the Committee had full access to all the 
information it required; that the Committee 
had appropriate Terms of Reference; 
and that it was adequately discharging 
its responsibilities.

58 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: The Group Risk Committee Dear Shareholder,
During the year the Committee 
has focused on embedding the 
Board’s risk strategy and risk 
appetite across the Group. This 
has been established as a key 
part of the Group’s Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework 
(‘ERMF’). A further refresh to the 
suite of Key Risk Indicators with 
associated triggers and limits was 
completed. These updates have 
improved the effectiveness of 
the risk management system by 
placing greater focus on the main 
risks affecting the business.
A significant amount of time has 
been dedicated to developing the 
Group’s Partial Internal Model for 
Solvency II with an application 
due to be submitted to the 
regulators in 2017. In the interim 
period the Group continues to 
maintain a regulatory capital add-
on to cover risks not captured 
within the standard formula. The 
Committee has also reviewed the 
Group’s proposed dividend level, 
capital plan and capital buffer 
in line with the capital policy. 
Further Solvency II applications 
relating to Undertaking Specific 
Parameters (USPs) and the 
Volatility Adjustment (VA) 
have also been submitted with 
approval granted for the latter in 
February 2017.
During the first half of 2016 the 
volatility of the yield curves led 
to increased volatility in the 
Solvency Ratio as a result of the 
interest rate risks associated 
with settled and potential PPOs. 
The increase in yield curves 
through the second half of 2016 
as well as further mitigating 
actions has led to a reduced 
exposure to interest rate risk  
at year end 2016.
The Committee continues to 
focus on key operational risks 
that affect the Group. A full 
programme of work to reduce 
cyber risk has been agreed 
throughout the year. This 
programme will also support 
the data protection work as the 
Group seeks to comply with the 
upcoming GDPR requirements.
The Committee challenged and 
reviewed the setting of and 
outputs from the regular stress 
and scenario testing and reverse 
stress testing. The output was 
incorporated into the Own 
Risk and Solvency Assessment 
(‘ORSA’) report for 2016, which 
the Committee also reviewed. 
Regular reports have been 
received on the risks and 
progress of the major change 
programme responsible for 
the implementation of a new 
policy administration system 
and data warehouse, known as 
Project Bolt. The first phase of 
the programme was successfully 
implemented in December 2015 
and continued to be rolled out to 
other brands throughout 2016. 
The focus on monitoring and 
reporting customer outcome 
risks continued during the 
year and included reports 
showing progress against the 
Group minimum compliance 
standards, which introduces 
the levels of compliance 
resources and monitoring 
levels that all Group firms 
must apply to their respective 
regulatory obligations. 
I look forward to continuing  
the good work this year.

Duties and responsibilities of the 
Group Risk Committee
The duties and responsibilities of the 
Committee are set out in Terms of Reference 
that were approved by the Board in January 
2013 and updated and approved in January 
2016. The responsibilities of the Committee 
can be summarised as:
• Oversee the development, 
implementation and maintenance of 
the Group’s overall Risk Management 
Framework and ensure that it is in line 
with emerging regulatory, corporate 
governance and best practice guidelines; 
• Monitoring the Group’s prudential risk 
exposure, which includes ensuring that 
the Group’s capital resources and liquidity

whilst meeting minimum regulatory 
requirements, including overseeing and 
challenging the design and execution of 
the Group’s stress and scenario testing;
• Monitoring the Group’s current and future 
conduct risk exposure;
• Ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Group’s systems and controls for 
the prevention of financial crime, data 
protection systems and controls;
• Monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the Group’s Compliance functions;
• Reviewing the Group’s progress towards 
achieving Solvency II compliance;
• Reviewing compliance with Group policies, 
including the established Reserving Policy 
and process;
• Considering and recommending to 
the Board for approval the Group’s risk 
appetite, including any changes to the

• Review and approve the Solvency II

Remuneration Committee sign off.
The Committee Chairperson reports 
formally to the Board on its proceedings 
after each meeting on all matters within 
its duties and responsibilities, as set out in 
previously circulated minutes to the Board. 
The Committee Chairperson also reports on 
the activities of the Committee in a formal 
written report that is submitted to and 
discussed by the Board every six months.
The work of the Committee is supported 
by more detailed work undertaken by 
executive Risk Management Committees 
in each of the Group’s operational entities. 
At each meeting, the Risk Management 
Committees consider significant movements 
in the operation’s risk profile, any risks that 
have arisen and any emerging risks. Risk 
Management Committees also assess and 
monitor any regulatory issues, ensuring 
that their resolution and the action taken 
are appropriately recorded. In the UK, the 
Risk Management Committee receives 
regular information on Conduct Risk, such as 
complaint handling reports and other related 
management information. The Group Risk 
Management function reviews and collates 
information from across the group for 
consideration by the Group Risk Committee.
Internal Control And Risk 
Management Statement
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
the Group’s system of risk management 
and internal control and, through the 
Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of this system. The system of 
risk management and internal control over 
insurance, operational, market, credit and 
group risks is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and breaches of risk 
appetites and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The Board is of the view that there is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing the Group’s risks and internal 
controls; that it has been in place for the 
year ended 31 December 2016; and that, up 
to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts, it is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the internal control 
guidance for Directors provided in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. 
The Board confirms that it has performed  
a robust assessment of the Group’s principal 
risks. These risks, along with explanations of 
how they are being managed and mitigated, 
are included in the Strategic Report on  
pages 40 to 43.
The Board is responsible for determining 
the nature and extent of the principal risks 
it is willing to take in achieving its strategic 
objectives. The Board meets at least seven 
times a year to discuss the direction of 
the company and provide oversight of 
the Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems. The role and responsibilities 
of the Board are documented within 
their Terms of Reference and these are 
reviewed annually. 
A key element of the control system is 
that the Board meets regularly with a 
formal schedule of matters reserved to 
it for decision and has put in place an 
organisational structure with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility. As described above, 
in order to ensure these responsibilities 
are properly discharged, the Board has 
delegated to the Audit Committee to 
keep under review the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls, internal control and risk 
management systems.
The Board has delegated the development, 
implementation and maintenance of the

to the Group Risk Committee. The Group Risk

Committee that the Group’s internal control,

continue to operate effectively.
The Group Risk Committee continued
60 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: The Group Risk Committee The Group has a ‘three lines of defence’ 
approach to Internal Control, including those 
controls that relate to the financial reporting 
process. The Board recognises that the 
day-to-day responsibility for implementing 
policies lies with the senior management, 
the ‘first line of defence’, whose operational 
decisions must take into account risk and 
how this can be controlled effectively. 
The ‘second line of defence’ describes the 
Committees and functions that are in place 
to provide an oversight of the effective 
operation of the internal control framework. 
The Group Risk Department and the 
Compliance functions are part of the  
second line of defence. 
The Group Risk Department defines and 
prescribes the insurance, operational, 
market, credit and group risk assessment 
processes for the business. It performs 
second line reviews, including of the 
reserving, capital modelling and business 
planning processes, and undertakes regular 
reviews of all risks in conjunction with 
management, with the results of these 
reviews recorded in risk registers collated 
centrally on the Group risk management 
system. Furthermore, Group Risk records any 
actual losses or near misses that occur as a 
consequence of the crystallisation of risk and 
analyses the sufficiency of the action taken 
to avoid reoccurrence. The Chief Risk Officer 
has responsibility for ensuring that managers 
are aware of their risk management 
obligations, providing them with support and 
advice, and ensuring that risk management 
strategies are properly communicated. 
Reports are produced showing the most 
significant risks identified and the controls 
in place. Internal Audit uses the risk registers 
to plan and inform their programme of audits 
around the most significant risks to the 
Group to ensure that the prescribed controls 
are in place and are operating effectively.
There is Compliance resource assigned to 
each operation who review and report on 
the first line of defence’s compliance with 
designated control activities. The Group 
Compliance function consolidates these 
reviews and provides reports to the Group 
Risk Committee.
The ‘third line of defence’ describes the 
independent assurance provided by the 
Audit Committee and the Group Internal 
Audit function that reports to that 
Committee. Internal Audit undertakes a 
programme of risk based audits covering all 
aspects of both the first and second lines of 
defence. The findings from these audits are 
reported to all three lines, i.e. management, 
the executive and oversight Committees, 
and the Audit Committee.
The Group Risk Committee, UK Risk 
Management Committee and other UK 
and overseas Risk Committees receive 
reports setting out key performance 
and risk indicators and consider possible 
control issues brought to their attention 
by early warning mechanisms that are 
embedded within the operational units. 
They, together with the Audit Committee, 
also receive regular reports from the 
Internal Audit function, which include 
recommendations for improvement of the 
control and operational environment. The 
Chair of the Group Risk Committee provides 
a comprehensive written report to the 
Board of the activities carried out by the 
Committee on an annual basis. In addition, 
the Board receives reports from the Chair 
of the Audit Committee as to its activities, 
together with copies of the minutes of the 
Group Risk Committee and Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee’s ability to provide the 
appropriate assurance to the Board depends 
on the provision of periodic and independent 
confirmation, primarily by Internal Audit, that 
the controls established by management are 
operating effectively and where necessary 
provides a high-level challenge to the steps 
being taken by the Group Risk Committee to 
implement the risk management strategy.  
Viability
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 revision of the Code, the Directors have 
assessed the prospect of the Company over 
a longer period than the 12 months required 
by the ‘Going Concern’ provision. The Board 
conducted this review for a period of three 
years to December 2019. This assessment 
has been made taking into account the 
current financial position of the Group, the 
Group’s business plans, the Group’s ‘Own Risk 
and Solvency Assessment’ (ORSA) process, 
and the principal risks and uncertainties 
faced by the Group, which are disclosed on 
pages 40 to 43 of the Strategic Report. 
The ORSA is performed in line with 
Solvency II regulations and requires 
the Group to demonstrate that it has 
a detailed understanding of the risks 
facing the business over a three-year time 
horizon. In addition to this the Group Risk 
Committee and the Group Board review 
regular updates to the Group’s capital and 
solvency projections. 
Quantitative and qualitative assessments 
of risks are performed as part of the ORSA 
process. The quantitative assessment (in 
line with the Group’s capital and solvency 
projections) considers how the regulatory 
capital requirements, economic capital 
needs, own funds and the solvency position 
of the Company is projected to change over 
the three year time horizon. It also includes 
a series of stress tests, linked to the Group’s 
principal risks and reports the impact of 
these stresses alongside any mitigating 
factors that reduce the impact. 
The results of the stress tests form part 
of the process to set the Group’s capital 
risk appetite, which ensures that a buffer 
on top of the Group’s regulatory capital 
requirement is held to protect its capital 
position against shocks and stresses. Refer 
to the Strategic Report for information on 
sensitivities to the reported 2016 solvency 
ratio position. 
Based on the results of this analysis, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over this three year period.

Statement from Alastair Lyons, Chairman of the Nomination Committee
“ What is important is diversity of thought, experience and 
approach and each new appointment must complement 
what already exists at the Board table”
Dear Shareholder,
Succession planning has clearly been 
a key area of focus for the Committee 
during the year. We were pleased to 
welcome Non-Executive Director, Penny 
James, who joined the Committee in April 
following Lucy Kellaway stepping down 
from Board at the AGM in April 2016. 
Given the significance of the appointment 
of Chairman and in order to ensure that a 
formal, rigorous and transparent process 
was followed, it was agreed by the Board 
in June 2016 that the new Chairman 
should be decided by the whole Board but 
excluding myself and any Non-Executive 
Directors who declared themselves as 
candidates. The Chairman succession 
process was led by Penny James. Penny 
led a Selection Board consisting of all 
Board members excluding the current 
Chairman and any directors who declared 
themselves as candidates. Further details 
of the comprehensive succession process 
that was followed are set out later in 
this report.
In addition to the Chairman succession 
process and in keeping with its remit to 
review regularly the composition and 
experience of the Board, the Committee 
led the process of Non-Executive 
Board appointments during the year. 
The Committee carried out a robust 
recruitment process resulting in the 
appointment of Justine Roberts in June 
2016, further enhancing the range of 
skills, breadth of experience and diversity 
around the Board table.
The Committee continued the 
development of a structured succession 
plan that would ensure appropriate action 
was taken well ahead of the dates on which 
individuals would be retiring in order to 
achieve their replacement, if appropriate, 
with individuals of the appropriate skills, 
experience and fit to the Board. 
In accordance with the requirements 
of Solvency II and the Senior Insurance 
Manager Regime, the Committee reviewed 
and approved the Group’s Fit and Proper 
Policy which sets out the process of 
assessment for every person who performs 
a key function to ensure that they meet 
the requirements in terms of qualifications, 
capability, honesty and integrity.
 
 
Alastair Lyons, CBE
Chairman of the  
Nomination Committee 
7 March 2017
The membership of the Committee at the 
year end was Alastair Lyons (Chairman), 
Colin Holmes and Penny James. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to 
the Committee. The Committee invites the 
Chief Executive to attend meetings when 
it deems appropriate. The Committee met 
formally on two occasions in 2016 although 
members of the Committee corresponded 
and met informally on a number of occasions 
to consider and meet with individuals that 
the Committee had identified as possible 
candidates to join the Board. 
The Committee leads the process for 
making appointments to the Board or where 
the appointee is likely to become a Board 
member. The Committee ensures there is 
a formal, rigorous and transparent process 
for the appointment of new Directors to 
the Board embracing a full evaluation of the 
skills, knowledge and experience required 
of Directors. The Committee also ensures 
plans are in place for orderly succession 
for appointments to the Board and reviews 
the succession plans for other senior 
management positions. Responsibility for 
making senior management appointments 
rests with the Chief Executive. 
The Chairman succession process was led by 
Penny James. Where preparatory research 
was required ahead of meetings of the 
Selection Board Penny was assisted by 
Executive Director Geraint Jones to ensure 
that there was a balance of Non-Executive 
and Executive input. The principal aspects 
against which potential candidates would 
be assessed for suitability were agreed 
based on discussions held jointly by Penny 
and Geraint with the Selection Board and 
Board attendees, as well as with others 
who would have insightful perspectives 
as to what competencies, experience, 
and personal characteristics the next 
62 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: The Nomination Committee Admiral Chairman would ideally have. The 
views expressed by leading institutional 
shareholders with whom the Chairman had 
recently conducted Corporate Governance 
meetings indicated that the majority 
were supportive of an internal process, 
given the Group’s distinctive culture and 
market position and subject to there 
being sufficient suitably qualified and 
experienced internal candidates.
The proposed suitability criteria were then 
discussed and agreed by the whole Board 
at its October meeting. At this meeting it 
was also agreed to appoint external search 
firm, Zygos, to assist with the process 
based on their depth of experience and 
understanding of the requirements of 
a FTSE 100 Chairman. Zygos carried out 
psychometric testing of, and had individual 
meetings with, each of the candidates. The 
candidates were benchmarked against the 
external marketplace with the assistance 
of Zygos, considering their knowledge of 
the other potential candidates and their 
relative strengths. Each internal candidate 
held individual sessions with Selection Panel 
members and the CEO and presented to 
the Selection Board at the December Board 
meeting in order to explain their view of the 
role and answer any questions raised.
Based on all of the input Penny and the 
Selection Board had received, it was agreed 
that they had more than one highly capable 
internal candidate. Having reviewed the 
external candidate list and discussed with 
Zygos their relative strengths, and after 
taking to account feedback from the 
Selection Board after the panel session,  
it was concluded that the internal 
candidates were sufficiently strong  
that approaching additional external 
candidates was unnecessary. 
At the Board meeting in January 2017, 
Penny recommended on behalf of the 
Selection Board that the Board approve the 
appointment of Annette Court, as Chairman 
of the Board, subject to regulatory approval. 
Throughout the process it was agreed that 
Annette had demonstrated good strategic 
alignment with the Executive and the Board, 
breadth of experience across different 
organisations and boards, varied board 
experience including experience of chairing 
boards and board committees, experience 
of working with complex, multi-line and 
international companies, deep knowledge 
of the insurance sector, and clarity of the 
direction of the Board itself.
The Group has in place a policy of recruiting 
well ahead of impending retirements in 
order to ensure continuity of knowledge and 
Board dynamics, hence the recruitment of 
Owen Clarke in 2015. In the context of the 
retirements that took place during 2016, 
with Henry Engelhardt, Margaret Johnson 
and Lucy Kellaway stepping down from the 
Board and having regard to forthcoming 
retirements and the changing nature of 
the Group’s business, the Board initiated a 
search for a new Non-Executive Director. 
The Committee developed an appropriate 
specification for a new Non-Executive 
Director and identified the required skills 
and experience. Following this process, the 
Committee identified Justine Roberts as best 
placed to fill the role identified.
Justine is CEO and co-founder of internet 
company, Mumsnet.com, which has grown 
into the UK’s biggest online network for 
parents. Justine has been responsible for 
the creation, strategic direction and overall 
management of Mumsnet, building it into 
one of the most recognisable internet 
brands in the UK. She brings a wealth of 
experience in interacting with consumers 
across social media. Given Justine’s 
background, experience and competence, 
and the external references that were 
obtained, the Committee did not consider 
it either necessary or appropriate to 
undertake a full search led by an external 
recruitment consultancy.
Each Committee member met separately 
with Justine and agreed that she would 
bring invaluable experience to the Board. 
The Board approved the Committee’s 
recommendations and following regulatory 
approval Justine was formally appointed to 
the Board with effect from 17 June 2016. 
The Board, at its meeting in April 2016, 
considered talent management within the 
Group and identified where there were 
individuals who, with further experience and 
guidance, might be capable of moving into 
particular senior management roles. The 
Committee remains satisfied that succession 
plans for Directors and senior management 
are in place to ensure the continued ability 
of the Group to implement strategy and 
compete effectively in the markets in which 
it operates.
The Group remains strongly supportive of 
the principle of boardroom diversity, of 
which gender is an important, but not the 
only, aspect. What is important is diversity 
of thought, experience and approach and 
each new appointment must complement 
what already exists at the Board table. 
Accordingly, appointments will always be 
made on merit against objective criteria, 
including diversity, and not just to achieve 
an externally prescribed number. Given 
women constitute 40% of our plc Board, 
the Group has already met the target set 
by both Lord Davies in his report: Women 
on Boards, and the Hampton Alexander 
Review (that builds on the Davies Review) 
which encourages FTSE 350 companies to 
achieve at least 33% women on Boards by 
2020. The Group also already meets the 
Hampton Alexander Review target of 33% 
women’s representation across executive 
committees below Board level and direct 
reports to those committees, as shown by 
the gender diversity table on page 44. The 
Group remains committed to providing equal 
opportunities, eliminating discrimination, 
and encouraging diversity amongst its 
workforce both in the UK and overseas. 
A breakdown of the gender of Company 
Directors and senior employees at the end 
of the financial year together with details of 
the Group’s Equality, Diversity and Dignity 
at Work Policy are set out in the Directors’ 
Report on page 78.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
63 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report (the Report) for 
the year ended 31 December 2016, which 
has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee) and approved 
by the Board. 
2016 has been another strong year for 
the Admiral Group, though key metrics 
were materially impacted by the Ogden 
discount rate change. Earnings per share 
in the year were 78.7 pence (2015: 107.3 
pence) and Return on Equity was 37% 
(2015: 49%). Total dividends for the 
financial year (including the proposed final 
dividend of 51.5 pence per share) will be 
114.4 pence per share. 
The Remuneration Committee
A Statement to Shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
“2016 has been another strong year for the Admiral Group”
One of the two Executive Directors, CEO 
David Stevens is a founding Director 
and receives remuneration that only 
comprises salary and modest benefits. 
The Committee continues to hold the view 
that this is appropriate, as his significant 
shareholding provides a sufficient 
alignment of his interest with those of 
other shareholders. In order to provide 
full transparency of pay arrangements for 
the other Executive Director, CFO Geraint 
Jones, this Report includes single figure 
and comparative data for him as well as for 
our CEO, as the pay arrangements for the 
CFO are more reflective of those for (non-
founder) executives. 
During the year, the Committee held a 
strategy session in which the Committee 
considered all aspects of the Group’s 
current remuneration arrangements 
together with a consideration of trends 
in UK corporate governance and the 
most recent AGM season. The Group’s 
remuneration consultants also provided a 
comprehensive update on remuneration 
trends at sector comparators and across 
the broader UK market. Following this 
meeting, the Committee concluded that 
the Group’s Remuneration Policy continued 
to remain appropriate and that it supported 
the view, held by the Board, that wide share 
ownership drives outstanding performance 
and promotes the long term success of the 
business whilst remaining in alignment with 
shareholder interests. 
Much of the focus of the Committee’s 
work in the second half of 2017 will be 
preparatory work including consultation 
with shareholders and key stakeholders as 
the Group prepares to put its Remuneration 
Policy before shareholders at the AGM 
in 2018.
The Committee considered the following 
matters during the year ended 
31 December 2016:
• Reviewing the salary arrangements and 
fee proposals for the Executive Directors, 
the Chairman and senior management;
• Reviewing the appropriateness of 
the performance conditions for the 
Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS) 
and Free Share Incentive Plan (SIP) awards;
• Reviewing the Company’s performance 
against the performance conditions 
applicable to the DFSS and SIP awards 
and where appropriate authorising the 
vesting of awards;
• Reviewing and authorising the grant of 
awards under both the DFSS and SIP;
• Reviewing the Committee’s Terms 
of Reference and recommending 
amendments to the Board for approval;
• Considering and approving the Group’s 
Material Risk Takers in accordance with 
the requirements of Solvency II regime;
• Reviewing the impact of the Living  
Wage on the Group’s current 
remuneration structure;
• Reviewing the new Gender Pay  
reporting requirements.

Corporate Governance: The Remuneration Committee Directors’ Remuneration Report
Compliance statement
This Remuneration Report has been 
prepared according to the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), 
Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 and other relevant 
requirements of the FCA Listing Rules. 
In addition, the Board has applied the 
principles of good corporate governance 
set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the Code) and has considered the 
guidelines issued by its leading shareholders 
and bodies such as the Investment 
Association and the Pensions and Lifetime 
Savings Association. Unless otherwise 
stated, information contained within this 
Remuneration report is unaudited. 
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was 
approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) on 29 April 2015, 
and took effect from that date. This section 
presents a summary of the approved policy, 
including the policy table and notes, pay-for-
performance charts, the recruitment policy, 
and Non-Executive Director appointments. 
The sections presented below are as 
disclosed in the prior year save a number of 
non-significant changes, as follows:
• References to financial years have been 
updated where appropriate;
• Pay-for-performance scenario charts have 
been updated to reflect latest salaries;
• Current Non-Executive Director 
appointment expiry dates have been 
updated; and
• References to Henry Engelhardt in the 
policy report have been removed, as he 
stepped down from the Board in May 2016.
Key principles of Admiral’s 
remuneration arrangements
The Group is committed to the primary 
objective of maximising shareholder value 
over time and ensuring that there is a strong 
link between performance and reward. This is 
reflected in the Group’s stated Remuneration 
Policy of paying competitive, performance-
linked and shareholder-aligned remuneration 
packages comprising basic salaries coupled 
with participation in performance-based 
share schemes to generate competitive total 
reward packages for superior performance. 
The Board is satisfied that the adoption of 
this policy continues to meet the objectives 
of attracting and retaining executives of the 
highest quality across the Group.
The Committee reviews the framework and 
remuneration packages of the Executive 
Directors and the most senior managers 
and recognises the need to ensure that 
the Remuneration Policy is firmly linked 
to the Group’s strategy, including its risk 
management approach. In setting the 
policy and making remuneration decisions, 
the Committee takes into account pay and 
conditions elsewhere in the Group. The main 
principles underlying the Remuneration 
Policy are:
• Competitive – the Group aims to combine 
salaries with attractive performance-
related incentives which provide the 
potential for competitive total reward 
packages for the achievement of superior 
performance. Base salaries reflect the role, 
job size and responsibility together with 
individual performance and effectiveness. 
Prevailing market and economic conditions 
and developments in governance are also 
considered, as are general salary levels 
throughout the organisation. In considering 
total remuneration for the Executive 
Directors, the Committee takes into 
account remuneration in companies of a 
similar size in the Financial Services sector;
• Performance-linked – a significant part 
of the Executive Directors’ (excluding the 
founding Director) and senior managers’ 
reward remains performance-linked and 
shareholder-aligned; and
• Transparent – all aspects of the 
remuneration structure are clear to 
employees and openly communicated. 
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
65 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Remuneration policy table
This table describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors as approved at the 2015 AGM.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
Base salary
To attract and retain 
talent by setting 
base salaries at levels 
appropriate for 
the business.
Salaries are reviewed annually or following  
a significant change in responsibilities.
Salary levels/increases take account of:
• Scope and responsibility of the position.
• Individual performance and 
effectiveness, and experience of  
the individual in the role.
• Average increase awarded across 
the Group.
Any salary increases are applied in line with the outcome of  
the review.
In respect of existing Executive Directors, it is anticipated that 
salary increases will normally be in line with the increase for the 
general employee population over the term of this policy. More 
significant increases may be awarded in certain circumstances 
including, but not limited to: where there has been a significant 
increase in role size or complexity, to apply salary progression 
for a newly appointed Executive Director, or where the Executive 
Director’s salary has fallen significantly behind market.
Where increases are awarded in excess of that for the general 
employee population, the Committee will provide the rationale  
in the relevant year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
Pension
To provide 
retirement benefits.
The Group operates a Personal Pension  
Plan, a Defined Contribution Scheme.
This is available to all employees following 
completion of their probationary period.
In the UK, the Group matches employee contributions up to a 
maximum of 6% of base salary subject to an overall maximum 
employer contribution of £9,000. Salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Other benefits
To provide  
competitive benefits.
Includes (but not limited to):
• Death in service scheme.
• Private medical cover.
• Permanent health insurance.
• Relocation, at the Committee’s discretion.
All benefits are non-pensionable.
Benefits may vary by role. 
None of the existing Executive Directors received total taxable 
benefits exceeding 5% of salary during the most recent financial 
year, and it is not anticipated that the cost of benefits provided will 
exceed this level over the term of this policy.
The Committee retains the discretion to approve a higher cost in 
exceptional circumstances (e.g. relocation), or in circumstances 
driven by factors outside the Company’s control (e.g. material 
increases in insurance premiums).
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
66 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Corporate Governance: Directors’ Remuneration Report Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity and performance metrics
Discretionary Free Share Scheme (DFSS)
To motivate and 
reward longer term 
performance, aid long 
term retention of key 
executive talent, use 
capital efficiently, grow 
profits sustainably and 
further strengthen 
the alignment of the 
interests of shareholders 
and staff.
Executive Directors may be granted awards 
annually at the discretion of the Committee. 
David Stevens has declined to participate 
given his significant shareholding.
Awards are generally made as a specific 
number of shares and vest after a minimum 
of three years subject to Group performance 
and continued employment.
Awards are subject to clawback and malus, 
i.e. forfeiture or reduction of unvested 
awards and recovery of vested awards in 
exceptional circumstances (such as material 
misstatement or gross misconduct).
Maximum opportunity: £2,000,000. For awards above £1,000,000  
a maximum of 600% of base salary applies. 
Vesting of DFSS awards is subject to the Group’s performance 
over a three-year performance period. The performance measures 
and respective weightings may vary year-on-year to reflect 
strategic priorities.
Details of the measures, weightings and performance targets  
used for specific DFSS grants are included in the Annual Report  
on Remuneration.
Threshold performance will result in vesting of up to 25% of the 
maximum award.
DFSS bonus
To further align 
incentive structures 
with shareholder 
interests through the 
delivery of dividend 
equivalent bonuses.
To incentivise shareholder value creation, 
in particular in the form of dividends, 
management participate in a bonus 
scheme which directly links their awards 
to dividends paid to shareholders. Bonus 
is calculated to be equivalent to dividends 
that would have been payable during 
the year on all outstanding DFSS shares 
awarded but not vested.
Maximum opportunity: sum equal to dividends payable during the 
year on awarded but unvested DFSS shares.
No bonus is payable unless dividends are payable on Admiral shares.
Approved Free Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
To encourage share 
ownership across all 
employees using HMRC 
approved schemes.
All UK employees participate in the SIP 
(except David Stevens, who has declined  
to participate). Grants are made twice a 
year based on the results of each half  
year and vest after three years subject 
to continued employment.
The SIP is an all-employee scheme and Executive Directors 
participate on the same terms as other employees. The acquisition 
of shares is therefore not subject to the satisfaction of a 
performance target.
Maximum opportunity is in line with HMRC limits.
Minimum Shareholding Requirement
To align interests of 
Executive Directors  
with shareholders.
Guideline to be met within five years  
of appointment.
Two times salary.
The Committee is satisfied that the above Remuneration Policy is in the best interests of shareholders and does not promote excessive risk-
taking. The Committee retains discretion to make non-significant changes to the Remuneration Policy without reverting to shareholders.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
67 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the remuneration policy table
Payments from existing awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration 
Policy. This includes all outstanding awards under the DFSS, made prior to the approval of the 2015 DFSS, and awards of DFSS shares that  
vest 50% on performance and 50% on continued employment made to the CFO prior to his appointment to the Board.
Remuneration arrangements for David Stevens (founding Director)
David Stevens is a founding Director, and he and the Committee continue to hold the view that his significant shareholding provides 
sufficient alignment of his interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders. In light of this, David Stevens’ 
remuneration package consists only of a below market rate salary, benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and 
death in service cover, and matching pension contributions from the Company under the Group’s Personal Pension Plan. David Stevens has  
not participated, nor is it intended that he participates, in any Group share schemes.

Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
The following charts provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split 
between the different elements of pay under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’. As described 
above, Admiral’s DFSS bonus is directly aligned with dividends received by our shareholders. As such, there is no performance range defined 
for this element of pay; the figures shown in the chart below for the CFO’s DFSS bonus include the value of the actual DFSS bonus paid in 2016 
as an illustration of the value he might receive. Under all scenarios, potential reward opportunities are based on expected awards for 2017 (in 
accordance with Admiral’s Remuneration Policy), applied to salaries as at 1 January 2017.

Approach to remuneration relating to new Executive Director appointments
External appointment
In the case of appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration,  
as follows:
Component Approach Maximum annual grant value
Base salary The base salary will be determined by the Committee with reference 
to the scope and responsibility of the position as well as internal 
relativities and their current remuneration.
Pension New appointees will be eligible to participate in the Personal Pension 
Plan with Group contributions in line with the existing policy.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits which may 
include (but are not limited to) death in service scheme, private 
medical cover, and permanent health insurance.
SIP New appointees will be eligible to participate in the SIP.
DFSS New appointees will be granted awards under the DFSS on the  
same terms as other Executives, as described in the policy table.
£2,000,000. Awards over £1,000,000 are  
subject to a maximum of 600% of base salary.
DFSS bonus New appointees will be granted awards under the DFSS bonus 
scheme on the same terms as other Executive Directors, as 
described in the policy table.
Linked to Admiral dividend.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new Executive Director appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited 
on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant factors including any performance conditions attached 
to the forfeited awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met to ensure that the value of the buy-out award is no greater than 
the fair value of the awards it replaces. The Committee may also avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if appropriate in respect of buy-out 
incentive arrangements.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
69 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Annual report on remuneration
This section of the report provides details of how Admiral’s Remuneration Policy was implemented in 2016 and the remuneration 
arrangements proposed for 2017.
Remuneration Committee membership in 2016
The Board sets the Group’s Remuneration Policy and, through the authority delegated to it by the Board, the Committee is responsible for 
making recommendations to the Board on the structure and implementation of the Remuneration Policy across the Group with consideration 
to the prevailing economic climate within the economies in which the Group operates. Its remit includes recommending the remuneration 
of the Group Board Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary; reviewing the remuneration of senior management; and 
reviewing the composition of and awards made under the performance-related incentive schemes.
At the end of 2016 the Committee consisted of Owen Clarke and Jean Park under the Chairmanship of Annette Court. Owen Clarke joined the 
Remuneration Committee with effect from 28 April 2016. Margaret Johnson was a member of the Committee until the date of her retirement 
from the Board, being 28 April 2016. The Committee met five times during the year.
The Group Chairman, CEO, CFO and Chief Risk Officer are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their 
advice on Group strategy and performance and Senior Executive pay strategy. The members of the Committee do not have any personal 
financial interests (other than shareholdings), or any conflicts, that relate to the business of the Committee. The Committee members do  
not have any day-to-day involvement in the running of the Group.
Advisor to the Committee
During the year, in order to enable the Committee to reach informed decisions on Executive remuneration, advice on market data and trends 
was obtained from independent consultants, Kepler Associates, a brand of Mercer (which is part of the MMC group of companies). Kepler 
reports directly to the Committee Chair, and is a signatory to and abides by the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants (which can  
be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com). Other than advice on remuneration, no other services were provided by Kepler (or  
any other part of the MMC group of companies) to the Company. The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2016 (based on  
time and materials) totalled £36,090, excluding expenses and VAT.
The Committee undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice 
provided is impartial and objective. The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Kepler is independent.
The Company Secretary also circulates market survey results as appropriate.

For the 2016 calculations, given that vesting occurs during 2017, after this 2016 Directors’ Remuneration Report is finalised, the figures are 
based on the average share price in the last three months of 2016 (£19.06). The 2015 calculations have been trued up based on the actual 
share price on vest (£20.17). Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens do not participate in the Plan given their significant shareholdings.
6. DFSS bonus: the bonus equivalent to dividends that were paid during the year on all outstanding DFSS shares awarded but not yet vested.
7.  Henry Engelhardt stepped down from the Board on 13 May 2016. In this table, his 2016 remuneration includes salary and benefits in respect

DFSS awards vesting on performance to 31 December 2016
Awards were made under the DFSS to Geraint Jones on 15 April 2014 and in 22 September 2014. For the April award, vesting for 50% of the 
award is dependent on the Company’s EPS performance in excess of a risk-free return, defined as average three-month LIBOR, over a three-
year period commencing on 1 January 2014. 10% of shares vest for matching LIBOR, full vesting occurs for outperforming LIBOR by 10% p.a., 
with straight-line vesting in between. No vesting occurs for EPS growth below LIBOR. For the remaining 50% of the April award, vesting is 
subject to continued employment only, as the award was made prior to Geraint Jones’ appointment to the Board. For the September award, 
vesting of 100% of the award is dependent on the Company’s EPS performance, and the targets are the same as for the April award.
The table below details the Company’s EPS performance against targets and vesting outcome over the performance period ending on 
31 December 2016.

3. Calculated based on the average share price in the last three months of 2016 (£19.06).
4. 50% of the award vests on continued employment only.
50% and 0% of Geraint Jones’ April and September 2014 DFSS awards, respectively, will vest in April 2017 and September 2017, respectively, 
subject to his continued employment on the vesting dates.
DFSS bonus in respect of 2016
The Group paid a bonus to all holders of DFSS shares in 2016, which was equivalent to the dividend payable on all outstanding DFSS shares 
awarded but not yet vested. The Committee continues to feel that having a bonus equivalent to the dividend flow received by investors 
further aligns the incentive structure with shareholders.
In 2016, Geraint Jones received a DFSS bonus of £174,209 (2015: £104,340). Neither Henry Engelhardt nor David Stevens received a DFSS bonus 
as they do not participate in the DFSS.
From 2015, DFSS bonus payments are subject to clawback in exceptional circumstances, such as material misstatement or gross misconduct.
Scheme interests granted in 2016 (audited)
DFSS
In September 2016, Geraint Jones was granted an award under the DFSS of 50,000 shares with a value at the date of award of £1,039,500 (based 
on share price of £20.79), equivalent to 495% of salary. The three-year period over which performance will be measured is 1 January 2016 to 
31 December 2018. The award is eligible to vest in its entirety on the third anniversary of the date of grant (i.e. September 2019), subject to 
performance and to continued employment. David Stevens again declined to be included given his significant shareholding. 
The award will vest on three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted equally.  
The performance conditions are summarised in the table below.

Since 2015, DFSS awards made have been subject to clawback and malus, i.e. forfeiture or reduction of unvested awards and recovery of vested 
awards in exceptional circumstances (such as material misstatement or gross misconduct).

Corporate Governance: Directors’ Remuneration Report SIP
In March and September 2016, Geraint Jones was granted awards under the SIP of 92 shares in March 2016, with a face value of £1,791, and  
87 shares in September 2016, with a face value of £1,784. The shares will vest on 11 March 2019 and 2 September 2019 respectively subject  
to continued employment only. David Stevens again declined to be included given his significant shareholding.
Exit payments (audited) 
Henry Engelhardt stepped down from the Board as CEO on 13 May 2016. He received salary and benefits in line with the approved policy up to 
his termination date. He has not received any exit payments. In addition, the Group did not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf 
of Henry Engelhardt, and he did not participate in any of the Group’s incentive schemes.
Henry Engelhardt continues to be employed by the Group, though has not been an Executive Director since stepping down from the Group 
Board on 13 May 2016.
Payments to past Directors (audited)
As disclosed in last year’s report, based on performance to 31 December 2015, 19,855 DFSS shares vested to Kevin Chidwick on 10 October 
2016. The total value at vest was £405,638 based on share price on vest of £20.43. Please refer to the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report  
for full details of actual performance against targets for this award.
Implementation of remuneration policy for 2017
Executive Directors
Salary, Pension and Benefits
Remuneration for the Executive Directors in 2017 will be determined in line with the latest policy. The Committee approved the following base 
salaries for the Executive Directors in 2016:
Director Latest salary 2016 salary % change Effective date
Geraint Jones £245,000 £210,000 17% 1 January 2017
David Stevens £388,236 £378,767 2% 1 September 2016
As stated in previous reports, Geraint Jones was appointed to the Board on a relatively low salary and the Committee expects to make salary 
increases in the first few years of his appointment that are above general inflation to reflect his demonstrated development in the CFO role 
and the performance of the business. The Committee will determine the levels of future increases taking into account both his individual and 
Company performance, and with reference to market pay levels. Geraint’s current salary of £245,000 continues to be in the lower quartile for 
FTSE 100 companies of a similar size. 
Geraint Jones will continue to participate in the Group Personal Pension Plan, where employee contributions are matched up to a maximum 6% 
of base salary with maximum employer contribution of £9,000. David Stevens will also continue to participate in the plan, on the same basis as 
in 2015. Both Executive Directors will continue to receive benefits in line with the policy.
DFSS
In advance of each DFSS cycle, the Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance measures and corresponding targets. Vesting 
of the 2017 award will be linked to the same three performance measures set for the 2016 awards, i.e. three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. 
FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted equally. The Committee intends to make DFSS awards in October 2017 and it 
is anticipated that targets will be the same as those for awards in 2016, as summarised in the table below. The Committee will determine the 
precise targets closer to the time of making the awards, later in the year, and will disclose them in the 2017 Annual Report on Remuneration.

75 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Dilution
The Company currently uses newly issued shares to fund the DFSS. The Company has controls in place to ensure that shares awarded under 
the incentive schemes operated by the Company within any rolling ten-year period do not exceed 10% of the number of ordinary shares in 
the capital of the Company in issue at the time of each award. As at the end of 2016, the ten-year rolling dilution level was 8.0%. The Company 
would consider using a mixture of newly issued shares and market purchase shares to fund the DFSS in the future. 
Interests held by Directors (audited)
Executive Directors have agreed to (acquire and) retain a beneficial shareholding equal to at least 200% of base salary, which can be built up

understanding of business goals and 
objectives including; the staff portal (Atlas), 
internal newsletters, videos, team briefings, 
suggestion schemes, staff forums, updates

with the amount of information they receive 
about the company (2015: 85%).
The transparency of our communication 
philosophy extends to senior managers 
and Directors, who sit amongst their teams 
which encourages a dialogue between staff 
of all levels of seniority across all areas of our 
business. Furthermore, our Chief Executive 
Officer operates an ‘open door’ policy so 
if any member of our staff wants to ask 
him a question, they can email him directly 
through our ‘Ask David’ intranet initiative. 
Our senior managers and Directors also 
participate in regular online chats with staff.

to the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol: 
A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition) and in accordance 
with the guidance for corporate reporting 
issued by the Department for Environment, 
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).

greenhouse gas emissions is available on the 
corporate website, www.admiralgroup.co.uk.
Going concern
Under Provision C.1.3 of the 2014 UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board is 
required to report on whether the business 
is a going concern. In considering this 
requirement, the Directors have taken into 
account the following:
• The Group’s projections for the next 12 
months and beyond, in particular the profit 
forecasts, regulatory capital surpluses and 
levels and sources of liquidity.
•  The risks included on the Group’s risk 
register that could impact on the Group’s 
financial position and performance, levels 
of liquidity and solvency over the next 
12 months.
• The risks on the Group’s risk register that 
could be a threat to the Group’s business 
model and capital adequacy.
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are 
set out in the Strategic Report. The Strategic 
Report also includes the Group’s principal 
risks and uncertainties. In addition, the 
governance report includes the Directors’ 
statement on the viability of the Group over 
a three year period. 
Following consideration of the above, the 
Directors have reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future, a 
period of not less than 12 months from the 
date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.

79 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Directors’ Report continued
Power to issue shares
At the last Annual General Meeting, held 
on 28 April 2016, authority was given to 
the Directors to allot unissued relevant 
securities in the Company up to a maximum 
of £93,049, equivalent to one third of the 
issued share capital as at 18 March 2016. This 
authority expires on the date of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 26 April 2017 
and the Directors will seek to renew this 
authority for the following year. 
A further special resolution passed at that 
meeting granted authority to the Directors 
to allot equity securities in the Company 
(up to a maximum of 5% of the issued share 
capital of the Company) for cash, without 
regard to the pre-emption provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006. This authority also 
expires on the date of the Annual General 
Meeting to be held on 26 April 2017 and the 
Directors will seek to renew this authority for 
the following year.
In line with the new principles published by 
the Pre-Emption Group in March 2015, and 
their template resolutions published in May 
2016, allowing a company the ability to seek 
authority over a further 5% of the issued 
ordinary share capital on a non-pre-emptive 
basis subject to certain conditions, it is the 
intention of the Company, at the AGM on 26 
April 2017, to seek this additional authority 
by special resolution and will confirm in the 
Notice of AGM that such additional shares 
are only issued in connection with a specified 
acquisition or capital investment. 
Appointments of Directors
The Company’s Articles of Association (the 
Articles) give the Directors power to appoint 
and replace Directors. Under the Terms of 
Reference of the Nomination Committee, 
any appointment must be recommended 
by the Nomination Committee for approval 
by the Board of Directors. The Articles 
also require Directors to retire and submit 
themselves for election at the first Annual 
General Meeting following appointment and 
all Directors who held office at the time of 
the two preceding Annual General Meetings 
to submit themselves for re-election. 
However, in accordance with the 
requirement under the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) for annual 
election of Directors, all Directors will submit 
themselves for re-election at the Group’s 
Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2017. 
Articles of Association
The Articles may only be amended by special 
resolution of the shareholders.
Power of the Directors
The Directors are responsible for managing 
the business of the Company and may 
exercise all powers of the Company subject 
to the provisions of relevant statutes, to any 
directions given by special resolution and to 
the Company’s Memorandum and Articles. 
The Articles, for example, contain specific 
provisions and restrictions concerning the 
Company’s power to borrow money. Powers 
relating to the issuing of new shares are also 
included in the Articles and such authorities 
are renewed by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting each year. 
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
Directors and Officers insurance cover is 
in place for all Directors to provide cover 
against certain acts or omissions on behalf 
of the Company. A Deed Poll of Indemnity 
was executed in October 2015, indemnifying 
each of the Directors, and Company 
Secretary, in relation to certain losses and 
liabilities that they might incur in the course 
of acting as Directors of the Company. The 
Deed Poll of Indemnity is categorised as 
qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
as defined by section 234 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and remains in force for all past and 
present Directors of the Company.
The Board is of the view that it is in the 
best interests of the Group to attract 
and retain the services of the most able 
and experienced directors by offering 
competitive terms of engagement, including 
the granting of such indemnities. Neither 
the Deed Poll of Indemnity nor insurance 
cover would provide any coverage in the 
event that a Director is proved to have acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
It is proposed that the next AGM be held at 
City Hall, Cardiff on Wednesday 26 April 2017 
at 2.00pm, notice of which will be sent to 
shareholders with the Annual Report.

81 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Opinion on financial statements of Admiral Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 
December 2016 and of the group’s and the parent company’s 
profit for the year then ended;
• the group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure 
Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements that we have audited comprise:
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Income Statements;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements  
of Comprehensive Income;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements  
of Financial Position;
• the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement;
• the Consolidated and Parent Company Statements of Changes 
in Equity;
• the related notes 1 to 12 to the Group financial statements; and
• the related notes 1 to 6 to the Parent Company financial statements.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial 
statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including  
FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Summary of our audit approach
Key risks Materiality
The key risks that we identified in the current year were:
• Valuation of gross insurance claims reserves
• Calculation of profit commission income
The materiality that we used in the current year was £14 million 
which was determined on the basis of 5% of pre-tax profit.
Scoping
We have identified five reporting components which we consider are of individual financial significance to the group’s reported results  
and these components were subjected to audits for group reporting purposes. 
Additionally, we have completed specific audit procedures in respect of two further components which, although not financially significant, 
did present specific audit risks which needed to be addressed.
The components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 94% of the group’s pre-tax profits and losses, 87% of revenue and 95% 
of the group’s net assets.
Going concern & the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the financial 
statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the group contained  
within the governance report on page 61.
We are required to state whether we have anything material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 40 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 40 to 43 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed  
or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they considered 
it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of 
at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 61 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the group, 
over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their 
statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue 
in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any 
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We confirm that we have nothing 
material to add or draw attention  
to in respect of these matters.
We agreed with the directors’ 
adoption of the going concern 
basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not 
all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not 
a guarantee as to the group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. The key risks identified this year are in line with those identified by 
the previous auditor in 2015.
Valuation of gross insurance claims reserves 
Risk description The group’s gross insurance claims reserves total £2,031 million (2015: £1,725 million). The judgements which are 
made by management in determining the valuation of incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims reserves are by 
far the most significant, in terms of their impact on the Group’s financial position. Setting these claims reserves is 
an inherently subjective exercise and small changes in underlying assumptions may have a material impact on the 
overall year end result reported.
We have identified a key risk of misstatement in respect of management’s selection of assumptions and estimates 
underpinning the incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims reserves, specifically around periodic payment orders 
(“PPOs”) and the ultimate severity of large bodily injury claims arising in the UK Car Insurance business. These 
particular claims result in higher individual claims reserves and are more judgmental in terms of the development 
of the ultimate losses which will be incurred – due to the longer-term nature of the Group’s exposure – than the 
lower value attritional losses which are more common in the normal course of business.
Following the conclusion of the government’s consultation on the Ogden discount rate used by courts to calculate 
the value of lump sum claims to be paid for long-term damages, management needed also to consider the interaction 
of this change with the assumed propensity of PPO settlements. The timing of the announced rate change from 2.5% 
to minus 0.75%, on 27 February 2017, meant that there was a high degree of uncertainty associated with projecting 
the ultimate impact of this change; given that no subsequent experience has yet emerged. 
Refer to page 56 in the audit committee report where this is included as a significant issue, note 5d and note 3 in 
the financial statements which refer to this matter.
How the scope of  
our audit responded  
to the risk
We have assessed the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of the key controls 
which management performs in relation to insurance reserving. This included testing controls over the data 
provided to the group’s external actuarial expert, the internal challenge of that expert’s work, and the appropriate 
governance oversight in determining the key assumptions for both the actuarial best estimates and the additional 
margin applied above the best estimate reserve.
We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims and exposure data used in the actuarial 
calculations by performing reconciliations of the relevant data back to audited financial information. 
We completed procedures to assess the competence and objectivity of management’s external actuarial expert 
and involved our own Deloitte actuarial experts to review and provide challenge on the methodology applied 
and the key assumptions and judgements taken in determining the gross insurance reserves noted above as 
significant risks.
Our challenge focussed on benchmarking the claims severity assumptions adopted by the group against our wider 
industry experience to assess suitability, evaluating the reserve releases and development trends from previous 
accident years, to verify the robustness of the reserving policy adopted, and understanding the year-on-year 
consistency in determining the reserve margins.
Finally, we have reviewed the specific adjustments made to refine the actuarial models for the change in Ogden 
discount rate and considered the related changes in PPO propensity assumptions.
Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
83 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Calculation of profit commission income 
Risk description We have identified a risk in revenue recognition in respect of the profit commission class of income. This revenue 
line contributed £54.3m to group profit before tax in the year (2015: £85.4m) and is recorded on the basis of 
management’s year end calculations, which are subject to the same underlying estimation as the insurance claims 
reserves. There is, therefore, a greater risk associated with this class of transactions than more automated revenue 
streams which are recorded at source through a large number of individually insignificant transactions.
Amongst the most significant inputs to the calculations are the loss ratios resulting from the gross insurance 
reserves booked in the financial statements, which is discussed as a separate risk, above. This is because the 
setting of reserves will affect the claims incurred in a given underwriting year, thus driving the loss ratios which 
determine the amount of profit commission to be recognised in the year.
Refer to page 57 in the audit committee report where this is included as a significant issue, note 5c and note 3  
in the financial statements which refer to this matter.
How the scope of  
our audit responded  
to the risk
In addition to the procedures outlined above in respect of the valuation of insurance reserves, we reviewed 
the profit commission calculation in detail, and compared the calculation logic and the inputs included by 
management to the terms of the relevant co-insurance contracts in force at the balance sheet date. On the  
basis of this understanding of the contractual terms, we independently formed an expectation for the recorded 
income using audited loss ratios and expenses data and compared this to that actually recorded by management.
Following the announcement of the new Ogden rate, we reassessed the profit commission calculation to test  
the loss ratios being used in the final calculations had been adjusted for the impact of the Ogden rate change.
We have also assessed the design and implementation and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal 
review controls performed by management, which are designed to identify any errors in the inputs or mechanical 
workings of the calculations.
Finally, we vouched the settlement of profit commissions during the year to cash receipts on bank statements  
and used this to reconcile the income recorded to the movement in the balance sheet position associated with 
these arrangements.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do 
not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Independent Auditor’s Report continued
to the Members of Admiral Group plc
Financial Statements: Independent Auditor’s Report Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of 
a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Group materiality £14 million (2015: £16 million was used by the previous auditors).
Basis for 
determining 
materiality
5% of pre-tax profit.
In 2015, the previous auditors set materiality at 4% of pre-tax profit.
Rationale for the 
benchmark applied
We consider profit before taxation to be the critical benchmark of the performance of the group and consider this 
measure to be suitable having compared to other benchmarks: our materiality equates to 1% of gross earned premium 
and 2% of equity.
We determine performance materiality at a level lower than 
materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, 
uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed 
the materiality for the financial statements as a whole. 
Group performance materiality was set at 70% of Group 
materiality for the 2016 audit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would 
report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of 
£0.7m (2015: £0.8m was used by the previous auditors), as 
well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report 
to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we 
identified when assessing the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. PBT

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
85 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 An overview of the scope of our audit
The financially significant components of the group which were identified in our audit planning are Admiral Insurance (Gibraltar) Limited, Admiral 
Insurance Company Limited, EUI Limited, Inspop.com Limited and the Admiral Group plc parent entity itself. In 2015, the previous auditor also 
identified five significant reporting components. Each of these components was subjected to a full-scope audit for group reporting purposes, 
completed to individual component materiality levels which ranged from £660,000 to £11.8m (the previous auditor disclosed the following range 
in 2015: £480,000 to £14m), dependent upon the relative significance of each individual component.
Additionally, we have completed specific audit procedures, designed to address specific audit risks, for the Elephant Insurance Company and Inspop 
USA LLC components of the group, each of which is a subsidiary company incorporated in the USA. Accordingly, we engaged a local component 
auditor, the Deloitte member firm in the USA, to perform these specified audit procedures on our behalf. We directed and supervised the work of the 
component auditor, including through visits to the component and component auditor and remote communication and review of their work.
For the remaining components not subject to audit or specified audit procedures, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-
assess our evaluation that there were no significant risks of material misstatement presented by any of these components. There are several 
non-significant components including branch operations in Europe; the branches in Spain and Italy were visited this year by members of the group 
engagement team and, to enhance our risk assessment and understanding of the group in our first year as group auditor, we assessed the design 
and implementation of key controls in key business cycles in these and the French branches.
The components within the scope of our audit procedures account for 94% of the group’s pre-tax profits and losses, 87% of revenue and 95% of 
the group’s net assets.

• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements; and
• the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified 
any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report.

• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for  
our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to  
report in respect of  
these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to  
report arising from  
these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to  
report arising from  
our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge  
of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to 
the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we 
have not identified any 
such inconsistencies or 
misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.

Consolidated statement of changes in equity
For the year ended 31 December 2016
92 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements: Consolidated statement of changes in equity 1. General information
Admiral Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales. Its 
registered office is at Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff, CF10 2EH and 
its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU). 
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101).
Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has adopted the following IFRS and interpretations during 
the year, which have been issued and endorsed by the EU:
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28: Investment Entities – 
Applying the Consolidation Exemption 
The application of these amendments has not had a material impact 
on the Group’s results, financial position and cash flows.
In 2016, the following standards, both with an effective date of 
1 January 2018, were endorsed by the EU:
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and
• IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
In 2014, the IASB issued the full, final version of IFRS 9. This version 
supersedes all previous versions. The standard has an effective 
date of 1 January 2018 although earlier application is permitted. 
The standard includes requirements relating to the recognition, 
measurement, impairment, de-recognition of assets along with 
general hedge accounting.
In late 2016, the IASB confirmed that the effective date for IFRS 17 
‘Insurance Contracts’ will be 1 January 2021, with the full standard 
expected to be issued during the first half of 2017. The 2021 
effective date means that the timescale is in line with that specified 
in an amendment to IFRS 4, the existing Insurance Contracts 
standard, which permits the deferral of the adoption of IFRS 9 for 
up to three years from the 1 January 2018 effective date. The Group 
expects to take advantage of this deferral approach and delay its 
adoption of IFRS 9 until 1 January 2021 to align with the effective 
date of IFRS 17. 
Following the issuance of the full and final version of IFRS 17, 
the Group plans to perform a detailed impact assessment of the 
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 on its results, financial position 
and cash-flows during 2017. 
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 was issued during 2014 and applies to annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard 
introduces a simple, five step principles-based model to be  
applied to the accounting of all contracts with customers. 
Revenue from insurance contracts and financial instruments is 
outside the scope of the IFRS 15. The Group’s detailed assessment 
of the impact of the standard on its results, financial position and 
cash-flows is currently in progress. The primary focus of this work 
is the other revenue generated by a portfolio of products that 
supplement the core car and household insurance policies and 
revenue generated by the Group’s price comparison businesses. 
Management’s preliminary assessment of the impact of this 
standard is that it is not expected to have a material impact on  
the Group’s financial statements. 
Standards yet to be endorsed by the EU
There are a number of standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations that were issued by 31 December 2016 but have 
either yet to be endorsed by the EU, or were endorsed shortly after 
the year end. The following IFRSs have been issued but have not been 
applied by the Group in these financial statements:
• IFRS 16 Leases;
• IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts;
• Amendments to IFRS 2, 4, 10 and 12 and IAS 7, 12, and 40;
• Annual improvements to IFRS standard 2014-2016 cycle;
• IFRIC interpretation 22.
IFRS 16 – Leases
IFRS 16 Leases was issued in early 2016. The standard specifies how 
firms will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. It presents 
a single lessee accounting model and requires that assets and 
liabilities relating to leases of greater than 12 months are recognised 
in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The standard will 
apply to reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 on its results, 
financial position and cash flows, along with any impacts of the other 
standards and amendments which have yet to be endorsed.
2. Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis. In 
considering this requirement, the Directors have taken into account 
the following:
• The Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, in 
particular the profit forecasts, regulatory capital surpluses and 
levels and sources of liquidity.
• The risks included on the Group’s risk register that could impact on 
the Group’s financial performance, levels of liquidity and solvency 
over the next 12 months.
• The risks on the Group’s risk register that could be a threat to the 
Group’s business model and capital adequacy.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report. The Strategic Report also includes the 
Group’s principal risks and uncertainties. In addition, the Governance 
report includes the Directors’ statement on the viability of the Group 
over a three year period.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
93 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Notes to the Financial Statements continued
For the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Basis of preparation continued
Following consideration of the above, the Directors have reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future, a period not less than 
12 months from the date of this report, and that it is therefore 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements. 
Further information regarding the Company’s business activities, 
together with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, is set out in the Strategic Report. Further 
information regarding the financial position of the Company, its cash 
flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are also described 
in the Strategic Report. In addition, notes 6 and 11 to the financial 
statements include the Company’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; 
details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk 
and liquidity risk.
The accounting policies set out in the notes to the financial 
statements have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently 
to all periods presented in these Group financial statements. 
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value 
through profit or loss or as available for sale. The Group and Company 
financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to 
the nearest £0.1 million.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls 
an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control, 
the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which 
control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of 
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements 
from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a 
subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing 
so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates 
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and 
various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the 
judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not 
readily apparent from other sources. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised 
in the year in which the estimate is reviewed. To the extent that a 
change in an accounting estimate gives rise to changes in assets and 
liabilities, it is recognised by adjusting the carrying amount of the 
related asset or liability in the period of the change.
Re-presentation of comparative information 
Comparative amounts within the consolidated cash flow statement 
relating to investments have been re-presented. Net cash flows 
into investments have been analysed into purchases of financial 
instruments and proceeds from financial instruments. Additionally, 
investment return and interest income on financial investments are 
now captured within the adjustments to profit after tax for non-cash 
items. There is no impact on total cash and cash equivalents or on net 
cash flow from operating activities for any period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
Judgements
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described in the notes 
to the financial statements, management has primarily applied 
judgement in the following area:
• Classification of the Group’s contracts with reinsurers as 
reinsurance contracts:
  A contract is required to transfer significant insurance risk in 
order to be classified as such. Management reviews all terms 
and conditions of each such contract, and if necessary obtains 
the opinion of an independent expert at the negotiation stage 
in order to be able to make this judgement. All reinsurance 
contracts (both excess of loss and quota share contracts) held by 
the Group have been assessed and it has been concluded that all 
contracts transfer significant insurance risk and have therefore 
been classified and accounted for as reinsurance contracts within 
these financial statements. 
In addition there are two further significant accounting estimates 
within the financial statements that also require management to 
apply judgement: 
• Calculation of insurance claims reserves:
  The Group’s reserving methodology requires management to 
set insurance claims reserves for the purpose of the financial 
statements, within a range of potential outcomes above the 
projected best estimate outcome, to allow for unforeseen 
adverse claims development. Management applies judgement 
in determining where, within this range of potential outcomes, 
the insurance claims reserves should sit. Refer to the section on 
estimation techniques below for further detail on the calculation 
of the projected best estimate outcome. 
• Recognition of deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses: 
  Management applies judgement in determining the probability 
of future taxable profits of an entity against which to utilise 
accumulated losses in determining the recognition of deferred 
tax assets. In applying this judgement, management makes 
an assessment of the reliability of approved business plan 
projections using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
including the age and status of the business, the Group’s previous 
experience in similar markets, historic performance against 
business plans and the application of a number of stress and 
sensitivity tests to the projections. 
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
94 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Estimation techniques used in calculation of claims  
provisions and profit commission
Estimation techniques are used in the calculation of the provisions 
for claims outstanding, which represent a projection of the ultimate 
cost of settling claims that have occurred prior to the balance sheet 
date and remain unsettled at the balance sheet date.
The key area where these techniques are used relates to the ultimate 
cost of reported claims. A secondary area relates to the emergence 
of claims that occurred prior to the balance sheet date, but had not 
been reported at that date.
The estimates of the ultimate cost of reported claims are based on 
the setting of claim provisions on a case-by-case basis, for all but the 
simplest of claims.
The sum of these provisions is compared with projected ultimate 
costs using a variety of different projection techniques (including 
incurred and paid chain ladder and an average cost of claim approach) 
to allow an actuarial assessment of their potential outcome. They 
include allowance for unreported claims.
The most significant sensitivity in the use of the projection techniques 
arises from any future step change in claims costs, which would cause 
future claim cost inflation to deviate from historic trends. This is most 
likely to arise from a change in the regulatory or judicial regime that 
leads to an increase in awards or legal costs for bodily injury claims that 
is significantly above or below the historical trend.
The Group’s independent actuarial advisors project best estimate 
claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques. 
As noted above, the Group’s reserving policy requires  
management to reserve within a range of potential outcomes  
above the projected best estimate outcome, to allow for 
unforeseen adverse claims development. 
For further detail on objectives, policies and procedures for 
managing insurance risk, refer to note 5 of the financial statements.
Future changes in claims reserves also impact profit commission 
income, as the measurement of this income is dependent on the 
loss ratio booked in the financial statements, and cash receivable is 
dependent on actuarial projections of ultimate loss ratios.
4. Group consolidation and operating segments
4a. Accounting policies
(i) Group consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the results and 
balances of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to 
as the Group) for the year ended 31 December 2016 and comparative 
figures for the year ended 31 December 2015. The financial 
statements of the Company’s subsidiaries are consolidated in the 
Group financial statements. The Company controls 100% of the 
voting share capital of all its principal subsidiaries, except Admiral 
Law Limited, BDE Law Limited, Inspop USA LLC, the indirect holding 
in comparenow.com Insurance Agency LLC, Rastreator.com Limited, 
the indirect holding in Comparaseguros Correduría de Seguros, S.L., 
Sociedad Unipersonal, Preminen Price Comparison Holdings Limited, 
the indirect holding in Preminen Dragon Price Comparison Limited 
and the indirect holding in Long Yu Science and Technology (Beijing) 
Co. Limited. 
The Parent Company financial statements present information 
about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group. 
In accordance with IAS 24, transactions or balances between 
Group companies that have been eliminated on consolidation are 
not reported as related party transactions in the consolidated 
financial statements.
(ii) Foreign currency translation
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, rounded to the nearest £0.1 million, which is the Group’s 
presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary items measured at cost are translated at their 
historic rate and non-monetary items held at fair value are 
translated using the foreign exchange rate on the date that  
the fair value was established.
The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional 
currency is not pounds sterling are translated into the Group 
presentation currency (sterling) as follows:
• Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet.
• Income and expenses for each income statement are translated 
at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable 
approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing 
on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are 
translated at the date of the transaction).
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and in a separate component of equity 
except to the extent that the translation differences are 
attributable to non-controlling interests.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount 
recognised in equity relating to that particular operation is 
recognised in the income statement.

4. Group consolidation and operating segments 
continued
4b. Segment reporting
The Group has four reportable segments, as described below. These 
segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly 
reported to the Group’s Board of Directors, which is considered to 
be the Group’s chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8 
Operating Segments. 
UK Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance, 
household insurance and other products that supplement the car 
insurance policy within the UK. It also includes the generation of 
revenue from additional products and fees from underwriting car 
insurance in the UK. The Directors consider the results of these 
activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried 
out in generating the revenue are not independent of each other 
and are performed as one business. This mirrors the approach taken 
in management reporting.
International Car Insurance
The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and 
the generation of revenue from additional products and fees from 
underwriting car insurance outside of the UK. It specifically covers 
the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, L’olivier 
- assurance auto in France and Elephant Auto in the US. None of 
these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the 
threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison
The segment relates to the Group’s price comparison businesses: 
Confused.com in the UK, Rastreator in Spain, LeLynx in France and 
compare.com in the US. Each of the price comparison businesses are 
operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into 
one reporting segment as Rastreator, LeLynx and compare.com do 
not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other
The ‘Other’ segment is designed to be comprised of all other 
operating segments that do not meet the threshold requirements for 
individual reporting. It includes the Group’s commercial van insurance 
broker, Gladiator, and commercial van insurance. 
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the 
corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation to the 
Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of 
Financial Position.
An analysis of the Group’s revenue and results for the year ended 
31 December 2016, by reportable segment, is shown below. The 
accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with 
those presented in the notes to the financial statements for the Group.

Segment revenues
The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders. Revenue within 
these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% or more of the Group’s total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is £20.8 million (2015: £14.2 million) which has been 
eliminated on consolidation. There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Revenues from external customers for products and services are consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown 
on page 96.
Information about geographical locations
All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country, are shown within the International Car 
Insurance reportable segment shown on the previous pages. The revenue and results of the three international Price Comparison businesses, 
Rastreator, LeLynx and compare.com are not yet material enough to be presented as a separate segment.

There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent 
assets deployed in the UK Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment 
profits. This is consistent with regular reporting to the Board of Directors.

Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
98 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 5. Premium, claims and profit commissions 
5a. Accounting policies
(i) Revenue – premiums
Premiums relating to insurance contracts are recognised as revenue, net of insurance premium tax, proportionally over the period of cover. 
Premiums with an inception date after the end of the period are held in the statement of financial position as deferred revenue. Outstanding 
collections from policyholders are recognised within policyholder receivables.
(ii) Revenue – profit commission
Under some of the co-insurance and reinsurance contracts under which premiums are shared or ceded, profit commission may be earned on a 
particular year of account, which is usually subject to performance criteria such as loss ratios and expense ratios. The commission is dependent 
on the ultimate outcome of any year, with revenue being recognised when loss and expense ratios used in the preparation of the financial 
statements move below a contractual threshold. Profit commission receivable from reinsurance contracts is accounted for in line with IFRS 4, 
whereas profit commission receivable from co-insurance contracts is in line with IAS 18.
(iii) Insurance contracts and reinsurance assets
Premiums
The proportion of premium receivable on in-force policies relating to unexpired risks is reported in insurance contract liabilities and 
reinsurance assets as the unearned premium provision – gross and reinsurers’ share respectively. 
Claims
Claims and claims handling expenses are charged as incurred, based on the estimated direct and indirect costs of settling all liabilities arising 
on events occurring up to the balance sheet date. 
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the balance 
sheet date, whether reported or not. Anticipated reinsurance recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Whilst the Directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the 
information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in 
significant adjustments to the amounts provided. 
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the income statement for the period in which the 
adjustments are made and disclosed separately if material. The methods used, and the estimates made, are reviewed regularly.
Provision for unexpired risks is made where necessary for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums (net of deferred 
acquisition costs) to meet future claims and related expenses. 
Co-insurance
The Group has entered into certain co-insurance contracts under which insurance risks are shared on a proportional basis, with the co-insurer 
taking a specific percentage of premium written and being responsible for the same proportion of each claim. The co-insurer therefore 
takes direct insurance risk from the policyholder and is subsequently directly responsible to the claimant for its proportion of the claim. 
As the contractual liability is several and not joint, neither the premiums nor claims relating to the co-insurance are included in the income 
statement. Under the terms of these agreements the co-insurers reimburse the Group for the same proportionate share of the costs of 
acquiring and administering the business.
Reinsurance assets
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on the insurance contracts issued by the 
Group are classified as reinsurance contracts. A contract is only accounted for as a reinsurance contract where there is significant insurance 
risk transfer between the insured and the insurer. 
Reinsurance assets are comprised of balances due from reinsurance companies for ceded insurance liabilities. Amounts recoverable from 
reinsurers are estimated in a consistent manner with the outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies 
and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract. 
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on a regular basis, and in detail every six months. If there is objective evidence that 
the asset is impaired, then the carrying value will be written down to its recoverable amount.
On the commutation of reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer is discharged from all obligations relating to the contract. Reinsurance assets and 
liabilities relating to the commuted contracts are settled in the period in which the commutation agreement is signed.

(i) Objectives, policies and procedures for the management of insurance risk
The Group’s primary business is the issuance of insurance contracts that transfer risk from policyholders to the Group and its co-
insurance partners. 
Insurance risk involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued. It is primarily 
comprised of Reserve risk; the risk that the value of insurance liabilities established is insufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims incurred 
at the balance sheet date, and Premium risk; the risk that the claims experience on business written but not earned is higher than allowed for 
in the premiums charged to policyholders. 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 6, it has delegated the detailed 
oversight of risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
100 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The Group also has a Reserving Committee which comprises senior managers within the finance, claims, pricing and actuarial functions. The 
Reserving Committee primarily recommends the approach for UK Car Insurance reserving but also reviews the systems and controls in place 
to support accurate reserving and material reserving issues such as Periodic Payment Order (PPO) and claims inflation, which represent the 
key uncertainties in the amount or timing of claims settlements. 
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted by the Group. These include pricing 
policies and claims management and administration processes, in addition to reserving policies and co- and reinsurance arrangements as 
detailed below.
Reserve Risk
Reserving risk is mitigated through a series of processes and controls. The key processes are as follows:
• Regular management and internal actuarial review of individual and aggregate case claim reserves, including regular reporting of 
management information and exception reporting of significant movements;
• Regular management and internal actuarial review of large claims, including claims settled or potentially settled by PPOs for which the 
uncertainty is increased by factors such as the lifetime of the claimant and movements in the indexation for the cost of future care of 
the claimant;
• Bi-annual external actuarial review of best estimate claims reserves using a variety of recognised actuarial techniques;
• Internal actuarial analysis of reserve uncertainty through qualitative analysis, scenario testing and a range of stochastic reserving techniques;
• Ad hoc external reviews of reserving related processes and assumptions;
• Use of a reserving methodology which informs management’s reserving decisions for the purposes of the Group’s financial statements.  
As described in note 3, critical accounting judgements and estimates, the methodology determines that reserves should be set within a 
range above projected best estimate outcomes to allow for unforeseen adverse claims development.
As noted in the Strategic Report, the Group shares a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated with external 
underwriters. In 2016, 40% of the UK car insurance risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk is borne by the 
co-insurer. A further 35% of the UK risk was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts. Co-insurance and reinsurance contracts are also 
used in the International Car Insurance businesses. Further detail can be found in the Strategic Report.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large 
individual claims and catastrophe losses.
Premium Risk
As noted above, the Group defines Premium risk as the risk that claims cost on business written but not yet earned is higher than allowed for in 
the premiums charged to policyholders. This also includes catastrophe risk; the risk of incurring significant losses as a result of the occurrence 
of manmade catastrophe or natural weather events. 
Key processes and controls operating to mitigate premium risk are as follows:
• Experienced and focused senior management and teams in relevant business areas including pricing and claims management;
• A data-driven and analytical approach to regular monitoring of claims and underwriting performance;
• Capability to identify and resolve underperformance promptly through changes to key performance drivers, in particular pricing. 
In addition, as mentioned above, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect the Group against very large individual 
claims and catastrophe losses. 
Other elements of insurance risk include reinsurance risk; the risk of placement of ineffective reinsurance arrangements, or the economic risk 
of reduced availability of co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements in future periods. 
The Group mitigates these risks by ensuring that it has a diverse range of financially secure reinsurance partners, including a long term 
relationship with Munich Re and a number of other high profile reinsurers. 
Concentration of insurance risk
The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk. This is because, although the Group has historically 
written only one significant line of UK insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wide regional base. 
The introduction of the international car insurance businesses in recent years and the launch of UK household business in 2012 will further 
contribute to the diversification of the Group’s insurance risk as these businesses grow.

(ii) Event after the reporting period – Ogden discount rate change
On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor announced a change in the Ogden discount rate, which is used in the calculation of personal injury 
claims compensation in the UK. The change reduced the discount rate from 2.5% to minus 0.75%. This change has been reflected in the gross 
and reinsurers' share of insurance liabilities reported in these financial statements. Refer to the following section for sensitivities in this 
key assumption. 
(iii) Sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in assumptions
Ogden discount rate
As noted above, the gross and reinsurers share of insurance liabilities in these financial statements are prepared on the basis of an Ogden 
discount rate of minus 0.75%. On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor also announced a consultation that considers options for reform 
 in the setting of this rate, resulting in potential for further changes in the rate. 
The sensitivity of a change in this assumption by 75 basis points (both an increase and decrease) is shown in the table below. The impact is 
presented is the total impact of the change on the Group’s pre-tax profit on an ultimate basis. It should be noted that not all of the ultimate 
impact would necessarily be recognised immediately.

Impact of increase in assumed Ogden discount rate of 75 basis points (to 0%) 125.7 68.7
Impact of decrease in assumed Ogden discount rate of 75 basis points (to minus 1.5%) (198.1) (102.1)
The net impacts are stated net of co-insurance and reinsurance and include the impact on net insurance claims along with the associated 
profit commission movements that result from the change in the Ogden rate. 
Underwriting year loss ratios – UK Car Insurance
In addition to the sensitivity above, the following table sets out the impact on equity and post-tax profit or loss at 31 December 2016 that 
would result from a 1% movement (both increase and decrease) in the UK Car insurance loss ratios used for each underwriting year for which 
material amounts remain outstanding.

Booked loss ratio 70% 84% 87% 88%
Impact of 1% change (£m) 11.4 6.8 3.0 1.8
As above, the impact is stated net of reinsurance and includes the change in net insurance claims along with the associated profit commission 
movements that result from changes in loss ratios. The figures are stated net of tax at the current rate.

(i) Investment income and finance costs
Investment income from financial assets comprises distributions as well as net realised and unrealised gains on financial assets classified as 
‘fair value through profit or loss’ (FVTPL), interest income and net realised gains from assets classified as ‘available for sale’ (AFS), and interest 
income on holdings in term deposits and gilts.
Finance costs from financial liabilities comprise interest expense on subordinated notes, calculated on the effective interest rate method.  
The effective interest rate method calculates the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability (or group of financial assets or financial 
liabilities) and allocates the interest income or expense over the expected life of the asset or liability.
(ii) Financial assets – investments and receivables

Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at FVTPL, AFS assets, loans and receivables or held to 
maturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they were acquired. 
The Group’s investments in money market liquidity funds are designated as FVTPL at inception. 
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group of assets and internal 
performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis. 
The Group’s holdings in Fixed Income and Asset Backed Securities are classified as AFS investments, which is consistent with the intention for 
which they were purchased. 
The Group’s deposits with credit institutions and gilts are classified as held to maturity investments, which is consistent with the intention for 
which they were purchased.
Transaction costs associated with the purchase of all financial assets are expensed within the income statement as incurred.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant realised or unrealised gain or loss recognised through the income statement.
AFS fixed income and asset backed securities are stated at fair value. Unrealised changes in the fair value of these assets are recognised in Other 
Comprehensive Income (OCI). Interest income on debt securities is recognised within profit or loss using the effective interest rate method. 
Deposits and gilts with fixed maturities, classified as held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement, as are any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method. Impairment losses are 
recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held at fair value or amortised 
cost are impaired. Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of 
the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset. 
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer  
or counterparty. 
Identified impairments of financial assets are recognised in the income statement, except in the case of assets classified as AFS where 
unrealised gains have been recognised through OCI. In this instance, impairments of the asset are first set against the unrealised gain in OCI 
with any excess being recognised in the income statement. 
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
108 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 De-recognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired, or when the Group transfers the asset  
and all the attached substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset to a third party.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term deposits with original maturities of 
three months or less. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. 
(iii) Financial liabilities
Initial recognition
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes and other financial liabilities initially recognised at fair value received, net of 
transaction costs incurred. 
Subsequent measurement
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through 
the income statement.
De-recognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under that liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(iv) Fair value measurement of assets held at amortised cost
The fair value of gilts and subordinated notes held at amortised cost is calculated with reference to quoted market valuations. See note 6d for 
a comparison of fair value and carrying value at the statement of financial position date.
The Group’s deposits are held with well rated institutions; as such the fair value approximates to the book value of the investment based on 
the interest rates of the instruments, credit risk movements and durations of the assets. The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is 
a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The notes are unsecured subordinated obligations of the Group and rank pari passu without any preference among themselves. In the event  
of a winding-up or bankruptcy, they are to be repaid only after the claims of all other creditors have been met.
There have been no defaults on any of the notes during the year. The Group has the option to defer interest payments on the notes but to date 
has not exercised this right. The aggregate fair value of subordinated dated notes at the balance sheet date is disclosed in the table below.
The Group holds a revolving credit facility of £100 million which expires in July 2018. As at 31 December 2016, £20 million was drawn under  
this agreement and is included as other borrowings in the table above. 
 
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
110 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Fair value measurement
The measurement of investments at the end of the period, for investments held at fair value and short term debt securities held at fair value, 
is based on active quoted market values (level one). 
The measurement of AFS debt securities at the end of the period is also based on active quoted market values (level one). 
The deposits are held with well rated institutions; as such the approximate fair value is the book value of the investment as impairment of the 
capital is not expected. There is no quoted market for these holdings and as such a level two valuation is used. The book value of term deposits 
is £170.0 million (2015: £267.6 million).
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair values of gilts and subordinated notes

Objectives, policies and procedures for managing financial assets and liabilities
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to financial risks of credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board 
of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control to the Group Risk Committee. There is also an 
Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Group’s investment strategy. 
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group. These are detailed in full in the Corporate 
Governance Statement. Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below. 
Credit risk
The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations. The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the 
Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables. 
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail. 
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Group’s risk 
appetite and, during 2016 and historically, no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure of the liquidity funds and 
the parameters set for managing the Fixed Income Mandates. Both forms of investment hold a wide range of very short duration, high quality 
securities. Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions. The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the 
Investment Committee. 
To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers (in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions), the Group only 
conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength ratings. In addition, many reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds 
withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group withholds the cash received as collateral.
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
112 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential for default by instalment 
payers. The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level of balance recoverable. There is also mitigation by 
the operation of numerous high- and low-level controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and 
automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2016 is £3,263.0 million (2015: £2,913.3 million), being the carrying value of 
financial investments and cash, and the excess of reinsurance assets over amounts owed to reinsurers under funds withheld arrangements. 
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure. The amount of bad debt expense relating to 
policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2016 and 2015 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2016 or 2015.
The Group’s credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows:
Rating
31 December 2016 
£m
31 December 2015 
£m
Financial institutions – Credit institutions AAA 269.3 247.8
Financial institutions – Credit institutions AA 733.8 679.4
Financial institutions – Credit institutions A 1,305.6 1,230.3
Financial institutions – Credit institutions BBB and below 236.0 234.0
UK Government gilts AA 197.4 198.2
Reinsurers AA 277.1 266.8
Reinsurers A 29.1 9.2
Interest rate risk 
The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital 
values of financial assets and liabilities. 
As noted above, the Group invests the following asset types:
• Money market liquidity funds and cash plus liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of short dated fixed and variable rate securities, 
such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper. 
• Term deposits with well rated institutions are short in duration (one to five years). These are classified as term and valued at amortised cost. 
Therefore neither the carrying value of the asset, nor the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
• Available for sale debt securities. These securities are held within two segregated mandates. The guidelines of the investments retain a 
similar credit quality of the money market funds (all holdings are investment grade). The duration of the securities is relatively short and 
similar to the duration of the on book claims liabilities (the average duration is three years).
• UK Government gilts. These are classified as term and valued at amortised cost. Therefore neither the capital value of the gilts, nor the 
interest return, will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group also holds a financial liability in the form of £200 million of subordinated notes with a ten year maturity and fixed rate coupon 
of 5.5%. This liability is valued at amortised cost and therefore neither the carrying value of the deposits, nor the interest payable, will be 
impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available financial resources to enable it to meet its obligations  
as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. 
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity. Further, as noted above, 
a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion 
of the Group cash and investments is immediately available. 
A breakdown of the Group’s other financial liabilities, trade payables and other payables is shown in note 10. 
The subordinated notes have a ten year maturity whereas all trade and other payables will mature within three to six months of the balance 
sheet date. (Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.)
In practice, the Group’s Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers 
and reinsurers. Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of £938.0 million (2015: £764.7 million), £610.1 million (2015: £554.3 
million) is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected to be settled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 5. The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of 
this note. 
The Group’s Directors believe that the cash flows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile. Liquidity risk is not, therefore, 
considered to be significant.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact the valuation of overseas 
assets and liabilities. 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its operations overseas. Although the relative size of the international operations 
means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses. Assets  
held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities; however, surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign 
currencies remain exposed. 
The Group’s exposure to net assets and profits in currencies other than the reporting currency is immaterial other than for US dollars. 
The Group’s exposure to net assets held in dollars at the balance sheet date was £70.5 million (2015: £87.3 million). 
The loss before tax derived from business carried out in the US was £39.1 million (2015: £45.9 million). If the Sterling rates with US dollars  
had strengthened/weakened by 10%, the Group’s profit before tax for the year would increase/decrease by £3.6 million (2015: £4.2 million). 
Fair value
For cash at bank and cash deposits and other receivables, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity. For assets 
held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level one (quoted prices in active markets) of the fair value hierarchy. 
For gilts and subordinated notes, the fair value is calculated with reference to the quoted market valuation. This is compared to carrying value 
earlier in this note.

Contribution from additional products and fees and Other Revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of products supplementing the core 
motor insurance policy, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments  
and vehicle commission charges paid by co- and reinsurers. Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the  
Group’s obligations to provide services. Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.  
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and broking commission earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying 
insurance policy.

8. Expenses
8a. Accounting policies
(i) Acquisition costs and operating expenses
Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over the period in which those 
premiums are earned. All other operating expenses are charged to the income statement in the period that they are incurred. 
(ii) Employee benefits
Pensions
The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees. The contributions payable to these schemes are 
charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of equity and cash settled compensation schemes for its employees. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the equity settled schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in 
equity. For cash settled schemes, the fair value of services received are also recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liability. 
For equity settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares 
granted as determined at the grant date (excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions). Non-market conditions such as profitability 
targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number of free shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
For cash settled schemes, the total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the closing Admiral Group share 
price at the end of the period. Prior to the vesting of each scheme, the closing share price at the end of the reporting period is used as an 
approximation for the closing share price at the end of the vesting period. As with equity settled schemes, non-market vesting conditions also 
impact on the total charge expensed over the vesting period. 
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the 
assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 8f for further details on share schemes.

Operating leases
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased items are classified as 
operating leases. The Group has entered into a number of non-cancellable operating lease arrangements for properties and other assets. The 
leases have varying terms, escalation values and renewal rights.
Operating lease payments, including the effects of any lease incentives, are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

reported in note 8c (2016: £50.3 million; 2015: £43.8 million) and the gross credit to reserves reported in the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity (2016: £33.2 million; 2015: £29.5 million).
The Consolidated Cash Flow Statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between ‘profit after tax’ and ‘cash flows from 
operating activities’. The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade and other payables line. 
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
118 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (i) The Approved Share Incentive Plan (the SIP)
Eligible employees qualified for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period. The maximum award 
for each year is £3,600 per employee. The awards are made with reference to the Group’s performance against prior year profit before tax. 
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period (three years from the date of award) otherwise the shares are forfeited. 
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing 
up the financial statements for awards not yet made (and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date). Awards under the 
SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and, hence, no adjustment has been made to this fair value. 
(ii) The Discretionary Free Share Scheme (the DFSS)
Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, individuals receive 
an award of free shares at no charge. Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares. The maximum number 
of shares that can vest relating to the 2016 scheme is 3,247,136 (2015 scheme: 3,019,188). 
The amount of 2016 award that actually vests is based on the growth in the Company’s earnings per share (EPS) relative to a risk free return 
(RFR), for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark. This performance is measured over the three year period the award applies to. For 
the 2016 scheme, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions. 
The range of awards is as follows:
• If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest.
• EPS growth is equal to RFR – 10% of maximum award vests.
• To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
For awards in 2015 and onwards there are now three performance conditions which the 50% not guaranteed to vest are subject to. These are 
three-year EPS growth vs. LIBOR, TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies), and ROE, weighted equally. 
Performance measure
Performance range
Threshold Maximum
EPS growth vs. LIBOR Growth in line with LIBOR Growth of 10% p.a. in excess of LIBOR
TSR vs. FTSE 350 (excluding investment companies) Median Upper Quartile
ROE 25% 55%
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends (although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would 
have been paid on the respective shareholding) and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised 
downwards to take account of these distributions. The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were 
made (as stated in the Directors’ Remuneration Report).

9. Taxation
9a. Accounting policy
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. 
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods. 
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the 
income statement.
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
120 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is calculated at the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or 
the asset is realised.
The principal temporary differences arise from carried forward losses, depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges. 
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of 
tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge. Any excess is recognised 
directly in equity.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward losses are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which the assets can be utilised. The probability of the availability of future taxable profits is determined by a combination 
of the classification of the status of the businesses holding cumulative tax losses and the business plan profit projections for that business, 
subject to appropriate stress testing.

Positive amounts presented above relate to a deferred tax asset position. 
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% on 1 April 2015. The average effective rate of tax for 2016 is 20.00% (2015: 20.25%). 
Further reductions to the main rate of corporation tax to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) and 17% (effective from 1 April 2020) were enacted 
on 26 October 2015 and 15 September 2016 respectively. This will reduce the Group’s future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2016 has been calculated based on the rate at which each timing difference is most likely to reverse.
The deferred tax asset relating to carried forward losses of £4.9 million relates to losses incurred in the Group’s US price comparison business 
compare.com, and is calculated at the local US rate of tax (35%). The recognised asset has been limited to the amount supported by forecast 
cash flows over the next five years. The forecasts and underlying assumptions have been reviewed and approved by the Board. In addition,  
the forecasts have been stressed for both revenue and profit reductions and the asset remains recoverable under the stressed scenarios.
At 31 December 2016 the Group had unused tax losses amounting to £142.7 million (2015: £89.6 million), relating to the Group’s US businesses 
Elephant Auto and compare.com, for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
10. Other assets and other liabilities
10a. Accounting policy
(i) Property and equipment, and depreciation
All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to  
write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives. These useful economic lives are as follows:
Improvements to short leasehold buildings – four to ten years 
Computer equipment – two to four years 
Office equipment – four years 
Furniture and fittings – four years 
Motor vehicles – four years
(ii) Impairment of property and equipment
In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any 
indications of impairment. If any such indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. 
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are recognised 
through the income statement.
Financial Statements: Notes to the Financial Statements
122 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 (iii) Leased assets
The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease. 
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classed as finance leases. 
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same 
manner as equivalent owned assets. Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors and the finance costs are spread 
over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
(iv) Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and 
represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. 
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing the 
Group’s opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 (First time adoption). In respect of acquisitions 
prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under 
UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date. On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs) according to business 
segment and is reviewed annually for impairment. 
The goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2016 is allocated solely to the UK Insurance segment.
Impairment of goodwill
The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount (by allocating the goodwill to 
CGUs) and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower. Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement 
and are not subsequently reversed. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period. Cash 
flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation. The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections in the value in 
use calculations is 6.5% (2015: 5.9%), based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, which is in line with the market (source: Bloomberg).
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses 
incurred during the period. Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes 
in the market. 
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs
Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs 
represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that correspond to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.  
This balance is held as an intangible asset. It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned. 
Software
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life (generally the licence term). Internally 
generated software is recognised as an intangible asset, with directly attributable costs incurred in the development stage capitalised. The 
internally generated software assets are amortised over the expected useful life of the systems and amortisation commences when the 
software is available for use.
The carrying value of software is reviewed every six months for evidence of impairment, with the value being written down if any impairment 
exists. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.
(v) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation arises as a result of an event that occurred before the balance sheet date, 
when a cash-outflow relating to this obligation is probable and when the amount can be estimated reliably. 
Where an obligation exists, but the likelihood of a cash out-flow or the amount is uncertain, or where there is a possible obligation arising  
from a past event that is contingent on a future event, a contingent liability is disclosed. 
Contingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-
occurrence of future events. Where it is probable that a cash-inflow will arise from a contingent asset, this is disclosed.

Goodwill relates to the acquisition of Group subsidiary EUI Limited (formerly Admiral Insurance Services Limited) in November 1999. It is 
allocated solely to the UK Insurance segment. As described in the accounting policies, the amortisation of this asset ceased on transition 
to IFRS on 1 January 2004. All annual impairment reviews since the transition date have indicated that the estimated recoverable value of 
the asset is greater than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment losses have been recognised. Refer to the accounting policy for 
goodwill for further information.

11e. Objectives, policies and procedures for managing capital
The Group manages its capital to ensure that all entities within the Group are able to continue as going concerns and also to ensure that 
regulated entities meet regulatory requirements with an appropriate margin. Excess capital above these levels within subsidiaries is paid up to 
the Group holding company in the form of dividends on a regular basis. 
The Group’s dividend policy is to make distributions after taking into account capital that is required to be held a) for regulatory purposes; b) 
to fund expansion activities; and c) as a further buffer against unforeseen events. This policy gives the Directors flexibility in managing the 
Group’s capital.
The Group’s regulatory capital requirements are discussed in the Group Financial Review within the Strategic Report.

*3
20.8 14.2
Total turnover 2,575.8 2,118.8
*1  During 2012 Admiral ceased earning Other Revenue from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies. At the same point, the Group began charging its panel of 
co- and reinsurers a vehicle commission. The substance of these changes meant that the total premiums written increased by the amount of revenue that was previously 
earned from the sale of non-optional legal protection policies. The vehicle commission included within Other Revenue is therefore eliminated from the turnover measure 
to avoid double counting.
*2 Other reconciling items represent co-insurer and reinsurer shares of Other Revenue in the Group’s International Car Insurance businesses.
*3 Intra-group income elimination relates to price comparison income earned in the Group from other Group companies.

Financial Statements Additional Information Corporate Governance Strategic Report Introduction
135 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016 1. Accounting policies
1.1 Basis of preparation
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). 
The amendments to FRS 101 (2015/16 Cycle) issued in June 2016 and effective immediately have been applied. The financial statements are 
prepared on the historical cost basis except for the revaluation of financial assets classified as fair value through profit or loss. 
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with 
Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.
1.2 Disclosure exemptions applied under FRS 101
The Company has taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions under FRS 101:
• FRS 101.8 (d): the requirement of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure to make disclosures about financial instruments
• FRS 101.8 (f): the requirement in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements to present comparative information in respect of:
 – paragraph 118(3) of IAS 38 Intangible Assets
• FRS 101.8 (g): the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D and 111 of IAS 1 Presentation of 
Financial Statements to produce a cash flow statement, a third balance sheet and to make an explicit and unreserved statement of 
compliance with IFRSs
• FRS 101.8 (h): the requirements of IAS 7 Statements of Cash Flows to produce a cash flow statement
• FRS 101.8 (i): the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to  
include a list of new IFRSs that have been issued but that have yet to be applied
• FRS 101.8 (k): the requirements in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures to disclose related party transactions entered into between  
two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to transaction is wholly owned by such a member
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these  
financial statements.
1.3 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this assumption, the Board have 
reviewed the Company's projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital surpluses. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual financial statements.
1.4 Critical accounting judgements 
In applying the Group’s accounting policies as described below management has primarily applied judgement in the impairment testing of 
the Company’s investment in group undertakings. Management has applied judgement in determining whether the carrying value of the 
investment, or asset may be supported by the recoverable amount calculation based on the ‘value in use’ of the asset (the net present value of 
future cash-flows arising from the asset). 
In calculating the net present value of future cash-flows, management has made assumptions over the timing and amount of underlying profit 
projections of the relevant undertakings, long term growth rates in those projections and the discount rate applied to those projections that 
is appropriate to reflect the market’s view of the risk of the relevant investment. 
Notes to Parent Company Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016
136 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Financial Statements: Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1.5 Shares in Group Undertakings
Shares in Group undertakings are valued at cost less any provision for impairment in value.
The requirements of IAS 36 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 
Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its 
carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is 
recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
1.6 Employee share schemes
The Company operates a number of share schemes for its employees. For equity settled schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the 
fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an increase in equity 
in the Company.
1.7 Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable. They are regarded as recoverable to the extent that, 
on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the 
future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
1.8 Financial assets and liabilities
All investments held at fair value at the end of the period are invested in AAA-rated money market liquidity funds. The measurement of  
these investments is based on active quoted market values (level 1).
Investments classified as held to maturity are comprised of UK government gilts, and are held in the Statement of Financial Position at 
amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost. 
The Company’s financial liabilities comprise subordinated notes which are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method and a 
credit facility held at amortised cost.

6. Continued application of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 – Reduced Disclosure Framework
Following the first time application of FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework in 2015, the Board considers that it is in the best interests 
of the Group for Admiral Group plc to continue to apply the FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework in future periods. A shareholder or 
shareholders holding in aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in Admiral Group plc may serve objections to the use of the 
disclosure exemptions on Admiral Group plc, in writing, to its registered office (Tŷ Admiral, David Street, Cardiff CF10 2EH) no later than  
30 June 2017.

Consolidated Financial Summary
140 Admiral Group plc · Annual Report and Accounts 2016
Additional Information: Consolidated Financial Summary Alternative Performance Measures
Throughout this report, the Group uses a number of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs); measures that are not required or commonly 
reported under International Financial Reporting Standards, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under which the Group 
prepares its financial statements. 
These APMs are used by the Group, alongside GAAP measures, for both internal performance analysis and to help shareholders and other users 
of the Annual Report and financial statements to better understand the Group’s performance in the period in comparison to previous periods 
and the Group’s competitors. 
The table below defines and explains the primary APMs used in this report. Financial APMs are usually derived from financial statement items 
and are calculated using consistent accounting policies to those applied in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated. Non financial 
KPIs incorporate information that cannot be derived from the financial statements but provide further insight into the performance and 
financial position of the Group. 
APMs may not necessarily be defined in a consistent manner to similar APMs used by the Group’s competitors. They should be considered as a 
supplement rather than a substitute for GAAP measures. 
Turnover Turnover is defined as total premiums written (as below) and other revenue. It is reconciled to financial statement line 
items in note 12a to the financial statements.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It reflects 
the size of the revenue generated by the Group and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of the 
growth in this revenue. 
The measure was developed as a result of the Group’s business model. The core UK Car insurance business has 
historically shared a significant proportion of the risks with Munich Re, a third party insurance Group, through a co-
insurance arrangement, with the arrangement subsequently being replicated in some of the Group’s international 
insurance operations. Premiums and claims accruing to the external co-insurer are not reflected in the Group’s income 
statement and therefore presentation of this metric enables users of the Annual Report to see the scale of the Group’s 
insurance operations in a way not possible from taking the income statement in isolation.
Total Premiums 
Written
Total premiums written are the premiums written within the Group, including co-insurance. It is reconciled to financial 
statement line items in note 12a to the financial statements.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It reflects 
the total premiums written by the Group’s insurance intermediaries and analysis of this measure over time provides a 
clear indication of the growth in premiums, irrespective of how co-insurance agreements have changed over time. 
The reasons for presenting this measure are consistent with that for the Turnover APM noted above.
Group’s share of  
Profit before tax
Group’s share of profit before tax represents profit before tax, excluding the impact of Non-controlling Interests. It is 
reconciled to statutory profit before tax in note 12d to the financial statements.
This measure is useful in presenting the limit of the Group’s exposure to the expenditure incurred in starting up new 
businesses and demonstrates the ‘test-and-learn’ strategy employed by the Group to expansion into new territories.
In 2016, Group’s share of Profit before Tax is presented on a ‘Pre Ogden’ and a ‘Post Ogden basis. ‘Pre Ogden’ represents 
the Group’s share of profit before tax before the impact of the reduction in the UK Ogden discount rate confirmed by 
the Lord Chancellor in February 2017.
Underwriting result 
(profit or loss)
For each insurance business an underwriting result is presented showing the segment result prior to the inclusion of 
profit commission, other income contribution and instalment income. It demonstrates the insurance result, i.e. premium 
revenue and investment income less claims incurred and insurance expenses.

Alternative Performance Measures continued
Loss Ratio Reported loss ratios are expressed as a percentage of claims incurred divided by net earned premiums. 
There are a number of instances within the Annual Report where adjustments are made to this calculation in order  
to more clearly present the underlying performance of the Group and operating segments within the Group.  
The calculations of these are presented within note 12b to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor loss ratio: Within the UK insurance segment we separately present motor ratios, i.e. excluding the 
underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to i) exclude the 
impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts and ii) exclude claims handling costs that are reported 
within claims costs in the income statement. 
International insurance loss ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance loss ratios presented 
exclude the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to 
exclude the claims element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of reinsurer claims 
costs would distort the underlying performance of the business.
Group loss ratios: Group loss ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted above. 
Adjustments are made to i) exclude the impact of reserve releases on commuted reinsurance contracts, ii) exclude 
claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and iii) exclude the claims element 
of the impact of international reinsurer caps.
Expense Ratio Reported expense ratios are expressed as a percentage of net operating expenses divided by net earned premiums. 
There are a number of instances within the Annual Report where adjustments are made to this calculation in order 
to more clearly present the underlying performance of the Group and operating segments within the Group. The 
calculations of these are presented within note 12c to the accounts and explanation is as follows.
UK reported motor expense ratio: Within the UK insurance segment we separately present motor ratios, i.e. excluding 
the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is adjusted to i) include 
claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income statement and ii) include intra-group 
aggregator fees charged by the UK price comparison business to the UK insurance business.
International insurance expense ratio: As for the UK motor loss ratio, the international insurance expense ratios 
presented exclude the underwriting of other products that supplement the car insurance policy. The motor ratio is 
adjusted to i) exclude the expense element of the impact of reinsurer caps as inclusion of the impact of the capping of 
reinsurer expenses would distort the underlying performance of the business and ii) include intra-group aggregator fees 
charged by the overseas price comparison businesses to the international insurance businesses.
Group expense ratios: Group expense ratios are reported on a consistent basis as the UK and international ratios noted 
above. Adjustments are made to i) include claims handling costs that are reported within claims costs in the income 
statement, ii) include intra-group aggregator fees charged by the Group’s price comparison businesses to the Group’s 
insurance businesses and iii) exclude the expense element of the impact of international reinsurer caps.
Combined Ratio Reported combined ratios are the sum of the loss and expense ratios as defined above. Explanation of these figures is 
noted above and reconciliation of the calculations are provided in notes 12b and 12c.
Return on Equity Return on equity is calculated as profit before tax for the period attributable to equity holders of the Group divided by 
the average total equity attributable to equity holders of the Group in the year. This average is determined by dividing 
the opening and closing positions for the year by two.
The relevant figures for this calculation can be found within the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Group Customers Group customer numbers are the total number of car, household and van policyholders within the Group.
This measure has been presented by the Group in every Annual Report since it became a listed Group in 2004. It 
reflects the size of the Group’s customer base and analysis of this measure over time provides a clear indication of 
the growth. It is also a useful indicator of the growing significance to the Group of the different lines of business and 
geographic regions. 
Effective Tax Rate Effective tax rate is defined as the approximate tax rate derived from dividing the Group’s profit before tax by the tax 
charge going through the income statement. It is a measure historically presented by the Group and enables users to 
see how the tax cost incurred by the Group compares over time and to current corporation tax rates.

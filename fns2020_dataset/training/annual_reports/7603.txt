Hunting PLC is an international 
energy services provider that 
manufactures and distributes 
products that enable the 
extraction of oil and gas for  
the world’s leading companies.
o ur business is made up of three key divisions:
provision of products and services 
to operators in the drilling phase  
of exploration and production 
programmes. t ypically the Company 
provides casing and o il Country 
t ubular Goods (“o Ct G”) in the 
construction of the wellbore in an 
oil and gas well; in-house design 
(Seal-l ock ™) and threading of 
premium connections are well 
suited to the deeper and more 
challenging offshore environments 
as well as onshore shale plays.
t he acquisition of innova-extel adds a 
significant electronic capability to our 
core mechanical competence.
t he Company is also an innovator in 
the design, manufacture and leasing 
of mud motors and associated 
drilling tools such as non-magnetic 
collars, which improve drilling time 
in certain geological conditions.  
t he a nnular pressure r elease 
System (“apr S”) adds significant 
value to the customer.
w ell Construction
Global manufacturing of accessories 
and completion equipment for the 
world’s principle producing regions. 
providing products, proprietary 
technologies, engineering expertise 
and services below the wellhead.
o Ct G supply, advanced 
manufacturing techniques, high 
specification casing and premium 
connections for global markets and 
two-step tubing for the u S. Speciality 
threading, oem manufacturing and 
proprietary downhole tools used by 
the upstream oil and gas companies. 
Clear-r un™ technology provides a 
significant advantage in performance 
for running tubing in zero emission 
environments.
w ell Completion
equipment manufacturing, supply 
and service for the maintenance  
and restoration of producing oil and 
gas wells. t he growth of this division 
by organic means and through 
acquisition has allowed for the 
integration of an extensive range  
of pressure control equipment 
technologies, wireline and slickline 
tools, together with intervention 
expertise into the Hunting portfolio.
t he capability has recently been 
strengthened further by the 
acquisition of n ational Coupling 
Company, a leader in subsea 
systems for Chemical injection, 
hydraulic valves, couplings and 
associated equipment. t his was 
further enhanced by the acquisition 
of w elltonic in December 2009 to 
form the Hunting w elltonic group  
of companies. Hunting w elltonic  
is widely regarded as one of  
the leading t hru-t ubing service 
providers at the forefront of 
supplying downhole tools to coiled 
tubing operations worldwide.

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chairman’s Statement
Our	 Well	 Intervention	 operations	
also	 had	 fine	 results,	 with	 National	
Coupling	 and	 Welltonic,	 both	 of	
them	 recent	 acquisitions,	 making	
excellent	 contributions.
Outside	 the	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services	
portfolio,	 Field	 Aviation	 and	 Gibson	
Shipbrokers	 –	 world	 leaders	 in	 their	
own	 fields	 –	 had	 profitable	 years	 in	
what	 are	 unpredictable	 markets.
The	 very	 significant	 capital	
investments	 made	 in	 the	 past	 two	
years	 are	 already	 bearing	 fruit,	 and	
we	 continue	 to	 add	 facilities	 in	 new	
and	 expanding	 markets	 such	 as	 the	
North	 Sea	 tubulars	 management	
segment	 and	 in	 China.
Earnings	 per	 share	 for	 continuing	
operations,	 before	 exceptional	 items,	
were	 24.7p,	 representing	 an	 increase	
of	 40%	 on	 the	 previous	 year.	 We	 are	
recommending	 a	 final	 dividend	 for	
2010	 of	 8.3p	 per	 share,	 payable	 on	
1 July	 2011	 to	 shareholders	 on	 the	
register	 on	 10 June	 2011,	 giving	 a	
total	 of	 12.0p	 for	 the	 year,	 a	 14%	
increase.
During	 the	 year,	 Iain	 Paterson,	 	
a	 non-executive	 Director	 of	 the	
Company	 since	 2000,	 retired.	 The	
Board	 thanks	 him	 for	 all	 his	 fine	 work	
Our	 year	 was	 in	 some	 respects	
overshadowed	 by	 the	 tragic	 blowout	
in	 the	 Gulf	 of	 Mexico,	 with	
consequences	 for	 the	 Group.	 On	 the	
negative	 side,	 a	 moratorium	 on	 deep	
water	 drilling	 in	 US	 waters	 affected	
our	 market	 in	 that	 area.	 On	 a	 positive	
note,	 it	 will	 become	 more	 important	
than	 ever	 that	 deep	 water	 wells	 are	
fully	 specified	 with	 high	 quality	
equipment	 –	 precisely	 the	 market	 we	
serve.
We	 have	 designed,	 developed	 and	
patented	 important	 new	 tubular	
connection	 products	 which	 are	
ideally	 suited	 to	 horizontal	 drilling	
and	 to	 exploitation	 of	 shale	 plays	 –	
enhancing	 still	 further	 our	 premium	
connector	 ranges.
The	 Well	 Construction	 activity	 of	 our	
principal	 operating	 company,	 Hunting	
Energy	 Services,	 recovered	 strongly	
from	 a	 difficult	 2009,	 aided	 by	 fine	
performances	 from	 our	 US	 shale	 gas	
operations	 and	 by	 an	 excellent	 start	 in	
our	 hands	 by	 Innova,	 the	 downhole	
electronics	 company	 acquired	 in	
September	 2010.
In	 the	 largest	 market	 segment,	 Well	
Completion	 activities	 once	 again	
performed	 very	 well	 with	 good	
results	 from	 all	 geographical	 areas.
The	 Group	 has	 produced	 excellent	
results	 in	 the	 year	 showing	 strong	
recovery	 from	 the	 challenges	 of	
2009.	 Profit	 before	 taxation	 from	
continuing	 operations	 and	 before	
exceptional	 items	 in	 2010	 was	
£50.0m	 (2009	 –	 £38.5m),	 a	 30%	
increase.
A	 robust	 balance	 sheet	 has	 allowed	
us	 to	 make	 the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
the	 Group’s	 history	 and	 to	 expend	
capital	 in	 both	 existing	 and	 new	
geographical	 areas.	 We	 will	 continue	
to	 seek	 compatible	 opportunities	 for	
further	 expansion.
The	 worldwide	 patterns	 of	
hydrocarbon	 pricing	 and	 production	
identified	 last	 year	 have	 been	
maintained.	 Strong	 crude	 oil	 prices	
have	 led	 to	 a	 boom	 in	 drilling	 for	 that	
commodity,	 while	 historically	 low	
prices	 have	 not	 prevented	 a	 rush	
towards	 exploiting	 the	 new	 methods	
of	 releasing	 unconventional	 gas,	
especially	 in	 the	 United	 States.
Western	 economies	 have	 only	 slowly	
regained	 their	 composure	 after	 the	
traumas	 of	 2008	 but	 Asia	 has	
expanded	 strongly	 –	 such	 that	 total	
world	 energy	 consumption	 is	 higher	
than	 seemed	 remotely	 likely	 in	 the	
dark	 days	 of	 the	 financial	 implosion.
“	 A	 robust	 balance	 sheet	
has	 allowed	 us	 to	 make	
the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
the	 Company’s	 history	
and	 to	 expend	 capital	 in	
both	 existing	 and	 new	
geographical	 areas.”

management	 facility	 in	 Fordoun,	
Scotland.	 A further	 £18.1m	 expansion	
of	 the	 Group’s	 Aberdeen	
manufacturing	 plant	 also	 began	 in	
the	 third	 quarter	 of	 2010	 and	 the	
Group	 invested	 £3.9m	 in	 land	 in	
Houma,	 Louisiana	 for	 a	 facility	 to	
serve	 Gulf	 of	 Mexico	 operations.
Within	 Well	 Intervention,	 plans	 were	
initiated	 on	 a	 £13.8m	 expansion	
at	 National	 Coupling’s	 facility	 in	
Stafford,	 Texas.
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 now	 has	
over	 30	 sites	 around	 the	 globe,	 which	
provide	 the	 Group	 with	 an	
operational	 capability	 in	 most	 regions	
of	 significant	 oil	 and	 gas	 activity.
The	 Group	 also	 continued	 to	 build	 its	
Exploration	 and	 Production	 business,	
where	 £7.1m	 was	 invested	 during	 the	
year	 (2009	 –	 £1.9m).
In	 September	 2010,	 the	 Group	
completed	 the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
its	 history	 with	 the	 purchase	 of	
Innova-Extel	 Holdings	 Inc.,	 a	
Houston,	 Texas	 based	 manufacturer	
of	 harsh	 environment	 electronic	
products,	 for	 a	 consideration	 of	 	
£80.3m.	 The	 business,	 now	
rebranded	 Hunting	 Innova,	 is	 a	 key	
addition	 to	 the	 Well	 Construction	
division	 and	 brings	 to	 the	 Group	 a	
new	 dimension	 of	 proprietary	
products	 that	 increase	 Logging	 and	
Measurement-While-Drilling	
capabilities,	 by	 adding	 electronics	 to	
the	 core	 mechanical	 engineering	
competence.	 Hunting	 Innova,	 along	
with	 the	 other	 recent	 acquisitions,	
manufactures	 higher	 margin	
technology-driven	 products.
Business Development
The	 Group’s	 strong	 financial	 result	
was	 achieved	 in	 part	 through	
increases	 in	 its	 operational	 footprint	
during	 2010,	 with	 the	 opening	 of	 new	
facilities	 in	 key	 markets.	 The	 Group	
increased	 capital	 expenditure	 to	
£49.7m	 in	 2010,	 from	 £21.6m	 in	 2009,	
reflecting	 opportunities	 afforded	
through	 investing	 for	 future	 growth	
especially	 in	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services	
where	 the	 Group	 invested	 £48.7m	
(2009	 –	 £21.1m).	 Within	 the	 Group	
figure,	 new	 business	 development	
comprised	 £36.8m	 (2009	 –	 £11.7m)	
and	 replacement	 expenditure	 was	
£12.9m	 (2009	 –	 £9.9m).
Within	 Well	 Construction,	 the	
Drilling	 Tools	 business	 opened	 a	 new	
regional	 centre	 in	 Latrobe,	
Pennsylvania,	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	
drilling	 activity	 in	 the	 Marcellus	 shale	
gas	 play	 where	 the	 introduction	 of	
new	 recovery	 techniques	 make	
drilling	 and	 production	 attractive	
even	 at	 the	 low	 prices	 for	 natural	 gas	
of	 under	 US$5/Mcf.	 New	 drilling	 tool	
facilities	 in	 Conroe,	 Texas	 and	
Casper,	 Wyoming	 have	 also	 been	
opened	 to	 service	 the	 US	 Gulf	 coast	
states	 and	 the	 Bakken	 shale	
respectively.	 The	 Group	 invested	 a	
total	 of	 £20.6m	 in	 this	 growing	
business	 line.	
A	 new	 manufacturing	 facility	 in	
Wuxi,	 China	 became	 operational	
during	 the	 year	 (a	 £4.7m	 investment),	
which	 aims	 to	 serve	 the	 fast	 growing	
demand	 for	 our	 products	 in	 China.
Within	 Well	 Completion,	 the	 Group	
completed	 phase	 2	 of	 the	 expansion	
of	 the	 tubular	 inventory	 and	
2010	 has	 been	 a	 strong	 year	 of	
recovery	 for	 Hunting	 and	 also	 one	 of	
continuing	 transformation	 as	 the	
Group	 positions	 itself	 to	 respond	 to	
accelerating	 demand	 from	 emerging	
regions	 and	 technically	 challenging	
resource	 plays.	 The	 Group	 has	
invested	 heavily	 in	 its	 operations	 and	
successfully	 completed	 a	 key	
acquisition,	 two	 core	 ingredients	 of	
its	 strategy	 for	 growth,	 while	 also	
increasing	 the	 number	 of	 touch	
points	 for	 Hunting’s	 products	 that	
service	 the	 wellbore	 for	 oil	 and	 gas	
companies	 throughout	 the	 world.
The	 year	 has	 seen	 a	 stabilisation	 of	
the	 global	 economic	 outlook	 which	
has	 led	 to	 many	 energy	 companies	
increasing	 capital	 expenditure	
programmes,	 resulting	 in	 a	
corresponding	 increase	 in	 activity	
levels	 in	 all	 of	 Hunting’s	 energy	
related	 operations.	 The	 oil	 price	 has	
recovered	 from	 its	 lows	 of	 2009	 and	
sustained	 an	 increase	 of	 15%	 during	
2010	 and	 is	 now	 trending	 towards	
US$100/barrel,	 which	 has	 provided	 a	
stable	 and	 encouraging	 investment	
environment.	 As	 a	 consequence,	
North	 American	 rig	 counts	 reported	
a	 39%	 increase	 during	 the	 year,	
indicating	 a	 return	 to	 a	 robust	 growth	
trend	 in	 energy	 demand.
Against	 this	 backdrop,	 the	 Group	
achieved	 an	 impressive	 28%	 increase	
in	 revenue	 in	 the	 year	 to	 £461.6m	
(2009	 –	 £359.9m)	 and	 a	 30%	
increase	 in	 profit	 before	 tax,	 from	
continuing	 operations	 before	
exceptional	 items,	 of	 £50.0m	 	
(2009	 –	 £38.5m).	 Profit	 before	 tax	
from	 continuing	 operations	 was	
£38.5m	 (2009	 –	 £39.1m).

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The	 integration	 during	 the	 year	 of	
Welltonic	 enhances	 the	 Well	
Intervention	 platform	 by	 broadening	
the	 product	 lines	 into	 thru-tubing	
technology	 for	 the	 coiled	 tubing	
market,	 providing	 synergies	 in	
engineering	 services	 with	 the	 existing	
range,	 and	 providing	 a	 permanent	
manufacturing	 base	 in	 the	 Middle	
East.	 This	 now	 acts	 as	 a	 regional	 hub	
and	 combines	 the	 other	 divisional	
sales	 operation	 in	 Dubai,	 UAE.
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	
established	 Hunting	 Equipment	
Management	 Services	 (“HEMS”),	 a	
drilling	 tool	 rental	 and	 management	
services	 unit,	 operating	 from	 a	
customised	 facility	 in	 Aberdeen,	
Scotland.	 HEMS,	 which	 is	 reported	
as	 part	 of	 the	 Well	 Construction	
segment,	 provides	 an	 additional	
range	 of	 Bottom	 Hole	 Assembly	
Drilling	 Equipment	 alongside	
Hunting’s	 proprietary	 products	 to	 an	
existing	 customer	 base,	 as	 well	 as	
providing	 opportunity	 for	 targeted	
growth	 throughout	 the	 eastern	
hemisphere.
Health, Safety and the Environment
With	 new	 acquisitions	 and	 facilities,	
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 added	 over	
800,000 sq ft	 of	 manufacturing	
footprint	 to	 the	 Group	 bringing	 the	
total	 to	 approximately	 2 million sq ft.	
During	 2010,	 the	 number	 of	
recordable	 incidents	 was	 57	
compared	 to	 22	 in	 2009.	 The	 Group	
continues	 to	 enhance	 its	 Health	 and	
Safety	 policies	 as	 it	 adds	 new	
facilities.
All	 of	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services’	 major	
manufacturing	 facilities	 are	 ISO	
14001	 Environmental	 Management	
Systems	 certified	 and	 at	 the	 year	 end	
Hunting’s	 Rankin	 Road	 facility	
received	 ISO	 18001	 certification	 for	
its	 Health	 and	 Safety	 practices	 –	 the	
first	 in	 the	 world	 to	 be	 so	 accredited	
by	 the	 American	 Petroleum	 Institute.

reputation	 for	 reliability	 and	 on	 time	
delivery	 under	 the	 Hunting	 brand.
Business Model
The	 key	 features	 of	 the	 Group’s	
business	 model	 which	 seeks	 to	
deliver	 the	 strategic	 objectives	 are:
	 > A	 decentralised	 management	
structure	 allowing	 local	
management	 to	 identify	 and	 react	
to	 customer	 or	 local	 market	
requirements.
	 > Close	 monitoring,	 support	 and	
direction	 from	 the	 centre.
	 > Short	 chains	 of	 command	 allowing	
for	 faster	 decision	 making.
	 > Framework	 of	 controls	 with	
discretionary	 limits	 and	 powers	 for	
local	 management.
	 > Flexible	 cost	 structures	 which	 can	
adapt	 to	 market	 conditions.
	 > Common	 standards	 for	 quality,	
health	 and	 safety	 across	
operations.
Maintaining	 high	 operational	
standards	 across	 all	 of	 the	 Group’s	
activities	 is	 viewed	 as	 one	 of	 the	
building	 blocks	 in	 delivering	 a	 strong	
financial	 performance.
national	 oil	 companies	 and	 the	 major	
operating	 companies	 who	 service	
them.	 In	 Asia-Pacific,	 the	
requirement	 for	 energy	 and	
increasing	 drilling	 activity	 should	 	
see	 continued	 demand	 placed	 	
upon	 the	 Group’s	 regional	
manufacturing	 facilities	 into	 the	
foreseeable	 future.	
These	 drivers	 will	 contribute	 to	 the	
ongoing	 demand	 for	 Hunting’s	
products	 and	 services.	 With	 the	
continuing	 internal	 investment	
programme	 under	 way,	
improvements	 in	 operating	
efficiencies	 will	 be	 developed	 as	 the	
various	 initiatives	 are	 completed.	
Sustained	 or	 increased	 activity	 in	 all	
our	 key	 regions	 of	 operation	 will	
drive	 momentum	 in	 the	 year	 and	
with	 the	 recent	 acquisitions	 fully	
integrated,	 Hunting	 is	 well	 positioned	
to	 continue	 its	 growth.	
Business Strategy
The	 key	 elements	 of	 the	 Group’s	
business	 strategy	 to	 deliver	 long-term	
shareholder	 value	 remain:
	 > To	 deliver	 both	 acquisitive	 and	
organic	 growth	 across	 all	 of	 the	
Group’s	 core	 operations.	
	 > To	 invest	 and	 develop	 the	 business	
platforms	 to	 augment:
	 – 		 proprietary	 products	 and	
services;
	 – 		 increased	 market	 share	 strength;
	 – 		 enlarged	 global	 footprint;	 and
	 – 		 capture	 of	 synergies	 from	 the	
opportunities	 thus	 created.
Underpinning	 these	 strategic	
objectives	 is	 a	 commitment	 to	
manufacture	 and	 deliver	 high	 quality	
products	 and	 services	 with	 a	
Outlook
The	 oil	 and	 gas	 industry	 continues	 to	
be	 driven	 by	 fundamental	
commodity	 economics	 and	 as	
demonstrated	 in	 North	 America,	 	
is	 susceptible	 to	 influence	 from	
political	 and	 other	 technical	 factors.	
With	 strengthening	 oil	 prices,	 strong	
demand	 from	 emerging	 economies	
and	 record	 capital	 expenditures	
forecast	 by	 the	 industry,	 the	 increase	
in	 momentum	 seen	 in	 2010	 will	
likely	 continue	 through	 2011.	
Increasing	 crude	 oil	 supply	 remains	 a	
challenge	 as	 new	 oil	 discoveries	 have	
been	 offset	 by	 increasing	 depletion	
rates	 in	 maturing	 fields.	 Better	
production	 technologies	 have	
allowed	 operators	 to	 produce	
reservoirs	 more	 quickly,	 boosting	
investment	 returns.	 However,	
accelerating	 production	 requires	 new	
fields	 to	 be	 brought	 online	 more	
quickly	 to	 counter	 sharper	 decline	
rates	 of	 productive	 fields.	 With	 most	
new	 discoveries	 in	 deeper,	 harsh	 or	
remote	 locations,	 many	 of	 the	 new	
offshore	 rigs	 being	 built	 are	 high-
capability	 rigs,	 which	 require	 higher	
quality	 rig	 equipment	 and	
completion	 products.	 Gas	 shale	
drilling	 in	 North	 America	 remains	
buoyant	 as	 companies	 seek	 to	 fulfil	
lease	 commitments	 and	 a	 positive	
commodity	 price	 and	 investment	
climate	 will	 benefit	 the	 continued	
development	 of	 oil	 shale.	 With	 a	
renewed	 appetite	 in	 the	 North	 Sea	
for	 oil	 exploration	 and	 improved	
recovery	 prospects	 for	 production,	
activity	 levels	 in	 Europe	 look	
increasingly	 positive.	 The	 Middle	
East	 continues	 to	 provide	 a	 	
growing	 share	 of	 work	 from	 the

	 > consolidating	 operations	 and,	
rolling	 out	 lean	 manufacturing	
behaviours;	 and
	 > expanding	 operations	 in	 areas	 of	
high	 product	 demand.
Coupled	 with	 this	 has	 been	 the	
successful	 execution	 and	 integration	
of	 acquisitions	 into	 the	 Group.	 The	
focus	 on	 proprietary	 products,	 with	
good	 market	 share	 underpinned	 by	 a	
global	 operational	 footprint,	 has	
allowed	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 to	
rapidly	 respond	 to	 the	 increased	
confidence	 seen	 within	 the	 industry	
in	 the	 early	 part	 of	 2010	 compared	 to	
2009.	 As	 the	 business	 enters	 2011,	
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 is	
continuing	 this	 momentum	 for	
increased	 demand	 in	 its	 chosen	
markets.
Well Construction
Hunting’s	 Well	 Construction	 division	
encompasses	 those	 businesses	 that	
are	 positioned	 in	 the	 initial	 drilling	
and	 construction	 phase	 of	 the	
wellbore.	 As	 the	 industry	
recommenced	 capital	 expenditure	
programmes	 towards	 the	 end	 of	
2009,	 business	 levels	 increased	
within	 the	 division,	 while	 also	
benefiting	 from	 the	 acquisition	 of	
Innova-Extel	 Holdings,	 which	
completed	 in	 September	 2010.	
Hunting	 manufactures	 or	 distributes	
those	 products	 that	 enable	 the	
extraction	 of	 oil	 and	 gas.	 The	
Group’s	 customers	 include	
international	 oil	 companies,	
independent	 energy	 companies,	
national	 oil	 companies	 and	 mid	 to	
large	 oil	 services	 groups.	 As	 the	
energy	 industry	 moves	 into	 new	 and	
more	 demanding	 geographies	 and	
drilling	 environments	 Hunting’s	
products	 and	 technologies	 contribute	
to	 the	 successful	 operations	 in	 these	
increasingly	 challenging	 resources.
With	 the	 addition	 of	 Hunting	 Innova	
in	 September,	 the	 Group	 now	
employs	 2,431	 people	 compared	 to	
1,738	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2009.
Hunting Energy Services
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 is	 the	
primary	 operating	 unit	 of	 the	 Group	
and	 during	 2010	 reported	 a	 39%	
increase	 in	 revenue	 to	 £400.7m	
(2009	 –	 £289.1m)	 and	 a	 49%	
increase	 in	 profit	 from	 continuing	
operations	 before	 exceptional	 items	
to	 £41.7m	 (2009	 –	 £27.9m).	 This	
impressive	 performance	 has	 been	 a	
result	 of	 the	 following:
	 > improved	 activity	 levels	 seen	 in	
the	 industry	 following	 the	 global	
recession;
	 > internal	 investment	 in	 the	 Group’s	
operations;

OCTG
Hunting’s	 OCTG	 business	 continues	
to	 provide	 an	 extensive	 range	 of	
casing	 products	 and	 management	
services	 for	 customers	 as	 they	
programme,	 drill	 and	 construct	 oil	
and	 gas	 wells.	 The	 Group	 has	 key	
relationships	 with	 both	 steel	 suppliers	
and	 manufacturers	 to	 facilitate	
just-in-time	 logistics	 to	 customers.
Trenchless Technologies
Hunting’s	 drill	 stem	 products	 and	
accessories	 are	 used	 predominantly	
in	 the	 telecommunications	 and	 utility	
industries,	 where	 the	 wellbore	 is	
used	 as	 a	 conductor	 to	 carry	 the	
relevant	 service.	 The	 year	 has	 seen	 a	
firming	 up	 of	 the	 business’	
distribution	 network	 and	 expansion	
into	 new	 market	 areas.
This	 business	 platform	 also	 includes	
the	 Annular	 Pressure	 Release	 System	
product	 line	 and	 during	 the	 year	
sales	 were	 exceptionally	 strong,	 with	
its	 broad	 adoption	 by	 the	 industry	
across	 all	 regions.
Drilling Tools
The	 Hunting	 Drilling	 Tools	 platform	
provides	 mud	 motors,	 shock	 tools,	
non-magnetic	 drill	 collars	 and	 other	
technologies	 to	 assist	 with	 the	 efficient	
drilling	 of	 oil	 and	 gas	 wells.	 New	 US	
drilling	 tool	 facilities	 at	 Conroe,	
Latrobe	 and	 Casper	 were	 opened	
during	 the	 year	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	
drilling	 activity	 in	 the	 major	 US	 shale	
plays	 as	 well	 as	 conventional	 wells.	
Demand	 for	 mud	 motors	 shifted	 from	
a	 position	 of	 under	 utilisation	 in	 2009	
to	 shortages	 of	 supply	 in	 2010	 as	 new	
directional	 and	 horizontal	 drilling	
activity	 increased	 demand	 for	
Hunting’s	 products.
The	 division’s	 profit	 from	 continuing	
operations,	 before	 exceptional	 items,	
increased	 in	 the	 year	 to	 £8.0m	 (2009	
–	 £3.3m)	 with	 contributions	 from	 five	
operating	 platforms:	 Premium	
Connections,	 Drilling	 Tools,	 Oil	
Country	 Tubular	 Goods	 (“OCTG”),	
Trenchless	 Technologies	 and	 the	 new	
electronics	 manufacturing	 capability	
with	 the	 inclusion	 of	 Hunting	 Innova.
Premium Connections
Hunting’s	 Premium	 Connections	
expertise	 includes	 the	 proprietary	
SEAL-LOCK™	 range	 of	 connections	
and	 associated	 technologies	 to	 enable	
the	 construction	 of	 the	 tubular	
sections	 of	 the	 wellbore	 in	 high	
specification	 environments.	 Most	 of	
the	 threadforms	 are	 patented.	
Alongside	 these	 existing	 products	 in	
2010,	 the	 business	 completed	 design	
and	 testing	 on	 a	 new	 WEDGE-
LOCK™	 threadform.	 This	 innovative	
design	 has	 the	 capacity	 for	 increased	
torque	 while	 providing	 a	 metal	 to	
metal,	 gas	 tight	 seal	 both	 internally	
and	 externally.	 It	 has	 successfully	
completed	 development	 to	 the	
highest	 levels	 of	 industry	 testing	 and	
has	 now	 been	 introduced	 to	 the	
customer	 community.
Hunting	 also	 signed	 a	 Premium	
Connections	 sales	 and	 marketing	
agreement	 with	 Arcelor-Mittal	 for	 a	
new	 OCTG	 mill	 in	 Saudi	 Arabia.	
Under	 the	 terms	 of	 the	 agreement,	
Hunting	 will	 be	 paid	 an	 annual	
licence	 fee	 in	 addition	 to	 a	 royalty	
proportional	 to	 the	 output	 from	
the mill.

Well Intervention
Hunting’s	 Well	 Intervention	 division	
continues	 to	 grow	 organically	 and	
benefits	 from	 a	 full	 year	 of	
contribution	 from	 the	 2009	
acquisitions	 of	 Welltonic	 (acquired	
December	 2009)	 and	 National	
Coupling	 (acquired	 June	 2009).	 The	
division	 provides	 a	 core	 suite	 of	
products	 for	 intervention	 activities	
and	 includes	 state-of-the-art	 tools	 to	
measure,	 restore	 or	 maintain	
received.	 These	 are	 needed	 to	 tap	
the	 energy	 resources	 of	 increasingly	
difficult	 geologies	 from	 shale	 drilling	
in	 North	 America	 to	 the	 ultra	 deep	
offshore	 fields	 of	 Australasia.
Manufacturing
Hunting’s	 Manufacturing	 business,	
which	 includes	 blast	 and	 pup	 joints,	
couplings	 and	 other	 accessories,	
reported	 good	 results	 in	 the	 year.	 	
The	 business	 rolled	 out	 a	 lean	
manufacturing	 programme	 in	 the	
year	 across	 a	 number	 of	 its	 facilities	
resulting	 in	 increased	 efficiencies.	 In	
Canada	 the	 business	 delivered	 good	
growth	 from	 the	 lows	 seen	 in	 2009	
and	 with	 rig	 counts	 increasing	 27%	
in	 the	 year,	 2011	 should	 see	 further	
growth	 in	 this	 region.	 In	 the	 second	
quarter,	 the	 business	 commissioned	
Plant	 A	 of	 the	 Wuxi	 facility	 in	 China,	
somewhat	 delayed	 by	 the	 weather,	
but	 where	 threading	 production	 has	
now	 commenced.	 The	 business	 in	
China	 is	 being	 completed	 in	 two	
stages,	 with	 phase	 1	 now	 finished,	
and	 machinery	 installed	 and	
commissioned.	 Phase	 2	 and	 Plant	 B	
will	 see	 a	 further	 120,000 sq ft	 of	
manufacturing	 space	 being	 added,	
with	 target	 commissioning	 for	 the	
second	 quarter	 of	 2011.	 This	 will	
carry	 a	 combined	 design	 throughput	
of	 120,000	 metric	 tonnes	 of	 OCTG	 	
per	 annum.	 Overall	 Hunting’s	
Asia-Pacific	 operations	 reported	
another	 year	 of	 growth.
Thread Protection
Hunting’s	 thread	 protection	 platform	
provides	 composite	 or	 plastic	 thread	
protectors,	 SealLube™	 thread	
Hunting Innova
This	 new	 acquisition	 comprises	 the	
Innova	 electronics	 business	 and	 the	
smaller	 Extel	 manufacturing	 plant.	
Innova	 manufactures	 printed	 circuit	
boards	 and	 harsh	 environment	
housing	 for	 use	 while	 oil	 and	 gas	
wells	 are	 being	 drilled	 or	 producing.	
Key	 attributes	 of	 these	 products	 are	
the	 ability	 to	 operate	 in	 high	
temperature	 and	 high	 pressure	
conditions.	 Proprietary	 designs	 are	
agreed	 with	 the	 customer	 and	 then	
manufactured	 in	 a	 secure	
environment	 to	 their	 required	
specifications.	 Customers	 include	 the	
major	 oil	 services	 groups.	 The	 Extel	
manufacturing	 facility	 has	 the	
capability	 to	 manufacture	
components	 required	 by	 Innova,	 and	
since	 acquisition	 has	 benefited	 from	
other	 inter-company	 work	 being	
routed	 through	 the	 facility	 previously	
contracted	 out	 to	 third	 parties.	
Well Completion
Hunting’s	 Well	 Completion	 division	
provides	 products	 to	 customers	
during	 the	 completion	 phase	 of	 an	
oil	 and	 gas	 well.	 In	 2010,	 the	 	
division	 delivered	 a	 good	 result	 with	
profit	 from	 continuing	 operations	
before	 exceptional	 items	 of	 £23.1m	
(2009	 –	 £20.3m).	 The	 division	
operates	 from	 three	 platforms:	
Premium	 Tubing,	 Manufacturing	 and	
Thread	 Protection.

Other Operating Divisions
Gibson Shipbrokers
Gibson	 Shipbrokers	 has	 continued	 to	
thrive	 despite	 operating	 in	 a	 largely	
unrewarding	 shipping	 sector.	 Energy	
shipping	 markets	 have	 displayed	
signs	 of	 a	 tentative	 recovery	 from	 the	
lows	 of	 2009,	 however	 these	 gains	
are	 not	 widespread	 nor	 are	 they	 in	
any	 way	 consistent.
Gibson	 has	 maintained	 its	 successful	
policy	 of	 selective	 expansion	 within	
the	 sectors	 it	 operates	 in	 so	 that	 it	
enjoys	 a	 good	 market	 presence.	 The	
number	 of	 additional	 staff	 recruited	
in	 2010	 was	 14,	 which	 brings	 the	
business’	 headcount	 to	 146	 in	
contrast	 to	 four	 years	 ago	 when	 	
there	 were	 only	 120.
This	 expansion	 was	 enhanced	 by	 the	
addition	 of	 an	 office	 in	 Oslo,	 while	
Singapore	 has	 also	 seen	 a	 doubling	
of	 staff	 numbers.	 Growth	 remains	 a	
priority	 being	 a	 recruitment	 blend	 of	
trainees,	 junior	 and	 experienced	
brokers,	 and	 acquisitions	 where	
appropriate.	 As	 a	 result	 Gibson’s	
market	 share	 has	 strengthened,	
which	 will	 in	 turn	 enhance	 results	 as	
the	 energy	 shipping	 sector	 finally	
pulls	 out	 of	 the	 recession.	 Profits	
from	 continuing	 operations	 for	 2010	 	
are	 above	 2009	 at	 £1.0m	 (2009	 –	
£0.7m).
Gibson	 Shipbrokers	 has	 always	
retained	 a	 reputation	 for	 being	 a	
strong	 tanker	 brokerage.	 With	 the	
ongoing	 expansion	 and	
reorganisation	 undertaken	 three	
years	 ago,	 the	 business	 now	 displays	
a	 notable	 strength	 in	 the	 majority	 of	
the	 sectors	 in	 which	 it	 is	 involved.
anticipated	 demand	 at	 Hunting	
Subsea	 has	 resulted	 in	 a	 £13.8m	
expansion	 of	 the	 company’s	 facilities	
being	 sanctioned,	 with	 ground	
broken	 in	 December	 2010,	 and	
completion	 expected	 by	 the	 	
end	 of	 2011.	 During	 the	 year	 17	
international	 and	 domestic	 patents	
were	 granted	 covering	 eleven	
products,	 including	 couplings	 and	
chemical	 injection	 systems	 designs.
Exploration and Production 
(“E&P”)
The	 Group’s	 E&P	 division	 has	
interests	 in	 the	 Southern	 US	 and	
offshore	 Gulf	 of	 Mexico,	 holding	
equity	 interests	 in	 over	 70	 production	
properties.	 On	 a	 Net	 Equivalent	
Barrel	 (“NEB”)	 basis,	 production	 in	
the	 year	 was	 230,000	 barrels	 (2009	
–	 243,000	 barrels).	 At	 the	 end	 of	
2010,	 WTI	 closed	 up	 15%	 at	 US$91/
barrel,	 compared	 to	 the	 start	 of	 the	
year.	 This	 increase	 enabled	 the	 E&P	
business	 to	 report	 an	 improved	 profit	
from	 operations,	 before	 exceptional	
items,	 of	 £1.3m	 (2009	 –	 £0.3m).	 	
The	 Group	 participated	 in	 five	
exploration	 wells	 during	 the	 year,	
resulting	 in	 three	 successes:	 offshore	
Louisiana	 on	 East	 Cameron	 Block	 24;	
onshore	 south	 Texas	 in	 Matagorda	
County	 and	 in	 west	 Texas,	 on	 the	
Adair	 San	 Andres	 Unit.	 The	 Group	
has	 completed	 a	 year	 end	 valuation	
of	 its	 reserves,	 which	 requires	
individual	 oil	 and	 gas	 properties	 to	 be	
impaired	 when	 the	 realisable	 value	 is	
less	 than	 the	 book	 value	 based	 on	
future	 production	 and	 commodity	
prices	 –	 accounting	 rules	 prohibit	
writing	 up	 the	 value	 of	 any	 oil	 and	
production	 of	 an	 existing	 well.	 	
2010	 proved	 to	 be	 a	 pivotal	 year,	 as	
customer	 interest	 was	 converted	 to	
new	 orders	 at	 National	 Coupling,	
which	 enabled	 the	 Well	 Intervention	
Division	 to	 deliver	 a	 strong	 increase	 in	
profit	 from	 operations	 and	 before	
exceptional	 items	 to	 £9.3m	 (2009	 –	
£4.0m).	 Under	 this	 platform	 are	 two	
businesses:	 Well	 Intervention	 and	
Hunting	 Subsea.
The	 established	 Well	 Intervention	
business	 provides	 pressure	 control	 	
equipment,	 control	 panels,	 E-line	
(wireline)	 and	 slickline	 tools.	 The	
pressure	 control	 product	 suite	 can	 be	
used	 with	 Blow-out	 Preventer	
equipment	 and	 associated	 products.	
Welltonic	 adds	 specialised	 advice,	
proprietary	 tools	 and	 OEM	 rental	
equipment	 that	 are	 used	 in	 the	
production	 string	 of	 the	 wellbore	
through	 coiled	 tubing.	 Integrating	 the	
operations	 has	 enhanced	 the	 Group’s	
footprint	 with	 facilities	 in	 Houston,	
Houma,	 Aberdeen,	 Dubai	 and	
Singapore.
Hunting	 Subsea	 has	 accelerated	 its	
activities	 during	 the	 year	 as	 strong	
international	 demand	 from	 a	 number	
of	 key	 customers	 drove	 the	 business	
to	 deliver	 a	 record	 result	 in	 2010.	
Orders	 for	 the	 Chemical	 Injection	
Systems	 developed	 by	 Hunting	
Subsea	 were	 received	 from	 many	 of	
the	 tier	 one	 OEMs	 and	 BP,	 for	 supply	
to	 the	 Macondo	 relief	 wells.	 A

of	 aircraft	 modification.	 Interior	
modification	 capabilities	 transform	
regional	 airliners	 into	 VIP	 or	
corporate	 shuttle	 aircraft.	 Leading-
edge	 avionics	 modifications	 keep	
aircraft	 productive,	 profitable	 and	
technologically	 advanced.
As	 a	 build	 to	 print	 aircraft	 parts	
manufacturer,	 the	 Parts	
Manufacturing	 facility	 in	 Calgary	
specialises	 in	 the	 production	 of	 parts	
and	 spares	 for	 the	 international	
commercial	 and	 military	 aerospace	
industry.	 The	 business	 manufactures	
airframe	 parts	 and	 accessories	 for	
both	 current-production	 aircraft	 and	
out-of-production	 aircraft.
In	 2010,	 Field	 Aviation	 delivered	 a	
profit	 from	 operations	 of	 £5.0m	
(2009	 –	 £7.2m).	 The	 reduction	 in	
profits	 is	 from	 the	 aircraft	
modification	 business	 with	 fewer	
major	 programmes	 than	 in	 2009.	 	
In	 2010,	 additional	 special	 mission	
aircraft	 were	 successfully	 delivered	 	
to	 the	 Japanese	 Coast	 Guard	 and	
several	 interior	 and	 avionic	
modifications	 were	 completed	 for	
both	 government	 and	 commercial	
customers.	 The	 outlook	 for	 the	
modification	 business	 in	 2011	 is	
challenging	 with	 fewer	 new	
programmes	 being	 awarded	 due	 	
to	 reduced	 government	 spending	
worldwide.

Finance Director’s Review
Net Finance Income
Net	 finance	 income	 was	 £1.3m	
compared	 to	 £1.8m	 reported	 in	
2009.	 The	 average	 interest	 rate	
earned	 on	 cash	 deposits	 in	 2010	 	
was	 0.82%	 against	 1.1%	 in	 2009.
Exceptional Items
The	 following	 exceptional	 items,	
before	 taxation,	 arose	 in	 the	 year:
	 > Dry	 hole	 costs	 of	 £3.1m	 from	 our	
Exploration	 and	 Production	
activities.
	 > Impairment	 of	 oil	 and	 gas	
capitalised	 expenditure	 of	 £5.3m	
resulting	 from	 reduced	 future	
commodity	 prices,	 principally	 gas	
prices,	 at	 the	 year	 end	 compared	
to	 31 December	 2009.
	 > Acquisition	 costs	 written	 off	
£3.1m.	 This	 includes	 costs	 relating	
to	 the	 acquisition	 of	 Innova-Extel	
together	 with	 costs	 on	 other	
potential	 acquisition	 candidates	
considered	 during	 the	 year.
	 > Foreign	 exchange	 losses	 of	 £4.5m	
arising	 on	 Canadian	 dollar	
denominated	 provisions	 for	 tax	
indemnities	 given	 in	 respect	 of	 	
our	 former	 Canadian	 business,	
Gibson	 Energy.
Earnings per Share
Basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 before	
exceptional	 items	 for	 continuing	
operations	 increased	 40%	 to	 24.7p	
from	 17.7p	 in	 2009.	 Basic	 earnings	
per	 share	 in	 2010	 was	 16.6p	 against	
21.9p	 reported	 in	 2009.	 The	
weighted	 average	 number	 of	 shares	
used	 in	 calculating	 the	 earnings	 per	
share	 in	 2010	 was	 131.3	 million	
compared	 to	 131.1	 million	 in	 2009.	
On	 a	 fully	 diluted	 basis,	 the	 weighted	
average	 number	 of	 shares	 is	 134.0	
million	 in	 2010	 and	 133.8	 million	
in 2009.
Taxation
The	 pre-exceptional	 Group	 tax	 rate	 	
for	 2010	 was	 30%	 (2009	 –	 32%)	
resulting	 in	 a	 tax	 charge	 of	 £15.0m	
(2009	 –	 £12.2m).	 This	 decrease	 in	 	
the	 tax	 rate	 largely	 reflects	 changes	 	
in	 the	 regional	 mix	 of	 profits.	 The	
exceptional	 charge	 in	 the	 year	
attracts	 a	 tax	 credit	 of	 £3.5m	 to	 give	
a	 net	 tax	 charge	 on	 continuing	
operations	 in	 2010	 of	 £11.5m	 (2009	
–	 £12.2m).
Canadian	 Manufacturing	 operations.	
Aberdeen	 and	 Asia	 Pacific	 results	
remained	 strong	 but	 on	 reduced	
activity	 levels.	 Well	 Intervention	
reported	 a	 133%	 increase	 in	 profits	
helped	 by	 full	 year	 contributions	 from	
the	 National	 Coupling	 and	 Welltonic	
acquisitions	 of	 2009.	 Exploration	 and	
Production	 reports	 improved	 results	
for	 the	 year	 on	 higher	 commodity	
prices,	 with	 a	 similar	 trend	 reported	
from	 Gibson	 Shipbrokers	 where	
shipping	 activity	 levels	 and	 rates	 have	
improved.	 Field	 Aviation	 reported	
reduced	 profits	 resulting	 from	 lower	
contract	 activity	 levels.	
Overall	 profits	 from	 continuing	
operations	 before	 exceptional	 items	
report	 a	 33%	 increase	 from	 £35.8m	
to	 £47.7m.	 After	 exceptional	 items,	
profit	 from	 continuing	 operations	
was	 £36.2m	 (2009	 –	 £36.4m).
EBITDA	 was	 £68.3m	 (2009	 –	
£50.6m)	 for	 the	 year.	 The	 charge	 in	
the	 year	 for	 depreciation	 was	 £17.6m	
(2009	 –	 £14.2m)	 and	 for	 intangible	
asset	 amortisation	 was	 £2.5m	 (2009	
–	 £0.6m).	 The	 increased	 intangible	
asset	 amortisation	 charge	 is	
attributable	 to	 the	 recent	 acquisitions	
of	 Innova-Extel	 and	 National	
Coupling.
Results
These	 financial	 statements	 report	 an	
excellent	 set	 of	 results	 from	 our	 core	
operations,	 with	 an	 underlying	
significant	 improvement	 on	 the	 prior	
year.	 We	 remain	 in	 a	 strong	 financial	
position	 with	 an	 excellent	 platform	
from	 which	 to	 grow	 and	 develop	 our	
global	 operations	 in	 an	 improved	
trading	 environment.
Group	 revenues	 increased	 28%	 to	
£461.6m	 from	 £359.9m	 in	 2009,	
benefiting	 from	 stronger	 markets	
together	 with	 incremental	 revenues	
from	 businesses	 acquired	 in	 2009	
(National	 Coupling	 in	 June	 2009,	 PT	
SMB	 in	 July	 2009	 and	 Welltonic	 in	
December	 2009)	 and	 Innova-Extel	
acquired	 in	 September	 2010.
Profit	 from	 operations	 reported	 a	
similar	 year	 on	 year	 improvement	
with	 Well	 Construction	 increasing	 	
by	 142%	 on	 improved	 margins,	
benefiting	 from	 the	 acquisition	 of	
Innova-Extel,	 along	 with	 strong	
underlying	 growth	 in	 the	 Premium	
Connections	 and	 Drilling	 Tools	
operations,	 together	 with	 a	 return	 to	
profit	 by	 Trenchless	 operations.	 Well	
Completion	 profits	 were	 up	 14%	 on	
the	 prior	 year	 with	 improved	 results

of	 £36.8m	 (2009	 –	 £11.7m).	 The	
increased	 level	 of	 capital	 spend	 is	
principally	 due	 to	 the	 facilities	
expansion	 programme	 under	 way	 in	
Scotland,	 US	 and	 China,	 together	
with	 an	 increased	 level	 of	
expenditure	 on	 our	 exploration	 and	
production	 activities,	 where	 £7 .1m	
(2009	 –	 £1.9m)	 was	 invested	 during	
the	 year.
Dividends	 paid	 during	 the	 year	 were	
£14.1m	 (2009	 –	 £13.8m)	 and	 payments	
made	 in	 respect	 of	 Gibson	 Energy	 	
tax	 indemnities	 absorbed	 £25.1m	 	
(2009	 –	 £4.1m).
Treasury Risk Management
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 centralised	
Treasury	 service	 with	 policies	 and	
procedures	 approved	 by	 the	 Board.	
These	 cover	 funding,	 banking	
relationships,	 foreign	 currency,	
interest	 rate	 exposures,	 cash	
management	 and	 the	 investment	 of	
surplus	 cash.
Currency	 options	 are	 used	 to	 reduce	
currency	 risk	 movements	 on	 the	
Group’s	 results,	 by	 hedging	
approximately	 50%	 of	 each	 year’s	
budgeted	 US	 dollar	 earnings	 into	
sterling.	 Currency	 exposure	 on	 the	
balance	 sheet	 is,	 where	 practical,	
reduced	 by	 financing	 assets	 with	
borrowings	 in	 the	 same	 currency.	
Spot	 and	 forward	 foreign	 exchange	
contracts	 are	 used	 to	 cover	 the	 net	
exposure	 of	 purchases	 and	 sales	 in	
non-domestic	 currencies.
Surplus	 cash	 is	 invested	 in	 AAA	
Money	 Market	 Funds	 and	 in	 bank	
deposits.	 Further	 detail	 on	 financial	
risks	 is	 provided	 within	 note	 30.
Liquidity and Funding
The	 Group’s	 liquidity	 and	 access	 to	
funding	 remains	 strong.	 Net	 cash	 at	 the	
year	 end	 of	 £212.2m	 (2009	 –	
£365.0m),	 which	 combined	 with	 a	
new	 £120.0m	 three	 year	 committed	
multi-currency	 borrowing	 facility	
expiring	 in	 2013,	 provides	 sufficient	
liquidity	 to	 meet	 anticipated	 funding	
requirements	 over	 the	 short	 and	
medium-term.	 Total	 credit	 facilities	 in	
place	 at	 the	 year	 end	 amount	 to	
£153.9m	 of	 which	 £33.9m	 are	
uncommitted.	 The	 maturity	 profile	 of	
the	 Group’s	 credit	 facilities	 is	 shown	
within	 note	 30	 to	 the	 accounts.
Net Cash
The	 year	 ended	 with	 net	 cash	 (note	 28)	
of	 £212.2m	 (2009	 –	 £365.0m).	 	
At	 31 December	 2010,	 the	 Group	
balance	 sheet	 shows	 borrowings	 of	
£56.7m.	 These	 borrowings	 are	 drawn	
on	 the	 Group’s	 UK	 overdraft	 facilities	
which	 are	 subject	 to	 a	 legal	 right	 of	
set-off	 against	 funds	 held	 in	 the	
Group’s	 UK	 bank	 accounts.	 Under	
International	 Financial	 Reporting	
Standards	 (“IFRSs”)	 these	 balances	
are	 required	 to	 be	 shown	 gross.
Cash Flow
Net	 cash	 outflow	 in	 the	 year	 was	
£152.8m	 (2009	 –	 £7.3m).	 Working	
capital	 absorbed	 £48.0m	 (2009	 –	
£11.9m	 inflow)	 as	 activity	 levels	
increased.	 New	 facilities	
commissioned	 during	 the	 year,	
together	 with	 the	 £80.3m	 Innova	
acquisition,	 also	 contributed	 to	 the	
working	 capital	 increase.	 Total	
capital	 expenditure	 was	 £49.7m	
(2009	 –	 £21.6m)	 comprising	
replacement	 spend	 of	 £12.9m	 	
(2009	 –	 £9.9m)	 and	 growth	 spend	
Balance Sheet
Net	 assets	 increased	 during	 the	 year	
from	 £561.8m	 at	 31	 December	 2009	
to	 £594.6m	 at	 31	 December	 2010.	
The	 net	 increase	 of	 £32.8m	 comprises	
£24.3m	 retained	 result	 for	 the	 year,	
increase	 in	 the	 fair	 value	 of	 the	
Gibson	 Energy	 warrant	 by	 £15.3m	
offset	 by	 £15.6m	 dividend	 payments	
together	 with	 foreign	 exchange	 gains	
and	 other	 items	 of	 £8.8m.
Available for Sale Financial Assets
On	 the	 sale	 of	 our	 Canadian	
subsidiary,	 Gibson	 Energy	 in	 2008,	
C$100.0m	 (£64.1m)	 of	 the	
consideration	 was	 deferred	 and	 held	
in	 the	 form	 of	 a	 warrant	 with	 an	
interest	 coupon	 of	 12%	 and	 a	
maturity	 date	 of	 12	 December	 2010.	
The	 warrant	 is	 currently	 held	 as	 an	
available	 for	 sale	 financial	 asset.	 At	
31	 December	 2008,	 given	 market	
conditions	 at	 that	 time,	 the	 carrying	
value	 of	 the	 warrant	 was	 impaired	 to	
C$50.0m	 (£32.1m).
On	 10	 December	 2010,	 we	
announced	 agreement	 to	 extend	 	
the	 terms	 of	 the	 warrant	 until	
1 September	 2011	 in	 return	 for	 an	
increased	 interest	 coupon	 of	 13%	 and	
if	 unpaid	 by	 that	 date	 an	 additional	
payment	 of	 C$10.0m	 (£6.4m).	
Following	 this	 extension,	 and	 as	
required	 under	 accounting	 rules,	 the	
fair	 value	 of	 the	 warrant	 has	 been	
reassessed	 as	 at	 31	 December	 2010,	
and	 in	 light	 of	 improved	 information	
becoming	 available	 the	 carrying	 value	
increased	 to	 C$70.0m	 (£44.9m).	 The

process	 described	 in	 the	 Corporate	
Governance	 Report	 on	 pages	 41	 to	
44.	 The	 process	 requires	 all	
businesses	 to	 identify,	 evaluate	 and	
monitor	 risks	 and	 take	 steps	 to	
reduce,	 eliminate	 or	 manage	 the	 risk.	
Group	 risks	 are	 formally	 reviewed	 by	
the	 Board	 at	 least	 three	 times	 a	 year.	
In	 addition	 risk	 management	 is	
discussed	 at	 every	 Board	 meeting.
Some	 of	 the	 risks	 that	 Hunting	 is	
exposed	 to,	 which	 could	 have	 a	
material	 adverse	 impact,	 arise	 from	
the	 specific	 activities	 undertaken	 by	
the	 Group;	 others	 are	 common	 to	
many	 international	 manufacturing	
companies:
Risks Specific to the Nature of 
Hunting Group Businesses
Commodity prices
Although	 not	 under	 the	 Group’s	
control,	 a	 material	 movement	 in	
commodity	 pricing	 could	 impact	
demand	 for	 the	 Group’s	 products	
and	 services.	 Working	 capital	 and	 in	
particular	 inventory	 levels	 are	 closely	
managed	 to	 mitigate	 against	 exposure	
to	 commodity	 price	 movement.
Product Quality and Reliability
Product	 quality	 and	 reliability	 is	
critical	 to	 the	 Group’s	 reputation	
with	 its	 customers.	 Quality	 assurance	
standards	 are	 monitored,	 measured	
and	 regulated	 within	 the	 Group	
under	 the	 authority	 of	 a	 Quality	
Assurance	 Director,	 who	 reports	
directly	 to	 the	 Chief	 Executive.
Adequacy of Provisions
The	 Group	 holds	 £56.1m	 of	
provisions	 for	 warranties,	 indemnities	
and	 vacant	 leasehold	 properties.	 The	
need	 to	 hold	 these	 provisions	 is	
regularly	 considered	 however	 the	
timing	 and	 amount	 of	 any	 provisions	
that	 may	 be	 payable	 can	 fluctuate.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions	 are	 an	 integral	 part	 of	 the	
continuing	 Group’s	 strategy	 of	
expansion	 and	 development.	 While	
recent	 new	 acquisitions	 to	 the	 Group	
have	 integrated	 well,	 the	 Board	 is	
conscious	 of	 the	 potential	 disruption	
to	 both	 the	 Group	 and	 acquiree,	 of	 an	
acquisition	 process	 and	 subsequent	
integration.	 The	 Board	 is	 actively	
from	 the	 business	 unit	 to	 which	 the	
goodwill	 relates.	 The	 cash	 flows	 are	
based	 on	 management’s	 view	 of	
future	 trading	 prospects.	 Any	
shortfall	 identified	 is	 treated	 as	 an	
impairment	 and	 written	 off.
Taxation 
The	 effective	 tax	 rate	 for	 the	 full	 year	
is	 30%	 and	 is	 the	 combined	 rate	
arising	 from	 the	 regional	 mix	 of	
Group	 results.	 The	 rate	 also	 takes	
into	 account	 the	 estimated	 future	
utilisation	 of	 tax	 losses	 and	 the	
agreements	 with	 regional	 tax	
authorities	 of	 corporate	 tax	
computations.
Deferred Tax
A	 deferred	 tax	 asset	 and	 liability	 are	
recorded	 within	 the	 financial	
statements	 at	 31	 December	 2010	 of	
£8.6m	 and	 £25.6m	 respectively.	
These	 balances	 are	 derived	 from	
assumptions	 which	 include	 the	 future	
utilisation	 of	 trading	 losses	 and	
provisions	 at	 assumed	 tax	 rates.
Share-based Payments
The	 estimated	 cost	 of	 grants	 and	
awards	 of	 equity	 instruments	 is	
spread	 evenly	 over	 the	 vesting	
period.	 The	 actuarial	 assumptions	
used	 in	 determining	 the	 charge	 to	
income	 are	 set	 out	 in	 note	 39.
Available for Sale Financial Assets
The	 warrant	 received	 as	 part	
consideration	 on	 the	 disposal	 of	
Gibson	 Energy	 is	 held	 as	 an	 available	
for	 sale	 financial	 asset	 at	 its	 fair	 value.	
The	 fair	 value	 of	 the	 warrant	 is	 based	
on	 management’s	 best	 estimate	 of	 the	
recoverable	 amount	 given	 current	
global	 economic	 conditions,	 together	
with	 an	 assessment	 of	 publicly	
available	 financial	 information	 on	
Gibson	 Energy.
Provisions
Provisions	 amounting	 to	 £56.1m	 are	
held	 on	 balance	 sheet	 at	 the	 year	
end.	 These	 are	 based	 on	 Director’s	
estimates	 of	 the	 future	 cost	 of	 current	
obligations.	
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
Facing the Group
The	 Group	 has	 an	 established	 risk	
management	 monitoring	 and	 review	
Critical Accounting Policies
The	 Group	 accounts	 are	 prepared	
using	 accounting	 policies	 in	
accordance	 with	 IFRS.	 The	 Principal	
accounting	 policies	 are	 set	 out	 on	
pages	 46	 to	 51.
The	 preparation	 of	 these	 accounts	
require	 the	 use	 of	 estimates,	
judgements	 and	 assumptions	 that	
affect	 the	 reported	 amount	 of	 assets,	
liabilities,	 revenue	 and	 expenses	 and	
the	 disclosure	 of	 contingent	 assets	
and	 liabilities.	 Directors’	 estimates	
are	 based	 on	 historical	 experience,	
consultation	 with	 experts	 and	 other	
methods	 that	 they	 believe	 are	
reasonable	 and	 appropriate.
Retirement Benefits
The	 Group	 operates	 a	 defined	
benefit	 pension	 scheme	 in	 the	 UK,	
which	 was	 closed	 to	 new	 entrants	
with	 effect	 from	 31	 December	 2002,	
as	 well	 as	 a	 number	 of	 defined	
contribution	 schemes	 within	 the	
Group.	 The	 defined	 benefit	 scheme	
is	 accounted	 for	 under	 IAS	 19	 and	
the	 main	 actuarial	 assumptions	 used	
are	 shown	 within	 note	 32	 to	 the	
accounts	 and	 in	 the	 table	 below.	
Property, Plant and Equipment and 
Other Intangible Assets
The	 Group’s	 property,	 plant	 and	
equipment	 and	 other	 intangible	
assets	 are	 subject	 to	 annual	 rates	 of

Economics and Geopolitics
The	 economic	 and	 political	
environment	 in	 the	 geographic	 areas	 in	
which	 the	 Group	 operates	 impact	
demand	 for	 the	 Group’s	 range	 of	
products	 and	 services.	 Management	
and	 the	 Board	 closely	 monitor	 trading	
results,	 forecasts,	 political	
developments	 and	 projected	
economic	 trends	 in	 order	 to	 match	
capacity	 to	 demand	 and,	 where	
possible,	 minimise	 the	 impact	 of	
adverse	 trends	 on	 the	 Group.	 In	
addition	 overheads	 are	 monitored	
regularly	 to	 ensure	 the	 cost	 base	 is	
actively	 managed.
Fluctuation in Currency  
Exchange Rates
The	 Group	 has	 significant	 overseas	
operations,	 hence	 results	 are	
denominated	 in	 a	 variety	 of	 currencies.	
As	 a	 result,	 the	 Group’s	 financial	
statements,	 which	 are	 reported	 in	
sterling,	 are	 subject	 to	 the	 effects	 of	
foreign	 exchange	 rate	 fluctuations	 with	
respect	 to	 currency	 conversions.	 The	
Group	 maintains	 an	 active	 strategy	 of	
financial	 hedging	 to	 mitigate	 such	 risk,	
subject	 to	 the	 availability	 of	 suitable	
products	 at	 the	 right	 cost.
Health, Safety and Environmental 
(“HS&E”)
The	 Group	 is	 subject	 to	 a	 number	 of	
HS&E	 laws	 and	 regulations	 that	 affect	
its	 operations,	 facilities	 and	 products	
in	 each	 of	 the	 jurisdictions	 in	 which	
it	 operates.	 The	 Group	 is	 committed	
to	 operating	 in	 compliance	 with	 all	
HS&E	 laws	 and	 regulations	 relating	 to	
its	 products,	 operations	 and	 business	
activities.	 However,	 there	 is	 a	 risk	
that	 it	 may	 have	 to	 incur	 unforeseen	
expenditures	 to	 cover	 HS&E	
liabilities,	 to	 maintain	 compliance	
with	 current	 or	 future	 HS&E	 laws	 and	
regulations	 or	 to	 undertake	 any	
necessary	 remediation.	 It	 is	 difficult	
to	 estimate	 with	 any	 reasonable	
certainty	 the	 future	 impact	 of	 HS&E	
matters,	 including	 potential	 liabilities,	
due	 to	 a	 number	 of	 factors	 and	
especially	 the	 lengthy	 time	 intervals	
often	 involved	 in	 resolving	 them.	
There	 is	 regular	 HS&E	 compliance	
reporting	 to	 the	 Board.
involved	 in	 monitoring,	 approving	
and	 assessing	 acquisitions	 to	 mitigate	
against	 the	 risk	 of	 poor	 investment	
decisions.	 All	 acquisitions	 require	
Board	 approval	 prior	 to	 commitment.
Capital Investment Programme
The	 Group	 continues	 to	 seek	
opportunities	 for	 organic	 growth	 and	
maintains	 an	 active	 capital	 investment	
programme.	 The	 programme	
encompasses	 investments	 in	 new	
territories,	 buildings,	 production	
equipment,	 rental	 equipment	 and	 IT	
systems.	 There	 is	 a	 range	 of	 risks	
involved	 in	 such	 programmes,	
including	 management	 distraction,	
facility	 upheaval,	 risk	 of	 IT	 systems	
failure	 and	 poor	 financial	 returns.	 The	
Board	 and	 senior	 management	 follow	
a	 rigorous	 process	 of	 approving,	
managing	 and	 monitoring	 capital	
investments	 along	 with	 planning	 for	
contingencies.	 All	 capital	 expenditure	
above	 discretionary	 limits	 requires	
Board	 approval	 prior	 to	 commitment.
Relationships with Key Customers
The	 Group’s	 success	 is	 defined	 by	
relationships	 with	 its	 key	 customers.	
A	 material	 reduction	 in	 orders	 from	 a	
major	 customer,	 whether	 through	
competitive	 action,	 contractual	
dispute,	 business	 consolidation	 or	
change	 in	 strategy	 could	 impact	 the	
Group’s	 financial	 performance	 and	
prospects.	 The	 Group	 is	 also	 reliant	
upon	 the	 conduct	 of	 its	 customers,	
given	 its	 products	 are	 exported	 by	
those	 customers	 across	 the	 world	
and	 used	 in	 a	 range	 of	 environments,	
including	 deep	 sea	 exploration	 and	
production.	 Senior	 management	
maintain	 close	 personal	 relationships	
with	 key	 customers	 and	 seek	 to	
maintain	 the	 highest	 level	 of	 service	
to	 preserve	 Hunting’s	 reputation	 for	
quality.
Other Risks Common to 
International Manufacturing 
Businesses
Effective control over subsidiaries
Group	 subsidiaries	 operate	 within	 	
a	 control	 framework	 with	 a	 degree	 	
of	 autonomy	 vested	 in	 local	
management.	 The	 operations	 of	
subsidiaries	 are	 subject	 to	 regular	
checking	 by	 management	 through	
board	 and	 management	 meetings,	
Loss of Key Executives
The	 Group	 is	 highly	 reliant	 on	 the	
continued	 service	 of	 its	 key	 executives	
and	 senior	 management,	 who	 possess	
commercial,	 engineering,	 technical	
and	 financial	 skills	 that	 are	 critical	 to	
the	 success	 of	 the	 Group.	
Remuneration	 packages	 are	 regularly	
reviewed	 to	 ensure	 they	 are	
remunerated	 in	 line	 with	 market	 rates.	
External	 consultants	 are	 engaged	 to	
provide	 guidance	 on	 best	 practice.
Failure	 to	 retain	 suitably	 qualified	
individuals,	 or	 to	 attract	 and	 retain	
strong	 management	 and	 technical	 staff	
in	 the	 future,	 could	 have	 an	 adverse	
effect	 upon	 the	 Group	 and	 the	 results	
of	 its	 operations.	 Senior	 management	
continually	 review	 the	 availability	 of	
the	 necessary	 skills	 within	 the	 Group	
and	 seek	 to	 find	 suitable	 staff	 where	
they	 feel	 there	 is	 vulnerability.

applications for positions from 
disabled persons and to their training 
and career advancement. Every effort 
is made to retain in employment 
those who become disabled while 
employed by the Group.
The location of our employees 
reflects the global nature of the oil 
and gas industry and the geographic 
diversity of the Group’s activities.
It is important for the Group to retain 
key employees, as well as attracting 
high quality individuals. This remains 
a major challenge for the oil and gas 
industry. Hunting has developed a 
supportive work environment that 
promotes development, learning and 
advancement to ensure that its 
employees realise their potential. 
Long service is a feature of the 
Group’s employees and recognition 
is given through service award 
programmes across the Group.  
Forty years service is not an 
uncommon attribute.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to achieving 
and maintaining the highest 
standards of safety for its employees, 
customers, suppliers and the public. 
The Group encourages and promotes 
an awareness of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the 
performance of the Group and 
shares information on current 
activities through regular 
communication and consultation. 
Communication with employees is 
undertaken through a variety of 
media including the Group’s 
magazine, the Hunting Review, 
which is published every six months 
and distributed to employees.
Currently, the Group has 2,431  
(2009 – 1,738) employees. In 2010, 
there was a 40% increase in 
employee numbers, largely due to 
the acquisition of Innova-Extel on 
3 September 2010 and the 
commissioning of new facilities in 
China and the US. The Group seeks 
to adhere to all relevant local and 
jurisdictional laws about employment 
equality and minimum wage 
legislation.
The Group provides training to its 
staff to ensure health and safety 
standards are maintained, as well as 
investing in personal development.
As a responsible employer, full and 
fair consideration is given to 
Introduction

responsibilities within its global 
operations. Its contribution and 
involvement is determined by

where practical, takes steps  
to protect the environment.
Employment and Training
Our people are our most valuable 
asset and the Group recognises that 
its success and reputation depends 
upon their efforts and integrity.  
Our people create Hunting’s 
competitive edge and target to 
ensure that our customers’

with local management, which 
allows local cultural issues to be 
appropriately managed and the 
necessary development programmes 
to be structured accordingly.

financial statements issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company 
may, by ordinary resolution, decide, or (if there is no such 
resolution or so far as it does not make specific provision) 
as the Board may decide. The movements in share capital 
during the year are laid out in note 33 of this report.
From 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006 
abolished the requirement for a company to have an 
authorised share capital. At the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company on 21 April 2010 the Articles of 
Association were amended to reflect this change to 
Company Law.
The Directors have the authority to allot shares and to 
disapply statutory pre-emption rights. This authority is 
renewed annually at the Annual General Meeting. The 
Company has authority, renewed annually, to purchase 
up to 14.99% of the issued share capital, equating to 
19,864,737 shares at 31 December 2010. Any shares 
purchased will either be cancelled, and the number of 
Ordinary shares in issue reduced accordingly, or held in 
Treasury. The Directors will be seeking a new authority 
for the Company to purchase its Ordinary shares at its 
Annual General Meeting.
The Company holds 971,723 shares in Treasury (2009 – 
969,687), which are to satisfy a proportion of the shares 
under award to employees who participate in the 
long-term incentive schemes currently run by the 
Company. This number of shares is deducted from the 
Company’s equity. The Company has a policy to 
purchase shares in the market or issue new shares to 
ensure there are sufficient shares to meet future payouts. 
Research and Development
Group subsidiaries undertake, where appropriate, 
research and development to meet particular market and 
product needs. The amount incurred and written off by 
the Group during the year was £0.9m (2009 – £0.9m).
Charitable and Political Contributions
During the year, the Group donated £45,000 (2009 – 
£56,000) to UK charitable organisations and £119,000 
(2009 – £106,000) to overseas charities. It is the Group’s 
policy not to make political donations, accordingly there 
were no political donations made during the year (2009 
– £nil).
Property, Plant and Equipment
Details of movements in property, plant and equipment 
are shown in note 15 to the financial statements. The 
Directors are of the opinion that the market value of the 
Company’s properties at 31 December 2010 exceeded 
their net book value by approximately £23.2m.
Share Capital
The Company’s issued share capital comprises a single 
class, which is divided into Ordinary shares of 25p each, 
details of which are set out in note 33 of the financial 
statements. As at 31 December 2010, there were 
132,519,924 Ordinary shares in issue. The rights and 
obligations attached to these shares are summarised on 
page 32 and are detailed in the Articles of Association of 
the Company, copies of which can be obtained from 
Companies House in the UK, or by writing to the 
Company Secretary at the registered office of the 
Company. Subject to applicable statutes, shares may be

shares. Shareholders rights to transfer shares are subject 
to the Company’s Articles of Association.
Transfers of uncertificated shares must be carried out

of shareholders. The Directors cannot suspend the 
registration of transfers of any uncertificated shares 
without obtaining consent from CREST.

financial statements Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and 
consequently have adopted the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing these financial statements.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated its willingness 
to continue in office as auditors. A resolution to reappoint 
them as auditors to the Company will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 20 April 2011.
By Order of the Board
Peter Rose
Company Secretary

Policy on the Payment of Creditors
The Company’s and Group’s policy is to pay all creditors 
in accordance with agreed terms of business. The 
Company itself has no substantial trade payables. The 
total amount of Group trade payables falling due within 
one year at 31 December 2010 represents 44 days worth 
(2009 – 64 days), as a proportion of the total amount 
invoiced by suppliers during the year ended on that date.
Publication of Half Year Report
In common with many public companies in the UK, the 
Company will no longer publish a printed version of its 
half year report. In future, the half year report will only  
be available online from the Company’s website at  
www.huntingplc.com.
Statement of Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, all 
Directors in office as at the date of this report have 
confirmed so far as they are aware there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and each Director has taken all reasonable steps 
necessary in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditors are aware of that information. This confirmation 
is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the 
provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chief Executive’s Review and 
the Operating Review on pages 6 to 19. The financial 
position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position, 
borrowing facilities, treasury risk management and the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the business are 
described in the Finance Director’s Review on pages 20 
to 23. The notes to the financial statements include the 
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital (note 37), its financial risk management 
objectives (note 30), details of its financial instruments, 
hedging activities and sensitivity analysis (notes 29  
and 30) and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk 
(note 30).
The Group has considerable financial resources together 
with a broad range of products and services and a 
diverse, global customer and supplier base. As a 
consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well 
placed to manage its business risks successfully in the 
current economic climate.

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Advice
During the year, Hewitt New Bridge Street (“Hewitt”) 
provided advice and assistance on remuneration for 
Hunting’s UK-based Directors, executive incentive plans 
and share scheme matters. Hewitt did not provide any 
other service to the Company during 2010. Additionally, 
the Committee received advice and assistance from 
Towers Watson in the US on remuneration for the 
Company’s North American based Director and senior 
management.
The Committee also consulted with and received 
information from the executives during the year but not in 
respect of their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy
The Company aims to ensure that remuneration, 
generally, and incentives, in particular, provide a clear 
link between individual performance and shareholder 
interests. The policy is to provide competitive 
remuneration packages enabling the Company to attract, 
motivate and retain executives of high ability, experience 
and commitment.
The Committee believes an appropriate balance should 
be maintained between fixed and variable performance 
related remuneration, with the current balance 
approximately 52% deriving from salary and benefits and 
48% from variable incentives.
The Committee’s ongoing approach is to set base salaries 
within competitive market ranges, combined with 
realistic reward potential for performance that is 
outstanding. Executive Directors’ remuneration packages 
consist of an annual salary, health cover and where 
appropriate, car and fuel benefits, life and disability 
insurance, an annual performance-linked cash bonus 
plan, pension contributions, participation in performance-
linked share plans and a long-term incentive plan. 
Performance targets are established to achieve 
consistency with the interests of shareholders with an 
appropriate balance between long and short-term goals.
In setting the remuneration of individual Directors, the 
Committee takes account of their role, responsibilities, 
skills, performance and references credible and 
established market pay studies. The Committee reviews 
such studies with caution in view of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels. The Committee also has 
the discretion to take account of social and corporate 
governance issues when setting the remuneration of the 
executive Directors.
Consistent with policy on service contracts, executive 
Directors’ service contracts are subject to termination on 
one year’s notice by the Company or the executive.
Set out below are the key elements of the policy, which 
will apply in 2011 and subsequent financial years. 
However, the Committee considers that an effective 
policy needs to be kept under review in order to reflect 
future changes to business needs and the environment in 
which the Company operates and, therefore, the policy 
may be amended in the future.
Remuneration Committee Report
Introduction
Hunting PLC operates in the international energy arena, 
supplying to global companies. Recruiting, retaining and 
appropriately incentivising our senior management 
remains a clear focus for the work of the Remuneration 
Committee. The following report summarises the 
Committee’s work and outlines forward policies 
for remuneration.
Compliance
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of Schedule 8 to the Accounting 
Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and has been 
approved by the Board. The report also satisfies the 
relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial 
Services Authority and describes how the Board has 
applied the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration 
in the Combined Code. It will be presented to 
shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting 
on 20 April 2011.
Remuneration Committee
Role and Composition
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) is 
responsible for determining the remuneration of the 
Chairman and the executive Directors, including the 
setting of competitive salaries, annual performance 
targets and participation in the Company’s executive 
share-based incentive plans. The Committee also takes 
account of remuneration policy for the Company’s senior 
executives generally.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during 
the year has complied with the Combined Code’s 
guidance on Directors’ remuneration. The terms of 
reference of the Committee are published on the 
Company’s website and are available from the Company 
on request.
The Committee comprises the non-executive Directors of 
the Company, George Helland (Committee chairman), 
John Hofmeister and John Nicholas. Iain Paterson served 
on the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 
8 June 2010. David Barr joined the Committee on his 
appointment to the Board on 1 January 2011.
The Committee met four times in 2010 with members 
attending all meetings held during their term in office.
Work During the Year
The Committee’s principal activities during the year 
under review included:
 > review of the remuneration structure vis-a-vis  
business needs;
 > consideration and approval of executive Directors 
salaries, bonuses and awards under the Performance 
Share Plan (“PSP”);
 > measurement of the performance conditions and 
determination of vesting levels in respect of awards 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and grants 
under the executive share option scheme;
 > approval of awards under the LTIP and PSP; and
 > approval of the remuneration report.

financial statements performance relative to the constituent members of the 
Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services and the DJ 
STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector indices and 
if the Committee determines the Company’s financial 
performance to be satisfactory. These indices are 
considered by the Committee to be appropriate as they 
compare the Company’s performance against other 
companies in the oil and gas services sector. Awards vest 
subject to the schedule outlined below:
Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) against the 
TSR of the members of the Comparator Group

Upper quartile or above 100%
Between upper quartile  
and median 
On a straight-line 
basis between  
40% and 100%
Median 40%
Below median 0%
The plan allows for a maximum of share-based awards 
with a value equal to 200% of annual salary to be 
granted. In practice, it is the Committee’s intention that 
awards will be below this maximum. In 2010, awards to 
the value of 100% and 80% of base salary were granted 
to Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose respectively.
2. Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
The LTIP is intended to link key executives’ remuneration 
to the long-term success and performance of the Group.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive 
pool which is calculated using the sum of the Group’s 
after tax operating income after deducting a charge for 
the after tax cost of capital, which for 2010 is a rate of 
7% on average shareholders’ funds. The incentive has 
two components, the first being 2% of the absolute value 
added, and the second being 5% of the incremental 
value added. These performance conditions align the 
interests of the executives with those of the Group and its 
shareholders and will only produce value to the 
participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the 
beginning of a three year performance cycle and are 
settled at the end of each cycle either in shares or in 
cash. The award for each participant is calculated as a 
percentage of the incentive pool resulting from the 
performance of the business over the performance cycle 
as determined by the Committee.
The pool available for distribution has decreased from 
£2.6m as at 31 December 2009 to £0.2m at 
31 December 2010. The aggregate amount of the pool 
awarded to participants for 2010 was £0.2m.
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single 
award may not exceed a certain multiple of the base 
annual salary of each participant. The maximum award 
levels under the LTIP rules as a multiple of base salaries 
are 3.5 times annual salary for Dennis Proctor and 1.75 
times annual salary for Peter Rose.
Base Salaries
Base salaries are reviewed annually. In considering 
appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into 
account the remuneration paid by comparable companies 
in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, the number of 
employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and 
international spread of the Group’s operations as well as 
applicable rates of inflation. The Company’s practice is to 
target base salaries at the mid-market level in the 
appropriate market for the executive position. In 
determining executive salaries, consideration is given to 
their experience and general personal performance. The 
Remuneration Committee is also mindful of pay and 
conditions for the wider employee population when 
determining executive remuneration.
Annual Bonus
An annual performance-linked cash bonus scheme is in 
place for the executive Directors. The scheme, which is 
not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive, 
reward for performance and reflects the competitive 
markets in which the Group conducts its business.
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are eligible for a bonus 
under the scheme when 80% of the Group’s budgeted 
profit before tax is achieved. Below this level no bonus is 
payable. The amount payable under the scheme when 
the budgeted profit before tax and return on capital 
targets are achieved, is 65% of base salary for Dennis 
Proctor and 50% of base salary for Peter Rose. When 
actual results achieve 120% of these performance targets 
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are entitled to a maximum 
cash bonus of 130% and 100% of base salary 
respectively. The amount of bonus payable accrues on a 
straight-line basis when actual results achieved are 
between 80% and 120% of performance targets.
During the year, the Committee undertook a review of 
the annual bonus arrangements, whereby the Committee 
increased the maximum bonus awardable to Dennis 
Proctor to 200% of base salary and to 150% for Peter 
Rose. This new arrangement will be effective for the 2011 
financial year. The Committee felt that such an increase 
was necessary to ensure that the remuneration packages 
continue to drive and reward performance and that they 
remain competitive in the global market place in which 
the Company operates.
Bonus schemes are in place for the majority of the 
Group’s employees.
Richard Hunting has no bonus entitlement and his 
remuneration is wholly non-performance related.
Long-term Performance Related Incentives
The Group operates three long-term plans all of which 
target to align the incentive package of executives with 
that of the long-term interests of shareholders:
1. Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Awards under the PSP are granted annually and vesting is 
subject to demanding performance conditions dependent 
on increased shareholder value. Awards granted under the 
PSP, which are subject to a three year vesting period, will 
only vest based on the Group’s total shareholder return

3. Executive Share Option Plan
The Company operated an executive share option scheme between 2001 and 2008 to provide longer-term incentives 
for executives and executive Directors. From 2009, executive Directors received share-based awards under the PSP 
rather than grants under the option plan. The right to exercise an option is subject to the growth performance of the 
Company’s Basic Earnings per Share (“BEPS”) over a three year period in comparison to that of comparator companies, 
who comprise of UK, US and Canadian oil and gas service companies. No shares are exercisable if the growth in BEPS 
does not exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3% per annum over the three year period. The number of shares 
exercisable, expressed as a percentage, by a Director can range from nil if the Company’s performance is below the 
median level, to 40% at the median level and up to 100% if the Company’s performance is between the median and 
the upper quartile levels of the comparator group. No further grants will be made under this share option plan.
Director’s Shareholding Requirements
In order to align the interests of the executive Directors with that of shareholders, each executive Director is required 
to build up and maintain a holding in the Company’s shares with a market value equivalent to not less than one times 
their annual salary.
Performance Graph
The graph below compares the total shareholder return for an investment in Hunting PLC Ordinary shares, with the 
return for the same investment in the FTSE Oil and Gas Index commencing on 31 December 2005.
Total shareholder return performance of Hunting PLC vs. FTSE Oil & Gas Index
 (TSR rebased to 100 at December 2005 and measured on a 3-month average basis)
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE Oil and Gas Index is the most appropriate index against which the 
shareholder return of the Company’s shares should be compared because this is the sector in which the Company 
is quoted.
Director Service Contracts
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy on executive Directors’ contracts is to comply with the guidance in the Combined Code.
All the Directors’ Service Contracts are rolling one year agreements and contain standard provisions allowing the 
Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of the Company, on 7 February 2001. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA. Under 
the terms of the Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Inc. and Dennis Proctor are required to give one year’s 
notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus 
and vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks. There are special provisions on a change of control.

financial statements These provide for payment of one year’s base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus 
paid in the previous two years. In addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group 
insurance programmes for one year following the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant 
option agreement, all share options and share-based awards granted to him will become exercisable at the date of the 
change of control and will remain exercisable for one year.
Richard Hunting entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 15 December 1989. This was amended 
effective 1 March 2004 whereby both the Company and the Director are required to give one year’s notice  
of termination.
Peter Rose entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008.
Under the terms of the Service Agreements for Richard Hunting and Peter Rose, both the Company and the Directors 
are required to give one year’s notice of termination. The Company reserves the right to pay them in lieu of notice 
(whether given by the Company or by them). The payment in lieu comprises salary only for Richard Hunting and salary 
and bonus only for Peter Rose. The Company also has the option to put Richard Hunting and Peter Rose on paid leave 
of absence on payment of a sum equivalent to salary for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus for Peter Rose (based 
on the previous twelve month period), subject to them complying with the terms of their Service Agreement. These 
conditions also apply on termination following a change of control. In addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an 
acceleration of all share options and share-based awards, which would become immediately exercisable and remain 
exercisable for a period of one year following termination.
The Company has authorised the executive Directors to undertake non-executive directorships outside of the Group 
provided these do not interfere with their primary duties. Richard Hunting held an external non-executive directorship 
during the year, for which he received £20,368.
Non-executive Directors
Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a fixed term of three years and thereafter, subject to approval of the 
Board, for a further three year term. Iain Paterson retired from the Board on 8 June 2010, George Helland was 
reappointed for an additional one year term from 1 October 2010 and David Barr was appointed to the Board on 
1 January 2011 for a three year term. In the event of early termination by the Company, non-executive Directors are 
not entitled to receive compensation for loss of office. Their letters of appointment are available for inspection by 
shareholders during normal business hours at the Company’s registered office or at the Annual General Meeting.

Pensions (audited)
UK executive Directors are members of the Hunting Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”) which is a defined benefit 
pension scheme. The retirement age for executive Directors under the Scheme is 60 and they are entitled to, subject to 
certain limits, a pension of up to two thirds of final salary. Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal 
to the State Lower Earnings Limit. Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme 
retirement date of 31 July 2006. Peter Rose contributes a similar proportion of his salary to the Scheme. The Scheme 
provides all members a lump sum death in service benefit of four times base salary and a spouse’s pension of two 
thirds of the member’s pension on the member’s death. Bonuses and benefits do not qualify as pensionable salary.
Dennis Proctor participates in a US 401K Tax Deferred Savings Plan.

31 December 2010 includes a temporary pension of just over £9,000 per annum.
(ii) The transfer values at 31 December 2010 have been based on estimated insurance company pricing terms, reflecting the fact that most of the benefits are covered by 
insurance policies.
(iii) Richard Hunting’s normal retirement date was 31 July 2006. No further benefits have accrued to him since that date. The pension figure shown above is the combination of 
his pension in payment and his residual late retirement pension available as at 31 December 2010. The year end transfer value reflects only the value of the pension shown 
above and does not include the value of the pension he received during the year.

financial statements Combined Code
This statement, which has been approved by the Board, reports on the Company’s compliance during the year ended 
31 December 2010 with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the “Combined Code”) as issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) in June 2008 (available on its website www.frc.org.uk) and how the principles of 
the Combined Code have been applied. Compliance with the principles relating to Directors’ remuneration is reported 
within the Remuneration Committee’s Report on pages 34 to 40.
The Company was fully compliant with the Combined Code’s provisions throughout the year.
The Board
The Board of Directors currently comprises the Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and four independent 
non-executive Directors. Iain Paterson retired from the Board after ten years’ service on 8 June 2010 and David Barr 
was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive Director on 1 January 2011. On Mr Paterson’s retirement 
from the Board, John Hofmeister was appointed as the Senior Independent Director. This composition, with a separate 
Chairman and Chief Executive, ensures a balance of responsibilities and authorities. Non-executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment include details of their duties and expected time commitments required. The Directors, together with 
brief biographical details, are identified on pages 28 and 29.
Excluding the Chairman, 67% of the Board is currently comprised of independent non-executive Directors.
Appointment and Replacement of Directors
Rules for the appointment and replacement of Directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. Directors 
are appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general meeting of holders of Ordinary shares or by the 
Board on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. The Company may also remove a Director. In addition, 
further details of the workings of the Nomination Committee are set out on page 42.
As recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code published in May 2010, at the Annual General Meeting of 
the Company to be held in April 2011, all of the Directors of the Company will submit themselves for re-election.
The non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a three year term with subsequent reappointment conditional 
upon an appraisal and review process described below. Letters of appointment for each of the independent 
non-executive Directors are available from the Company upon request and their terms of appointment are summarised 
on page 37 . Details of the executive Directors’ service contracts are set out on pages 36 and 37.
On appointment to the Board, each Director receives comprehensive induction tailored to their experience and needs. 
David Barr is receiving an induction to the Group, including site visits to subsidiaries. All Directors have access to the 
Company Secretary and to independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, in the furtherance of their 
duties. Directors are encouraged to maintain their skills and knowledge to best practice standards and, where 
appropriate, attend update training courses on relevant topics. The Company Secretary, through the Chairman, is 
responsible for keeping the Board informed of Corporate Governance developments and maintaining corporate 
awareness of legislative and regulatory changes. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for the Board.
The Board normally meets formally five times a year and convened six times during 2010, of which one meeting was 
held in North America. Meeting dates are set a year in advance. Attendance by each of the Directors at Board or 
Committee meetings is detailed below.

In addition, the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and Chief Executive is set out in writing and 
agreed by the Board. Matters specifically reserved for the 
Board include, but are not limited to, the following:
 > compliance with UK Company Law and the UK  
Listing Rules;
 > review of the Group’s system of risk management, 
internal control and assess its effectiveness;
 > approve all Stock Exchange announcements;
 > approve the full and half year financial statements, 
including the approval of dividends;
 > consider the Group’s commercial strategy and approve 
the annual budget;
 > consider recommendations of the Board sub-
committees including Board remuneration, 
appointments and their terms of reference.
The Board, its committees and each individual Director 
participate in an annual performance evaluation 
appraisal, the purpose of which is to confirm the 
continued effective contribution and performance of the 
individual or committee. Evaluation of the Board was 
undertaken by the non-executive Directors and took 
account of the Directors’ attendance and their 
contribution at meetings, financial performance of the 
Group against budget, compliance with corporate 
governance and best practice guidelines and market 
perception of the Group. The Nomination, Remuneration 
and Audit Committees were evaluated by the executive 
Directors and took account of communication with the 
Board and compliance with terms of reference. The 
evaluation of the Chairman was undertaken by the 
non-executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent 
Director, and included an assessment of his leadership 
and direction of the Board. The appraisal of the Chief 
Executive was completed by the non-executive Directors 
together with the Chairman. Evaluation of the other 
individual Directors took account of their contribution 
and, in the case of the Finance Director, the performance 
of his executive duties.
Prior to the reappointment of a non-executive Director, 
the Nomination Committee undertakes an evaluation of 
the Director’s contribution and commitment to the Board 
together with an evaluation of the Board’s requirements. 
In the case of a non-executive Director being 
reappointed for a term beyond nine years, the Combined 
Code recommends a particularly rigorous evaluation with 
particular consideration being given to the need to 
regularly refresh the Board and to continued 
independence. The Nomination Committee undertook 
such an evaluation of George Helland prior to his 
reappointment for a one year term effective from 
1 October 2010, concluding that he remained a 
committed and independent contributor to the Board. 
George Helland did not participate in the evaluation 
process undertaken by the Committee.
The Company has procedures in place to deal with 
potential conflicts of interest whereby actual and 
potential conflicts of interest are reviewed, and 
appropriate authorisation sought, prior to the 
appointment of any new Director or if a new conflict 
arises. In accordance with the Articles of Association, 
only non-conflicted Directors are involved in the 
authorisation process. The Board is of the view that these 
procedures operated effectively throughout the year.
The Group operates a decentralised management 
structure to allow for rapid responses to customer 
requirements. A framework of controls with discretionary 
limits and powers for local management is contained 
within a group manual.
The Board has three main committees to which it 
delegates responsibility and authorities.
Nomination Committee
Members of the Committee are Richard Hunting 
(Committee chairman), Dennis Proctor and the non-
executive Directors. Iain Paterson retired from the 
Committee on 8 June 2010. The Committee convened 
twice during the year and has written terms of reference 
approved by the Board, which are published on the 
Company’s website. Committee members in office 
participated in all Committee meetings except for George 
Helland who did not attend the section of the meeting 
which considered his reappointment. The role of the 
Committee includes leading the process for Board 
appointments and determining the terms of new 
appointments. The Committee also considers succession 
planning which takes into account the experience and 
skills required of Board members. The Committee met on 
24 August 2010 to consider the reappointment of George 
Helland for a further one year term.
In August 2010, the Committee commenced a process to 
appoint a new non-executive Director. The Committee 
considered the balance of experience currently 
represented by the Board of Directors and the need to 
regularly refresh the Board and concluded that a Director 
with oil industry knowledge would enhance its 
capabilities. The Committee appointed Boyden 
Associates to assist the search process, and after 
reviewing the available candidates completed a formal 
interview process. On 14 December 2010 the Committee 
met and considered and recommended to the Board the 
appointment of David Barr, effective from 1 January 2011. 
Mr Barr has considerable experience in the global oil 
services sector and is a valuable addition to the Company 
as it continues its growth strategy.
Remuneration Committee
Details of the Remuneration Committee are contained 
within its report on page 34. The Committee, which 
convened four times during the year with all members in 
tenure participating, has written terms of reference 
approved by the Board, which are published on the 
Company’s website. During the year, the Committee 
reviewed its effectiveness and the Chairman reported 
these findings to the Board. Iain Paterson retired from the 
Committee on 8 June 2010. David Barr joined the 
Committee on 1 January 2011 following his appointment 
to the Board.
Audit Committee
Members of the Committee comprise exclusively the 
independent non-executive Directors. John Nicholas was 
appointed as Audit Committee chairman on 24 February 
2010, succeeding Iain Paterson, who retired from the 
Board and from the Committee on 8 June 2010. The 
Committee met four times during the year and operates

financial statements under written terms of reference approved by the Board, 
which are published on the Company’s website. All 
Committee members attended all meetings held whilst in 
their tenure during the year. The Committee normally 
meets in February, April (to coincide with the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company), August and December. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and the 
external auditors are invited to attend all meetings.
The auditors present an audit report at the February, April 
and August meetings for consideration by the Committee. 
Their full year report includes a statement on their 
independence, their ability to remain objective and to 
undertake an effective audit. The Committee considers 
and assesses this independence statement on behalf of the 
Board taking into account the level of fees paid 
particularly for non-audit services. The Committee 
considers the effectiveness of the audit by reviewing and 
taking account of any Financial Reporting Committee 
reports on the auditors, together with input from executive 
management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and its 
predecessor firms have been the Company’s auditors for 
many years. The Audit Committee is satisfied with their 
effectiveness and their independence and has not 
considered it necessary to require an independent tender 
process. The Audit Committee considers the 
reappointment of the auditors annually and makes a 
recommendation to the Board. During 2010, the 
Committee continued to closely monitor fees paid to the 
auditors in respect of non-audit services, which are 
analysed within note 9 on page 66 and includes £1.8m in 
respect of taxation advice and acquisition due diligence. 
The scope and extent of non-audit work undertaken by 
the external auditor is monitored by, and, above certain 
thresholds, requires prior approval from the Committee to 
ensure that the provision of such services does not impair 
their independence or objectivity. At the August meeting, 
which was held immediately prior to the announcement of 
the half year results, the auditors presented their interim 
report to the Committee, which included audit scope and 
fee estimates for the annual audit. The Committee 
normally meets with the auditors without executive 
Directors present at the end of each formal meeting.
Other responsibilities of the Audit Committee include:
 > monitor and review of reports on the Group’s system 
of internal control;
 > review of reports from the Group’s internal audit 
process and agreement of internal audit scope;
 > review of the external auditors independence and 
effectiveness of the audit process and assess the level 
and quality of service in relation to fees paid;
 > monitor the Group’s financial statements and 
announcements; and
 > monitor and approve engagements of the external 
auditor to provide non-audit services to the Group.
The Board received copies of all reports submitted to the 
Audit Committee.
The Senior Independent non-executive Director, John 
Hofmeister, is the primary point of contact for staff of the 
Company to raise in confidence, concerns they may have 
over possible improprieties, financial or otherwise. All 
employees have been notified of this arrangement 
through the corporate magazine, Company notice boards 
and the Company’s website.
During the year, the Committee reviewed its effectiveness 
and the Chairman reported these findings to the Board.
Institutional Shareholders
The Company uses a number of processes for 
communicating with shareholders, including all stock 
exchange announcements, the annual and half year 
reports, interim management statements issued twice a 
year, and the Annual General Meeting to which all 
shareholders are invited.
In addition, the Chief Executive and Finance Director 
meet on a one-to-one basis with all principal 
shareholders at least twice a year, following the 
Company’s half and full year results, or when requested 
to update them on Group performance and strategy. The 
Board is in turn briefed by the Chief Executive, when 
appropriate, on matters raised by shareholders.
During the year, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
non-executive Director met with a number of 
shareholders to discuss strategy, governance and other 
matters. Their comments were passed on to the Board by 
the Chairman. The non-executive Directors are also 
available to meet shareholders.
The Company’s major shareholders are listed, together 
with the information required under the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 7 .2.6, within the Report of the 
Directors on page 31.
Internal Controls
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for the Group’s 
system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness 
and for compliance with the Turnbull guidance. The 
internal control system, which has been in place 
throughout 2010 and up to the date of approval of these 
accounts, is an ongoing process designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks to which the 
Company is exposed. These systems of internal control 
are designed to manage rather than eliminate risks, 
therefore they only provide reasonable, but not absolute 
assurance, against material misstatement or loss in the 
financial statements and of meeting internal control 
objectives. The Directors have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control for the period 
covered by these financial statements, the key features of 
which are as follows:
Management Structure – within operational parameters 
set by the Board, management is delegated to the 
executive Directors. Subsidiaries operate within clearly 
defined policies and authorities contained within a group 
manual under a de-centralised management structure. All 
senior management changes require the prior approval of 
the Chief Executive.
Reporting and Consolidation – all subsidiaries submit 
detailed financial information in accordance with a 
pre-set reporting timetable. This includes weekly,  
bi-monthly and quarterly treasury reports, monthly 
management accounts, annual budgets and two-year 
plans, together with half year and annual statutory 
reporting. The Group’s consolidation process is 
maintained and updated with regular communication, 
including distribution of a group manual to all reporting 
units. The Group monitors and reviews new UK Listing

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Rules, Disclosure and Transparency Rules, accounting 
standards, interpretations and amendments and legislation 
and other statutory requirements. Subsidiary reporting 
entities are supported by instruction from Group and 
structured training. All data is subject to review and 
assessment by management through the monitoring of 
key performance ratios and comparison to targets and 
budgets. The content and format of reporting is kept 
under review and periodically amended to ensure 
appropriate information is available.
Strategic Planning and Budgeting – strategic plans and 
annual budgets containing comprehensive financial 
projections are formally presented to the Board for 
adoption and approval and form the basis for monitoring 
performance. Clearly defined procedures exist for capital 
expenditure proposals and authorisation.
Quality Assurance – most of the business sectors within 
which the Group operates are highly regulated and 
subsidiaries are invariably required to be accredited, by 
the customer or an industry regulator, to national or 
international quality organisations. These organisations 
undertake regular audits and checks on subsidiary 
procedures and practices ensuring compliance with 
regulatory requirements.
Monitoring Process – in addition to reports from external 
auditors, the Audit Committee receives reports from the 
internal auditor and monitors the internal audit process, 
as part of the Group’s internal audit and risk assessment 
programme. An annual programme of internal audit 
assignments is approved by the Audit Committee.
All subsidiaries undertake formal self assessment risk 
reviews a minimum of three times a year on their internal 
control environment. These reviews encompass the 
identification of the key business, financial, compliance 
and operational risks facing the business, together with an 
assessment of the controls in place for managing and 
mitigating these risks. Additionally, risks are evaluated for 
their potential impact on the business. The results of these 
reviews, together with a review of risks facing the Group 
as a whole, are reported to the Board.
Code of Conduct – recently published, the Code of 
Conduct contains policies and procedures covering how 
the Group conducts business and maintains its 
relationships with business partners. The Code of 
Conduct is available on the Company’s website for 
employees and business partners. Compliance with the 
Code will be regularly monitored.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Remuneration Committee Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable laws 
and regulations.
Company Law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors have elected to prepare the Group and parent 
Company financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union (“EU”). Under Company 
Law, the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and apply them 
consistently;
 > make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
 > prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Group’s and Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and the Group and to enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the 
Remuneration Committee Report comply with the 
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. The Directors 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and the Company and for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website, www.huntingplc.com. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Pursuant to the Financial Service Authority’s Listing Rules 
and Disclosure and Transparency Rules, each of the 
Directors, whose names and responsibilities are listed on 
page 29, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge and 
belief:
 > the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of 
the Group and the Company; and
 > the Business Review on pages 6 to 27 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the 
Group’s operations and the position of the Group and 
the Company, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Report of the Auditors
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of 
Hunting PLC 
We have audited the financial statements of Hunting PLC 
for the year ended 31 December 2010 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated 
Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, Company Balance Sheet, Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, Company Statement of 
Changes in Equity, Consolidated and Company Statement 
of Cash Flows, the Principal Accounting Policies and the 
related notes. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the 
parent company financial statements, as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 44, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this  
report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in 
writing.
Scope of the Audit of the Financial Statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.
 
Opinion on Financial Statements 
In our opinion: 
 > the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s 
affairs as at 31 December 2010 and of the Group’s 
profit and Group’s and parent Company’s cash flows 
for the year then ended;
 > the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
 > the parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006; and
 > the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on Other Matters Prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
 > the part of the Remuneration Committee Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
 > the information given in the Report of the Directors for 
the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on Which we are Required to Report by 
Exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
 > adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
 > the parent Company financial statements and the part 
of the Remuneration Committee Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
 > certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or 
 > we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 > the Directors’ statement, set out on page 33, in relation 
to going concern;
 > the parts of the Corporate Governance Report relating 
to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions 
of the June 2008 Combined Code specified for our 
review; and
 > certain elements of the report to shareholders by the 
Board on Directors’ remuneration.

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Basis of Accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as 
adopted by the European Union and IFRIC 
Interpretations. The financial statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis under the historical 
cost convention as modified by the revaluation of 
available for sale financial assets and those financial 
assets and financial liabilities held for trading.
The principal accounting policies applied in the 
preparation of these financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to 
all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments  
and Interpretations
The following new standards, amendments and 
interpretations became effective for and were adopted 
during the year ended 31 December 2010:
 > IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations
 > IAS 27 (revised) Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements
 > Amendment to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged Items
 > Amendment to IFRS 2 – Group Cash-settled Share-
based Payment Transactions
 > Improvements to IFRSs – April 2009
 > IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations is effective for the 
Group for all business combinations which complete after 
31 December 2009. The revised standard introduces 
significant changes to the accounting for business 
acquisitions. All consideration, including contingent 
consideration, is recorded at fair value at the acquisition 
date, with contingent consideration liabilities 
subsequently re-measured through the income statement. 
All acquisition costs are expensed to the income 
statement in the period in which they are incurred. IFRS 
3 (revised) also offers a choice, on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis, to measure any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-
controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. The comparative figures for 2009 
have not been restated on adoption of this standard, as it 
does not impact the Group’s 2009 financial performance 
or position.
Although the adoption of the other standards, 
amendments and interpretations represent a change in 
accounting policy, comparative figures for 2009 have not 
been restated for these, as the changes do not impact the 
financial performance or position of the Group.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective 
Subsequent to the Year End
 > IFRS 9 Financial Instruments*
 > IAS 24 (revised) Related Party Disclosures
 > Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: 
Presentation – Classification of Rights Issues
 > Amendment to IFRIC 14 – Prepayments of a Minimum 
Funding Requirement
 > Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets*
 > Amendment to IAS 12 – Deferred tax: Recovery of 
Underlying Assets*
 > IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with 
Equity Instruments
 > Improvements to IFRSs – May 2010 
* Not yet endorsed by the European Union
It is not anticipated that any of the new requirements will 
significantly impact the Group’s results or financial 
position.
Consolidation
On adoption of IFRS, the Company elected not to restate 
business combinations prior to 1 January 2004. The 
Group accounts include the results of the Company and 
its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies so as 
to obtain benefits from their activities.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on  
which control is transferred to the Group. They are 
de-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to 
account for business combinations. The consideration 
transferred for a business acquisition represents the fair 
values of any assets transferred, liabilities incurred and/or 
equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration 
also includes the fair value of any asset or liability 
resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
The subsequent movement in fair value of any contingent 
asset or liability is measured through the income 
statement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the 
income statement as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. IFRS 3 (revised) offers a 
choice, on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, to measure 
any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair 
value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate 
share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Uniform 
accounting policies have been adopted across the Group.
Non-controlling Interests
Non-controlling interests are those interests in the net 
assets and results of consolidated subsidiaries, which are 
not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Group, and 
are identified separately in shareholders’ equity.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has 
significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor 
an interest in a joint venture. Generally, the Group 
regards an investment in the voting rights of between 
20% and 50% as an associate. The Group’s share of after

tax results of associates is included separately in the 
income statement and the Group’s share of the net assets 
is included separately in the balance sheet.
Discontinued Operations
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group 
that has either been disposed of during the year or that is 
classified as held-for-sale, which represents a separate 
major line of business or geographical area of operations 
and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a 
separate major line of business or geographical area of 
operations. Discontinued operations are presented on  
the income statement as a separate line and are shown 
net of tax.
Revenue
Revenue is measured as the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable for the provision of 
goods or services in the ordinary course of business, 
taking into account trade discounts and volume rebates, 
and is stated net of sales taxes. Revenue is recognised 
when it is probable that the economic benefits associated 
with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount 
of revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are 
rendered. Revenue from product sales is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have 
been transferred to the customer, which is normally on 
delivery of the products.
Long-term contracts are contracts which cover more than 
one accounting period and which do not fall within the 
definition of construction contracts.
Revenue on long-term contracts for the supply of services 
is recognised according to the stage of completion 
reached in the contract by reference to the work done 
during the period. An estimate of the profit attributable to 
work completed is only recognised once the outcome of 
the contract can be reliably measured. Expected losses 
are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable. The 
net amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised 
profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress 
billings is disclosed as trade receivables/payables.
Revenue on long-term contracts for the supply of goods is 
recognised on completion of the contract when the 
significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred 
to the customer. However, if control and the significant 
risks and rewards of ownership of the work in progress in 
its current state are transferred to the customer as 
construction progresses, then revenue is recognised by 
reference to the stage of completion.
Exceptional Items
Exceptional items are regarded as significant items of 
income and expense, which are separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size, incidence or nature to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. 
Exceptional items are principally profits or losses on the 
closure or disposal of subsidiaries, provision for warranties 
on disposal of subsidiaries, the impairment of assets, 
provisions for onerous leases and acquisition costs.
Interest
Interest income and expense is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method, except for 
finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
capitalised as part of the cost of those assets until such 
time as they are substantially ready for their intended use 
or sale.
Foreign Currencies
The financial statements for each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and associates are prepared using their 
functional currency. The functional currency is the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which 
an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group and functional 
currency of Hunting PLC is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional 
currency of the Company are translated at the exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denoted in non-functional 
currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at 
the balance sheet date and any exchange differences 
arising are taken to the income statement.
For consolidation purposes, the net assets of overseas 
subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at 
the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The 
income statements of overseas subsidiaries and associates 
are translated into sterling at the average rates of 
exchange for the year. Exchange differences are 
recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency 
translation reserve, together with exchange differences 
arising on foreign currency loans used to finance overseas 
net investments. The foreign currency translation reserve 
commenced on 1 January 2004 and all cumulative 
translation differences for foreign operations that existed 
on 1 January 2004 were deemed to be zero.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange 
differences previously recognised in the foreign currency 
translation reserve relating to that business are transferred 
to the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on disposal.
Segmental Reporting
Financial information on operating segments that 
corresponds with information regularly reviewed by 
Dennis Proctor, the Chief Operating Decision Maker, is 
disclosed in the accounts. Information on operating 
segments, which are components of the Group that are 
engaged in providing related products, is presented. 
Geographical information presented is based on the 
location of where the sale originated and where the 
non-current assets are located.
Research and Development
Research costs and development costs ineligible for 
capitalisation are written off to the income statement 
as incurred.

Taxation
The taxation charge in the income statement comprises 
current tax and deferred tax arising on the current year’s 
net profits and adjustments to tax arising on prior  
year’s profits.
Current tax is the expected net tax payable arising in the 
current year on the current year’s net profits, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, plus adjustments to net tax payable in respect 
of prior years’ net profits.
Deferred tax is the expected net tax payable on the 
current year’s net profits arising in a future year, using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date that are expected to apply when the related 
deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability 
is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all taxable 
temporary differences. Deferred tax assets and liabilities 
are recognised separately on the balance sheet. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are 
expected to be recoverable and are reported as non-
current assets in line with IAS 1. Consequently, deferred 
tax assets that are expected to be recovered within 
twelve months are recognised within non-current assets.  
The same accounting treatment applies for deferred 
tax liabilities.
If items of income and expense are recognised in other 
comprehensive income, then the current and deferred tax 
relating to those items is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is 
provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
Exploration Expenditure
Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially 
capitalised to wells or fields as appropriate, pending 
determination of the existence of commercial reserves. 
Expenditures incurred during the exploration and 
appraisal phases are written off unless probable 
(“commercial”) reserves have been established or the 
determination process has not been completed. Drilling 
expenditure and directly attributable operational 
overheads associated with an exploratory dry hole are 
expensed immediately upon final determination that 
commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are  
not found.
When an oil or gas field has been approved for 
development, the accumulated exploration and appraisal 
costs are included in oil and gas development properties.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. 
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to 
the acquisition and installation of the items and finance 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
or production of qualifying assets.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of 
assets, other than land or assets under construction, using 
the straight-line method, over their estimated useful lives, 
at the following rates:
 > Freehold buildings – 2% to 10%
 > Leasehold buildings – life of lease
 > Oil and gas exploration and development equipment 
– unit of production
 > Plant, machinery and motor vehicles – 6% to 33
1
∕3%
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are  
reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of  
each reporting period.
Freehold land and expenditure on the exploration for and 
evaluation of mineral resources are not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, 
less any impairment in value. Depreciation of these  
assets commences when the assets are ready for their 
intended use.
Computer software integral to an item of machinery is 
capitalised as part of the hardware.
Property, plant and equipment are impaired if their 
recoverable amount falls below their carrying value. 
Impairment losses are charged to the income  
statement immediately.
Oil and gas development expenditure is stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in 
value. Where commercial production in an area of 
interest has commenced, the capitalised costs are 
depreciated using the unit of production method over the 
total proved reserves of the field concerned. Costs are 
depreciated only when commercial reserves associated 
with a development project can be determined with 
reasonable accuracy and commercial production 
has commenced.
Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed 
to the net assets acquired. Goodwill arises where the fair 
value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of 
the Group’s share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost 
less accumulated impairment losses. Negative goodwill is 
immediately written off to the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the 
purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to 
those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that 
business remaining on the balance sheet at the date of 
disposal is included in the determination of the profit or 
loss on disposal.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 has not 
been reinstated and will not be included in determining 
any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.

Other Intangible Assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses, where 
applicable. These assets have a finite life and are 
amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected 
future economic benefits, or when this cannot be reliably 
estimated, by using the straight-line method. 
Intangible assets are amortised over the following period:
 > General computer software – three to eight years
 > Customer relationships – four to ten years 
 > Patents – seven years
 > Other intangibles – one to eight years
Impairments
The Group carries out impairment reviews in respect of 
goodwill at least annually. The Group also assesses at 
least annually whether there have been any events or 
changes in circumstances that indicate that property, 
plant and equipment and other intangible assets may be 
impaired and an impairment review is carried out 
whenever such an assessment indicates that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. For the purposes of 
impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest 
levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to its 
recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value 
less costs to sell and value in use. Impairments are 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss  
is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying 
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that  
would have been determined, net of depreciation  
or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
previously recognised.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Cost is determined using the first-in-first-
out method and net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course 
of business.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise 
cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with  
a maturity of less than three months from the date of 
deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount  
of cash. Accrued interest is disclosed as part of the 
year-end balance.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash 
equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term 
deposits with a maturity of less than three months from 
the date of deposit. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts 
are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Financial Assets
The Group classifies its financial assets into the following 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or 
loss, loans and receivables, and available for sale 
financial assets. Management determines the 
classification of its investments at initial recognition and 
re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value at the 
trade date, which is normally the consideration paid, 
plus, in the case of financial assets that are not measured 
at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. The 
Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a 
financial asset is impaired by comparing its carrying value 
with the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
discounted at a rate relevant to the nature of the financial 
asset. Management will however use an alternative 
method where this would result in a more accurate fair 
value. If the carrying amount is higher, it is reduced to the 
appropriate value and the loss is recognised immediately 
Financial assets cease to be recognised when the right to 
receive cash flows has expired or has been transferred 
and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks 
and rewards of ownership.
(a) Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are 
included in the income statement in the period in which 
they arise. A financial asset is included in this category if 
acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short-term and also includes derivatives that are not 
designated in a hedge relationship. Assets in this category 
are classified as current assets if they are expected to be 
settled within 12 months, otherwise they are classified as 
non-current assets.
(b) Loans and Receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for 
goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course 
of business. Loans and receivables are carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. If 
collection is expected in one year or less (or in the 
normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are 
classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as 
non-current assets. Interest accrued on loans carried at 
amortised cost is regarded as an integral part of the loan 
balance and therefore included within the carrying 
amount of those loans. Consequently, interest receivable 
within twelve months on loans due after more than one 
year is recognised within non-current assets.
(c) Available for Sale Financial Assets
Available for sale financial assets are held at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity. 
On disposal or impairment, the accumulated gains and 
losses previously recognised in equity are recognised in 
the income statement. Available for sale financial assets 
are non-derivative assets that are either designated in this 
category or not classified in any other categories.
Financial Liabilities
Financial liabilities, including trade payables, are initially 
recognised at fair value at the trade date which is 
normally the consideration received less, in the case of 
financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
through profit or loss, transaction costs. The Group 
subsequently re-measures all of its non-derivative 
financial liabilities, including trade payables, at 
amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is 
due within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of 
the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities.
Interest accrued on loans that are measured at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method is regarded as  
an integral part of the loan balance and therefore 
included within the carrying amount of those loans. 
Consequently, interest payable within twelve months  
on loans due after more than one year is recognised  
in non-current borrowings.
Debt Issue Costs
When it is probable that some or all of the loan facility 
will be drawn down, transaction costs are capitalised and 
amortised through interest expense using the effective 
interest method. When it is not probable that some or all 
of the loan facility will be drawn down, the facility fee is 
capitalised as a prepayment for services and amortised 
over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Derivatives and Financial Instruments
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value as net 
proceeds received or consideration paid at the trade date 
and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at 
each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that have not been 
designated in a hedge relationship are recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Derivative and primary financial instruments that are 
designated in a hedge relationship are accounted for as 
cash flow hedges. Hedges of highly probable forecast 
transactions are cash flow hedges. The effective portion 
of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in a 
cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity. The 
gains and losses relating to the ineffective portion are 
recognised in the income statement. Amounts 
accumulated in equity are taken to the income statement 
at the same time the hedged item is recognised in the 
income statement. When a forecast transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains and losses 
that were reported in equity are immediately transferred 
to the income statement.
All of the Group’s hedges to which hedge accounting is 
applied, are tested for effectiveness prospectively and 
retrospectively and are fully documented as hedges at the 
point of inception of the hedge relationship.
Embedded Derivatives
An embedded derivative is a feature in a sales or 
purchase contract that causes the cash flows of the 
contract to change whenever there is a change in a 
specified variable. The Group reviews its sales and 
purchase contracts when they first become a party to the 
contract in order to determine the existence of embedded 
derivatives within them.
Derivatives that are embedded within a host contract are 
separated from that contract and measured at fair value 
unless either (1) the host contract is measured at fair 
value, in which case the fair value of the derivative is 
subsumed within the fair value of the entire contract,  
or (2) the derivative is closely related to the host contract, 
in which case the derivative is measured at cost.  
An embedded derivative is regarded as not closely 
related to its host contract when the cash flows it 
modifies are associated with risks that are not inherent  
in the contract itself.
Subsequent reassessment of whether an embedded 
derivative is required to be separated from the host 
contract is prohibited unless there is a change in the 
contract’s terms.
Leases
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the 
lessee. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded 
in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at 
the lower of their fair value and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments and depreciated over the 
shorter of their estimated useful lives and their lease 
terms. The corresponding rental obligations are included 
in borrowings as finance lease liabilities, initially at a 
value equal to the fair value of the leased asset, or if 
lower, at a value equal to the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Interest incurred on finance 
leases is charged to the income statement on an 
accruals basis.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental of 
these is charged to the income statement as incurred over 
the life of the lease on a straight-line basis. Operating 
lease income is recognised in the income statement 
within other income as it is earned.
Provisions
Provisions are liabilities where the amount or timing of 
future expenditure is uncertain. Provisions are recognised 
when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a 
past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate 
can be made of the obligation. If the time value of  
money is material, provisions are discounted to their 
present value.
If an obligation is not capable of being reliably estimated 
it is classified as a contingent liability.
Employee Benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are 
charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the expected 
cost of providing benefits is determined using the 
Projected Unit Method, with valuations updated annually 
by qualified independent actuaries at each balance sheet 
date. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in 
the period in which they occur, in the statement of 
comprehensive income. The asset or liability recognised 
in the balance sheet represents the present value of the

defined benefit obligation, as offset by the fair value of 
plan assets. Interest arising on the present value of the 
defined benefit obligation and the expected return on the 
plan’s assets is recognised, as a net figure, within interest 
in the income statement.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent 
that the benefits are already vested and is otherwise 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period 
until the benefits become vested.
All cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 January 
2004 have been recognised in reserves.
The expected cost of post-employment benefit 
obligations is spread evenly over the period of service of 
the employees.
Share-based Payments
The Group issues cash-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees as consideration for services received 
from the employees. A liability equal to the portion of the 
services received is recognised at its current fair value, 
determined at each balance sheet date. The fair value of 
the liability is re-measured at each subsequent reporting 
date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in 
fair value recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is 
measured as the present value of the future cash flows.
The Group also issues equity-settled share-based 
payments to certain employees as consideration for 
services received from the employees. The fair value of 
the employees’ services is recognised as an expense in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period based on the Group’s estimate of awards 
that will ultimately vest. 
The fair value of employees’ services is determined by an 
external valuer, using the Monte Carlo valuation model, 
with reference to the grant date fair value of the options 
granted. The fair value includes market performance 
conditions in respect of the performance based awards 
and excludes the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is 
reviewed at each balance sheet date and at the vesting 
date, where the estimate is adjusted to reflect current 
expectations. The adjustment is included as part of the 
underlying expense recognised in the income statement. 
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting 
date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has been applied from 
1 January 2004 to grants of equity instruments  
issued after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 
1 January 2005.
Share Capital
The Company’s share capital comprises a single class of 
Ordinary shares, which are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the 
proceeds, net of tax.
Treasury Shares
Treasury shares are stated at cost and presented as a 
deduction from equity attributable to owners of the 
parent. Consideration received for the sale of these shares 
is also recognised directly in equity, with any difference 
between the proceeds from the sale and the original cost 
being taken directly to retained earnings.
Dividend Distributions
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders  
are recognised as liabilities in the Group’s financial 
statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the Company’s shareholders and are dealt 
with in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Interim 
dividends are recognised when paid.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires 
management to make judgements and assumptions about 
the future, resulting in the use of accounting estimates. 
These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual 
results and adjustments will consequently be necessary. 
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, 
consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of 
future events.
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the 
carrying amounts of the following significant assets and 
liabilities: employee benefits (as detailed in note 32), 
goodwill (note 16), share-based payments (as detailed in 
note 39), provisions (fair value of obligation and discount 
rate as detailed in note 31) and deferred taxation (timing 
of liabilities and timing and recoverability of assets as 
detailed in note 22). Deferred tax balances are derived 
from assumptions, which include the future utilisation of 
trading losses and provisions at assumed tax rates.
In respect of the sale of Gibson Energy, accounting 
estimates and judgements have been applied in 
determining (i) the fair value of the outstanding equity 
warrant (note 19), which is based on published financial 
data and management’s best estimate of the recoverable 
amount, given the legal terms of the equity warrant and 
prevailing economic conditions, and (ii) provisions for tax 
indemnities, where the timing and amount of any 
provisions that may be payable remains uncertain.

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
1. Segmental Reporting
The Group reports on six operating segments in its internal management reports. The Group’s segments are strategic 
business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies, the aviation and 
shipping sector.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas 
wells along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication 
infrastructure build-out.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and 
gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and 
restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Group’s oil and gas exploration and production activities in the 
Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London. Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are 
actively shipped along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain. Gibson Shipbrokers is also involved in the 
shipping of liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”), petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).
Field Aviation is an aircraft service organisation providing modification, installation, distribution, maintenance and 
manufacturing services for regional, business and government operators worldwide.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting 
purposes to Dennis Proctor, the Chief Operating Decision Maker. 
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before 
any exceptional items. Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group. Inter-segment 
sales are priced on an arm’s length basis. Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the operating 
segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.

The impairment charge of £5.3m relates to the write down of oil and gas development expenditure, largely due to a 
change in the discount rate used to value the oil and gas reserves and a fall in commodity prices during the year.  
The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use. These calculations use 
discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income 
attributable to such reserves. Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.  
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% compared to 8% in 2009, the change having an impairment 
impact of £1.2m in the year. The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the 
long-term average oil price assumed to be US$90.97 bbl (2009 – US$88.01 bbl) and the long-term average gas price  
at US$5.10 mcf (per 1,000 cubic feet). A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$6.63 mcf in 2009, 
together with a review of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of £4.1m in the year.
The Group has released £0.1m (2009 – £1.5m) of surplus provisions relating to warranties given in respect of a 
former subsidiary.

13. Results for the Financial Year
In accordance with the exemption allowed by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented 
its own statement of comprehensive income. A profit of £44.3m (2009 – £24.6m) has been accounted for in the 
financial statements of the Company.
14. Earnings per Share 
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume 
conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares. The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise 
price is less than the average market price of the Company’s Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of 
shares under the Group’s long-term incentive plans.

The impairment charge includes the write down of oil and gas development expenditure of £5.3m, largely due to a 
change in the discount rate used to value the oil and gas reserves and a fall in commodity prices during the year. The 
recoverable amount of the oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use. These calculations use 
discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income 
attributable to such reserves. Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.  
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10%, compared to 8% in 2009, resulting in an impairment impact 
of £1.2m. The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the long-term average oil 
price assumed to be US$90.97 bbl (2009 – US$88.01 bbl) and the long-term average price of gas US$5.10 per mcf  
(per 1,000 cubic feet). A decline in the long-term average gas price from US$6.63 mcf in 2009, together with a review 
of oil and gas reserves, resulted in an impairment impact of £4.1m in the year.
Oil and gas exploration and development includes expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of mineral 
resources, which is recognised at cost and is not depreciated. The amount recognised in cost at 31 December 2010 is 
£nil (2009 – £nil), including additions during the year of £3.1m (2009 – £nil) and an impairment loss of £3.1m 
(2009 – £nil).
The balance of the £8.9m impairment of assets comprises a £0.5m property impairment in Hunting Energy Services.
Plant, machinery and motor vehicles include £nil (2009 – £0.2m) being the net book amount of the capital element of 
assets held under finance leases after accumulated depreciation of £0.1m (2009 – £nil).
Included in the net book amount is expenditure relating to assets in the course of construction of £6.3m (2009 – £7 .3m) 
for freehold land and buildings, £2.8m (2009 – £2.7m) for oil and gas exploration and development, £0.9m (2009 – £nil) 
for plant and machinery and £0.3m (2009 – £nil) for short leasehold buildings.

Net book amount 100.3 54.9
The net book amount at 1 January 2009 was £29.3m.
Goodwill for 2009 has been restated to recognise additional goodwill of £0.8m on the acquisition of the Welltonic 
group of companies in December 2009, which is reported as part of the Well Intervention segment.
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of 
the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows:
2010  
£m
Restated  
2009  
£m
Continuing operations:
Well Construction 60.3 15.6
Well Completion 6.4 6.3
Well Intervention 32.4 31.8
Gibson Shipbrokers 1.2 1.2
Total 100.3 54.9
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations. These calculations use discounted 
pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are 
based on past experience and order books. Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated 
growth rates between 3% and 5%, which decline over time. The growth rate reflects the products, industries and 
countries in which the relevant CGU operates.
Cash flows are discounted using pre-tax rates between 8.9% and 12.3% (2009 – 8%). The discount rate best reflects 
the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU. Consideration has also 
been given to other risks such as currency risk and country risk.
Having performed a sensitivity analysis, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key 
assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

£m
2009  
£m
Unlisted equity investments 0.2 0.2
Equity warrant 44.9 29.6
45.1 29.8
The equity warrant formed part of the consideration for the disposal of Gibson Energy ULC (“Gibsons”) in 2008 and 
had a carrying value of £29.6m at 31 December 2009.
Gibsons started publishing financial information publicly for the first time in 2010, which the Group used to perform a 
valuation of the equity warrant as at 31 December 2010, based on a multiple applied to Gibsons’ reported EBITDA. 
This valuation technique used a significant number of unobservable inputs, including management’s views about the 
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the equity warrant, such as its marketability and Gibsons’ 
maintainable earnings. In light of the public availability of financial information and an improving global economic 
outlook, together suggesting an improving financial performance of Gibsons, the Group was able to conclude a revised 
fair value of £44.9m.
The £15.3m (2009 – £1.3m) increase in the fair value of the equity warrant during the year has been recognised in 
other comprehensive income as separately disclosed within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. 
This comprises £12.8m (2009 – £nil) due to the revaluation of the equity warrant at 31 December 2010 and £2.5m 
(2009 – £1.3m) due to foreign exchange differences.
Management consider that changing certain inputs, such as Gibsons’ EBITDA and the earnings multiple, to reasonably 
possible alternative assumptions, would change the fair value of the equity warrant significantly. A 10% variance in 
Gibsons’ EBITDA would have an estimated impact of £10m on the value of the equity warrant and a 10% variation in 
the earnings multiple would have a similar impact.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2010 is the fair value of the financial assets of £45.1m 
(2009 – £29.8m), see note 29.

The principal subsidiaries are detailed in note 46.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of the investments is supported by their underlying net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost, which is the fair value of the consideration paid, less impairments.
The reversal of impairment of £0.1m and the impairment charge of £1.5m in 2009 related to a non-trading subsidiary 
that had incurred losses and which the Directors did not expect to be fully recovered in the foreseeable future. The 
investment has been stated at the subsidiary’s net asset value, being the Directors’ estimate of the recoverable amount.

Trade receivables that are not past due and not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent 
history of default or any indications that the customers will not meet their payment obligations. At the year end  
there are no trade receivables (2009 – none) whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past  
due or impaired.
Derivative financial instruments have been acquired from financial institutions and these are expected to be  
fully recovered.
At 31 December 2010, trade receivables of £28.5m (2009 – £18.9m) and other receivables of £nil (2009 – £0.5m) were

21. Trade and Other Receivables (continued)
At 31 December 2010, £0.5m (2009 – £nil) of trade receivables were not past due but were impaired and £1.2m  
(2009 – £1.9m) were past due and were impaired.
Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or 
concerns have been raised about the customer’s liquidity. Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
At 31 December 2010, other receivables of £nil (2009 – £nil) were not past due but were impaired and £0.1m  
(2009 – £0.1m) were past due and impaired and a provision of £0.1m (2009 – £0.1m) was made following evidence  
that the amounts would not be collectable under the original terms of the receivable.

customer base. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable, as shown in note 29.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any 
collateral previously held.

None (2009 – none) of the Company’s trade and other receivables were past due at the year end and the Company 
does not consider it necessary to provide for any impairments. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the 
fair value of each class of receivable, as shown in note 29. The Company does not hold any collateral as security and 
no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previously held.

29. Derivatives and Financial Instruments
Currency derivatives
The Group has used currency swaps, spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge 
its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year. 
At 31 December 2010, the total notional amount of the Group’s outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is  
£12.1m (2009 – £15.2m).
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement. 
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a £0.2m loss  
(2009 – £3.0m loss) have been recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using 
forward foreign exchange contracts. These forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next 
twelve months. Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward foreign exchange contracts at 
31 December 2010 will be recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged 
forecast transaction affects the income statement. 
Gains of £0.6m (2009 – £0.8m gain) were recognised in the hedging reserve (note 34) during the year. Gains of £0.1m 
(2009 – £2.3m losses) were removed from equity during the year and were included in revenue in the income 
statement. Ineffectiveness of £nil (2009 – £nil) arose on the cash flow hedges during the year.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows 
calculated by reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates. The carrying values of available for sale 
unlisted investments are based on the Directors’ best estimate of fair value as there is no active market in which these 
are traded. The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year 
end exchange rate.

and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet.

Gibsons started publishing financial information publicly for the first time in 2010, which the Group used to perform a 
valuation of the equity warrant as at 31 December 2010, based on a multiple applied to Gibsons’ reported EBITDA. 
This valuation technique used a significant number of unobservable inputs, including management’s views about the 
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the equity warrant (see note 19).

30. Financial Risk Factors
The Group’s activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest 
risk and cash flow interest risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s risk management strategy seeks to mitigate 
potential adverse effects on its financial performance. As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial 
instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, 
with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign 
currency and interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash. 
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the 
Group for funding, the investment of surplus cash, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk 
management. It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the 
Group’s operating companies.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating  
activities, particularly in respect of US dollars. Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows  
and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the  
Group’s local operations.
(i) Transactional risk
The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward 
foreign exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps. Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have 
been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions. Operating companies prepare 
quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified. 
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity. Exposures arising from 
committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified. The currency flows to be hedged are 
committed foreign currency transactions greater than £250,000 equivalent per month and/or currency flows that in 
aggregate exceed £500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.

30. Financial Risk Factors (continued)
The table below shows the carrying values of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative 
financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the 
following year. The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge and 
loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences 
arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

The US dollar denominated financial instruments consist mainly of trade receivables and inter-group loans and the 
Canadian dollar denominated financial instruments consist mainly of tax provisions and inter-group loans.
(ii) Translational risk
Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Group’s investments in foreign operations. Average rate options are used to 
reduce translation risk on the Group’s consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% 
of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling. These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
(b) Interest rate risk
Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits and overdrafts expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed 
interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The treasury function manages the 
Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps, caps and floors, when considered appropriate.
The Group needs to ensure that sufficient liquid funds are available to support its working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions. During the year, cash was, therefore, invested by the treasury 
function in AAA rated, instant access Money Market Funds and in fixed-rate bank deposits, with terms of between 
overnight and four months. As the funds were invested for short periods of time, the interest yield on these was 
relatively low. However, the preservation of the Group’s net cash took priority over earning high interest yields.
(c) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, 
investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties. Credit risk exposure is 
continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course 
of the Group’s activities. Financing transactions are with leading financial institutions, which have Fitch long-term 
ratings between A+ and AA, and no losses are expected from non-performance of these counterparties.
Cash is only invested with financial institutions approved by the Board. Exposure limits are set for each approved 
counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into. Approved institutions all have a minimum 
of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating and AAA rating for Money Market Funds from Standard and Poors, Moodys or 
Fitch rating agencies.

30. Financial Risk Factors (continued)
Cash and cash equivalents of £268.7m (2009 – £403.6m) and investments of £2.5m (2009 – £nil) have been  
deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1+ and AAA rated Money Market Funds and are expected  
to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the  
credit risk limit set for each counterparty. Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value  
of the instrument. Net derivative financial assets of £0.5m (2009 – £0.1m) have been taken out with financial 
institutions, which have Fitch short-term ratings of F1+ and are expected to be fully recovered.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored. Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality 
of the customer and past experience through trading relationships. To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding 
receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Company operates a pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with pension plan assets of £5.5m 
(2009 – £8.0m). The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity 
policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated. The pension buy-in has been affected by 
using three insurers, so as to spread its credit risk. The credit ratings of these insurers is monitored.
(d) Liquidity risk
The Group needs to ensure that is has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements and to fund acquisitions. All subsidiaries submit weekly, bi-monthly and quarterly treasury 
reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Group’s requirements.
The Group has sufficient net cash and credit facilities to meet both its long- and short-term requirements.
The credit facilities totalled £153.9m (2009 – £181.9m) and comprise £120.0m (2009 – £135.0m) of committed facilities 
and £33.9m (2009 – £46.9m) of uncommitted facilities. All of these facilities are unsecured and are provided by a 
variety of funding sources.
The committed facilities comprise a £120.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of three banks. The £120.0m 
multi-currency loan facility expires on 25 October 2013. A commitment fee of 0.6% is payable on the undrawn amount.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year end:
2010

2009  
£m
Floating rate:
Expiring within one year – 135.0
Expiring between two and five years 120.0 –

Surplus funds have been placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.
The tables below analyse the Group’s and Company’s non-derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity 
groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date of the financial 
liabilities and the amounts are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows. The carrying amounts in the balance sheet are 
the discounted amounts. Balances due within one year have been included in the maturity analysis at their carrying 
amounts, as the impact of discounting is not significant.

30. Financial Risk Factors (continued)
(e) Sensitivity analysis 
The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Group’s 
and Company’s financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders’ equity. Financial 
instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity 
analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2010.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net cash, the ratio of fixed to floating interest 
rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged 
from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2010.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other 
post-retirement obligations, provisions (but including onerous leases) and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of 
foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 > Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Group’s results, that is, an 
increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
 > The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.

Hunting PLC  Annual Report and Accounts 2010
31. Provisions (continued)
The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading 
purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties. The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of 
future conditions in the sub-letting market. It is expected that £2.4m of the provision will be utilised in 2011, £2.6m in 
2012 and the remaining balance of £12.5m utilised from 2013 to 2023. Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a 
risk-free rate of between 1% and 4% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Group’s obligation to dismantle, remove and restore 
items of property, plant and equipment. The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs 
expected to arise in meeting this obligation. The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of one to fifteen years.
Following the disposal of Gibson Energy in 2008, the Group recognised a provision for tax indemnities. These 
provisions are expected to be utilised in 2011.
The Group expects the other provisions of £0.1m to be fully utilised in 2011.
32. Post Employment Benefits
Pensions
Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits 
linked to final salary and a defined contribution section. With effect from 31 December 2002, the defined benefit 
section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section. The 
majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Scheme’s defined benefits are now covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related 
risks have largely been eliminated. This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year. 
However, the obligation ultimately rests with the Group. During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the 
existing insurance policies to secure further benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme is produced and updated annually to 31 December 2010 by 
independent qualified actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation assumes that benefits at present continue to be linked to the RPI 
measure of inflation. The Trustees of the Scheme are seeking clarification on how the Government’s recent 
announcement relating to the minimum level of increases that must be provided will impact the Scheme.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were:
2010 2009
Annual rates
Rate of increase in salaries 5.6% 5.7%
Rate of increase in pensions 3.6% 3.7%
Discount rate 5.4% 5.6%
Inflation 3.6% 3.7%
The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality. The mortality table implies 
that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.1 years (2009 – 24.0 years) and an expected 
future lifetime of 27.3 years (2009 – 27 .1 years) for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time. The mortality table implies that 
a 65 year old female currently has an expected future lifetime of 25.7 years (2009 – 25.6 years) and an expected future 
lifetime of 27.6 years (2009 – 27.5 years) for a female reaching 65 in 20 years time. Based upon past experience, 
pension increases have been assumed to be in line with inflation.
Long-term rates of return expected at 31 December:
2010 2009
Annual rates
Insurance annuity policies 5.4% 5.6%
Equities n/a 8.2%
Bonds 4.2% 4.4%
Other 4.2% 4.4%
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as management’s best estimate of the long-term return 
on the major asset classes – insurance annuity policies, bonds and other – weighted by the actual allocation of assets at 
the measurement date. The expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.

32. Post Employment Benefits (continued)
For 2010 the actual return on the plan’s assets amounted to a gain of £9.9m (2009 – £49.7m). The gain arising as a 
result of the increase of the value placed on the insurance annuity policies is offset by a corresponding increase in the 
value placed on the corresponding liabilities. The effect is seen in the actuarial losses on the defined benefit obligations 
stated above.

37. Capital Risk Management
The Group’s capital consists of equity. At the year end, total equity was £594.6m (2009 – £561.8m).
It is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Group’s activities, having 
due regard to interest rate and currency risks and the availability of borrowing facilities. The gearing ratio, which is net 
debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is monitored regularly against both internal targets and external 
covenant requirements. However, the Group had net cash at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
The Group needs to ensure that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with to ensure that borrowing 
facilities remain in place. The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements 
were met during the year.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, rights issues of share capital. The Group’s 
net cash/debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital 
expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.

39. Share-based Payments
Executive Share Options
The Company operates an executive share option scheme which grants options to eligible employees. Vesting of 
options granted is subject to the achievement of performance targets, as described in the Remuneration Committee’s 
Report, over a three year period. Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which 
to exercise the option.

Options are valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted to model the particular 
features of the options. The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only relates to 
options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, are as follows:
Date of grant 04.03.2008 06.03.2007 08.03.2006 09.03.2005

31 December 2009 75% 75% 100% 100%
31 December 2010 75% 100% 100% 100%
The assumption for early exercise is 50% when options are 20% in the money.
The expected volatility is calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to 
each grant date.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is £0.6m (2009 – £0.6m) and is recognised 
as part of operating expenses.

39. Share-based Payments (continued)
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Under the PSP annual conditional awards of shares may be made to executive Directors and senior employees. Awards 
are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period. The PSP is a share award 
scheme and as such there is no exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance over a three year 
period from date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services 
sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP award movements during the year are set out below:
2010  
Number  
of awards
2009  
Number

Outstanding at beginning of the year 182,038 –

Lapsed during the year (18,767) –
Outstanding at the end of the year 450,112 182,038

Date of grant:

26 February 2010 282,135 – 25.02.13
Outstanding at the end of the year 450,112 182,038
The fair value of the PSP award granted in 2010 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model (also known as the 
“Monte Carlo” model), which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows:
2010 2009
Assumptions:
Weighted average share price at grant 587.5p 444.25p
Expected volatility – Hunting PLC 44.4% 44.4%
Expected volatility – Comparator group 58.3% 57.1%
Risk free rate 1.8% 1.9%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 401.64p 251.47p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the 
performance period at the date of grant. The expected volatilities of each constituents of the comparator group are calculated 
on the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free 
rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award. It is 
accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition. This is 
factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting was 645.0p.
The accounting charge of the PSP is adjusted for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse  
for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period and forfeit a proportion of their award.  
The estimate of the expected forfeiture lapse rate is 2.5% per annum.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is £0.4m (2009 – £0.1m), which is recognised in operating 
expenses.

Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”)
Under the RSP, annual conditional awards of shares may be made to employees subject to continued employment 
during the vesting period. There are no performance conditions attached to these awards. The RSP is a share award 
scheme and as such there is no exercise price.
Details of the RSP award movements during the year are set out below:

Lapsed during the year (28,345) (8,017)
Outstanding at the end of the year 432,419 243,134
The weighted average share price at the date of vesting was 502.0p (2009 – 565.9p).

Outstanding at the end of the year 432,419 243,134
The fair value of the RSP award granted in 2010 was calculated using the Black Scholes pricing model. The assumptions 
used in the model were as follows:
2010 2009
Assumptions:
Weighted average share price at grant 587.5p 444.25p
Expected volatility 44.4% 44.4%
Risk free rate 1.8% 1.9%
Expected life 3 years 3 years
Fair value 587.5p 444.25p
The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years to grant, equal in length to the 
remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period. The risk free 
rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award. It is 
accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the employee remaining in employment. This is factored 
into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The accounting charge of the RSP is adjusted for an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse  
for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period and forfeit a proportion of their award.  
The estimate of the expected forfeiture lapse rate is 2.5% per annum.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the RSP is £0.6m (2009 – £0.3m), which is recognised in  
operating expenses.
Long-term Incentive Plan
The Group operates a Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) for key executives.
LTIP awards may be settled in shares or cash. Details of awards made under this plan are contained within the 
Remuneration Committee’s Report on page 35.

Hunting PLC is an international 
energy services provider that 
manufactures and distributes 
products that enable the 
extraction of oil and gas for  
the world’s leading companies.
o ur business is made up of three key divisions:
provision of products and services 
to operators in the drilling phase  
of exploration and production 
programmes. t ypically the Company 
provides casing and o il Country 
t ubular Goods (“o Ct G”) in the 
construction of the wellbore in an 
oil and gas well; in-house design 
(Seal-l ock ™) and threading of 
premium connections are well 
suited to the deeper and more 
challenging offshore environments 
as well as onshore shale plays.
t he acquisition of innova-extel adds a 
significant electronic capability to our 
core mechanical competence.
t he Company is also an innovator in 
the design, manufacture and leasing 
of mud motors and associated 
drilling tools such as non-magnetic 
collars, which improve drilling time 
in certain geological conditions.  
t he a nnular pressure r elease 
System (“apr S”) adds significant 
value to the customer.
w ell Construction
Global manufacturing of accessories 
and completion equipment for the 
world’s principle producing regions. 
providing products, proprietary 
technologies, engineering expertise 
and services below the wellhead.
o Ct G supply, advanced 
manufacturing techniques, high 
specification casing and premium 
connections for global markets and 
two-step tubing for the u S. Speciality 
threading, oem manufacturing and 
proprietary downhole tools used by 
the upstream oil and gas companies. 
Clear-r un™ technology provides a 
significant advantage in performance 
for running tubing in zero emission 
environments.
w ell Completion
equipment manufacturing, supply 
and service for the maintenance  
and restoration of producing oil and 
gas wells. t he growth of this division 
by organic means and through 
acquisition has allowed for the 
integration of an extensive range  
of pressure control equipment 
technologies, wireline and slickline 
tools, together with intervention 
expertise into the Hunting portfolio.
t he capability has recently been 
strengthened further by the 
acquisition of n ational Coupling 
Company, a leader in subsea 
systems for Chemical injection, 
hydraulic valves, couplings and 
associated equipment. t his was 
further enhanced by the acquisition 
of w elltonic in December 2009 to 
form the Hunting w elltonic group  
of companies. Hunting w elltonic  
is widely regarded as one of  
the leading t hru-t ubing service 
providers at the forefront of 
supplying downhole tools to coiled 
tubing operations worldwide.

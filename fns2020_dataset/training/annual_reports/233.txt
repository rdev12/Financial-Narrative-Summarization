Chairman’s statement
Peter Sechiari Chairman
The 	 Board 	 is 	 pleased 	 to 	 report	
another 	 period 	 of 	 solid 	 results,	
despite	challenging	market	conditions
During the period, ACM has continued to 
make strong progress, and the Board is 
pleased to report the results that have been 
achieved against a backdrop of historically 
weak freight rates. The Group’s global 
infrastructure, which has been built over 
recent years, is now well positioned to take 
advantage of existing markets as well as 
potential increases in the volume of 
commodity shipping. 
Results
The results for the year to 31 March 2011 are 
broadly in line with expectations and the Group 
is pleased to report revenue of US$45.7 million 
(2010: US$41.1 million), while profit before 
amortisation and taxation and adjusted for minority 
interest was £6.5 million (2010: £6.6 million). 
Margins have reduced mainly due to our 
investment into a new global dry cargo 
broking division.
The Group’s cash position remains strong,  
with £5.0 million and no debt (2010: £4.3 million).
Dividend
In line with the Board’s confidence in the 
longer-term prospects for the Group, the 
progressive dividend strategy has been 
maintained and the Directors are recommending 
a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 
of 7.0 pence, making a total of 10.0 pence per 
share for the year (2010: 9.5 pence per share), 
which is covered two and a half times by adjusted 
earnings. The final dividend is payable on 
7 October 2011 to shareholders on the register 
as at 9 September 2011. 
Strategy
Over recent years the Board has worked hard 
to put in place the foundations for future growth, 
and the Group’s strategy is very much on track. 
With divisions performing well across our 
international offices, the Board believes that the 
Group has the right structure in place to achieve 
ACM’s stated strategy of building a successful 
global integrated shipbroking business.
The Group’s dry cargo shipbroking business, 
which was acquired in June 2010, is now 
integrating successfully. The Board is confident 
that this business will prove a good investment 
for future growth. 
The Group will be moving to new premises 
in London in August 2011, which will provide 
additional space for further expansion.

Employees
The Board would like to thank all of our employees 
for their dedication and contribution to another 
year of significant achievement. ACM remains 
committed to recruiting, retaining and developing 
the best people and our committed and talented 
employees will play a critical role in the Group’s 
success going forward.
Prospects
ACM continues to be well placed to take 
advantage of the commodity markets and has 
diversified into dry cargo shipbroking which we 
expect will continue to grow and enhance our 
future earnings. The Group is also focused on 
continuing to build on its robust position in 
ACM’s core business of tanker broking.
Whilst the current trading environment remains 
challenging, the medium and longer-term 
prospects for the Group remain strong. 
Peter Sechiari
Chairman
22 July 2011
Expansion
The Board is confident that we 
currently have the right structure 
and teams in place and we 
continue to look for opportunities 
to expand our global shipbroking 
network further.
ACM’s 	 strategy 	 is	
robust 	 and 	 the 	 Group	
continues to gain 
market share across 
its 	 divisions 06 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Chief Executive’s review
ACM has set out its strategic aim to become 
an integrated shipbroking service provider 
and the Board feels that with a presence 
in key international markets, combined with 
its diverse operations, the Group has all of 
the fundamentals in place to achieve this. 
The Board is pleased to have achieved these 
results in a challenging market and having made 
a significant investment in our new dry cargo 
division. Despite the current global market 
conditions that are restricting ACM’s profit, the 
Board remains confident that the Group has the 
right strategy to achieve considerable growth once 
market rates improve, given the high volumes 
of fixtures that are being successfully secured. 
Spot brokerage
The spot brokerage desk, ACM’s principal business, 
which involves the hire of a ship for a single 
voyage, had a strong year with revenue up 20% 
over last year. The number of spot fixtures has 
increased by 14% compared to last year, excluding 
small tankers and dry cargo. The Group’s small 
tanker broking desk also had a successful year. 
Although rates improved in the third quarter of 
last year, they have remained weak for much 
of the period.
The volume of fixtures continues to increase, 
and our network of global offices is working 
together well in a cyclical shipping market that 
has been at its lowest level for some time. Within 
the Group there is optimism that freight rates 
will improve and ACM is well positioned to benefit 
from any upward market movements.
Time charter
The time charter business involves the long-term 
hire of tankers. As previously reported, the forward 
order book for the time charter business has 
reduced as a result of market conditions. 
Consequently this division has declined by 21%, 
as it is difficult to conclude deals at current market 
rates. However , the market structure is now showing 
signs that there will be more volume of long-term 
business concluded, which will prompt more 
charterers to secure tonnage on time charter 
and ACM expects to benefit from this. 
Sale and purchase
The sale and purchase business, which involves 
the sale and purchase of new and older ships, 
declined slightly by 5% compared to the same 
period last year , as this business was also impacted 
by the weak market conditions. The Shanghai 
office is now starting to contribute to the Group, 
and as rates improve this division should return 
to positive growth. 
Dry cargo
The acquisition of Endeavour Shipbrokers, the 
Australian dry cargo business, on 24 June 2010 
has successfully diversified the Group’s earnings 
and enhanced its offering to its clients. This 
acquisition is highly complementary to the 
Group’s new dry cargo venture in UK and China 
which was launched during the year.
The dry cargo business is performing well although 
freight rates are weak. However, the global fleets 
of dry cargo vessels are being employed and 
absorbed in line with an increase in commodity 
transportation. ACM’s expansion into Australia, 
ACM Endeavour , has performed well with the volume 
of deals meeting management expectations, 
although earnings have been affected by the 
current market rates. International synergies 
throughout our network are now occurring with 
the London, Shanghai and Australian desks

Notice of AGM
starting to collaborate and this approach will be 
further strengthened with the planned opening 
of the Singapore desk in autumn 2011.
Gas/LPG
ACM is pleased with the small London-based 
broking team that the Group has set up for gas/
LPG shipbroking. This is an interesting and 
expanding area of shipping as worldwide gas 
consumption is forecast for significant growth 
in the future. ACM has ambitions for further 
expansion into gas shipbroking.
Overseas operations
One of ACM’s core strengths is the Group’s 
international presence, as it can offer its clients 
excellent local knowledge in the key regions for 
the sector, supported by global infrastructure. 
ACM’s global expansion continues with the 
Australian venture, which is integrating 
successfully into the Group, and is starting 
to work effectively with our dry cargo desks 
in London and China. Our Singapore business 
is performing particularly well following the 
Group’s investment in this region. The Group’s 
offices in India and China show considerable 
promise although expansion in these areas is 
being undertaken with caution given the 
complexities of the local markets. All of our 
international offices work closely together and 
are backed by a strong research team so as to 
provide ACM’s clients with a first class service.
Financial derivatives
The Group’s joint venture with GFI Group, Inc. (GFI) 
to conduct derivative brokerage continues to 
make steady progress and is achieving good 
volumes; however, this business is also closely 
related to freight rates, and has therefore been 
affected by the weakness in the market. This joint 
venture desk with GFI concludes some 40% of 
the world’s tanker freight derivative market and 
has proved to be of great benefit to the physical 
tanker broking desk. The Board believes that 
this business is a valuable addition to ACM’s 
offering and it continues to add value to the Group. 
The market
The strong global demand for oil continues to 
grow, and with a forecast of 1.3 million barrels 
per day growth in 2011, followed by an average 
of 1.2 million barrels per day growth over the 
subsequent five years (Source: IEA). This compares 
favourably with the average growth seen between 
2004 and 2008 of 0.8 million barrels per day. 
Comparing its outlook for oil consumption, 
local production and new refinery additions, 
the IEA has identified significant growth in 
Chinese and other non-OECD Asian demand 
for Middle Eastern and West African crude oil, 
comfortably offsetting falls it expects to see in 
OECD Asian and US imports from both regions 
and adding significantly to tanker employment. 
Japanese oil import demand has been revised 
upward since its earthquake as power-generation 
and reconstruction-related boost demand from 
both crude oil and refined products.
The Group anticipates that the majority of the 
ships over 20 years old will be prompted to exit 
the spot market over the coming five years as a 
result of the significant restrictions to trade, as 
oil majors continue to raise quality standards. 
This will be offset by the delivery of new tankers. 
ACM expects that fleet growth expectations will 
be revised downward over coming months as 
the industry comes to terms with a much slower 
pace of newbuilding deliveries. 
While the dry cargo fleet is going through a 
phase of growth there is also large expansion 
in the commodity markets especially in Australia, 
Brazil, Africa and Canada which will add demand 
to the market and increase the volume of dry 
broking business. 
Outlook
Freight rates have been at a historical low; 
however, ACM has been well positioned and 
has gained market share both organically and 
through diversification. In challenging market 
conditions, ACM has made good progress 
during the period, increasing volume of fixtures 
by 14% and strengthening its international 
presence. ACM is expanding and recruiting in 
each of its global offices and moving premises 
in London in August 2011 in order to support 
that expansion. 
The Board is confident that we currently have 
the right structure and team in place and we 
continue to look for opportunities to expand 
our global shipbroking network further. Our 
progressive dividend policy reflects the Board’s 
confidence for the future and ACM remains 
optimistic that the Group is well placed for both 
medium and longer-term growth.

Diversifying into dry cargo
By diversifying the Group’s 
earnings and moving into dry 
cargo, ACM is building on the 
global infrastructure that it has 
established since its inception, 
and starting to use its shipbroking 
expertise to work with all sizes of 
bulk dry cargo ships. 08 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Financial review
The overall effect of the change in exchange 
rates was to increase revenue by £0.5 million 
and profit before taxation by £0.1 million. 
At the year end, the Group had forward currency 
contracts to sell US$9.0 million at an average 
exchange rate of US$1.59 to £1. 
Dividends
The Directors are recommending a final 
dividend of 7.0 pence per share in respect of 
the year ended 31 March 2011 with a total cost 
of £1,283,000. Together with an interim dividend 
of 3.0 pence paid during the year, the total 
dividend in respect of the year will be 10.0 pence 
with a total cost of £1,897,000. The total dividend 
of 10.0 pence is 5% higher than the previous 
year’s full dividend of 9.5 pence per share and 
is covered almost 2.5 times by the adjusted 
earnings per share. 
Cash flow 
One of the key attributes of the Group is 
its cash-generative nature. Cash generated 
from operating activities was £5.9 million 
(2010: £2.6 million). This inflow excludes a 
further £1.3 million (2010: £1.6 million) received 
from our joint venture. The cash balance at the 
year end was £5.0 million (2010: £4.3 million).
This is after having utilised £2.3 million as the 
cash element for the acquisition of the business 
of Endeavour Shipbrokers.
Profit and earnings
Revenue in sterling increased by 13% (11% in US$), 
due to an increase in our core spot brokerage 
business and boosted by the new dry cargo 
ventures. This was offset by administrative 
overheads being 19% higher mainly as a result 
of these dry cargo ventures. This investment 
in dry cargo is anticipated to reap good rewards 
in the medium and long term.
Profit before tax and amortisation adjusted 
for minority interest for the year was £6.5 million 
for the year (2010: £6.6 million).
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was 21.7 pence 
(2010: 24.5 pence) with adjusted EPS down from 
26.3 pence to 24.8 pence. On a diluted basis, 
EPS was 21.6 pence and 24.7 pence adjusted.
The effective taxation rate was 29.4% 
(2010: 30.3%).
Profit attributable to equity shareholders was 
£4.0 million (2010: £4.3 million).
Foreign exchange
The bulk of the Group’s income is denominated 
in US dollars. The average effective exchange 
rate for the 2010/2011 year was US$1.56 
compared with US$1.59 for the previous year, 
while the rate at 31 March 2011 was US$1.60 
compared with US$1.52 at 31 March 2010.

Balance sheet 
The value of net assets at the balance sheet date 
increased to £19.9 million (2010: £13.3 million).
Included within non-current assets is £15.8 million 
(2010: £10.2 million) for intangible assets which 
resulted from acquisitions. The increase during 
the year arose from acquisition of the business 
of Endeavour Shipbrokers.
The pension deficit for the defined benefit 
scheme has decreased to £0.3 million from 
£2.1 million. The decrease is primarily due to  
a change in the assumptions relating to future 
increases in benefits. A deferred tax asset of 
£0.1 million (2010: £0.6 million) exists as a 
result of this liability. This scheme is closed to 
new members. On the back of a full actuarial 
valuation as at 31 March 2008, the Group has 
agreed to make additional contributions of 
£300,000 per annum to the pension scheme. 
Trade and other payables have increased by 
approximately £0.3 million. This mainly relates 
to a higher bonus accrual at the year end which 
is due to timing of bonus payments.
During the year the Group acquired 119,000 of 
its own shares through its Employee Share Option 
Plan. The cost of shares acquired is shown on 
the balance sheet within the ESOP reserve which 
is shown as a deduction from equity. The plan 
owns 489,000 shares of the Group.

with a total cost of £1,897,000.
Risk management
The Board seeks to identify and monitor risks 
facing the business.
Foreign exchange risk – the majority of the 
Group’s income is denominated in US dollars 
and the rate of exchange relative to sterling can 
have an effect on the performance of the Group. 
The Group uses foreign exchange instruments 
to manage this risk. At March 31 2011 the Group 
had forward foreign exchange contracts in place 
to sell US$9.0 million (2010: US$9.0 million) at 
an average rate of US$1.59 (2010: US$1.60) 
into sterling. The Board has a policy to continually 
have some forward cover in place to help 
manage this risk.
Liquidity risk – at 31 March the Group did not 
hold any net debt and has adequate cash 
resources to meet its ongoing requirements.
Interest rate risk – the Group has exposure 
to movements in interest rates in respect of 
its deposits. All deposits are made with 
reputable banks.

Employees
The Group has high regard for its employees. The Group seeks to enhance their careers with training and career development as well as continuing 
to motivate them. Share option schemes have been set up to add to the annual bonus structure. The Group seeks to have equal opportunity policies 
in place at each location.
Payment policy
The Group pays in accordance with agreed payment terms. The Company does not have any trade creditors.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union 
and applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union; and
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company’s and the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and parent company and enable them to ensure that 
its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Insofar as the Directors, individually, are aware:
 there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
  the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant information and to establish 
that the auditor is aware of that information.
Donations 
During the year the Group made charitable donations of £43,990 (2010: £37,951).
Financial risk
The Group’s financial risk and its management policies are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
At the Annual General Meeting (AGM) a number of resolutions will be proposed. Details of these resolutions together with explanatory notes 
can be found in the enclosed notice of meeting.
Auditor
RSM T enon Audit Limited has expressed its willingness to continue in office and a resolution to re‑appoint them will be proposed at the AGM.

Corporate governance
Introduction
The Board is committed to achieving good standards of corporate governance. Although under the rules of AIM the Group is not required to comply 
with the Combined Code, the Directors intend to comply so far as reasonably practicable for a company of ACM’s size and nature. Where full 
compliance is not appropriate due to the Company’s size and/or nature, the Directors will refer to guidance for AIM listed companies issued 
by the Quoted Companies Alliance.
Board of Directors
The Board consists of three executive and four non‑executive Directors, a composition which the Board believes is best suited to the continued 
success of the Group. 
The Board is responsible for establishing the strategic direction of the Group and monitoring the Group’s performance against its business plan. It is 
also responsible for leading and controlling the Group, and in particular, for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group’s strategy, budget, major 
items of capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals. Regular meetings are held and all necessary information is supplied on a timely basis to 
enable the Board to discharge its duties effectively. Additionally, special meetings take place, or other arrangements are made, when Board decisions 
are required in advance of the regular meetings. 
It is the Company’s policy that Directors are re‑elected by shareholders and the Company’s Articles of Association require one third to retire by rotation. 
Board committees
The Board has a remuneration committee, an audit committee and a nomination committee. Each of these committees consist of the four non‑executive 
Directors and are chaired by Peter Sechiari. The Board also has a compliance committee consisting of Peter Sechiari and Ian Hartley.
The remuneration committee is discussed within the Directors’ remuneration report on page 15.
The audit committee meets whenever there is business to discuss and meets at least twice each year. The audit committee is responsible for ensuring 
that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored, controlled and reported on. It also meets with the auditor without executive Directors 
being present and reviews reports from the auditor relating to accounts and internal control systems.
The nomination committee has responsibility for making recommendations on the appointment of additional Directors to the Board and the appointment 
of members of the Company’s senior management team. It meets at least twice a year. 
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the system of internal control. Although no system can provide absolute assurance against misstatement or loss, the Group’s 
systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance. The Board is also responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the system.
Going concern
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its business for the foreseeable future. For this reason 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Shareholder relations
The Board places significant importance on maintaining good communications with its shareholders. This includes meetings with shareholders and 
analysts as appropriate. Shareholders are also invited to the Company’s AGM, where questions are taken. The Company also uses its Annual Report 
and Accounts, Interim statement and website (www.acmshippinggroup.com) to provide further information to shareholders.  15 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee consists of the non‑executive Directors: currently Peter Sechiari (as Chairman), David Cobb, Timothy Jaques and 
Jürgen Breuer. The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required. The remuneration committee considers all material 
elements of remuneration policy, including remuneration and incentives of executive Directors and senior management (including pension rights 
and compensation payments) with reference to independent remuneration research and professional advice. The Board is responsible for 
implementing the recommendations and agreeing the remuneration packages for individual Directors. The remuneration committee is also 
responsible for making recommendations for grants of options under share option and incentivisation schemes. No Director is able to participate 
in discussions relating to his own terms and conditions of remuneration. Non‑executive Directors’ and the Chairman’s fees are determined 
by the full Board on the advice of the remuneration committee.

Annual bonus
In order to attract and retain the highest calibre of employees, a significant proportion of the remuneration packages of executive Directors and senior 
management is geared towards an annual bonus. The Group adopts an industry standard bonus model whereby proportions of revenue and profit 
are distributed to senior employees as bonuses. The individual allocation of this bonus between the Directors and senior employees is discretionary. 
This discretion is exercised by the remuneration committee upon the recommendation of senior executives.
Pension contributions
The Company makes pension contributions on behalf of its executive Directors. James Gundy is a member of the Group’s defined benefit scheme. Ian Hartley 
is a member of the Group’s stakeholder scheme. John Plumbe and the non‑executive Directors do not participate in the Group’s pension schemes.  16 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

the cash flow statements, and the related notes. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited . 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted 
by the European Union and as regards the parent company financial statements as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 13, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
  whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
 the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements

  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2011 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union;

statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; 
  the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; 
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

The currency reserve arises from exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation.
The share‑based payment reserve represents the fair value of share options which have been granted.
The merger reserve arose when the shares of ACM Shipping Limited were exchanged for shares in ACM Shipping Group plc. Since the members 
and their rights were unchanged the transfer of ownership was accounted for in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
The treasury reserve arises from where the Company acquired shares in itself.

Notes to the financial statements
year ended 31 March 2011
1. Accounting policies 
(a) Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those European Union endorsed IFRS and IFRIC 
interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at the time of preparing these statements (July 2011). The policies set out below 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as noted below.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for the parent company as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. 
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and enterprises controlled by the Company (and its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition.
(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow and can be reliably measured. Revenue is recognised when 
the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission. This is generally the point at which there is completion of contractual terms between the 
principles of a transaction. Time charter revenue is recognised on a monthly basis.
(d) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value. Depreciation is provided on a straight 
line basis over the expected economic life of that asset as follows:
Leasehold improvements –  over the life of the lease
Fixtures, fittings and office equipment – two to five years
(e) Operating lease agreements
Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor are charged against profits 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
(f) Pension costs and other post‑retirement benefits
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and recognises the pension liability in the Group balance sheet. The liability is the present value 
of the accrued defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme’s assets. The present value of the defined benefit 
obligation is measured using the projected unit method and discounted at an AA corporate bond rate. Assets are valued at market value. The Group 
recognises actuarial gains and losses via the statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. 
The Company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. Contributions to these schemes have been charged against profit as they fall due. 
(g) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability 
in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax 
is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when 
the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences 
can be utilised. 
(h) Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted into sterling at the rate of exchange at the time of the transaction. At each balance 
sheet, monetary assets and liabilities are converted at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date with any gain or loss being included in the 
income statement.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas operations are converted at the balance sheet rate while the income statement is translated 
at the average rate for the year. Any exchange gain or loss arising on consolidation is charged to reserves. 24 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

1. Accounting policies continued
(i) Joint ventures
The Group’s investment and share of the profits or losses of the joint ventures are included in the financial statements using the equity method. 
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity which is subject to joint control.
(j) Investments
All investments are stated at cost less provisions for diminution in value.
(k) Goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) acquired. Goodwill arises 
where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is allocated to cash‑generating units for  
the purposes of impairment testing. On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in  
the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
(l) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are stated in the balance sheet at their fair value at the date of acquisition less 
accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment. The amortisation of the carrying value of the capitalised forward order book and 
customer relationships is charged to the income statement over an estimated useful life determined by either the expected due dates for future 
income in the case of forward order books or the expected duration of customer relationships. The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed 
for impairment at least annually or when there is an indication that they may be impaired. The estimated useful life of the items in the forward order 
book is generally up to four years and the customer relationships is ten years.
(m) Share‑based payments
The Company awards employees bonuses in the form of share options and long‑term incentive plan share awards, on a discretionary basis from time 
to time. The options and awards are normally subject to vesting conditions and, where it is considered likely that the conditions will be met, their fair 
value is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in other reserves over the vesting period. The cash proceeds 
received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium. 
(n) Financial instruments
Classification
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity (i.e. forming part of shareholders’ funds) only 
to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial 
liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and
 b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non‑derivative that includes no obligation 
to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging 
a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes  
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium 
account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
The Company’s share capital is treated as equity.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity. 25 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at nominal value.
Forward contracts
The Company uses forward contracts for foreign currency and accounts for these using hedge accounting.
(o) Own shares held by ESOP
Transactions of the Group‑sponsored ESOP are treated as being those of the Group and are therefore reflected in the Group’s financial statements. 
In particular, the plan’s purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.

2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates in one business sector and does not report internally any segmental information other than revenue streams. As a result no 
additional business sector information is provided. Business is the Group’s primary reporting segment. Geographical information is not produced 
and is not readily available. In view of management, the cost of developing this information would be excessive.

All amortisation charges in the year have been charged through administrative expenses. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash‑generating units which are tested for impairment at least annually. The recoverable amount has been determined based 
on a value in use calculation using risk‑adjusted cash flow projections based on financial budgets prepared by the Group. The key assumptions used 
in the value in use calculation are:
  the discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 12%. This is the Group’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect market 
assessment of specific risks associated with the segment cash flows;
 the period over which cash flows are projected based on financial budgets approved by the Board is one year; and
 the growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the budget period is 3%.
Management believes that it is unlikely that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any of the 
cash‑generating units to exceed its recoverable amount.

16. Pension commitments
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK which is closed to new members. The Group also operates stakeholder schemes 
and contributes to independent funds on behalf of certain of the Group’s employees.
The operating charge for pension costs in the year is:
         2011 2010 
         £000 £000
UK defined benefit scheme        162 76
Defined contribution schemes         569 592
         731 668
The last full funding valuation on the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2008. A qualified independent actuary has carried out 
a valuation for IAS 19 purposes as at 31 March 2011 to obtain the figures in this disclosure note. The figures for the year ended 31 March 2010 have 
also been included for comparison.
The projected unit valuation method has been used. 
The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date were:
         2011 2010
Economic assumptions  
Discount rate        5.6% pa 5.6% pa
Price inflation (RPI)        3.6% pa 3.7% pa
Price inflation (CPI)        2.9% pa n/a

Pension increase:  
– RPI increases subject to a maximum of 2.5% pa       2.1% pa 2.3% pa
– RPI increases subject to a maximum of 3.0% pa       2.4% pa 2.7% pa
– RPI increases subject to a maximum of 5.0% pa       2.9% pa 3.5% pa
Discretionary pension increases        0.0% pa 0.0% pa
Expected return on assets  
Diversified Growth Fund (DGF)        7.6% pa 7.7% pa
Cash        4.4% pa 4.5% pa
Demographic assumptions
Average expected remaining life of:
– 60 year old non‑retired male        28.2 yrs 28.1 yrs
– 60 year old retired male        27.1 yrs 27.0 yrs
– 60 year old non‑retired female        30.5 yrs 30.4 yrs
– 60 year old retired female        29.5 yrs 29.4 yrs
Scheme assets are stated at their bid values at the respective balance sheet dates. The expected long‑term rate of return on DGFs of 7.6% pa reflects 
historic returns on underlying assets and is within the range of assumptions typically used by other companies. The expected long‑term rate of return 
on cash of 4.4% pa is based upon the gross redemption yield available on long‑dated gilts. 35 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

20. Share‑based payments continued
Share‑based payment expense
The total charge in the consolidated income statement for the year with regard to these awards is £267,000 (2010: £394,000).
The fair values of the LTIPs are inherently valued at the share price at the date of grant less 1 pence per share.
The fair values of the options granted were determined using the Binomial option pricing model. Assumptions used in the application of the option 
pricing models were: 
  Risk‑free interest rate – in the range 2.93% to 5.11% for the different grants 
  Dividend yield  – 3%
  Volatility – 30%
  Life of options – five and a half years
  Fair values range – from 36.6 pence to 64.5 pence 
Expected volatility was estimated by reference to historical share price movements in both the Group and comparable quoted companies 
with a longer listing history than the Group.

        £000 £000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents       4,266 689 4,955
25. Financial instruments and risks
The Group’s financial risk management policies are designed to reduce the risk of currency, liquidity and credit risk exposure.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash at bank and other items including trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly 
from its operations. 
The Group has no assets or liabilities other than forward foreign exchange contracts that fall to be classed as derivatives. The Group does not engage 
in instruments of a speculative nature.
(a) Currency risk
The Group carries out most of its business in US dollars and hence it is exposed to currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. So as 
to mitigate this risk the Group places forward contracts for the sale of US dollars at fixed rates. The purpose of such transactions is to manage the 
currency risk arising from the Group’s operations. At year end the Group had contracts outstanding to sell US$9.0 million (2010: US$9.0 million) 
and to receive sterling. These contracts all had a maturity date of less than one year and were contracted at rates ranging from $1.58 to $1.63 to £1. 
The average rate of the forward contracts was $1.59 to £1. 
At each balance sheet date, the contracts which are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are restated to their fair value, based on currency 
contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 31 March 2011 the fair value of these contracts was an asset of £31,000 (2010: asset of £258,000).
The rate on the balance sheet date was $1.60 to £1 (2010: $1.52). The average rate for the year was $1.56 to £1 (2010: $1.60).
As at 31 March 2011 all cash and cash equivalents were held in sterling except for bank accounts totalling US$1.8 million (2010: US$1.8 million). 
There is no difference between the book values and fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
The effect on profit before taxation of a 10% weakening in the average US dollar exchange rate in the year compared to the effective rates for the year 
is approximately £1.3 million adverse (2010: £1.2 million). This effect is before hedging and with all other variables being equal. A 10% strengthening 
in the average US dollar is approximately £1.3 million favourable (2010: £1.2 million). The effect on equity is similar to that on profit before taxation.
(b) Liquidity risk
The Group finances itself through retained earnings. The Group is fundamentally cash generative and manages its liquid resources so as to obtain 
the best available rates of return on cash investments, whilst retaining access to those resources. 
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is given in note 24. The Group does not currently have any borrowings.
(c) Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented 
by the carrying value of receivables as at the balance sheet date. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and a bad debt provision 
is held to cover doubtful debts. The Group has not historically suffered from significant bad debts.
(d) Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rates on its cash and short‑term deposits.

27. Business combinations
On 1 July 2010, the Group acquired the business of Endeavour Shipbrokers, a dry cargo shipbroker based in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. 
The acquisition was for a consideration of £5.4 million made up of £2.3 million cash plus 1,815,000 shares in ACM Shipping Group plc.
The fair value of the assets acquired was:

Included in the £4,100,000 of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due 
to their nature. These items include an assembled workforce and the detailed knowledge and expertise of the specialist markets.
£1,802,000 of intangible assets were separated from goodwill as part of this business combination and relate to the forward order book and customer 
relationships. The fair values of these intangible assets were calculated by an independent valuer using the net present value of future cash flows.
Endeavour is highly complementary with the Group’s recently started venture for dry cargo in the UK. 41 ACM Shipping Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Notice of AGM
Notes
1.  If you have sold or transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please send this document and the enclosed form of proxy (“Proxy Form”) 
to the stockbroker, or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was effected, for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
2.  Holders of ordinary shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM. Shareholders are entitled to appoint 
a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A shareholder can appoint the Chairman 
of the meeting or anyone else to be his/her proxy at the meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder. More than one proxy can be appointed in relation 
to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different ordinary share or shares held by that shareholder. 
T o appoint more than one proxy, the Proxy Form should be photocopied and completed for each proxy holder. The proxy holder’s name should be 
written on the Proxy Form together with the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is authorised to act. The box on the Proxy Form must also 
be ticked to indicate that the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All Proxy Forms must be signed and, to be effective, must be 
lodged with the Company’s registrar so as to arrive not later than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, or in the case of an adjournment 48 hours 
before the adjourned time. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the appointment 
submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the 
Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first‑named being the most senior).
3.  The return of a completed Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting in person if he/she wishes to do so.
4.  Only shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company as at 48 hours before the time of the meeting shall be entitled 
to attend the AGM either in person or by proxy and the number of ordinary shares then registered in their respective names shall determine the number 
of votes such persons are entitled to cast on a poll at the AGM.
5.  The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in note 2 does not apply to Nominated Persons. 
The rights described in that note can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company.
6.  In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the AGM, arrangements will be put in place at the AGM so that: (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of 
the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to 
the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than 
one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman 
of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who 
attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative. 
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on proxies and corporate 
representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment letter if the Chairman 
is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
7.  In accordance with regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the 
purposes of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast), members must be entered on the Company’s register 
of members by 11.30am on 4 September 2011, or if the meeting is adjourned, by not later than 48 hours before the time and date fixed for 
the adjourned meeting.
8. A vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.
9.  Copies of all service agreements under which Directors of the Company are employed by the Company or any subsidiaries will be available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) 
from the date of this notice until the conclusion of the AGM, and at the venue of the AGM for 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
10.  Except as provided above, shareholders who have general queries about the meeting should write to the company secretary at the address of our 
registered office. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this notice of AGM or any related documents (including the Proxy Form) 
to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

ACM Shipping Group plc (the “Company”)
AGM – Business at the AGM
Shareholders will see from the notice of AGM that they are asked to consider and, if thought fit, pass a number of resolutions as ordinary 
and special business which are summarised below.
As ordinary business
Resolution 1 – to receive the financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Resolution 2 – to approve the Directors’ remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 March 2011.
Resolution 3 – to declare a final dividend for the financial year ended 31 March 2011 of 7 pence per share. Subject to approval, the final dividend 
will be payable on 7 October 2011 to shareholders on the register as at close of business on 9 September 2011.
Resolutions 4, 5 and 6 – under the Company’s Articles of Association, and in accordance with Group policy, one third of the Company’s Directors 
retire by rotation and, being eligible, John Plumbe, Jürgen Breuer and Timothy Jaques offer themselves for re‑election.
Resolution 7 – Auditor – this resolution, if passed, will re‑appoint RSM T enon Audit Limited as auditor of the Company and authorise the Directors 
to fix their remuneration.
As special business
The following item will be proposed as an ordinary resolution:
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
This resolution, if passed, will authorise the Directors of the Company generally and unconditionally to allot ordinary shares of the Company up to 
a maximum nominal value of £65,168 representing approximately one third of the current issued share capital of the Company. This authority will expire 
at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company unless previously varied, revoked or renewed by the Company in general meeting.
The following items will be proposed as special resolutions:
Resolution 9 – Disapplication of pre‑emption rights
This resolution, if passed, will grant the Directors of the Company power to allot shares wholly for cash pursuant to the authority conferred on them 
by resolution 8 otherwise than to the existing shareholders of the Company in proportion to their existing holdings of ordinary shares. The first part of 
the disapplication is limited to rights issues, open offers and similar pro‑rata issues. In relation to a rights issue, open offer or other pro rata issues the 
disapplication authority is unlimited and allows the Directors to offer shares to existing shareholders other than strictly in proportion to their holdings, 
where for example, overseas regulations make it difficult to offer shares pro rata to existing overseas shareholders or when dealing with fractions of 
shares. The second part of the disapplication is limited to issues of shares pursuant to the terms of the Company’s current share scheme and any other 
share schemes approved by the Company in general meeting. The final part of the resolution also enables your Board to allot shares for any purpose 
up to an aggregate nominal value of £19,550 representing approximately 10% of the current issued share capital of the Company.
Resolution 10 – Share buy back 
This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own shares and is proposed as a special resolution. If passed, 
the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 1,955,000 of its shares, representing just under 10% of the Company’s issued share 
capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of this notice of AGM.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any shares purchased under this authority. The authority will expire 
at the conclusion of the Company’s next AGM. 
Whilst the Directors do not currently have any intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution, the Directors would require the authority 
granted by this resolution to make market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares as a method of returning surplus cash to shareholders. 
The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase shares where they consider that such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders 
generally and will result in an increase in earnings per share.
The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out 
of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to transfer sufficient shares purchased under this authority into treasury in order to satisfy 
the Company’s share incentive schemes and to cancel any excess shares purchased. Form of proxy

Notes:
1.  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint one or more proxies (who need 
not be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting in person) of his/her own choice to attend 
and to vote in his/her place. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form. Please indicate 
the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your 
proxy (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of shares held by you). Please also indicate 
if the proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should 
be returned together in the same envelope. If a member wishes to appoint a proxy other than the Chairman, 
delete the words “the Chairman of the meeting or”, initial the alteration and insert the name of the person 
you wish to appoint as your proxy. All members are entitled to attend and vote at the meeting, whether 
or not they have returned a form of proxy.
2.  If you indicate that you want your vote withheld your proxy may abstain from voting and therefore there 
is no vote at law to be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and against the resolution. 
 
3.  If a member is a corporation, this form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or by the 
signature of an officer or attorney duly authorised in writing. 
4.  In the case of joint holders, the signature of any one holder will be sufficient, but the names of all joint 
holders should be stated, and the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote will be accepted to the 
exclusion of the vote(s) of other joint holder(s), seniority being determined by the order in which the 
names stand in the register of members of the Company.
5.  In order to be valid, this form of proxy, duly executed together with any power of attorney or other 
authority under which it is signed, or a notarially certified or office copy of such power or authority, must 
be lodged at the Company’s Registrars not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting or any 
adjournment of the meeting.
6.  The return of a completed form of proxy will not prevent a shareholder attending the AGM and voting 
in person if he/she wishes to do so. Business Reply

Chairman’s statement
Introduction 
2016 has been a significant and positive year for the Group 
as we continue to deliver value to all our stakeholders. 
We have exceeded our growth expectations for the year 
with gross written premiums up 19% to £655m through 
enhancements to our underwriting capabilities and by 
taking advantage of favourable market conditions in 
Motor; demerged Gocompare.com from the Group ('the 
Demerger') to allow both businesses to thrive and reach 
their full potential; and further strengthened our robust 
capital position providing us with the capital flexibility to 
continue our growth ambitions and deliver strong returns. 
Insurance
We have always said that we will only grow when we 
believe it is profitable to do so and throughout 2016 the 
favourable rating environment in Motor allowed us to grow 
strongly, albeit the Home insurance market continued to 
be challenging. The management team remain focused in 
delivering the Group’s growth strategy through initiatives, 
such as footprint expansion, in a controlled manner and I 
believe they continue to make the right decisions in dynamic 
market conditions. We are encouraged that the Government 
continues to explore options to lower whiplash claims costs 
which in turn could lead to lower premiums for customers, 
although we are mindful of the recent change in the Ogden 
discount rate to minus 0.75% and the impact this could have 
on customer premiums across the market. 
Demerger of Gocompare.com
On 3 November 2016, Gocompare.com demerged 
from the Group and listed on the London Stock Exchange. 
Since acquiring full control of Gocompare.com in early 
2015 the Group successfully repositioned the business and 
strengthened its management team with the introduction of 
Matthew Crummack as chief executive officer in June 2016. 
The return of Gio Compario reinvigorated Gocompare.com’s 
marketing proposition; an expense review addressed the 
cost base; and focus was given to the many opportunities 
available to Gocompare.com to grow outside of its core 
markets. Both esure and Gocompare.com are now 
positioned to thrive and reach their full potential and 
we wish the new management team at Gocompare.com 
well for the future.
Sir Peter Wood / Chairman
'2016 has been a significant and positive year for the Group. 
Premiums are ahead of expectations; Gocompare.com has been 
demerged allowing both businesses to thrive and reach their full 
potential; capital is at the top of our risk appetite; and we have 
once again paid a special dividend, demonstrating the Board's 
commitment to return excess capital to shareholders.' Strategic Report Governance Financials
05 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Capital and dividends 
The Group’s capital coverage above its solvency capital 
requirement has always been appropriate for the business 
that we are, and continue to be, a low risk personal lines 
insurer. As part of the Demerger, the Group received a 
dividend from Gocompare.com that further strengthened 
its robust capital position. The Group’s capital position is 
at the upper end of our risk appetite, after allowing for the 
final dividend that is inclusive of a special element, and 
gives us the capital flexibility to pursue further profitable 
growth opportunities.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 10.5 pence 
per share, and in conjunction with the interim dividend of 3.0 
pence per share, gives a full year dividend of 13.5 pence per 
share representing a payout ratio of 70% of underlying profit 
after tax. Since the Group became public in 2013, the Board 
has returned £240m to shareholders through dividends, 
underpinning the Board’s commitment to return excess 
capital to shareholders.
Board
Once again the Board have demonstrated the value 
that their wealth of experience and knowledge bring 
to our Group and I would like to thank them for their 
input throughout the year. We have benefitted from a 
year of relatively little change after Anne Richards left us in 
February 2016 and I am delighted that Peter Shaw and Alan 
Rubenstein joined the Board in March 2017, giving us further 
strength and depth. Peter Ward will be stepping down from 
the Board at the Annual General Meeting in May 2017 after 
many years of great service and I would like to thank him for 
his support, challenge and wisdom across the years.
Summary 
2016 has been a significant and positive year for the 
Group and this would not have been possible without the 
hard work and dedication of all our colleagues across the 
business. I believe the Group is well positioned to carry on 
with this positive momentum and I look forward to the 
future with great confidence.

opportunities, we have solid foundations from which 
to grow and deliver our ambition'

Introduction
What a year 2016 has been. We have exceeded our 
gross written premium expectations for the year with 
growth of 19%; increased underlying profit by 18% and 
profit from continuing operations by 19%; successfully 
demerged Gocompare.com; and returned excess capital 
to shareholders through special dividends while 
maintaining sufficient capital flexibility to carry on 
our growth ambitions in 2017 and beyond. 
Focus
2016 has been a year of growth through focused 
underwriting. We added nearly 200,000 in-force policies 
to the business and momentum continues to build in our 
footprint expansion programmes with the launch of a further 
12 segments in Motor towards the end of the year. Through 
enhancements to our underwriting capabilities we are now 
able to quote for 70–80% of the Motor market, without 
materially moving the dial on risk, giving us great 
opportunities to deliver our ambition of 3 million in-force 
policies by 2020.
In Motor, our customer contribution modelling continues 
to evolve. With regular and detailed monitoring we are able 
to make more informed value-based decisions on a daily 
basis. Through a customer contribution approach we are able 
to offer competitive prices to customers allowing them to 
benefit from our great products and service throughout their 
time with the Group, while generating value for the business. 
The Home market remains challenging, in particular the 
rating environment on price comparison websites, and we 
do not believe market conditions are conducive to growth 
at this time. Adverse weather events in the early part of 
the year, along with flash flooding in June, impacted the 
profitability of the market and our portfolio, and we have 
taken corrective action on the portfolio as we look to improve 
the underwriting performance of the account. Despite this, 
Home remained a key contributor to the Group in 2016. 
Control 
We remain committed to only growing when we believe 
it is profitable to do so, rather than for vanity, and our 
ambition is to reach three million in-force policies by 2020, 
underpinned by this philosophy. 
There is an acquisition cost to growth, however through 
our enhanced contribution analysis, great service and 
strong customer retention, we are confident our growth 
will deliver value. 
Stuart Vann / Chief Executive Officer
Chief Executive Officer’s statement Strategic Report Governance Financials
13 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Effective claims management and expense efficiency 
provide the foundations to deliver increased value and 
our counter fraud capabilities continue to lead the way 
across the market. Over the past three years the Group has 
utilised device profiling to deter 'ghost broking' with great 
success and this would not have been possible without our 
collaborative and innovative approaches across the business. 
Our low risk approach to underwriting and conservative 
reinsurance programme mitigated much of our exposure to 
the change in the Ogden discount rate and leaves us well 
placed within the market compared to our peers.
Scale
Investment in our infrastructure is ongoing to ensure we 
have agile, flexible and scalable systems in place to meet 
ever changing customer preferences. Our digital market 
place remains focused on price comparison website 
distribution and improvements to our online customer 
journey have improved new business sale conversion and 
our customer experience. There is plenty more to come. 
Colleagues 
We strive to make esure a great place to work as it is our 
colleagues who are fundamental to our success. In 2016, 
we have implemented a new pay and reward framework; 
invested in our talent; and our first employee sharesave 
scheme vested, allowing colleagues to share in the success 
of the business.
Summary & Outlook
2016 has been a year of strong growth and I am confident 
this will deliver value over the coming years. As we look out 
into 2017, assuming stable market conditions and normal 
weather, we continue to expect strong growth in both 
premiums and in-force policies at 15–20% and 5–10%, 
respectively; the combined operating ratio to be in the 
region of 96–98%; and our Non-underwritten additional 
services revenues are forecast to grow ahead of in-force 
policies in line with the trend seen in the second half 
of 2016.
Our performance in 2017 and beyond will be driven by the 
hard work of all our colleagues across the business and I 
would like to thank them for their commitment and 
dedication in helping us to deliver our ambitions.

Counter Fraud
What is esure’s approach to counter fraud?
We follow a risk-based, proactive strategy with 
a robust stance taken to deter and take action 
against proven fraud. We have well established 
counter fraud systems and controls and target 
market-leading performance. We invest in pioneering 
solutions where there is financial benefit, competitive 
advantage or a need to mitigate against an evolving 
fraudulent activity.
How do you operate within the business?
Fraud is controlled through the close collaboration 
of a core expert team of 35 colleagues, with further 
support across Risk, Underwriting, Claims and 
Operations to counter fraud activity. 
What were the key achievements in 2016?
We improved our predictive analytics; stepped up 
our device-profiling capabilities across multiple 
customer touch points; and enhanced our automated 
processes to detect policy fraud. 
How do you work with the rest of the sector?
We are active in collaborating with law enforcement 
and the Insurance Fraud Bureau, with a number of 
cases under investigation. Applying sanction action 
on serious fraud remains a key deterrent and one of 
the team’s priorities while protecting the majority of 
our honest customer base.
What next? 
We will remain a pioneer in fraud prevention through 
innovation. In a constantly changing environment 
our approach to mitigate and deter fraudulent 
activity will be key. 14 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016

Gross written premiums increased 19.0% to £655.0m

and positive rate increases across the portfolio in Motor. 
In-force policies increased by 8.6% to 2.174 million 
(2015: 2.001 million) as the Group delivered strong 
growth in Motor in favourable market conditions.
Profit after tax of £269.2m includes a non-cash 
disposal gain of £213.6m on Demerger; amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets of £10.4m; and £14.5m of fees 
associated with the Demerger. Management’s measure of 
the underlying profit after tax of £80.5m excludes these 
items as they do not impact the Group’s dividend capacity.

increased by 11.9% to 1.606 million (2015: 1.435 million) 
as the Group’s footprint expansion programmes

Trading profit of £8.9m (2015: £6.7m) has improved as 
the positive rating environments of 2015 and 2016 start to 
earn through ahead of claims inflation, albeit this has been 
largely offset by a lower level of favourable development 
of prior accident year reserves to £29.4m (2015: £46.4m)

comparison websites.
Adverse weather claims costs totalled £6.6m (2015: £4m), 
£3.2m higher than the Group expected to incur in the year, 
and costs associated with the Flood Re levy of £2.9m (2015:

as outlined above and the Group continued to benefit from 
strong favourable development of prior accident year 
reserves of £9.3m (2015: £10.3m), which equated to 
11.0% of net earned premiums (2015: 12.5%).

performance in instalment income.
Non-underwritten additional services trading profit 
increased 8.9% to £60.0m (2015: £55.1m) in line with the 
Group’s in-force policy growth. The growth in instalment 
income is largely driven by an increase in Motor customers

Profit after tax from discontinued operations
Income and expenses relating to Gocompare.com are 
disclosed in the Group’s profit after tax from discontinued 
operations. The profit after tax of £209.7m (2015: £72.0m) 
is the profit generated by Gocompare.com up to Demerger, 
net of tax (2016: £19.2m; 2015: £16.4m); the fair value 
gain of the Group’s holding in Gocompare.com at Demerger 
(2016: £213.6m; 2015: £nil); the Group’s joint venture 
deemed disposal gain (2016: £nil; 2015: £63.8m); the 
amortisation of acquired intangible assets relating to 
Gocompare.com, net of tax (2016: £8.6m; 2015: £8.2m); 
and the fees associated with the Demerger of £14.5m 
(2015: £nil). 
In accordance with IFRIC 17, the Group calculated the 
fair value of Gocompare.com at Demerger. Prior to the 
Demerger, the Group held Gocompare.com at book value 
(£88.2m); however, on Demerger Gocompare.com plc’s 
market capitalisation was £301.8m. This resulted in a fair 
value gain on Demerger of £213.6m. Strategic Report Governance Financials
19 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Underlying profit after tax
The Group’s 2016 reported profit after tax is £269.2m 
(2015: £121.9m). Underlying profit after tax adjusts for 
the fair value gain on Demerger of Gocompare.com of 
£213.6m (2015: nil); the Group’s joint venture deemed 
disposal gain (2016: nil; 2015: £63.8m); the amortisation 
charge of acquired intangible assets, net of tax, of £10.4m 
(2015: £10.1m); and fees associated with the Demerger of 
Gocompare.com of £14.5m (2015: £nil). The underlying profit 
after tax is management’s measure of profitability of the 
Group and it is with reference to the Group’s underlying 
profit after tax that the dividend has been set. 
Earnings per share
Reported earnings per share increased by 120.5% to 64.6 
pence (2015: 29.3 pence) as a consequence of the fair value 
gain on Demerger of £213.6m in 2016 not occurring in 2015.
Underlying earnings per share increased 17.7% to 19.3 
pence (2015: 16.4 pence), largely driven by an improvement 
in the investment return. 
Dividend per share
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.5 pence 
per share, which together with the interim dividend of 3.0 
pence per share, takes the full year dividend to 13.5 pence 
per share. The full year dividend of 13.5 pence per share 
represents an annualised payout ratio of 70% of the Group’s 
underlying earnings per share. The payout ratio comprises 
a base dividend of 50% and a special dividend of 20%.
The ex-dividend date is 13 April 2017, the record date is 
18 April 2017 and the payment date is 26 May 2017. These 
dates are in respect of both the base and special dividend.

non-cash disposal gain of £213.6m (2015 included a joint 
venture deemed disposal gain of £63.8m).
Operating activities were a net outflow of £3.8m 
(2015: net inflow of £154.8m) largely driven by cash 
flows generated from the Group’s operating activities being 
invested into its investment portfolio. In 2015, the net cash 
generated benefitted from a drawdown in cash to fund the 
acquisition of Gocompare.com in March 2015. 
Investing activities generated a net outflow of £25.7m 
(2015: £73.5m) reflecting the purchase of property, plant and 
equipment alongside fees relating to the Demerger. In 2015, 
the cash outflow reflects the acquisition of Gocompare.com in 
March 2015 and the cash dividends received from Gocompare.
com prior to completion when held as a joint venture.
Financing activities includes the Group’s dividend payments 
of £42.9m in 2016 (2015: £66.1m), the Gocompare.com 
debt raise of £73.1m prior to Demerger and the finance 
costs associated with the Notes of £8.4m (2015: £8.4m).

Investments
The Group deploys a conservative investment strategy 
with the primary objectives of capital preservation and 
maintaining liquidity. Through better alignment of the 
investment and liability durations the Group is able to 
deliver appropriate returns while minimising earnings 
and capital volatility. 
Strategic investment allocations
The Group’s investment portfolio is in the process of 
transitioning towards the following strategic asset allocations 
and target returns. The Group expects the target allocations 
to be achieved in mid 2017.

Note: 2015 comparative information has not been provided as the

The Group’s total assets under management are 14.0% 
higher at £862.9m (2015: £757.0m, including derivative 
financial liabilities) due to a combination of strong premium 
growth and dividend received prior to the Demerger. 
The Cash & Liquidity portfolio reflects accessible cash 
for operational activities and is inclusive of a buffer for 
adverse events. The allocation of 5% is in line with the 
Board-approved liquidity risk appetite.
The Claims backed portfolio is constructed with reference to 
the expected future cost of the Group’s technical liabilities, 
as defined under Solvency II. During the period, the Group 
has improved the alignment of the duration of these assets 
with the appropriate liabilities. This has increased the 
duration of claims backing assets to 3.6 years compared to 
3.4 years on claims liabilities. The assets acquired during 
this period have been designated as available for sale 
('AFS') to minimise the impact of interest rate changes on 
earnings. In total, the Group has designated £192.6m as 
AFS and £359.2m as fair value through profit and loss. 
Additionally, the Group has disposed of all residential 
mortgage back securities (2015: £38.5m). 20 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Finance Review continued
The Surplus portfolio seeks to deliver returns while 
investing in a manner that reflects the Group’s risk appetite, 
in particular with reference to its solvency capital. The Group 
currently holds £143m (17% of total assets) in a liquidity 
fund within its surplus portfolio pending the outcome of a 
review of the strategic asset allocation within the investment 
portfolio. This is expected to complete during the first half of 
2017. The remaining assets are invested across a mixture of 
fixed income and equities.
The Group’s total investment duration was 2.6 years (2015: 
<1.0 year) as the Group looks to match better its asset and 
liability durations under Solvency II.

Reserving
The Group holds claims reserves, to cover the future 
cost of settling claims that have been incurred but not 
settled at the balance sheet date, whether already known 
to the Group or not yet reported, net of associated 
reinsurance recoveries. 
For known periodic payment orders ('PPOs') and potential 
PPO awards, indexed cash flow projections are carried out 
in order to estimate an ultimate cost on a gross and net of 
reinsurance basis. The Group currently has 11 PPOs. The 
cash flow projections were undertaken on a discounted 
basis. The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs 
and potential PPOs in the consolidated statement of financial 
position represents less than 5% of net claims outstanding 
at 31 December 2016. 
Due to the inherent uncertainties in reserving the Group 
adopts a prudent approach to reserving through reserving in 
excess of the actuarial best estimate. Over time the inherent 
uncertainties in the actuarial best estimate reduce and the 
Group releases the margin above the best estimate. The 
Group’s current reserve margin is comfortably in excess 
of its actuarial best estimate. 
On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor changed 
the Ogden discount rate from plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%, 
effective 20 March 2017. As at 31 December 2016, the 
Group’s reserve margin included an allowance for a change 
in the discount rate to 0%. 
The impact on the Group’s performance from a change in 
the discount rate is outlined below:

The Group has not adjusted its 2016 financial position to 
take into account the discount rate moving to minus 0.75%, 
beyond the 0% allowed for within its reserve margin as 
at 31 December 2016. The effect is immaterial on profit 
after tax. 
The Group benefited from strong favourable development of 
prior accident year reserves, with total prior year releases of 
£38.7m in 2016 (2015: £56.7m). The favourable development 
represents 7.0% of net earned premium (2015: 11.4%). 
Reinsurance
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer 
mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s 
appetite for individual claim or event exposure and to reduce 
the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation 
losses. By doing so, the Group reduces the impact that an 
event can have on its capital position and its underwriting 
results in both Motor and Home. The Group’s reinsurance 
programmes are due for renewal on 1 July 2017.
Currently, the Group has in place non-proportional excess 
of loss reinsurance programmes for its Motor and Home 
underwriting activities. The purpose of these programmes 
is to provide cover for both individual large losses, for Motor 
and Home, and accumulation losses arising from natural 
and other catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance 
treaties are in place covering all years in which the Group 
has underwritten Motor policies. 
The Group has no quota share reinsurance or co-insurance 
arrangements in place.
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an 
annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the 
most appropriate structure and risk retention profile, taking 
into account the Group’s business objective of minimising 
volatility and the prevailing cost and the availability of 
reinsurance in the market.
Capital
The Group seeks to manage its capital in order to maintain 
an appropriate level of capitalisation and solvency to ensure 
that regulatory requirements are met with a prudent buffer 
and to ensure that there is sufficient capital available in 
order to fund profitable growth opportunities. 
Solvency II is the new solvency framework implemented 
on 1 January 2016 as the capital adequacy regime for the 
European insurance industry. It establishes a set of EU-wide 
capital requirements and risk management standards with 
the aim of increasing protection for policyholders. The Group 
is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) 
on both a Group basis and, for the Group’s sole underwriter, 
esure Insurance Limited, on a solo basis.  Strategic Report Governance Financials
21 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
The Group intends to hold capital coverage of its solvency 
capital requirement ('SCR') in the region of 130–150%. The 
capital surplus above the SCR provides sufficient headroom 
to absorb adverse capital events and should enable the 
Group to continue to meet its regulatory capital 
requirements.

Coverage ratio 149% 123%
 
From 1 January 2016, the Group was required to calculate its 
SCR and capital resources ('Own Funds') under the Solvency 
II Directive. The SCR is the level of capital the Group is 
required to hold to meet its obligations if a 1 in 200–year 
event were to occur in the next 12 months. The Group adopts 
the standard formula to calculate its capital requirements 
under Solvency II. 
The Group intends to hold capital coverage of its SCR in the 
region of 130–150%. This provides sufficient headroom to 
absorb adverse capital events and capital flexibility to fund 
further profitable growth. As at 31 December 2016, the 
coverage ratio of the Group’s SCR was 149% (2015: 123%).
The Group’s Own Funds increased by £84m in 2016, largely 
driven by a Gocompare.com’s debt raise prior to Demerger 
being paid to the Group as a dividend and an increase in 
the Group’s qualifying Tier 2 capital instrument. Own Funds 
comprise Tier 1 and Tier 2 qualifying capital. The Notes 
meet the qualifying criteria of a Tier 2 capital instrument 
and qualify up to a maximum of 50% of the SCR. The 
quality of the Group’s capital remains strong with 66% 
in Tier 1 and 34% in Tier 2.
Solvency capital requirement
The Group’s SCR allocation by risk type, based upon the 
undiversified capital requirement, can be seen below:
2016 
£m
Underwriting risk 72%
Market risk 18%
Operational risk 8%
Credit risk 2%
The main risk driver is underwriting, consisting of 
premium, reserve and catastrophe risk, reflecting the 
capital requirements of the core business activities for 
the Group.
Sensitivities
The Group’s capital structure is positioned to minimise 
the impact that adverse capital events have on its ability 
to meet its solvency capital requirements, were they to 
occur. The adverse capital events below are outlined to 
demonstrate the Group’s capital resilience to such events. 
 Impact

* Capital coverage movements are stated after earnings impact (net of 
tax and dividend with events assumed to occur on 31 December 2016). 
Ogden discount rate
As at 31 December 2016, the Group’s solvency coverage 
above its SCR included an allowance of £3m for a change 
in the Ogden discount rate to 0%. As a consequence of the 
discount rate moving to minus 0.75%, the Group’s capital 
position in 2017 will be reduced by £2m.
Dividends
The Group’s dividend policy is to target a base dividend of 
50% of underlying profit after tax and enhance the base 
dividend with a further special dividend, if the Group has 
sufficient capital and distributable reserves, after allowing 
for an appropriate level of capital coverage of the Group’s 
SCR and future growth opportunities. From 2017, the 
dividend will be set with reference to the Group’s reported 
profit after tax. The Board remains committed to returning 
excess capital to shareholders where it does not believe it 
can utilise retained capital for further profitable growth.
The interim dividend will be paid in October of the relevant 
financial year and the final dividend in May of the following 
financial year, in the approximate proportions of one-third 
and two-thirds respectively.
Segmental reporting
In 2016, the Group’s reportable segments were: Motor 
underwriting; Home underwriting; Non-underwritten 
additional services; and Investments. In 2017, the Group 
will change its reportable segments to Motor and Home to 
reflect its contribution approach.

Risk management
The Board is responsible for prudent oversight of esure 
Group, ensuring that it is conducted in accordance with 
sound business principles and within applicable law and 
regulation. This encompasses the responsibility to set and 
monitor adherence to strategic risk objectives and risk 
appetite statements. The Board also ensures that 
measures are in place to provide effective identification, 
management control and acceptance of risk.
In order to set boundaries to the acceptance of risk 
exposures, the Board has set out the following strategic 
risk statements that underpin our risk appetite and how 
the Group operates (see table below).
The Group’s risk management framework and ORSA 
processes are proportionate to the risks that we face and 
are organised around the core elements of risk strategy, 
risk appetite, governance, and the associated risk 
reporting.
The Group’s risk management framework is dynamic and 
continues to be enhanced and developed to ensure it 
continues to meet the needs of the business.

ensure it meets the needs of the business.  Strategic Report Governance Financials
23 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Risk strategy and appetite
The Group’s risk appetite incorporates a range of 
quantitative and qualitative measures of risk, supporting 
our strategic risk objectives, against which the actual or 
planned exposures and uncertainties can be monitored. 
This monitoring is reflected in regular reporting to the 
Group Executive Committee and the Risk Committee.
The risk appetite forms a fundamental part of the way in 
which the Group thinks about and assess risk, setting out 
the types and level of risk that it is willing to accept or 
avoid in the pursuit of its strategy.
These are considered within the Group’s strategic decisions 
and business planning but also form a critical element in 
the way we think about risk within the business. This 
includes how performance is assessed and how staff are 
incentivised. This ensures that staff and management 
behaviours are aligned to the risk appetite and strategic 
risk objectives and that this is reflected in day-to-day 
decision-making.
 
Risk reporting
The risk management framework and ORSA process are 
designed to ensure that the Risk Committee receives timely 
and appropriate reporting on our exposure to existing and 
emerging risks in each of the core risk categories – 
insurance, market, financial and solvency, operational, 
legal, regulatory and conduct. Strategic risks and the 
reputational consequences of these risk exposures are 
considered within this risk reporting.
Such reporting is supported by:
• Updates to the Group’s risk registers covering current 
and emerging risks.
• Reports on events that have resulted in actual or 
potential financial or reputational losses to the Group 
or its customers.
•  The results of stress, scenario and sensitivity testing as 
well as the modelling of our risks within our economic 
capital model.
•  The findings, recommendations and management actions 
arising from reviews conducted by the risk, compliance 
and Internal Audit functions.
• Detailed reviews of our key risks.
A key strength of the Group’s risk management strategy 
is the integration of risk assessment and evaluation into 
the Group’s business operations, planning and 
capital management.
Risk governance
In accordance with recognised good practice, the Group 
operates a 'three lines of defence' governance framework. 
This is set out on page 24. The Group’s risk governance is 
underpinned by a risk management function headed by the 
Chief Risk Officer, a member of the executive team reporting 
to the Chief Executive Officer, but with independence 
assured through direct and independent access to the 
Chairmen of the Board, Audit and Risk Committees.
The risk strategy, appetite and framework are articulated 
in a suite of policies covering the material risks that we 
face. Each of these policies is subject to annual review 
and approval.
Regulation
The UK motor and home markets are regulated by the 
Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and the Financial 
Conduct Authority ('FCA').
A summary of areas of focus in 2016 can be found below:
• Solvency II implementation; the Group has implemented 
Solvency II as a standard formula firm.
• EU General Data Protection Regulation.
• Senior Insurance Managers Regime and extending the 
Senior Manager and Certification Regime to all 
regulated firms.
• EU Insurance Distribution Directive.
• Renewal price transparency.
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ('ORSA')
Our Board and senior management  
have confidence in how we are  
embedding our strategic risk objectives.
There is a clear linkage between  
our strategic risk objectives and  
our risk appetite.
Our strategic decisions and plans  
are aligned to and support our  
risk appetite.
The risk appetite is fully embedded  
in all areas of the business.

Risk management continued
•  The cyclical nature of the business means that 
projecting for periods much longer than three years 
creates material uncertainty; however, we do look at 
longer-term strategic developments and emerging risks 
over longer time periods.
• The stress and scenario tests are considered over a 
three year period (as applicable) and such a period gives 
management sufficient opportunity to implement 
mitigations to return to ‘business as usual’.
Based on this robust assessment, the Directors confirm
that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company 
will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment.
Distributions
As noted in the Directors Report on page 71, the Directors 
have become aware of certain technical issues in respect 
of the Company’s procedures for the payment of the final 
cash dividend of 7.3 pence per share paid on 20 May 2016 
and the interim cash dividend of 3.0 pence per share paid on 
21 October 2016, (the 'Relevant Distributions'). As a result, 
the Relevant Distributions were not made in compliance with 
all the procedural requirements of the Act. The Company has 
put in place additional procedures to ensure that all relevant 
legal requirements relating to distributions are complied 
with going forward. These procedures have been subject 
to external legal review and will be regularly reassessed to 
ensure they remain appropriate.
Viability statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code 2016 the Directors have assessed the 
Group’s prospects and viability for the three-year period to 
31 December 2019, taking into account the Group’s current 
position and the potential impact of the principal risks as 
detailed in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 27. This 
is based on the ORSA as described within the Risk 
section on pages 22 to 27; the report on this process was 
submitted to the UK financial services regulator, the PRA.
This assessment encompasses business planning as a 
central estimate and variability derived from both the stress 
and scenario testing and risk modelling. The Directors 
consider this to be a robust process for assessing the 
current and future principal risks facing the Group.
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future 
performance or solvency of the Group.
The assessment period of three years has been chosen as 
it is in line with our business planning horizon and for the 
following reasons:
• We have an annual renewal cycle; which means that 
three years provides sufficient scope to see the impact 
of changes to the business.

25 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Key elements
• Pricing and underwriting
• Reserves
• Catastrophe
• Reinsurance
Definition
Insurance risk is the most material risk for the Group. It 
represents the uncertainty in the profitability of the business 
written due to variability in the value and timing of claims 
and premium rates – this can impact historic (reserve risk) 
as well as future exposures (underwriting and catastrophe).
There is some uncertainty within the market in terms of the 
rating environment and potential legal changes through the 
government consultation on Ogden discount rate and 
whiplash reforms. 
Mitigation
• There is strong and regular monitoring in place of the 
external environment to understand and react to the 
changing market, ensuring that we are well placed to 
benefit from any developments.
• There is a strong claims management process that 
ensures that there is strong customer service, 
management of claims costs and management 
information to understand claims trends.
• There is a robust monitoring process in place that tests 
the key variables affecting loss performance, including 
loss ratios, risk mix, pricing, quote conversion, renewal 
retention ratios, claims costs, claims frequency and the 
adequacy of reserves.
• There is use of external data to support our analysis of 
risk exposure for underwriting and catastrophe risk.
• There is a prudent approach to reserving risk with a risk 
appetite to hold a margin above the actuarial best 
estimate. The Group’s actuarial function analyses and 
projects historical claims development data and uses a 
number of actuarial techniques to both test and forecast 
claims provisions. In addition, independent external 
actuaries assess the adequacy of the Group’s reserves.
• There is reinsurance in place to protect the business 
from large losses and Catastrophe events; there are risk 
appetite metrics set against the level of coverage as well 
as the creditworthiness of reinsurers and concentration 
risk – these are monitored prior to finalisation of any 
contract and on an ongoing basis to ensure that it 
remains in line with our risk appetite.
Key elements
• Interest rate
• Spread
• Equity
• Default
• Liquidity
Definition
There are moderate levels of market Risk taken by the 
Group. It represents the uncertainty in the financial position 
due to fluctuations in the level and in the volatility of market 
prices of assets and liabilities.
There is some increased uncertainty within the market 
following Brexit and other macroeconomic uncertainties. 
Mitigation
• Market Risk is managed through regular monitoring, 
including the drivers of investment return and value at 
risk measures, counterparty exposures and interest rate 
sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. As part of this, 
the Group considers the matching of the investment 
portfolio with its insurance liabilities to mitigate and 
manage this risk.
• Oversight of the Group’s investment strategy and 
the associated liquidity risk is undertaken by the 
Investment Committee.
• Our investment strategy does not expose the Group to 
material currency risk or the risks arising from active 
trading of derivatives. 
• The Group manages the level of investment counterparty 
credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to 
a single counterparty or groups of counterparties, and 
on geographical counterparties and geographical 
segments. Such risks are subject to regular review 
within the Investment Committee.
• The Group continues to monitor its liquidity risk by 
considering the Group’s operating cash flows, stressed 
for catastrophe scenarios, dividend payouts, liquidity 
strains and investment strategy to mitigate this risk.

principal risks facing esure Group, focusing on those 
that would threaten the business model, future 
performance or solvency of the Group. 26 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Principal risks continued
Key elements
• Financial reporting
• Solvency position 
Definition
The risk that inaccurate financial estimates or judgements 
could misrepresent our financial or solvency position and 
change key strategic decisions. The preparation of financial 
information requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions where the actual outcome 
may differ from these estimates.
Mitigation
• The Group reviews financial estimates and underlying 
assumptions on an ongoing basis, taking into account 
changes in underwriting conditions, changes in 
legislation or regulation, and market movements.
• The Group has strong governance in place to provide 
oversight of the financial estimates and judgements as 
well as the solvency position being monitored on a 
regular basis.
• In addition, independent external actuaries assess the 
adequacy of the Group’s technical provisions. The 
oversight of the Group’s material financial estimates and 
judgements resides with the Audit Committee.
• As part of the ORSA process the Group considers the 
longer-term solvency position and the risks that it faces.
Key elements
• Business processes
• IT systems and disaster 
recovery
• Data security and  
cyber risk
• Infrastructure risk and 
business continuity
• Financial crime and 
fraud
• Outsourcing
• Distribution
Definition
The risk that there is a financial loss or reputational 
damage due to inadequate or failures with processes, 
people or systems – either within the Group or within 
material partners.
Mitigation
• Ownership and management of the operational risks 
sit with the first line business functions. There are also 
specialist teams that reside within the business functions 
that provide expertise and support, including for business 
continuity, IT disaster recovery, fraud and financial crime 
and cyber risk.
• Oversight, support and challenge are provided by the 
second line risk function which works closely with the 
first line business and specialist functions. 
• Operational risk identification, assessment and 
management are embedded within management 
processes. These processes are supported by the 
second line Risk team, including the annual risk and 
control self assessment.
• The Group has a robust governance and risk framework 
in place which provides an effective structure within 
which operational risks are identified, measured and 
managed. It ensures that there is clear ownership for 
risks with effective reporting and escalation mechanisms, 
supporting management oversight and decision-making.

27 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Key elements
• Legal and political risk
• Conduct and compliance risk
• Regulatory risk
Definition
The Group operates in a regulated environment therefore 
there is a risk of reputational or financial damage driven by 
regulatory or legal intervention. 
Mitigation
• There is a low appetite for this risk and this is reflected 
in management decision-making, with close monitoring 
of key risk indicators.
• Board oversight is ensured by upward reporting of a 
suite of customer and conduct risk appetite statements 
and measures.
• The Group continues to monitor legal and regulatory 
developments in the UK and Europe, through our close 
relationship with our regulators (the FCA and PRA) and 
other official bodies and the use of proactive risk 
management tools and processes to mitigate our 
exposure to regulatory risk.
• Our culture and tone from the top ensures the interests 
of our customers and their fair treatment is paramount.
• We have a strong governance framework and our 
Conduct Risk and Customer Committee reviews all 
aspects of our customer service.

for the Group as we have 
invested and delivered some 
significant initiatives from 
our People agenda.”
Helen Taylor / HR & Professional 
Services Director
2016 in summary
It’s our people that make us successful. They 
deliver an excellent customer experience and are the 
foundation of our growth. This has been a great year 
for the Group as we have invested and delivered 
some significant initiatives from our People 
Agenda including:
• Implementation of a new Pay and Reward Framework 
across the business
• Improvements to our Performance Management 
processes
• Building the skills and competencies we want to see in all 
our leaders
• Investment and development of our internal talent 
• The maturity of our first employee sharesave scheme
• 15 year anniversary celebrations
Our People and Culture
The Group employs 1,557 people across three offices in 
Reigate, Manchester and Glasgow. We believe the key to 
our success is not just what we do but the way we do it. The 
quality and commitment of everyone who works at esure 
Group is the key to making us successful. To achieve this, 
esure Group’s people strategy is built upon a competitive 
reward and benefits package, a high level of colleague 
engagement, opportunities to grow and develop and 
excellent internal communications. 
It’s important our colleagues are rewarded both fairly 
and competitively and that our structure and progression 
opportunities are transparent and easy to understand. 
Financially, the Group is committed to rewarding our 
colleagues for the value that they bring to the Group.
Whilst we have always adopted the Government National 
Minimum and Living Wage, we are now furthering our 
commitment to colleagues by supporting the Living Wage 
Foundation and from 2017 we pay the Voluntary Living 
Wage across all areas of our business. 
We aim to offer fair and equitable pay increases for 
everyone based upon an individual’s contribution to the 
business which promotes progression through the pay 
ranges. Colleagues in our customer facing areas and a 
small number of head office functions now also benefit from 
a formal pay progression scheme which allows them the 
opportunity to accelerate through the pay ranges. 
Our aim is to provide a great place to work for all 
colleagues and we continue to invest in our people  
as this is fundamental to our success.  Strategic Report Governance Financials
29 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
In addition, and following an extensive market review, we 
also invested a further £1.7m into our reward structure and 
implemented a new Pay and Reward Framework across all 
areas of our business. This included increasing the salaries 
of our new starters in customer facing teams; realignment 
of variable pay to ensure junior colleagues have increased 
fixed pay and new customer focused incentive schemes.
We have further improved the range of benefits offered 
to colleagues this year by increasing our basic holiday 
entitlement for over 800 colleagues and providing an 
improved wellbeing offering which includes the opportunity 
to join a health cash plan and free flu vaccinations. This 
supplements the wide range of benefits we already offer 
colleagues including profit share, a voluntary benefits 
platform, salary sacrifice schemes including childcare, 
cycle to work, car parking and computers, season tickets 
loans, long service awards (for colleagues who have been 
with the Group for 10 and 15 years) and discounts on Group 
insurance products.
We also operate an esure Group sharesave plan enabling 
colleagues to invest in the business through share ownership 
at 80% of market value. The first scheme we launched back 
in 2013 matured in November 2016. Colleagues had the 
option to purchase esure Group shares and become a 
shareholder in the Group, sell their shares or take their 
savings back. Over 69% of colleagues (283 of the 408 
colleagues) chose to purchase shares at the option price 
and become a shareholder in the esure Group demonstrating 
their commitment to our Business. 
Our annual sharesave schemes are popular with colleagues 
and we continue to maintain a high take up. In 2016, 507 
colleagues invested in this scheme, which was a 50% 
increase on the number of applicants in 2015. This was a 
fantastic achievement which again demonstrates colleagues 
commitment to working at esure. 
This year also saw the vesting of the free shares awarded 
to colleagues back in 2013 in recognition of us becoming a 
plc. Again a high number (30%) of colleagues decided to 
keep their shares, becoming shareholders. 
Colleagues
'Our culture is to engage with our colleagues and 
put the customer at the heart of everything we do. 
We focus on delivering excellent service through 
listening to our customers, responding to their 
needs, getting it right first time, keeping our 
promises and with timely customer communications. 
If we get all of this right it will be great for our 
customers and will drive efficiency.'
David Pitt / Chief Operating Officer
The Group looks to recognise colleagues who have shown 
a commitment to being part of the esure Group. In 2015 
we are proud to say that 70 colleagues celebrated their 
15 year anniversary with us which was acknowledged with 
a special gift from the CEO. In addition we had 48 colleagues 
celebrating their 10 year anniversary with the Group. To 
mark this special occasion the Executive Team hosted a 
number of 10 year anniversary evening dinners across 
our locations. 
Engagement
We ran our second colleague engagement survey this 
year, partnering again with Willis Towers Watson. We 
maintained an excellent response rate of 91%, meaning 
the results contained in the survey really do reflect the views 
of the majority of colleagues. Our overall engagement score 
was 65% which was lower than our first survey. However, 
this was not unexpected given some of the operational 
challenges colleagues faced during the first six months of 
the year when call volumes were particularly high. We were 
really pleased with the customer focused culture the survey 
demonstrated with 85% of colleagues believing they can 
positively impact our customers experience. In addition a 
fantastic 93% of our colleagues understand how their job 
contributes to our business goals. Results were shared 
face to face with all colleagues and a number of local 
action plans have been developed which included refreshed 
offices in Manchester and Glasgow to improve the working 
environment. At a Business wide level it is important that we 
maintain a focus on engagement and action planning. 
Class of 2016, Rising Stars with CEO, Stuart Vann 30 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
To ensure this continues, we remain focused on two 
strategic areas of improvement which underpin our 
business plan:
• Communicating Better – improving the consistency 
of communications across the business. 
• Leading Better – investing in all leaders across the 
Group to build the skills and competencies we would like 
to see in all our leaders.
The annual colleague engagement survey is just one 
mechanism whereby colleagues can provide the senior 
management team with feedback. Annual face-to-face 
colleague briefings to share Company news are hosted by 
the Executive team and take place across all our locations. 
This is further supported by twice yearly ‘Ask the Exec’ 
Q&As and a bi-monthly CEO Business Update 
communication to colleagues. 
The Employee Consultation Group ('ECG') is another 
forum to understand colleague views and opinions and 
provide a mechanism for feedback to the Executive Team. 
The Group meets regularly and during 2016 four committee 
meetings were held. Colleagues have the opportunity to 
raise ideas or ask questions via a dedicated section on 
eserve (the Company intranet site) or via elected colleague 
representatives from Reigate, Manchester and Glasgow. 
Around 50 new questions and ideas across the three 
locations ranging from catering facilities, ideas on 
improving communications across locations and requests 
for new equipment to do the job such as printers have 
been raised and responses published on the dedicated 
ECG intranet pages. 
Regular recognition underpins the esure Group and we 
look to recognise colleagues for going the extra mile in a 
variety of ways. This includes everything from a gift for 
great customer feedback from the CEO to dinners for high 
performing colleagues and the recently established annual 
CEO awards.
The Group encourage all colleagues to enjoy work 
and get involved in team-based activities. This year there 
have been a number of celebrations for colleagues to be 
involved in, including the Olympics celebrations and our 
very own ‘Road to Rio’ challenges whereby colleagues were 
encouraged to run, ride, walk, row, skip during the three 
weeks of the Olympics to make our way to Rio – that’s just 
5,778 miles away! In addition, we have our now infamous 
Christmas quiz where colleagues can win substantial prizes 
such as ipads and flat screen televisions. 
Our training and development
In our continued commitment to grow and develop 
colleagues, we have implemented a number of key 
initiatives this year, including a revised performance 
management framework which will result in a more 
transparent and consistent approach across the Business. 
The approach will revolve around evaluating colleagues’ 
overall, rounded performance throughout the whole of the 
performance year, considering not only ‘what’ a colleague 
achieves, but also ‘how’ they achieve this.
In addition to the training all colleagues receive in order 
to excel in their roles, our Chief Executive Officer sponsors 
two Talent programmes – Rising Stars and Future Leaders. 
Both programmes (aimed at customer-facing colleagues 
and middle managers respectively) provide the 
opportunity for colleagues to learn from senior leaders 
within the business, develop new skills, identify career 
opportunities and helps esure Group strengthen its talent 
pool, capability and succession plans. 
From an external talent perspective, we were asked 
by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to sponsor 
a female leader on their Future Leaders Programme. The 
programme (which commences in January 2017 and lasts 
for 12 months) was created in consultation with insurers 
to complement and add to the development pathways of 
promising senior leaders. We are delighted to support such 
initiatives to help development across the industry.

Following our engagement survey results, a key area of 
focus this year and next is developing the core competencies 
of our leaders. There are a number of key initiatives which 
have been implemented to support that development 
journey including:
• Launch of the leadership framework which will allow us 
to establish a benchmark for what good leadership looks 
like at esure Group.
• A Management Excellence programme aimed at our team 
leader population to provide development on core 
management basics.
• A series of communication development sessions to 
leaders to improve communication effectiveness.
We are extremely proud that one of our colleagues from 
our Personal Injury team within Claims has been awarded 
the coveted John Smith Trophy by the Chartered Insurance 
Institute ('CII'). The CII is the world's largest professional 
body for the insurance and financial planning professions 
and it awards the John Smith Trophy each year to the 
student who obtains the best results for the Diploma  
in Insurance. 
In 2017 we will also be focusing on introducing 
apprenticeships to allow us to develop colleagues as well as 
ensuring we continue to build technical competence within 
our Business. 
Community and charity involvement
We have further invested in the great charity work we 
have always undertaken in the community by establishing 
a Community Committee in each of our three locations. This 
enables each office to support the communities and local 
charities that are important to their particular location in 
addition to national charities such as the NSPCC, Sport Relief 
and Cancer Research. Over the past 12 months each location 
has undertaken a wide range of fund raising activities 
throughout the year, everything from dress down days, fun 
days, cake sales, charity boat races and sponsored runs. 
During 2016 colleagues across our locations raised 
a fantastic total in the region of £33,000 in charitable 
donations. In addition to monetary donations, the Group 
has also supported a number of charities in more tangible 
ways including:
• Our Reigate office has a long standing relationship with 
Surrey Fire Brigade as we sponsor its Safe Drive, Stay 
Alive campaign aimed at preventing young drivers from 
being involved in traffic accidents. We have supported 
this programme for 11 years now and we are proud to be 
a part of an initiative that sees thousands of 16–18 year 
olds across Surrey educated about safe driving.
• At our Glasgow office, for the 12th year in a row, 
colleagues put together Christmas lunch boxes for the 
local Loaves and Fishes charity who provide essential 
food items to families in the Glasgow and surrounding 
area. The charity has said that this year requests have 
reached an all-time high and our donations make a huge 
difference to those less fortunate than ourselves. 
• At our Manchester office, colleagues supported the Royal 
Manchester Childrens Hospital Ward 84 Summer Party. 
This was achieved by sending volunteers to assist on the 
day, which enabled the parents to spend more time with 
their children. We also collected boxes full of toys for the 
children which we put into a raffle to raise funds to 
support forthcoming events.
We recognise that investing in a community is not just 
about providing employment opportunities and we have 
worked hard to support the communities where we are 
based. A further example of this is in Glasgow where we 
have been working in partnership with Developing Young 
Workforce Glasgow to give the opportunity to students from 
schools and higher education, who have an interest in the 
financial sector to visit the Group and learn more about our 
Business through their Finance & Business Services Insight 
programme. The visits consist of groups of up to 15 people 
from across the education spectrum e.g. school, college and 
university, and cover a range of information including a tour 
of the business environment, an overview of the Group, 
potential career information and opportunities. 32 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016

Chairman’s letter
Dear shareholder
The Board’s role is to provide leadership to the Group to 
assist us in achieving its strategic aims, and to promote 
the long-term success of the Group. We keep our corporate 
governance framework under continual review and our Board 
Committees play a vital role in ensuring its effectiveness. 
Each Committee Chairman has provided a report on the 
Committee’s role and these can be found on pages 40 to 46.
Following her appointment as CEO of M&G Investments, 
Anne Richards stepped down as a Non-Executive Director
on 25 February 2016. 
As part of our succession planning, and as previously 
announced, Peter Ward has decided to step down as 
Non-Executive Director of the Company at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2017. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank Peter and Anne for their 
support over the years, they have been exceptionally 
valuable members of the Board.
I am delighted to welcome Alan Rubenstein and Peter Shaw, 
who joined the Board as Non-Executive Directors on 8 March 
2017, Peter Shaw has been appointed a member of the 
Remuneration and Risk Committees. Alan Rubenstein has 
been appointed as a member of the Audit and Nomination 
Committees.
I, together with the Nomination Committee, continue to 
keep the membership of our Board under review, ensuring 
we have the right mix of skills, experience and background. 
Currently, 30% (33% as from May 2017) of our Board 
members are women.
We remain committed to diversity and equality within 
our organisation, whilst continuing to make appointments 
based on objective criteria.
I believe this report demonstrates how, through their 
actions, the Board and its Committees continue to fulfil 
their governance responsibilities and how the Board works 
proactively to embed good governance practices across the 
Group on an ongoing basis.

The UK Corporate Governance Code
We are firmly committed to high standards of 
corporate governance and maintaining a sound 
framework for the control and management of the 
business. Throughout the period from 1 January 
2016 to 31 December 2016, the Group has been in 
compliance with the principles and provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
As a major UK general insurer, the Group has, since 
2000, been regulated, most recently by the FCA and 
the PRA. We are, therefore, familiar and comfortable 
with the corporate governance practices expected 
of a listed company as many have been long 
established in the business.
 
The Group also complies fully with the corporate 
governance requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 
(and regulations made thereunder) applicable to 
it as a result of its insurance and insurance 
mediation businesses.
Further information on the UK Corporate Governance
Code can be found at www.frc.org.uk.

Leadership
The Board is responsible for leading and controlling the esure 
Group and has overall authority for the management and 
conduct of the Group’s business, strategy and development. 
The Board is also responsible for ensuring the maintenance 
of a sound system of internal control and risk management 
(including financial, operational and compliance controls, and 
for reviewing the overall effectiveness of systems in place), 
and for the approval of any changes to the capital, corporate 
and management structure of the Group.
To assist the Board in carrying out its functions and to 
ensure there is independent oversight of internal control 
and risk management, the Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to Board Committees, which, except for 
the Nomination Committee, are comprised of independent 
Non-Executive Directors. The Nomination Committee is 
comprised of a majority of independent Non-Executive 
Directors. The Chairman of each Board Committee reports 
to the Board on its proceedings after each Committee 
meeting. Each Board Committee has agreed Terms of 
Reference approved by the Board. On 1 March 2016, the 
Board agreed to redesignate the Investment Committee 
as a Management Committee.
The full schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s 
decision along with the Terms of Reference of the Board’s key 
Committees are available to view online at www.esuregroup.
com/corporate-information/corporate-governance.
Board meetings
The Board holds regular scheduled meetings throughout 
the year. Seven scheduled Board meetings were held in 
2016. An annual strategy meeting was also held.
If unable to attend a meeting, Directors are encouraged to 
provide their views and comments to the Chairman on the 
matters to be discussed so these can be shared with the 
other Directors at the meeting. Meeting attendance by the 
Directors is shown in the next column.
At each meeting, the Chief Executive Officer and 
Chief Finance Officer reported on operational and 
financial performance.
Diversity
Although we do not have a diversity policy, the Group is 
strongly committed to the merits of diversity at Board level 
and throughout the business. We are committed to carrying 
out candidate searches across the widest possible pool of 
talent against a set of objective criteria based on merit, 
but with due regard to the benefits of diversity, including 
gender. Currently, 30% of the Board are female. 
Our Group Executive Committee has one woman on 
a Committee of five members (20%). Of our senior 
managers, 33% (16) are female; this becomes 53.5% 
(15) for managers. Our overall percentage of female staff 
is 51.5% (807). We have signed up to the Women in 
Finance Charter.
We shall continue to develop the potential of women
throughout the Group.
Directors’ external activities and conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in 
which they have a direct or indirect conflict of interest 
or possible conflict of interest with the Company. Under 
the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has 
the authority to authorise such potential conflicts and 
there is a procedure in place to deal with any actual or 
potential conflicts of interest. Prior to taking on additional 
responsibilities or external appointments, Directors are 
obliged to obtain authorisation from the Chairman and it is 
their responsibility to ensure that they will be able to meet 
the time commitment expected of them in their role at the 
Group. Any potential conflicts approved by the Board are 
recorded in an Interests Register, and are noted by the 
Board at its next meeting.
Executive Directors may take up one FTSE 100 non- 
executive directorship and are allowed to retain any fees 
they receive for such appointment. Stuart Vann and Darren 
Ogden do not hold any such directorships.

are complemented by a strong and experienced Senior 
Management team. The Group Executive Committee is 
chaired by the Chief Executive Officer. Strategic Report Governance Financials
37 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer are separate, with responsibilities 
clearly divided.
The Chairman
The Chairman is responsible for the leadership 
of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in 
all aspects of its role. He promotes the highest 
standards of corporate governance and ensures 
effective communications with shareholders. The 
Chairman sets the agenda for Board discussions to 
promote effective and constructive debate and to 
support a sound decision-making process, ensuring 
that the Board receives accurate, timely and clear 
information, in particular about the Group’s 
performance. He is also Chairman of the 
Nomination Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for the performance and management of the 
Group’s business.
In addition to membership of the Board, the 
Chief Executive Officer leads the Group Executive 
team in running the business and is charged with 
recommending and then implementing the Board’s 
strategy. He is also responsible for ensuring 
effective internal controls and risk 
management systems are in place.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer 
meet regularly and keep in close contact as they 
are a critical link between the Board and senior 
management and liaise on strategic and other issues.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring a very broad 
level of experience and independent judgement 
to the Board and make a valuable contribution to 
achieving our objectives. They provide a strong 
independent element on the Board and are well 
placed to challenge constructively and help formulate 
strategy. Shirley Garrood is the Deputy Chairman and 
also the Senior Independent Director. She supports 
the Chairman in his role and is also available as an 
additional point of contact for shareholders.
Company Secretary
The Company Secretary provides administrative 
and logistical support to the Board. Advice and 
support are also given on governance, compliance 
and regulatory matters. The Company Secretary 
is available to advise all Directors and ensures that 
Board procedures are complied with. The Directors 
may also seek independent professional advice at 
the Company’s expense. No such advice was sought 
during the year.

As the Chairman is also a controlling shareholder in the 
Group, a Relationship Agreement between Sir Peter Wood 
and the Group is in place to ensure that the independence 
provisions as set out in the Listing Rules are complied with. 
The Non-Executive Directors have a letter of appointment 
that sets out the terms and conditions of their directorship, 
including the fees payable and the expected time 
commitment. Each Non-Executive Director is expected 
to commit sufficient time, as is reasonably necessary, for 
the proper performance of his or her duties. Additional 
time commitment is required to fulfil the roles of Deputy 
Chairman, Senior Independent Director and Committee 
Chairman or Board Committee member.
Succession planning and Board appointments 
The Nomination Committee has continued to work on 
ensuring an appropriate mix among both the Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors. It also kept under review the 
succession planning for Executive Directors, Non-Executive 
Directors and other senior executives.
In 2016 Anne Richards stepped down as a Non-Executive 
Director and Peter Ward will step down as a Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
on 17 May 2017. As part of the succession planning 
the Nomination Committee, having reviewed the skills 
required, recommended to the Board the appointment 
of Alan Rubenstein and Peter Shaw as Non-Executive 
Directors. The Committee also recommended to the Board 
the appointments of Alan Rubenstein as a member of the 
Audit and Nomination Committee and Peter Shaw as a 
member of the Risk and Remuneration Committees.
The Board believes that it will continue to possess the 
relevant skills and competencies for the future under its 
succession plan.
Board induction and professional development
On joining the Board, Directors take part in an 
induction programme to increase their knowledge 
and understanding of the Group. In line with the normal 
process, Alan Rubenstein and Peter Shaw were provided 
with information about the Group, the role of the Board 
and the matters reserved for its decision. They were also 
provided with the Terms of Reference and membership 
of the main Board Committees, as well as corporate 
governance policies and procedures. Meetings were held 
with each of the Executive Directors, members of the Group 
Executive and senior managers across the Group as part of 
the induction programme.
The induction programme also included:
• Company structure and strategy; 
• Key people and succession plans; 
• Board procedures including the governance framework, 
Board calendar, minutes from previous meetings, 
effectiveness reviews and action plans; 
• Finances, performance, operating plans, operational 
overview of all business areas; Group risk profile and our 
approach to risk; 
• Insight into key internal audits and areas of focus; and
• Share register and voting history and an overview of our 
Remuneration Policy.
Effectiveness
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises ten members: The Chairman, 
two Executive Directors and seven Non-Executive Directors.
Peter Ward has decided to step down as a Non-Executive 
Director at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting 
on 17 May 2017.
The Chairman, Sir Peter Wood, has served in this role since
2000 and, on appointment, was not independent. Of the 
seven Non-Executive Directors:
• Shirley Garrood, María Dolores Dancausa, Martin Pike, 
Angela Seymour-Jackson, Alan Rubenstein and Peter 
Shaw are considered by the Board to be independent 
for the purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code
• Peter Ward has served on the Board for more than nine 
years from the date of his first election, but is 
considered by the Board to be independent for the 
purposes of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
notwithstanding the length of his service.
In reaching this conclusion regarding the independence
of Peter Ward, the Board has:
• considered the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code and the nature of the relationships 
and circumstances outlined above which are relevant 
to the Board’s determination of independence; and
• evaluated the historic contribution of this Director 
to the Group in scrutinising the performance of 
management, monitoring the reporting of performance 
and constructively challenging and assisting the 
development of the Group’s proposals on strategy.
The Group therefore considers that it complies with the 
relevant requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
in relation to the balance of Executive and independent Non-
Executive Directors on the Board and with the requirements 
for composition of the Group’s Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees.
Directors’ election and re-election
At the Annual General Meeting in 2016, all continuing 
Directors offered themselves for re-election. Each Director 
was re-elected and no Director received less than 90% in 
favour of the votes cast. At the Annual General Meeting 
in 2017, all of the Directors will again retire and all will 
offer themselves for re-election, or in the case of newly 
appointed Directors, for election.
Biographical details of each of the Directors, 
together with details of their skills and experience, may be 
found on pages 32 and 33. Following a formal performance 
evaluation, the Board has concluded that each Director’s 
performance continues to be effective and that the Directors 
continue to demonstrate commitment to the role and, 
accordingly, the Board recommends that shareholders 
approve the resolutions to be proposed at the 2017 Annual 
General Meeting relating to the re-election or election of 
the Directors.
Executive Directors’ service contracts and  
Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment 
The Chairman and each of the Executive Directors have 
a service contract with the Group. The service contracts 
of the Chairman and the Executive Directors can be 
terminated by not less than 12 months’ notice by the 
Chairman or the Executive Director (as appropriate) 
and 12 months’ notice by the Group. Strategic Report Governance Financials
39 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Evaluation of Board performance
The assessment of the Board was conducted in 
accordance with the guidance set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance code. As the 2015 review was conducted by 
an external facilitator, the 2016 review was undertaken 
internally by the Chairman and Company Secretary, using 
comprehensive questionnaires.
The evaluation was based around a number of key areas:
• Board composition, role, skills, diversity, balance 
and experience.
• Succession planning.
• Board leadership and culture.
• Agenda, information and papers.
• Strategic oversight.
• Governance, regulatory compliance and support; and
• Committee performance.
The Board also assessed its progress against the action 
plan from the 2015 review, and concluded that good 
progress had been made against the plan. 
The final report on the Board and its Committees was 
presented and discussed with the whole Board at its 
meeting in December 2016. The Chairman met individually 
with each Director to discuss the findings. The Senior 
Independent Director also met with the Directors to review 
the Chairman’s performance. This review was then shared 
with the Chairman.
Having gone through the effectiveness review, the 
Directors are satisfied that the Board and each of its 
Committees are operating effectively. The review has 
identified some actions that will help maintain and improve 
its effectiveness. Areas for improvement included: more 
contact with senior management below Group Executive 
level and ensuring the Board and Committee papers are 
more concise.
Overall the evaluation process confirmed that the Board was 
operating effectively with a culture that supported open and 
challenging debate and that all Directors individually made 
valuable contributions and demonstrated commitment to 
the role.
Shareholder engagement
The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer and the 
Senior Independent Director and Deputy Chairman, as well 
as other senior executives, held meetings with a number of 
the Group’s shareholders and prospective shareholders to 
discuss the Group’s strategy and financial performance. All 
Non-Executive Directors, including the Senior Independent 
Director, have an invitation to attend investor meetings if 
they wish. The Directors are provided with regular reports 
on shareholders’ and analysts’ views and of changes in the 
holdings of the principal shareholders.
During the year, the Chairman, Martin Pike, as Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee, and the Company Secretary 
had meetings with several of the Group’s largest institutional 
shareholders to discuss our Demerger with Gocompare.com.
The Group has established procedures to ensure the timely 
release of inside information and the publication of financial 
results and regulatory financial statements. The Disclosure 
Committee, a committee of senior executives and chaired 
by the Company Secretary, also reviews all significant 
announcements for accuracy and compliance requirements.

Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are to assist the 
Board in discharging its duties in respect of: 
• agreeing the scope of the external audit, receiving and 
reviewing reports from the Group’s external auditor, 
monitoring its effectiveness and independence, and 
making recommendations to the Board in respect of its 
remuneration, appointment and dismissal;
• monitoring and reviewing Internal Audit activities; 
• approving the annual audit plan;
• reviewing the Annual Report and Accounts of the Group 
and other announcements relating to its financial 
performance; 
• reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of 
internal controls; and 
• reviewing the Group’s Whistleblowing Policy. 
The Committee is authorised to investigate any activity 
within its Terms of Reference and to seek any information 
that it requires from any employee. It has the right to 
consult professional advisors and, if it is not satisfied with 
the advice received, seek further independent professional 
advice. The Committee’s Chairman formally reports to the 
Board on its proceedings after each meeting.
Terms of Reference
The Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference can be viewed on 
our website at www.esuregroup.com/corporate-information, 
and are reviewed annually. These were last updated on 
8 March 2017.
Composition and Meetings
The Audit Committee currently has four members. Further 
biographical details regarding the members of the Audit 
Committee can be found on pages 32 and 33. All four 
members of the Audit Committee have extensive commercial 
experience and therefore satisfy the requirements of the 
Code. The Board has determined that Shirley Garrood, the 
Chairman of the Committee, is the Committee’s designated 
financial expert.
In the year under review, the Committee held five 
scheduled meetings, details of the attendances at these 
meetings are set out in the table above.
To discharge its functions effectively, the Audit Committee 
has unrestricted access to the Group’s external and internal 
auditors, with whom it also meets without the Executive 
Directors present. These meetings ensure that there are no 
restrictions on the scope of their audits, and allow 
discussions on any matters that the auditors might not 
wish to raise in the presence of management. During 2016 
three such meetings were held.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Finance 
Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Operating Officer 
and the Company Secretary, along with the external and 
internal auditors, are invited to attend meetings of the 
Committee. Other members of senior management are 
invited to present reports as necessary to enable the 
Committee to undertake its duties.
The Audit Committee and the Risk Committee have 
cross-membership. This has permitted both Committees to 
ensure that their Terms of Reference remain appropriate 
to deliver coverage of both the internal control and risk 
management framework of the Group. Strategic Report Governance Financials
41 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Audit Committee Section
Overview of the actions taken by the Audit 
Committee to undertake its duties.
In undertaking its responsibilities, the Committee 
concentrated on five main areas.
1 Financial reporting
With support and input from the external auditor, 
the Committee has challenged and reviewed the 
financial reporting for the Group, and assessed 
whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted, 
whether management has made appropriate estimates 
and judgements and whether disclosures in this Annual 
Report for the Group are fair, balanced and understandable. 
In the current year the treatment of the Demerger of 
Gocompare.com plc has been an additional matter for the 
Committee’s consideration. 
The Committee has taken an active role in the Group’s 
final preparations for Solvency II reporting. As part of 
this the Committee has considered and reviewed solvency 
disclosures included for the first time in the Annual Report. 
The Committee will also review this year the publicly 
disclosed returns required under Solvency II including the 
Solvency and Financial Condition Report (‘SFCR’) and the 
reporting to the PRA in the Regulatory Supervisory Report 
(‘RSR’) and new Quantitative Reporting Templates (‘QRT’s) 
associated with these reports and will recommend these 
returns to the Board and to esure Insurance Limited for 
review and final approval. 
The Group’s control environment underpins the integrity 
of the financial statements. The Committee has considered 
reports from the Chief Risk Officer, Internal Audit function 
and external auditor to satisfy itself that the control 
environment supporting the financial statements is 
properly designed and operating effectively.
Significant financial judgements and financial reporting 
for 2016
As part of its work in the year, the Audit Committee, on 
behalf of the Board, has reviewed the Annual Report and 
financial statements, the Interim Report and financial 
statements, and the Group’s significant annual regulatory 
returns. In doing this, the Audit Committee has considered 
various issues and discussed how these are addressed:
Claims outstanding
After discussion with management and the external 
auditor, the Committee determined that the most 
significant judgement relating to the Group’s financial 
statements continues to be the estimation of claims 
outstanding, which comprise provisions for the cost of 
settling all claims incurred but not settled at the balance 
sheet date, whether reported or not, and including related 
reinsurance recoveries and claims handling expenses. The 
Group’s policy is to hold sufficient provisions to meet all 
liabilities as they fall due, inclusive of a margin, by reference 
to the Board-approved risk appetite. Whilst considering this 
issue, the Committee received reports and presentations 
from the internal and external actuary (Willis Towers 
Watson), with the results of the external actuary being 
considered as part of the second line of defence. The 
Committee also meets with the Chief Actuary at least once 
a year without management present. Two such meetings 
were held in 2016.
The Committee challenged and debated the process, 
key judgements and assumptions supporting the internal 
actuary’s best estimate projection, including a range of 
sensitivities and possible alternative scenarios and 
explanations for differences compared with the 
projections undertaken by the external actuary.
The Committee noted the inherent uncertainties associated 
with reserving for certain types of claim. Factors such as 
changes in the legal environment, results of litigation, 
propensity of personal injury claims, changes in medical 
and care costs, and costs of vehicle and home repairs can all 
substantially affect overall costs and expenses of claims, and 
cause a material divergence from the basis and assumptions 
on which the reserves were calculated.
During the year, the Committee gave specific consideration 
to the Group’s approach to reserving for claims subject to 
periodic payment orders (‘PPOs’) and large bodily injury 
claims as part of a wider development of the process and 
models used for claims outstanding. The factors on which 
the Committee focused included the changes seen over 
recent years in the Office of National Statistics’ Annual 
Survey of Hours and Earnings figures, the split between 
upfront lump sums and the PPO and PPO propensity and the 
Ogden rate. Whilst PPOs are individually large the Group 
controls its net exposure through its reinsurance policies. 
On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor changed the 
Ogden discount rate from plus 2.5% to minus 0.75% 
effective 20 March 2017. As at 31 December 2016 the 
Group’s reserve margin included an allowance for a change 
in the Ogden discount rate to 0%. To assess the impact on 
the financial statements of the announced rate being lower 
than the Group had allowed for, the Committee considered 
management’s analysis and reviews conducted by the 
external auditor and the external actuary. The Committee 
concurred with management’s assessment that the impact 
on profit after tax is immaterial. Refer to note 31 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further information.
Demerger of Gocompare.com
The Committee was involved throughout the process 
for the Group’s Demerger of Gocompare.com Group plc. 
Once the transaction was complete the Committee debated 
and questioned management’s approach to the Demerger 
accounting, disclosure and regulatory reporting. This 
included, but was not limited to the proposed accounting 
treatment and disclosure and review of the narrative 
disclosure included in note 12. 
Other matters
The Committee also considered a number of less significant 
matters, including new accounting standards which may 
impact the Group in the next few years, the classification 
of and accounting for investments classified as available 
for sale and the accounting treatment of the share-based 
payment schemes after the Demerger of Gocompare.com. 
The Group has in place arrangements to ensure that the 
Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides shareholders with the 
information necessary to assess the Group’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy. The Committee 
examined the 2016 Annual Report and was specifically 
tasked by the Board to review the viability statement and 
to advise on whether the report is fair, balanced and 
understandable. 42 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
The Committee questioned and provided comments 
to those charged with governance and oversight of the 
drafting and production of the Annual Report, including 
the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer and Chief 
Risk Officer. The Committee focused on the overall tone 
and messages conveyed by the report and consistency with 
internal reports and information presented to the Committee 
throughout the year, drawing together information from the 
independent external auditor, internal audit reports and 
information provided by those charged with governance. 
We continued to challenge this year, for example around 
PPOs as noted above, in light of increasing levels of 
regulation and evolving best practice. 
Following full consideration of all available information, 
including discussion and debate with both management and 
the external auditor, the Committee concluded that it could 
recommend to the Board that the 2016 Annual Report and 
financial statements are fair, balanced and understandable.
The Committee reviewed the Whistleblowing Policy and 
ensured any concerns raised were properly investigated.
2 Internal controls and key risks
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee received reports 
from the Chief Risk Officer and Internal Audit. The Internal 
Audit function is fulfilled by a third-party organisation, 
Mazars LLP, which has fulfilled this function since 2010. 
During 2016, in line with best practice, the approach taken 
by Mazars has been refreshed with the appointment of a 
new lead partner with 14 years’ experience of delivering 
internal audit to insurance companies.
The Committee challenged the Executive team on the 
content and reliability of those reports and the Committee 
has been satisfied that appropriate arrangements, actions 
or mitigating controls are in place in response to Internal 
Audit and the Chief Risk Officer’s findings. No significant 
failings or weaknesses were identified.
This year, the Committee reviewed all internal audits; of 
these, the most significant internal audits addressing key 
risk areas during the year were:
• IT Infrastructure Transformation – Ongoing analysis 
and assessment of the processes, governance and risk 
management activities relating to the project and its key 
risks. Work related to the implementation testing phase 
of the project and the initial post-implementation 
activities undertaken following the successful completion 
of the project during Q2 2016;
• Cyber – an assessment of the adequacy of training and 
awareness of cyber-crime prevention within esure 
Group, and a review of the adequacy and effectiveness 
of the supplier relationship management framework, 
with a specific focus on the management and storage of 
confidential client or employee data by key suppliers;
• Claims – an assessment of the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the general controls within the claims 
handling process, focusing on the key risks and 
examining the design and operating effectiveness of the 
controls in place;
• Underwriting & Pricing – a review of the processes, 
procedures and controls in place for pricing and rate 
setting. Controls and procedures for updating 
underwriting rules and assumptions were also reviewed;
• Compliance – an assessment of the adequacy of the 
arrangements in place for the compliance function, in 
particular its effectiveness as well as its governance 
structure. Emphasis was also placed on assessing the 
function’s management of regulatory and conduct risks 
through Quality Assurance, compliance monitoring and 
other key controls; 
Audit Committee Section continued
• Regulatory – a review of the Groups’ regulatory 
compliance framework adequacy to ensure that it is fully 
compliant with the Senior Insurance Managers Regime 
(‘SIMR’); and
• Internal Audit also followed up and reported to the 
Committee on all outstanding actions from previous 
internal audits.
These key risk areas have also been reflected in the 
principal risks considered both by management, as 
discussed on page 25 to 27, and KPMG in their role as 
external auditors as highlighted on page 74.
3 Effectiveness of Internal Audit
The Audit Committee supports the Board in fulfilling its 
responsibilities to review the activities, resources, 
organisational structure and the operational effectiveness 
of the internal audit activities. Following discussion with the 
Committee Chairman, Mazars LLP presents its internal 
audit plans for approval to the Committee before the start 
of each year and provides an update and further plans 
mid-year. The Committee reviewed the internal audit work 
plans during the year and concluded that it was satisfied 
with the plans and that they were addressing the key risks.
As part of the annual review referenced above, and 
considering management’s opinion, the Committee was 
satisfied that the Internal Audit function remains effective 
and fit for purpose. The Internal Audit Charter can be 
viewed on our website at www.esuregroup.com/corporate-
information. These were last updated on 18 May 2016.
4 Effectiveness and independence of the external auditor
The Audit Committee oversees the Group’s relationship 
with the external auditor and formally reviews the 
relationship, policies and procedures to ensure 
independence. The Group’s policy on the provision of 
non-audit services is reviewed regularly to ensure that the 
independence and objectivity of our external auditor is 
maintained. It sets out the categories of non-audit services 
which the external auditor will and will not be allowed to 
provide to the Group. The policy states that our external 
auditor may only be used for non-audit work where specific 
services have been approved by the policy. This policy has 
been updated in light of the new regulations issued as part 
of the European Audit Reforms; which, for Public Interest 
Entities including the Group, not only cap non-audit fees to 
70% of the average Group statutory audit fees over the 
previous three years but also further restrict the types of 
work which can be performed by the auditors and came 
into full force from June 2016. Notwithstanding the change 
in policy there may still be occasions when the external 
auditor is best placed to undertake other accounting, 
advisory and consultancy work on behalf of the Group.
The Group’s policy on non-audit work was updated on 
7 December 2016 and can be found on the Group’s website 
at http://www.esuregroup.com/corporate-information/ 
corporate-governance.
The Committee receives reports twice a year detailing 
the fees paid to the external auditor for the provision of 
non-audit services. Non-audit fees paid to the external 
auditor in 2016 were £1.6m, including £1.4m related to the 
Group’s Demerger of Gocompare.com Group plc, £0.1m for 
tax advice and compliance services and £0.1m relating to 
the interim review. Strategic Report Governance Financials
43 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
For the purposes of evaluating the independence of the 
external auditor, the Committee has excluded the interim 
review fee and the Solvency II audit fee as these fees are 
classified as audit-related but are required by legislation. 
Excluding the interim review fees, and Solvency II audit 
fees, non-audit fees paid to KPMG were 581% of external 
audit fees in the year. Non-audit fees were principally 
related to the reporting accountant role for the Group’s 
Demerger of Gocompare.com Group plc and related work 
including tax advice specific to the Demerger and a review 
of the accounting treatment proposed by management. The 
Committee considered the appropriateness of appointing 
KPMG for this work including the challenge this could give 
to KPMG’s independence and assessed the steps taken by 
KPMG to ensure the continuing independence of the audit 
partner and audit team. The Committee concluded that 
there were significant benefits of using KPMG, including 
added efficiency from existing knowledge of the Group and 
tighter confidentiality by minimising the number of parties 
involved. The Committee also noted that it is customary 
for the reporting accountant role to be performed by the 
auditor for these reasons. The Committee therefore 
approved the use of KPMG to provide this advice. This 
resulted in a high ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees. 
However, the Committee has noted that this level of fee 
is not material to KPMG, and is unlikely to recur. When the 
fees for this work are excluded the value of non-audit fees 
as a percentage of audit fees falls to 34%.
A full breakdown of non-audit fees paid during the year is 
disclosed within the Notes to the financial statements on 
page 94.
The Committee decided that no conflicts of interest were 
found to exist between the work performed for the purpose 
of an external audit and non-audit services provided by 
KPMG.
The Committee welcomes KPMG’s policy of audit partner 
rotation every five years, which facilitates independence 
and objectivity within the external audit team. The current 
external audit engagement partner is Philip Smart, who 
was appointed to lead the audit in 2015 following the 
rotation of the previous audit partner after completing five 
years on the engagement. Philip Smart is supported by 
Timothy Butchart.
The Committee is satisfied with the performance and 
effectiveness of KPMG and has concluded that KPMG 
continues to display the necessary attributes of 
independence and objectivity.
The Committee considers the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and the appropriateness of 
tendering the external audit contract as part of normal 
business practice. Based on its ongoing assessment, for 
example through the quality of the external auditor’s report 
to the Committee, the audit partner’s interaction with the 
Committee and the rotation of the engagement partner, 
and the findings of the AQR review on our 2013 Audit, the 
Committee remains satisfied with the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the audit. The Committee therefore has 
not considered it necessary to require the audit to be put 
out to tender this year. 
KPMG have acted as auditors to the Group since 2000. As 
the Group’s listing was in 2013 the transitional rules under 
the EU legislation give the Group the option to delay the 
tender process until 2023 after which the Group will be 
required to undertake a formal tender process at least 
every ten years. In addition under these regulations, the 
Senior Engagement Partner is required to rotate every 
five years. However, it is the Group’s intention to put the 
External Audit Services Contract out to tender at the end 
of the current audit engagement partner’s rotation in 2019.
5 Audit Committee effectiveness
During the year, the Committee undertook an internal 
evaluation of its effectiveness and the results were 
discussed at the Board meeting in December 2016, 
concluding that the Committee was effective and 
functioning well.
Conclusion
As a result of its work during the year, the Committee has 
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference. The Chairman of the Committee will be at the 
Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the 
activities of the Committee from shareholders.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Annual statement
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am delighted 
to present this year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 
8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended in 
2013), and relevant sections of the Listing Rules. The 
report is divided into three sections: 
1. This annual statement, which summarises the major 
activities and decisions taken by the Committee. 
2. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy, setting out the 
Remuneration Policy for the Company’s Executive 
Directors; and 
3. The Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out 
how the Committee will implement the Remuneration 
Policy for the financial year ending 31 December 2017, 
and also the remuneration payable in respect of the 
financial year ending 31 December 2016. 
This year the Committee’s activities were focused on 
finalising and implementing the new policy, which was 
put to a vote at our 2016 AGM, reviewing executive pay 
arrangements in the context of regulatory developments 
and, later in the year, considering the impact of the 
Demerger of the Gocompare.com business which took place 
in November, in particular in relation to the treatment of the 
different elements of the Executive Directors’ remuneration 
packages in the context of the Demerger. The Committee 
conducted a review of the treatment of share awards both 
for other senior employees staying at the Group and for 
those transitioning to the standalone Gocompare.com 
business following the Demerger.
The Directors’ Remuneration Policy was put to a binding 
vote and approved at the 2016 AGM and will continue to 
operate in 2017. The existing policy is therefore provided 
in this year’s report for reference only. The Annual Report 
on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
2017 AGM.
Remuneration changes in respect of the Demerger 
of Gocompare.com
On 3 November 2016 the Gocompare.com business was 
successfully demerged from the esure Group. As a result 
of the Demerger, the Committee carried out a review of the 
individual components of the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and other senior management and determined 
that some changes were needed to ensure remuneration 
continued to be appropriate for the Group’s structure 
and strategic priorities. All changes were in line with the 
approved policy, with the exception of the Restructuring 
Award Plan (‘RAP’) awards which were approved by 
shareholders in a separate vote and are described below.
In particular, where performance conditions and 
targets for outstanding Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and 
Strategic Leadership Plan (‘SLP’) awards were set prior to 
the decision to demerge, the Committee felt it necessary 
to reassess the appropriateness of the performance 
targets and their alignment to the strategic plan of the 
Group going forward.
Therefore, the Committee has used its discretion to amend 
how performance is measured for some elements of the 
outstanding PSP and SLP awards to ensure that performance 
targets are equivalently stretching for the new business 
structure while continuing to incentivise participants. 
The details of these amendments are set out on page 
60 to 61.
In addition to the adjustments made to outstanding PSP 
and SLP awards, the new Restructuring Award Plan was 
introduced following approval from more than 80% of 
shareholders in a separate resolution at our general 
meeting on 1 November 2016. A shareholder consultation 
exercise was carried out with our largest shareholders and 
investor bodies in October 2016 to gather feedback on the 
proposed RAP awards and the Committee and I are grateful 
to our investors for taking the time to share their views 
with us. Full details of the RAP and the basis for making the 
awards was provided in the Circular and Notice of General 
Meeting and details of the grants are set out on page 62.
No changes were made to the Executive Directors’ salaries 
during 2016.
Performance outcomes in 2016
Since listing in 2013, the Group has delivered a sound 
performance through management’s disciplined approach 
in challenging market conditions and has built strong 
foundations for future growth.
The 2016 annual bonus was based on Group trading 
profit (60% of awards), personal and customer performance 
measures (25%) and strategic measures (15%). The Group 
achieved strong financial performance between target and 
maximum in 2016 together with near maximum performance 
against non-financial targets which led to overall awards of 
102.8% of salary for both the CEO and for the CFO (82.25% 
of their maximum opportunities).
Details of the 2016 bonus awards, including the level 
achieved and resulting payment outcomes, can be found 
on page 57.
As discussed in the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the Committee continues to seek to improve the 
transparency around the disclosure of both financial and 
non-financial annual bonus targets. The Committee has 
reviewed and enhanced our disclosure on the non-financial 
bonus targets, whilst the financial targets are disclosed one 
year in arrears so as not to compromise our competitive 
standing by publishing any financial information that is 
commercially sensitive.
Awards to Executive Directors under the 2014 Performance 
Share Plan were due to vest in early 2017, in respect of the 
performance period ended on 31 December 2016. However, 
in the context of the Demerger, the Committee used its 
discretion to determine that these awards should vest early 
upon completion of the Demerger on 3 November 2016, 
with the performance period end date brought forward to 
30 September 2016. These are included in the Outcomes 
for 2016 table shown on page 50. 48 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) performance 
for the 2014 awards was between the median and upper 
quartile of the peer group and Earnings per Share (‘EPS’) 
performance was below threshold; therefore this resulted 
in an overall vesting outcome of 25.1% of the maximum 
award available. Further details are provided on page 61.
Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2017
The CEO’s and CFO’s salary will remain at the same level 
as for 2016 at £524,500 and £355,500 respectively.
The annual bonus for 2017 will again be based on 60% 
Group trading profit performance, 25% on personal and 
customer performance measures and 15% on strategic 
measures. The maximum opportunity remains unchanged 
at 125% of salary for both the CEO and CFO.
The CEO and CFO will receive grants of 250% and 210% 
of salary respectively under the SLP in 2017. Shareholders 
will note the reduction on last year’s SLP grants as the 
Committee determined that reduced grant sizes for 
Executive Directors were appropriate for 2017 given the 
reduced size of the Group following the demerger and the 
current business direction. The SLP awards will continue to 
be based on absolute total shareholder return for three-
quarters of the award and the remaining portion on relative 
TSR, the targets for which are set out on page 49.
Other key activities undertaken by the Committee 
in the year
The Committee met seven times in the year. Other 
than the activities associated with the Demerger, other 
activities carried out in the year included: approval of 
the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report; finalisation of 
the Remuneration Policy; reviewing performance outcomes 
for awards vesting in 2016 under the annual and long-term 
plans; setting targets for awards made in the year; 
reviewing an independent report on remuneration risk 
from the Chief Risk Officer and reviewing the executive 
remuneration arrangements in the context of regulatory 
developments, particularly the provisions of Solvency II. 
As part of the remuneration review in the context of 
the Demerger, the Committee reviewed proposals by 
management for the treatment of the all-employee share 
plans, including a compensation payment in respect of the 
reduced value of the 2014 Sharesave award. This and further 
activities in relation to remuneration arrangements for the 
broader workforce are described on page 62.
I trust this report gives a helpful summary of our 
Remuneration Policy and its application and that we can 
look forward to your support for our proposals at the AGM 
on 17 May 2017.
Yours sincerely

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section presents the Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy (the ‘Policy’) for 2016 and beyond. The Policy 
contained herein was put to a binding vote at the 
2016 AGM and became effective on 12 May 2016, 
following approval from shareholders.
No changes to the Policy are proposed for 2017 and 
as such, this section of the report is reproduced here 
for reference only. Details of how the Policy will be 
implemented in 2017 are provided in the Annual 
Report on Remuneration which starts on page 57.
Remuneration principles
The Group seeks to attract and retain the best talent for 
the benefit of the business and to align the interests of 
Executive Directors, senior management and employees 
with the long-term interests of shareholders and other 
stakeholders.
To that end, the Group’s remuneration policies aim to 
provide appropriate reward for good performance without 
creating incentives that will encourage excessive risk-taking. 
In setting the Policy, the Committee has regard to the 
provisions within the FCA’s Remuneration Code (even though 
the Group is not required to comply with that code) and to 
the anticipated requirements of Solvency II. In particular, 
the Committee considers carefully the link between 
remuneration and risk and there is cross-membership of the 
Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee carried out a shareholder consultation 
on the proposed new Policy in early 2016. Shareholders 
were largely supportive and their feedback was carefully 
considered when finalising the details of the Policy. The 
Committee will also consider any shareholder feedback 
received at the next AGM and any other feedback received 
at any other time as part of the review of Executive 
Directors’ remuneration and when implementing the Policy. 
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in 
the Group
The Committee regularly reviews remuneration trends 
across the Group, including the differential between the 
total remuneration at the highest and lowest levels of 
employees within the Group, and these were taken into 
account when setting the Policy. However, there has been 
no formal consultation with employees in determining 
the Policy.
The table below summarises the key elements of the Policy.
Policy table
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Salary
To pay Executive Directors 
at a level commensurate 
with the size and scope 
of their role and their 
contribution to the Group 
and appropriately set for 
each individual.
Set at a level that 
maintains an appropriate 
balance between fixed 
and variable pay ensuring 
good risk management 
and no undue emphasis on 
variable pay.
Takes account of individual skills, 
performance, experience, responsibilities and 
pay, as well as internal relativities within the 
wider employee population.
Set with reference broadly to mid-market 
levels and to remuneration generally 
within the Group and other appropriate 
comparator companies of a similar size and 
complexity to the Group.
Normally reviewed annually with changes 
effective from 1 January. Paid in cash.
Details of the current salaries for the 
CEO and CFO are set out on page 57.
There is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. However, the Committee is 
guided by the general increase for the 
broader employee population.
Larger increases may be awarded where 
the Committee determines it appropriate 
to take into account a change in role 
and / or responsibilities, a significant 
change in the size, composition and / or 
complexity of the Group, the increased 
experience or performance in role of 
the Executive Director or where other 
exceptional circumstances exist. 52 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Annual bonus
Incentivises and rewards 
annual delivery of 
financial and non-financial 
objectives.
The Committee sets the performance 
measures, targets and the weighting 
between them annually to reflect the key 
priorities for the business for the year 
ahead and may vary them from year 
to year.
All or a majority of the annual bonus will be 
weighted to one or more financial measures 
set on a sliding scale basis. Non-financial 
metrics, including delivery of strategic and 
personal objectives, (up to a maximum of 
40% of the total bonus) may be set by the 
Committee if it determines it appropriate.
At least 30% of the annual bonus will be 
deferred into an award of shares under the 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) each year, with 
the deferred portion vesting in equal thirds 
over a three-year period. The portion to be 
deferred and the timeframe for deferred 
awards to be released may be amended, in 
particular if any such changes are required 
from a regulatory perspective.
The remaining portion of the bonus which 
is not deferred will be paid in cash.
Malus and clawback provisions apply (see 
below). Furthermore, the Committee has 
overriding discretion to scale back annual 
bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, 
risk or regulatory compliance issues and in 
the event that the level of bonus represents 
an excessive proportion of the Group’s 
overall profit.
The maximum bonus opportunity under 
the Policy has been set at 125% of salary 
for the Executive Directors for each 
financial year.
No more than 25% of the maximum 
opportunity is payable for threshold 
performance.
Strategic Leadership
Plan (“SLP”)
To encourage and reward 
delivery of the Group’s 
longer-term strategic 
objectives.
Aligns the interests of 
Executive Directors 
with the interests of 
shareholders through 
the use of share-based 
awards.
Awards normally vest subject to 
satisfaction of applicable performance 
conditions measured over at least three 
years. Typically, a holding period (expected 
to be two years for awards made in 
2016) will apply post-vesting, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise.
Performance conditions for 2016 awards 
are based on absolute (75%) and relative 
(25%) TSR.
The Committee may use alternative 
measures, for example EPS, and weightings 
for future awards if it deems this 
appropriate. However, at least part of the 
total award will be determined by a share 
price-based metric.
The Committee has an overriding discretion 
to scale back vesting of the awards in 
certain events such as where the level of 
vesting represents an excessive proportion 
of the Group’s overall profit, or where a 
significant one-off event which affects 
Group performance occurs during the SLP 
performance measurement period.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply. 
(see page 54).
The maximum award limit, except for 
recruitment awards (see recruitment 
section), in respect of any financial 
year under the Policy is 300% of salary 
(face value at date of grant) being the 
maximum under the plan rules. The 
Committee may not decide to grant at 
maximum levels each year. 15% of the 
award vests for threshold performance 
with 100% vesting for maximum 
performance.

Chairman
The salary and any contractual benefits 
for the Chairman are determined by the 
Committee.
Non-Executive Directors
Fees for Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors. The Chairman and 
Executive Directors are guided by market 
data for similar non-executive roles in other 
companies of a similar size and complexity 
as well as the experience and time 
commitment of its Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors may also receive 
a transport, hotel and incidental expenses 
allowance for their duties for the Group in 
respect of which the Group may discharge 
any related tax liability.
Fees are reviewed on an annual basis 
and any increases are typically in line 
with market levels. Details of the current 
salary of the Chairman and the fee 
levels for the Non-Executive Directors 
are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
There is no prescribed maximum annual 
increase. Total fees will not exceed the 
amount specified in the Group’s Articles 
of Association of £2m. 54 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Directors’ Remuneration Policy continued
Legacy arrangements
It is proposed that no further awards will be granted to 
Executive Directors under the PSP, subject to shareholder 
approval of the SLP at the 2016 AGM; it is proposed it will 
be replaced by the SLP. Details of outstanding PSP awards 
are set out in the section headed 2015 PSP awards.
The Committee reserves the right to make any 
remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office (including exercising any discretions available 
to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding 
that they are not in line with the Policy where the terms 
of the payment were agreed (i) before 13 May 2014 (the 
date the Group’s first shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy came into effect) (ii) before the Policy 
came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment 
were consistent with the shareholder-approved Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; 
or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a 
Director and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment 
was not in consideration for the individual becoming a 
Director. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the 
Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, 
in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment 
are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.
Notes to the Policy table
Performance conditions
TSR has been chosen as the most appropriate metric 
for SLP awards made in 2016 as it is strongly aligned with 
the Group’s ambitious targets for delivering shareholder 
value. Stretching targets have been set for absolute TSR 
performance and these are set out in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration. The remainder of the TSR element is 
measured against the FTSE 250 Index (excluding 
investment trusts and the Company) and therefore 
provides a good measure of relative stock market 
performance, with management only being rewarded for 
the delivery of exceptional relative levels of return. A blend 
of these measures is considered to be a complementary 
mix of absolute and relative performance and focuses on 
superior stock market returns, in line with the Company’s 
future strategy. The Committee, in selecting performance 
measures and setting targets, ensures that there is a 
strong link between the strategies adopted for the business 
and the targets set for each SLP award and annual bonus 
cycle. Performance targets will be set annually prior to 
awards being made with regard to the business strategy 
and economic and market environment at that time.
Share-based awards
Share-based awards under the SLP, DBP and PSP may:
a) be made in the form of conditional share awards 
of nil-cost options or equivalent instruments;
b) be settled in cash at the Committee’s discretion;
c) subject to any prevailing regulatory requirements, 
incorporate the right to receive the value of any awards 
that would have been paid on the shares that vest 
under an award on such basis and over such period 
(ending no later than the date the individual first 
becomes entitled to have underlying shares delivered 
to him) as the Committee may determine;
d) have their performance conditions amended or 
substituted if an event occurs which causes the 
Committee to consider an amended or substituted 
condition would be more appropriate and not materially 
less difficult to satisfy; and
e) be adjusted in the event of a variation of the 
Company’s share capital or any demerger, delisting, 
special dividend or any other event which may in the 
Committee’s opinion affect the current or future value 
of the Company’s shares.
Malus and clawback provisions
Malus (the right to reduce the value of unvested awards) 
will apply to unvested awards under the DBP, PSP and SLP. 
Clawback will apply to vested awards under the DBP, SLP 
and PSP and the part of the annual bonus which is paid in 
cash. These provisions may be invoked at the Committee’s 
discretion at any time prior to a takeover of the Company 
and within three years of the vesting of PSP awards and the 
payment of cash bonuses and six years of the grant of DBP 
and SLP awards.
The Committee has the discretion to invoke these 
provisions in the following circumstances:
• where there is a material misstatement of any Group 
member’s financial results, or an error in assessing 
performance conditions applicable to PSP or SLP awards 
or calculating the bonus to which a DBP award relates 
is discovered;
• where the Committee becomes aware of any 
misconduct on the part of the individual; and 
• for DBP and SLP awards only, where a material failure of 
risk management by a Group member is identified, or in 
the event of serious reputational damage to a Group 
member during the period commencing at the start of 
the performance period for SLP awards and the grant 
date for DBP awards and ending on the sixth anniversary 
of the grant date of the award.
Alignment with remuneration elsewhere in the Company
Where appropriate, the Committee aims for as much 
consistency as possible between the Policy for Executive 
Directors and the Remuneration Policy for employees 
across the Group as a whole. For example, all employees 
(including Executive Directors) participate in similar pension 
and benefits arrangements, and all participate in an annual 
bonus plan or profit sharing plan. Senior employees at Group 
Executive and Operational Executive level participate in the 
SLP, which is considered appropriate as senior executives are 
more able to influence the long-term strategic (as opposed to 
operational) success of the Group, as evidenced by long-term 
TSR performance. The Company encourages and helps 
facilitate share ownership by all employees by offering 
participation in the Company’s Save As You Earn Plan.
Illustrations of application of the Policy
The following chart provides an indication of the 
remuneration that each Executive Director might receive in 
accordance with the Policy for 2016 in respect of minimum 
(fixed pay), on-target and maximum performance.
The following assumptions have been made in compiling 
these illustrations of remuneration:
• Fixed pay for all three scenarios is based on salary 
levels for 2016, the cost of supplying the benefits 
received for 2015 and the current pension policy 
applied to 2016 salary.
• For illustrative purposes, on-target performance under 
the annual bonus at 50% of maximum and SLP is shown 
at 35% of maximum.
• Consistent with the Policy to be applied in 2016, the 
maximum bonus opportunity is shown as 125% of salary 
for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer. 
The SLP grant level is 300% of salary for the Chief 
Executive Officer and 250% of salary for the Chief 
Finance Officer is shown.
• No assumptions are made as to share price growth 
and dividend accrual, and these have been excluded 
from the analysis. Strategic Report Governance Financials

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee will aim to set a new Executive Director’s 
remuneration package in line with the Policy approved by 
shareholders. New Executive Directors will participate in 
the annual bonus and the Strategic Leadership Plan on the 
same basis as existing Directors.
In arriving at a total package and in considering quantum 
for each element of the package, the Committee will take 
into account the size and scope of the role, the skills and 
experience of a candidate, the market rate for a candidate 
of that experience, as well as the importance of securing 
the preferred candidate. For international candidates, this 
may mean that consideration might be given to typical 
remuneration practices in the country of their previous 
employer. In respect of an individual’s recruitment, annual 
bonus potential will not exceed 125% of salary and SLP 
awards will not exceed 300% of salary.
Special consideration may be given in the event that 
long-term incentive awards accrued at a previous employer 
are due to be forfeited on the candidate’s leaving that 
company, in which case the Committee retains the 
discretion to grant further awards with vesting on a 
comparable basis to the likely vesting of the previous 
employer’s award.
The SLP rules submitted to shareholders for approval 
at the 2016 AGM allow for a one-off award to be made to 
compensate the candidate for the loss of those awards with 
(in the case of the SLP) performance measures over such 
period as the Committee may determine. These recruitment 
awards will not count towards limits referred to in the policy 
table. For internal candidates, long-term incentive awards 
granted in respect of the prior role would be allowed to vest 
according to its original terms, or adjusted if appropriate to 
take into account the appointment.
For the appointment of a new Chairman or Non-Executive 
Director, the fee would be set in accordance with the 
approved Policy in force at that time. The length of 
service and notice periods shall be set at the discretion 
of the Committee, taking into account market practice, 
corporate governance considerations and the particular 
candidate at that time.

The Company’s policy is that service contracts do not have 
a specific duration but may be terminated with 12 months’ 
notice from the Company or the Executive Director.
Under their letters of appointment, Non-Executive Directors’ 
appointment is terminable by either party on three months’ 
written notice except where the Director is not reappointed 
by shareholders, in which case termination is with immediate 
effect. The appointment letters for the Non-Executive 
Directors provide that no compensation is payable on 
termination, other than for accrued fees and expenses.
The Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment 
are available for inspection at the Group’s registered office.
The obligations of the Group in respect of remuneration 
and payments for loss of office when a Director leaves the 
Group are set out on the next page.
Under their service contracts, the Executive Directors are 
entitled to salary (reviewed annually), pension contributions 
and benefits. The Chairman is entitled to salary (reviewed 
annually), private health cover and use of a driver (for 
business and a portion of personal travel). The Company 
reserves the right to settle any tax liability on these benefits 
on the Chairman’s behalf. These benefits may be paid during 
the Director’s notice period (although the Director is 
required to seek alternative employment in this time).
The service agreements of the Chairman and the Executive 
Directors can be terminated by not less than 12 months’ 
notice by either party. The Company may put the Chairman 
and the Executive Directors on gardening leave during their 
notice period, and can elect to terminate employment by 
making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to up to 12 
months’ salary. This payment may be made as either a lump 
sum on termination or with an amount equivalent to up to 
six months’ salary payable in a lump sum on termination 
and six months’ salary payable in monthly instalments 
from the seventh month to the twelfth month, subject to 
offset against any earnings elsewhere during that six-month 
period in any new role.
In addition, statutory entitlements or sums to settle or 
compromise claims in connection with a termination would 
be paid as necessary.
The Committee has a policy framework for payments for 
loss of office by an Executive Director, both in relation to 
the service contract and incentive pay, which is 
summarised below.
The recent performance of the Executive Director will be 
taken into account as a determining factor in the reason for 
the cessation and, therefore, the potential payments and 
scope for exercise of the Committee’s discretion are as set 
out on page 56. 56 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016

Takeovers
If there is a takeover or winding-up of the Company, DBP, PSP and SLP awards will vest (and be released from their 
holding periods) early. The extent to which PSP and SLP awards vest in these circumstances will be determined by the 
Committee, taking into account any relevant performance conditions and, unless the Committee determines otherwise, 
the proportion of the original performance period that has elapsed at the time of the relevant event. If the Company is 
affected by a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event which, in the Committee’s opinion, may affect the 
current or future price of the Company’s shares, it may allow awards to vest (and be released) early on the same basis 
as for a takeover. Alternatively, awards may be exchanged for equivalent awards in the acquiring company. In such 
circumstances, the Committee may also decide to pay a cash bonus in respect of the financial year in which the 
relevant event occurs (in all circumstances subject to the maximum set out in the policy table). Strategic Report Governance Financials

1. From the 6 April 2016 onwards, pension input periods (the period over which the amount of pension saving under an arrangement is measured) 
were aligned with the tax year. On the 8 July 2015 transitional measures were put in place in preparation for this alignment.  
As part of the transitional measures individuals were granted an adjusted annual allowance for the 2015/16 tax year subject to certain criteria. 
As a result of this Stuart Vann elected to reduce his salary in exchange for pension contributions which has resulted in a decrease in gross salary 
from £524,500 to £522,661 and pension received for the period to make use of his increased annual allowance for the tax year 2015/16.

Performance outcomes for incentive plans (audited)
The Committee continues to be committed to aligning 
disclosure of the annual bonus operation as closely as 
possible with investors’ expectations and market best 
practice. For the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
we adopted the approach that financial targets would 
normally be disclosed retrospectively in the following 
year. In the 2015 report we provided details of the targets 
which had applied to the 2014 annual bonus and stated 
an intention to disclose the 2015 financial targets in our 
2016 Report.
The Board considers the 2016 financial targets to be 
commercially sensitive, given their close link to the Group’s 
long-term strategy. Furthermore, it is the Committee’s 
belief that disclosing targets for 2016 at this stage would 
put the Group at a competitive disadvantage. 
Therefore, the Committee has taken the same approach 
as previously for the disclosure of financial targets. In line 
with the commitment in the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, the Committee has disclosed the targets in full in 
relation to 2015 awards as we no longer deem them to be 
commercially sensitive. It is the Committee’s intention to 
disclose financial targets in relation to 2016 awards in the 
2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report, when they are no 
longer expected to be commercially sensitive.
In response to feedback received from investors with 
regards to the disclosure of strategic and non-financial 
objectives in the 2015 report, the Committee has reviewed 
the approach and intends to provide more comprehensive 
disclosure levels, where possible, in respect of 2016 and 
future years. Details of non-financial targets as far as 
possible for 2016 have been disclosed in this year’s Report. 
Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2016 
(audited)
The annual bonus for 2016 was based 60% on a financial 
measure, 15% on strategic measures and 25% on personal 
and customer measures.
This rebalance of financial and non-financial metrics from 
previous years was set out in the 2015 Annual Report on 
Remuneration. These amendments were made in response 
to the business environment and to enable the measurement 
of performance against a broader range of metrics for the 
annual bonus, recognising the Group’s key strategic 
objectives for the year and reflecting the latest regulatory 
guidance on the balance of performance metrics.
A risk adjustment process is in place for all measures and is 
described later in this section.
Performance against 2016 financial targets (audited)
The financial measure is assessed on the Group’s trading 
profit with reference to a sliding scale. Targets are set by 
the Committee each year with reference to the commercial 
environment. Actual Group trading profit of £84.6m and 
profit generated from Gocompare.com whilst in the Group 
of £24.5m totalling £109.1m which was between target and 
maximum and represented a good set of financial results 
for the year under review. Targets for 2016 will be 
published in the 2017 Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
See below for an illustration of how the performance 
outcome was calculated.
Maximum 100%
Actual 77.5% 
Target 50%
Threshold 25%
Performance against strategic, personal and 
customer objectives (audited)
A specific strategic element was introduced to the 
annual bonus for 2016 to enable a focused assessment 
of the Executive Directors’ delivery of the strategic 
priorities for esure Group and Gocompare.com (up 
to the point of Demerger). The strategic measures in 
relation to Gocompare.com were set at the beginning 
of the performance year, prior to the announcement of 
the strategic review and subsequent Demerger, when the 
consolidation and growth of Gocompare.com as a part of 
the esure Group formed a significant part of the Group’s 
strategic focus. This portion of the award has been 
assessed with reference to delivery of the Gocompare.com 
plan up until the Demerger in November.
The personal measures aim to emphasise the 
importance of developing organisational capability and 
enhancing succession plans throughout the organisation 
and for operating within a prescribed risk and conduct 
framework. Our employees are an essential asset for 
delivering sustainable growth in esure and the personal 
element of the annual bonus enables an assessment of 
the Executive Directors’ capabilities in supporting and 
developing the workforce. 
The customer measures focus on embedding a culture 
that places customers at the heart of esure’s business and 
is based on achievement against a wide range of measures 
which are assessed monthly and cover the broad range of 
customer outcomes.
As in previous years, the scale for the non-financial 
measures ranges from not achieved to fully achieved. 
Following an independent review by the Chief Risk Officer of 
the level of performance achieved, the Committee deemed 
that the CEO had achieved 35.75% of his objectives, and 
that the CFO had achieved 35.75% of his objectives (out of a 
maximum of 40%). 
The table on page 59 provides further information on the 
strategic, personal and customer measures. Performance 
for all elements will be determined to be fully achieved 
(100% vesting), partially achieved (50% vesting) or not 
achieved (0% vesting).

Risk adjustment of variable remuneration committee (audited)
The Remuneration Committee monitors developments in regulatory guidance throughout the year, in particular in 
relation to Solvency II, and the assessment of annual bonus outcomes is carried out in the context of guidance regarding 
risk adjustments.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to scale back annual bonus payments in the event of, inter alia, risk or 
regulatory compliance issues and also in the event that the level of bonus represents, in the Committee’s view, an 
excessive proportion of the Group’s overall profitability. 
There were no events in 2016 which led the Committee to determine that a scale back of the annual bonus payment was 
appropriate. In addition, the Committee did not consider that the level of bonus represented an excessive proportion of 
the Group’s overall profitability such that it should be scaled back. 
Awards in 2016 were subject to deferral arrangements in line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. 30% of awards will 
be deferred into shares, with the deferred portion vesting in equal thirds over three years.  60 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Annual bonus for the year ending 31 December 2015 (audited)
As stated in the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report, financial targets for the annual bonus awards received in relation to 
that year were not disclosed owing to their commercial sensitivity. The Committee now considers these targets no longer 
to be sensitive and, as such, they have been set out below. 
The annual bonus for 2015 was based 75% on a financial measure and 25% on personal and customer measures. The 
financial measure was assessed on the Group’s trading profit with reference to a sliding scale. Actual trading profit was 
£92.3m, which was between target and maximum performance and represented a solid set of financial results given 
market conditions. The Committee selected the targets for the 2015 annual bonus awards based on budgeted levels of 
profit given the context of the external environment as well as esure’s own strategic plans for the 2015 financial year. 
The Committee is satisfied that the targets were sufficiently stretching for the Executive Directors and were appropriate 
in driving the continued success of the esure business following the completion of the Gocompare.com acquisition. 
The outcome against the financial objectives during 2015 is set out below:

Vesting of long-term incentive awards for performance periods ending during the year ending 31 December 
2016 (audited)
Executive Directors were granted awards under the 2014 PSP, the vesting of which was due to be determined with 
reference to the performance period ending on 31 December 2016. Following the Demerger of the Gocompare.com 
business, the Committee used its discretion to determine that the 2014 awards should vest early upon completion of the 
Demerger on 3 November 2016. Under the PSP, Executive Directors have agreed to retain any shares (net of tax) for a 
six-month period post-vesting.
Performance was assessed on a pro-rata basis for the period from 1 January 2014 to 30 September 2016.
Awards were subject to EPS performance (two-thirds) and relative TSR performance (one-third) with performance 
originally due to be measured over a three-year period. EPS was measured on a straight-line basis between a threshold 
growth target of 15% and a stretch target of 39%. The Group’s TSR was ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 250, 
excluding investment trusts and esure. 25% of the TSR element of the award vests for median performance rising on a 
straight-line basis to 100% vesting for upper quartile ranking or above.
EPS growth targets 2014 Awards
Threshold (25% vesting) 15%
Stretch (100% vesting) 39%
EPS performance was below 15% growth which was below threshold for the shorter performance period, resulting in nil 
vesting under the EPS element of the award. Relative TSR performance was between the median and upper quartile of the 
peer group, resulting in 75.3% vesting of the TSR portion. Therefore the 2014 awards achieved an overall vesting outcome 
of 25.1% of the maximum award available.

Treatment of outstanding long-term incentive awards following the Demerger of Gocompare.com
2015 PSP awards
PSP awards granted in 2015 are subject to the same performance conditions and targets as the 2014 awards. 
In the context of the Demerger, the Committee determined that an adjustment to the measurement of EPS performance 
was necessary to enable continued measurement of performance on a ‘like-for-like’ basis. Therefore, the Committee used 
its discretion to determine that the 2015 EPS condition will be measured by excluding the impact of Gocompare.com from 
the base year EPS (i.e. comparing base year EPS for esure Group only with the final year EPS for esure Group at the end 
of the performance period). The growth targets themselves remain unchanged.
The table provides the target growth at threshold and maximum for 2014 and 2015. EPS targets rise from threshold to 
maximum and vesting in between is on a straight-line basis. EPS is measured over a three-year period (taking as a 
starting figure the 2014 EPS.
Earnings per share growth targets 2015 awards
Threshold (25% vesting) 15%
Stretch (100% vesting) 39%
Relative TSR is measured over the period from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 for the 2015 awards. No adjustments 
have been made to the targets as the company’s TSR was rebased at the time of the Demerger.
SLP awards granted in 2016
The SLP awards are subject to an absolute TSR growth target for three-quarters of the award and relative TSR for the 
remaining one-quarter of the award.
The targets for the 2016 SLP awards were stated in the 2015 Directors’ Remuneration Report and were based on very 
stretching plans which reflected the high growth potential of Gocompare.com for the duration of the performance period. 
As a result of the Demerger, the Committee determined that the original absolute TSR targets for the 2016 SLP awards 
would be significantly harder to achieve due to the less diversified sources of value in the Group, with performance wholly 
dependent on the level of competition in the motor and home market.
The Committee therefore used discretion to adjust the absolute TSR targets for 2016 SLP awards to ensure that these 
were equivalently stretching for participants following the Demerger. The Committee is of the opinion that the revised 
targets reflect the strategic plan of esure going forward while maintaining an ongoing level of incentivisation. 
The targets have been revised to reflect the same level of stretch as the original targets, and are only adjusted to reflect 
the lower growth projections of the esure business without the impact of Gocompare.com. 
The original and revised targets for the 2016 SLP absolute TSR element are as follows:
Absolute TSR growth Threshold (15%) vesting Mid (35%) vesting Good (66%) vesting
Maximum / exceptional  
(100%) vesting
Original targets 13% p.a. 16% p.a. 21% p.a. 31% p.a.
Revised targets 10.5% p.a. 13.5% p.a. 18.5% p.a. 27.5% p.a.
In respect of the relative TSR condition, performance will be measured over the period from 1 January 2016 to 
31 December 2018. As for previous years’ awards, the Group’s TSR will be ranked against the constituents of the FTSE 
250 Index (excluding investment trusts and esure itself) at the start of the performance period. As for 2015 awards, no 
adjustments will be made to the relative TSR targets as the Company’s TSR was rebased at the time of the Demerger. 62 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
The relative TSR targets therefore remain the same as was stated in the 2015 report.

RAP awards (audited)
The Restructuring Alignment Plan (‘RAP’) was approved by over 80% of shareholders at the general meeting of the 
Company on 1 November 2016. The Executive Directors and a small number other senior management received share 
awards under this new plan following the Demerger of Gocompare.com in November 2016. A description of the RAP and 
the basis for making the awards was provided in the Circular and Notice of General Meeting.
The RAP awards are not subject to any performance conditions but are subject to a holding period. Awards will vest on the 
first anniversary of the grant date and will be released in equal thirds on the second, third and fourth anniversary of the 
grant date. 
These awards were outside the limitations of the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy and as such, special approval was 
obtained from shareholders. No further awards will be made under the RAP in future years.

2. Share price on date of grant was calculated using a five-day averaging period prior to date of grant.
Sourcing of shares (dilution limits)
In compliance with the Investment Association guidelines, the rules of the PSP, SLP, RAP and DBP and the Group 
Sharesave Plan (the ‘Sharesave Plan’) and Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) provide that, in any period of ten calendar years, 
not more than 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital may be issued under these plans and any other 
employee share plan adopted by the Company. In addition, the PSP, SLP, DBP and RAP provide that in any period of ten 
calendar years, not more than 5% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital may be issued under these and any 
other executive share plans adopted by the Company.
The Company operates within these limits, currently tracking at 2.03% of outstanding capital in all employee share 
scheme plans and 1.43% in executive plans.
All-employee share plans and other arrangements
The Board adopted two all-employee share plans in 2013: the SIP and the Sharesave Plan. Participation is currently 
being offered under the Sharesave Plan to employees including the Executive Directors. Employees can save up to £500 a 
month (increased from £250 in 2013) to purchase shares on the exercise of their Sharesave options at a purchase price of 
80% of market value at the date of grant. The first Sharesave Plan matured in November 2016 with c.75% of participants 
electing to become shareholders. The shares that employees were granted at the time of IPO vested in March 2016.
Following an extensive market review during 2016, a further £1.7m was invested into the Employee Reward structure 
which included increasing new starter salaries, realignment of variable pay to ensure that our more junior employees 
received more fixed pay, new customer-focused incentives, introduction of performance-based pay, improved holidays 
and a further commitment to employees by ensuring that from 2017 we will pay the voluntary living wage across all 
areas of our business.

Directors’ shareholdings and share interests (audited)
To align the interests of the Executive Directors with shareholders, Executive Directors are required to build up 
shareholdings equivalent to 200% of salary, through the retention of shares vesting under the Company’s share plans. 
Executive Directors are required to retain at least 50% of their net-of-tax value of any vested PSP and SLP awards, until 
such time as the share ownership target has been met. There have been no further changes in these interests between 
31 December 2016 and 9 March 2017.

basis. Any changes will be made in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and will be disclosed in full in next year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

2.  The role of Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Director is held by one person, the fees include £55,000 in her role as SID.
Pension and other benefits
These will be awarded in line with the Policy.
Annual bonus
The maximum bonus potential for the year ending 31 December 2017 will be 125% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Finance Officer, in line with the Policy. The performance measures will be Group trading profit for 60% of the 
maximum bonus available, delivery of strategic measures (such as continued development of the underwriting footprint) for 
15% and personal and customer performance measures (based around personal and customer objectives) for the remaining 
25%. Targets will be disclosed retrospectively as early as possible after they cease to be commercially sensitive, which we 
expect to be no later than in the 2018 Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In accordance with our Remuneration Policy, 30% of any bonuses awarded at the end of the performance period will be 
deferred into shares, which will be released in thirds over a three year period. Participants will be eligible to receive 
dividends on these shares, subject to compliance with regulatory guidance.
Strategic Leadership Plan (“SLP”)
SLP awards to be granted to the Chief Executive Officer in 2017 will be shares worth 250% of salary and to the Chief 
Finance Officer 210% of salary. The maximum awards under the Policy are 300% for the Chief Executive Officer and 250% 
for the Chief Finance Officer and the Committee reviews the appropriateness of opportunities granted annually.
 
The 2017 awards will be subject to two independent performance conditions. Three-quarters of the award will be 
determined by reference to growth in absolute total shareholder return (TSR) and one quarter will be determined by 
reference to relative total shareholder return as set out below. Performance will be measured over a three-year period 
beginning on 1 January 2017. Awards will vest, subject to performance, on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
Following vesting, all awards will then be subject to a post-vesting holding period of two years.
Vesting will be determined with reference to four points, as below. There is straight line vesting between these points.

All of the members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors, as defined under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code.
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Finance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Company Secretary and HR Director and 
Professional Services may, by invitation, attend meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed. No Director 
is involved in determining his or her own remuneration. None of the Committee members have had any personal financial 
interest, except as shareholders, in the matters decided. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
External advisors
The Committee is advised by Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’). Deloitte was appointed by the Remuneration Committee as part of 
a competitive tender process in 2015. Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, 
voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. Furthermore, 
no member of the Deloitte engagement team has any personal connection with esure Group. As such, the Committee is 
satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte is independent and objective.
The total fees paid to Deloitte in respect of its services to the Committee for the year ending 31 December 2016 were
£182,000. Fees are predominantly charged on a ‘time spent’ basis. During the year, Deloitte also provided the Company 
with advice in relation to other reward and share plans advice as well as advice in relation to Corporation Tax compliance, 
regulatory consultancy support and also actuarial support.

Significant changes and events
On 13 September 2016, the Group announced its intention 
to pursue a Demerger of Gocompare.com Group plc from the 
Group through a separate listing on the main market of the 
London Stock Exchange. A General Meeting was held on 
1 November 2016, at which the shareholders of the Group 
voted in favour of the Demerger. Subsequently the 
Demerger of Gocompare.com Group plc from the 
Group was completed on 3 November 2016.
Post-balance sheet events
On 27 February 2017, the Lord Chancellor changed the 
Ogden discount rate from plus 2.5% to minus 0.75% 
effective 20 March 2017. As at 31 December 2016 the 
Group’s reserve margin included an allowance for a change 
in the Ogden discount rate to 0%. To assess the impact on 
the financial statements of the announced rate being lower 
than the Group had allowed for, the Committee considered 
management’s analysis and reviews conducted by the 
external auditor and the external actuary. The Committee 
concurred with management’s assessment that the impact 
on profit after tax is immaterial. Refer to note 31 to the 
consolidated financial statements for further information.

Appointment, retirement and removal of Directors
The appointment and replacement of Directors is governed 
by the Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’), the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), the Companies 
Act 2006, the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman 
and the Company and related legislation. The Articles may 
only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders. 
The Board has the power to appoint additional Directors 
or to fill a casual vacancy amongst the Directors. Any such 
Director holds office only until the next AGM and may offer 
himself / herself for election.
Under the Relationship Agreement between the Chairman 
and the Company, as long as the Chairman or any of his 
associates, when taken together, hold at least 15% of 
the shares or voting rights attaching to the shares, the 
Chairman will be entitled to appoint, remove and reappoint 
one person to be a Director, who may be either himself or

Directors’ and Officers’ insurance and indemnities
The Group maintains Directors’ and Officers’ liability 
insurance, which gives appropriate cover should legal action 
be brought against its Directors. In addition, indemnities are 
in force under which the Group has agreed to indemnify the 
Directors against all liabilities and related costs that they 
may incur in the execution of their duties. Copies of these 
indemnities are kept at our registered office and are open 
for inspection by any member. These indemnities do not 
cover the Directors for fraudulent activities.
Employees
As at 31 December 2016, the Group employed 1,557 people. 
The Group is committed to creating an environment in which 
individual differences and contributions are recognised and 
valued, and to safeguard a working environment that 
promotes dignity and respect for all. No form of victimisation, 
discrimination, bullying or harassment will be tolerated.

We seek to promote equal opportunities for all, through 
the provision of employment practices and policies that 
recognise the diversity of our employees and ensure that 
neither our employees nor prospective employees receive 
less favourable treatment on the basis of their perceived or 
actual age, disability, race, religion or belief, sex (including 
gender, marital status, pregnancy or maternity, or gender 
reassignment or sexual orientation), working hours (part-
time, full-time or fixed-term employees) or physical 
characteristics.
The Group is committed to employing people who are 
disabled or who become disabled during their career by 
making reasonable adjustments as appropriate. Actively 
working with the Access to Work government scheme 
enables the Group to support the continued employment 
of disabled employees and prospective disabled employees. 
The training, career development and promotion of disabled 
people are, as far as possible, identical to those of 
other employees.
Employees are kept up to date with regular Chief Executive 
Officer briefings, business updates, team meetings and 
internal communications. Employees’ views are gathered 
through our Employee Consultation Group, department 
forums, employee surveys and Ask Exec question forum.

Environment
Global emissions
This report presents a narrative report for the 2016 
Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Mandatory Reporting requirement 
of esure Group’s UK operations.
Methodology: The footprint is calculated in accordance 
with the GHG Protocol and Carbon Trust (‘CT’) guidance on 
calculating organisational footprints. Activity data has been 
converted into carbon emissions using published emissions 
factors. The data used has been provided by the Group and 
sense checked (but not formally verified) by Utilitywise PLC.
Emissions sources: The footprint includes the Scope 1 
(fossil fuel and refrigerant leakage) and Scope 2 (electricity) 
emissions associated with the offices in which the Group is 
based. For the purposes of the report only, Scope 1 (direct) 
and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions sources are required.
Organisational boundary: The footprint includes data 
for the three offices in which the Group employs staff 
(Reigate, Manchester and Glasgow), as well as two 
domestic apartments. Note that this does not include 
outsourced activities, for example repair shops and 
third-party suppliers. This also includes data for the 
Gocompare.com office in Newport from 01/01/16–01/11/16 
before the Demerger of the Company from the Group.

Change of control
There are no material agreements to which the Group is 
party that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change 
of control of the Group following a takeover bid.
The provisions of the Company’s employee share plans may 
cause options and awards granted under such plans to vest 
upon a change of control.
Share capital
Our share capital consists of one class of Ordinary Shares 
of 
1
/12p each. Each share ranks equally and carries the same 
rights to vote and receive dividends and other distributions 
declared. There are no restrictions on the transfer or holding 
of shares in the Company. As at 31 December 2016, the 
Company had 417,916,872 Ordinary Shares in issue. The 
Company does not hold any shares in Treasury. 70 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
The rights attached to shares which are the subject of 
awards under any of our employee share plans are not 
available until any award or option is exercised and the 
shares are allotted or transferred to the relevant individual. 
The Trustee of our employee benefit trust is obliged to act 
in the best interests of the share plans’ beneficiaries. At 
General Meetings, the Trustee may exercise discretion and 
vote in respect of Trust shares although it may not always 
choose to do so. Where shares are beneficially held by an 
employee within a share plan he or she may direct the 
Trustee to vote on his or her behalf.
Power of Directors to issue shares
The Directors require express authorisation from 
shareholders to allot new shares. A resolution will be 
proposed at the 2017 AGM to renew the authority to 
allot shares.
Purchase of own shares
The Directors require express authorisation from 
shareholders to purchase our own shares. Accordingly, at 
the 2017 AGM, the Group proposes to renew the authority 
granted by shareholders at the AGM in 2016 to repurchase 
up to a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital. At 
the present time, the Group has no plans to exercise this 
authority and did not exercise the authority during 2016.
Further details are provided in the 2017 Notice of the AGM.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 31 December 2016, the Group had been notified,
in accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency 
Rule 5.1.2R, of interests in 3% or more of the voting rights

Relationship Agreement with controlling shareholder 
Sir Peter Wood, the Group’s Chairman, is a controlling 
shareholder of the Group with a total holding of 
approximately 30.85% of the Company’s voting rights.
The Group entered into a Relationship Agreement with 
Sir Peter Wood on 8 March 2013, which was amended and 
restated on 29 October 2014.
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to 
ensure that the Group is capable at all times of carrying on 
its business independently of Sir Peter Wood and certain 
persons deemed to be connected with him.
In addition to other undertakings and agreements, the 
Relationship Agreement contains the following undertakings:
(a) that transactions and arrangements between the Group 
and Sir Peter Wood (and / or any of his associates) will 
be conducted at arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms;
(b) that neither Sir Peter Wood nor any of his associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of 
preventing the Group from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and
(c) that neither Sir Peter Wood nor any of his associates 
will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution that is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
The Board confirms that, since the entry into the amended 
and restated Relationship Agreement on 29 October 2014 
until 6 March 2017, being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this Annual Report and Accounts:
(i) The Group has complied with the independence 
provisions included in the Relationship Agreement;
(ii) So far as the Group is aware, the independence 
provisions included in the Relationship Agreement have 
been complied with by Sir Peter Wood and his 
associates; and
(iii) As far as the Group is aware, the procurement 
obligation included in the Relationship Agreement has 
been complied with by Sir Peter Wood.
Restrictions on voting rights
All shareholders entitled to attend and vote at a General 
Meeting may appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak and 
vote in their place. A member may appoint more than one 
proxy provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the 
rights attached to a different share or shares held by the 
shareholder. A proxy need not be a shareholder. Proxy forms 
must be received by our registrars at least 48 hours before 
the time appointed for holding a meeting, as set out in any 
Notice or in any form of proxy circulated by us. The 
appointment of a proxy does not preclude a shareholder 
from attending and voting in person at a General Meeting.

Auditor
Resolutions to reappoint KPMG LLP as auditor of the Group 
and to authorise the Directors to determine its remuneration 
will be proposed at the 2017 AGM. The Audit Committee 
considers that the relationship with the auditor is working 
well and remains satisfied with its effectiveness. There are 
no contractual obligations restricting our choice of auditor.

Disclosure of information to auditor
Each Director at the date of the approval of this report 
confirms that:
• so far as he or she is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditor is unaware.
• he or she has taken all the steps that he or she ought 
to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself 
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Group’s auditor is aware of that information.
Going concern
These consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared on a going concern basis. The financial 
performance and position of the Group, its cash flows and its 
approach to capital management are set out in the financial 
review on pages 16 to 21. The Group has a strong financial 
position, with robust reserves, a conservative investment 
portfolio and capital significantly in excess of the minimum 
regulatory requirement. In addition, the Board has reviewed 
the Group’s projections for the next 12 months and beyond, 
including cash flow forecasts and regulatory capital 
surpluses. The Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operation for at least the next 12 months.
The Group’s viability statement is on page 24.
Material contracts
Save as disclosed below, there are no material contracts 
(other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course 
of business) to which the Group is a party:
• An agreement between the Group and CapGemini for 
the outsourcing of IT services. The initial term of the 
agreement was for five years from 1 April 2010 to 
31 March 2015.
• On 16 May 2014, a new seven-year agreement between 
the Group and CapGemini was signed.
• The Relationship Agreement between the Company and 
Sir Peter Wood remains in force until the Ordinary Shares 
cease to be admitted to the Official List of the FCA and to 
trading on the London Stock Exchange; or the Potential 
Controlling Shareholder ceases to own, when taken 
together, 15% or more of the Ordinary Shares or the 
voting rights attaching to the Ordinary Shares unless, 
at the time the Potential Controlling Shareholders shall 
cease to own, when taken together, 15% or more of the 
Ordinary Shares or the voting rights attaching to the 
Ordinary Shares, Sir Peter Wood remains the Chairman of 
the Company, in which event the Relationship Agreement 
shall terminate six months after Sir Peter Wood ceases to 
be the Chairman of the Company.
Research and development
In the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new 
products and services in each of its business divisions.
Special rights
There are no persons holding securities that carry special 
rights with regard to the control of the Group.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of risk management and internal 
control. To ensure that this is achieved and that the risk 
management and internal controls are embedded in the 
running of the business, the Group operates a three lines of 
defence structure which is regularly reported on to the Audit 
and Risk Committees. This framework mitigates the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, unforeseen losses and 
material financial misstatement.
There are a number of controls in place within this framework 
to ensure that the Group has robust procedures for preparing 
consolidated accounts and for financial reporting.
The Risk Committee and the Audit Committee, 
respectively, regularly review the effectiveness of the 
Group’s risk management and internal control systems. 
Their monitoring focuses on material risks and controls 
and is based principally on reporting upwards within the 
framework from business management, risk management 
and the Internal Audit function so that the Committees may 
consider whether significant weaknesses exist. During the 
course of the reviews, the Committees have not identified or 
been advised of any failings or weaknesses that they have 
determined to be significant.
To support Group policies and to facilitate the raising 
of concerns about possible improprieties in matters 
of financial reporting or any other matters, the Group 
provides a confidential telephone hotline, so that staff 
or third parties may report anonymously any perceived 
inaccurate or unethical working practices.
The Audit and Risk Committees endeavour to ensure that 
the Group has in place appropriate and effective controls, 
checks, systems, and risk management techniques.
Distributions
The Board has become aware of certain technical issues in 
respect of the Company’s procedures for the payment of the 
following dividends:
(a) the final cash dividend of 7.3 pence per share paid on 
20 May 2016; and
(b) the interim cash dividend of 3.0 pence per share paid 
on 21 October 2016, each a ‘Relevant Distribution’ and 
together, the ‘Relevant Distributions’
The Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a public 
company may pay a dividend out of its distributable profits 
as shown in the last accounts circulated to members, or if 
interim accounts are used, those that have been delivered 
to Companies House. These requirements apply even if the 
company in question has sufficient distributable profits to 
pay the relevant dividend at the relevant time.
The Company has at all times had sufficient profits 
and other distributable reserves to justify the Relevant 
Distributions and, as such, it could have prepared relevant 
interim accounts showing the requisite level of distributable 
profits and delivered these to Companies House in order 
to satisfy the procedural requirements of the Act. The 
Company did not, however, take all of these steps in 
relation to the Relevant Distributions. In both instances 
this constituted a procedural breach of section 838 of 
the Act and, accordingly, the Relevant Distributions were, 
regrettably, made otherwise than in accordance with 
the Act.
  72 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 
2017, a resolution will be proposed which authorises the 
appropriation of distributable reserves to the payment of the 
Relevant Distributions and puts all potentially affected parties 
in the position in which they were intended to be had the 
Relevant Distributions been made in accordance with the 
procedural requirements of the Act. This resolution 
constitutes a related party transaction under IAS 24 
and under the Listing Rules. 
 
The Company has put in place new procedures relating 
to all distributions which will ensure that relevant legal 
requirements are complied with at all times. These 
procedures have been subject to external legal review 
and will be regularly reassessed to ensure they 
remain appropriate.
 
Internal Audit
The Group’s Internal Audit function is fully outsourced.
The activities and effectiveness of Internal Audit are 
monitored and reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for ensuring that adequate access 
to information and resource is given to the Lead Internal 
Auditor and for approving the appointment and removal of 
the Lead Internal Auditor. The Lead Internal Auditor reports 
directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Internal 
Audit reports are presented to the Audit Committee on the 
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal controls and 
the adequacy of these systems to manage business risk and 
to safeguard the Group’s assets and resources. Internal 
Audit uses the Group’s risk registers to plan and inform its 
annual audit programme around the most significant risks to 
the business to ensure that controls are in place and are 
designed and operating effectively. The Audit Committee 
reviews and approves the Annual Internal Audit Plan.
This section together with the reports set out on pages 34 
to 72 are approved by order of the Board.

statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and 
parent company financial statements for each financial 
year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance 
with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced

prudent
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the EU
• For the parent company financial statements, state 
whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company financial 
statements
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the parent company will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the parent company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets 
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are 
also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of esure Group 
plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 set out on pages 
77 to 127. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the 
year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006; and, as regards the group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial 
statements the risks of material misstatement, in 
decreasing order of audit significance, that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows (unchanged from 2015):
Claims outstanding £672.9m (2015: £614.2m) and 
claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers 
£271.1m (2015: £209.3m). Risk vs 2015: v w
Refer to page 40 (Audit Committee Report), page 87 
(accounting policy) and pages 109 to 113 (financial 
disclosures). 
The risks:
As part of its business model the Group incurs insurance 
claims and there is typically a time lag between a claim 
being incurred and being reported and subsequently 
settled. The resulting claims outstanding on the Group’s 
balance sheet at any point in time, including year-end, are 
therefore significant. Valuation of the claims outstanding 
has inherent risk of uncertainty with some claims not yet 
being reported and the final costs of the majority of claims 
outstanding being unknown at the point of reporting. A 
portion of these claims outstanding are recoverable from 
reinsurers based on the policies in place across the Group. 
At 31 December 2016 the Group had claims outstanding 
representing 55% (2015: 56%) of total liabilities, and 
claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers 
representing 18% (2015: 14%) of total assets.
Gross claims outstanding: 
The valuation of claims outstanding remains one of the 
key judgemental areas upon which our audit is concentrated, 
due to the level of subjectivity inherent in the estimation of 
the effect of uncertain or unknown future events and the 
resulting potential exposure to large losses. The most 
notable claim events with significant levels of uncertainty 
include losses arising from periodic payment orders (‘PPOs’) 
(a structured settlement in the form of a regular series of 
payments over the remainder of a claimant’s life and which 
inherently has considerable uncertainty associated with it in 
respect of longevity and cost inflation, see page 109) and 
large bodily injury claims for motor insurance.
The claims outstanding reserve includes specific claims 
reserves for reported claims plus an estimate for claims 
incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) as some claims can 
take some time to emerge or develop. Actuarial techniques 
are required to determine the actuarial best estimate of 
reported claims and the IBNR. Resulting key areas of focus 
are the actuarial assumptions, such as claims development 
trends and discount rates applied to PPOs, and the 
completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the 
actuarial projections.
An additional margin is included in the claims outstanding 
reserve above the actuarial best estimate to account for 
current uncertainties around factors that may influence the 
final cost of settlement of the claims. The margin is based 
on the Directors’ judgement, supported by quantitative and 
qualitative analysis to inform their views.
Claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers: 
A portion of the claims outstanding balance is recoverable 
from reinsurers dependent on the reinsurance coverage of 
the relevant claims. An element of judgement is involved in 
the valuation relating to the level of reinsurance coverage 
of the IBNR which depends on the specific terms of the 
reinsurance contracts in place. Reinsurer credit default also 
results in credit risk over these reinsurance recoveries, 
being particularly relevant for the recoveries associated 
with the claims outstanding that have a long duration.
Our response
Gross claims outstanding:
• We have tested governance arrangements and key 
controls around the internal reserving process, including 
controls over the setting of reserves for reported claims 
and controls over the completeness and accuracy of the 
data underlying the actuarial projections, such as data in 
respect of current and historical claims, used to set the 
reserve for IBNR.
• We evaluated the competence, capabilities and 
objectivity of the internal and external actuaries 
used by the Group, based on discussions with them, 
our knowledge of the actuaries’ qualifications and the 
professional standards that their work is subject to, and 
by providing challenge to their analysis through the 
procedures described below.
• We used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in 
our challenge of the reserving methodology and the key 
assumptions used. We have assessed these assumptions 
for reasonableness, through analytical procedures 
including claims development trends over time, as well 
as consistency with prior periods. We considered the 
movement in reserves relating to claims incurred in prior 
years to assess the reasonableness of Directors’ past 
assumptions and the methodology used to estimate 
claims outstanding. Where there have been changes in 
the methodology or key assumptions we have assessed 
whether these are reasonable based on changes in the 
industry and the Group’s historical claims experience, 
and have considered whether all changes we would 
expect to see have been made. We have also considered 
the reasonableness of the differences in methodologies, 
assumptions and projections between the internal and 
external actuary by understanding the rationale for 
both approaches and comparing the impact of these 
differences on the outputs in the context of materiality 
for the Group financial statements. In doing the above, 
we have focused on the amounts provided both on PPOs, 
due to their inherent uncertainty, and large bodily injury 
claims in the context of significant uncertainty. This is  Strategic Report Governance Financials
75 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
especially relevant in relation to the uncertainty over 
estimating the ultimate claims liabilities given the change 
in line Ogden rate, over which sensitivity analysis has 
been performed.
• We benchmarked the Group’s methodology, key 
assumptions and projected results (such as the ultimate 
loss ratios, being the ultimate losses as a proportion of 
the premiums received) against our expectations given 
our cumulative knowledge of the sector.
• In respect of the margin that the Directors have set over 
the internal actuarial best estimate, we considered the 
consistency of the margin applied against developments 
in the level of uncertainty over the claims. This also 
included a critical assessment of the quantitative and 
qualitative considerations made by the Directors when 
selecting the specific level of margin to be held for the 
period as well as consideration of industry related 
benchmarks.
• We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures over the degree of estimation uncertainty 
and the sensitivity of recognised amounts to changes in 
assumptions, and assessed whether the disclosures 
comply with relevant accounting standards.
• We have sampled a number of large loss reserves to 
verify that case reserves held are supported by 
underlying documentation and are quantified in line with 
the Group’s reserving methodology. We have also 
performed trend analysis over specific characteristics of 
case reserves and obtained explanations for variances 
and outliers.
Claims outstanding recoverable from reinsurers:
• We evaluated and tested key controls around reinsurers’ 
share of claims outstanding, including the governance 
process in determining reinsurance IBNR and 
reinsurance credit controls in place to provide comfort 
over the recoverability of amounts owed by reinsurers.
• We used our own actuarial specialists to assist in 
evaluating the appropriateness of reinsurance recoveries 
on IBNR by considering the historical ratios of ‘paid and 
reported claims, net of reinsurance recoveries’ to ‘paid 
and reported claims, gross of reinsurance recoveries’.
• We assessed the methodology applied to calculate the 
allowance for reinsurance bad debt, by reference to 
common approaches within the market and consistency 
with prior periods. We assessed the existence of any 
potential indicators of credit default issues with regard 
to reinsurance over reported claims through analysing 
aged debt and reinsurance counterparty credit ratings.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the 
scope of our audit
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole 
was set at £7.5m (2015: £6.6m), determined with reference 
to a benchmark of Group total income including revenue 
contributed by Gocompare.com, consistent with 2015, of 
which it represents approximately 1% (2015: 1%). Group 
total income is considered to be the most appropriate 
benchmark as it provides a more stable measure 
year-on-year than Group profit before tax against 
which to scope our audit.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or 
uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.4m 
(2015: £0.3m), in addition to other identified misstatements 
that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
During the year, there was a demerger of one of the 
Group’s components, Gocompare.com. For ten months 
of the year, this component was part of the Group 
and consolidated accordingly into the Group financial 
statements. The Group team instructed the Gocompare.
com component auditor to perform an audit for Group 
reporting purposes over the significant area of profit before 
tax, for the ten-month period to be consolidated and the 
information to be reported back. The audit of the remainder 
of the Group including its components was undertaken by 
the Group audit team. The components scoped in for Group 
reporting accounted for 100% of total Group revenue, 
Group total assets, and Group profit before tax. The Group 
team approved the component materialities, which ranged 
from £1.25m to £6.7m (2015: £1.0m to £5.6m), having 
regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year is consistent with 
the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the 
course of the audit of the financial statements and from 
reading the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report:
• we have not identified material misstatements in those 
reports; and 
• in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006. 
5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of 
principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, 
we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in 
relation to: 
• the Directors’ viability statement on pages 24 to 27, 
concerning the principal risks, their management, and, 
based on that, the Directors’ assessment and 
expectations of the Group’s continuing in operation 
over the next three years to 31 December 2019; or 
• the disclosures on page 71 concerning the use of the 
going concern basis of accounting. 
6 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters 
on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to 
you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our 
audit, we have identified other information in the Annual 
Report that contains a material inconsistency with either 
that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading.  76 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
Independent auditor’s report to the members of esure group plc only continued
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between 
the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the 
Directors’ statement that they consider that the annual 
report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business model and 
strategy; or
• the Corporate Governance Report does not appropriately 
address matters communicated by us to the Audit 
Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are 
not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statements, set out on pages 68 and 24, in 
relation to going concern and longer-term viability; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on 
pages 32 to 46 relating to the company’s compliance 
with the eleven provisions of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code specified for our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above 
responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 73, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of 
the scope of an audit of financial statements is provided on 
the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/

1. General information
esure Group plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales. Its registered office is The Observatory, Reigate, 
Surrey, RH2 0SG.
The nature of the Group’s operations is the writing of general insurance for private cars and homes. The Company’s 
principal activity is that of a holding company.
All of the Company’s subsidiaries are located in the United Kingdom, except for esure S.L.U., which is incorporated in Spain.
2. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements present the esure Group plc group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016, 
comprising the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, as well as the comparatives.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union.
At a General Meeting on 1 November 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the demerger of Gocompare.com plc 
(‘Gocompare.com’) and on 3 November 2016 the demerger was completed.
Under IFRS 5 – Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations (‘IFRS 5’) there is no impact on the prior year 
financial statements as a result of this demerger other than a change in the presentation of the results and the cash flows of 
the Gocompare.com business to discontinued operations. There is no impact on the prior year statement of financial position.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. As detailed in the Strategic Report 
on page 24, the Directors have assessed the Group’s prospects and viability for the three year period to 31 December 
2019. Based on this robust assessment, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months.
These consolidated financial statements have been presented in Sterling and rounded to the nearest hundred thousand. 
Throughout these consolidated financial statements any amounts which are less than £0.05m are shown by 0.0, whereas a 
dash (-) represents that no balance exists.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial assets 
and land and buildings that are measured at fair value at the reporting date. The principal accounting policies adopted are 
set out below.
New and amended accounting standards adopted with no significant impact on the Group
The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for its annual reporting period 
commencing 1 January 2016:
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception
• Amendments to IFRS 11 Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations
• Amendments to IAS 1 Disclosure Initiative
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation
• Amendments to IFRSs Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012-2014 Cycle
The adoption of these amendments did not have any impact on the current or prior periods.
New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective
The following standards have been issued and are effective for accounting periods ending on or after 31 December 2016 
and are expected to have an impact on the Group financial statements.
IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments
The new standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard includes requirements for 
recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition of financial instruments and general hedge accounting. The 
Group’s current analysis is that this will not have a material impact on our results with the key changes for the Group 
being around terminology.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The new standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard specifies how and when an 
IFRS reporter will recognise revenue as well as requiring such entities to provide users of financial statements with more 
informative, relevant disclosures. The standard provides a single, principles based five-step model to be applied to all 
contracts with customers. The Group’s current analysis is that this will not have a material impact on our results.
IFRS 16 – Leases
The new standard is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The standard provides a single lessee 
accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months 
or less or the underlying asset has a low value. This is in contrast to the current standard which differentiates between 
operating and finance leases. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of the different possible transitional approaches.
Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2016 82 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity. Subsidiary companies are consolidated using the acquisition method.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtained control, 
and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
In preparing these consolidated financial statements, any intra-group balances, unrealised gains and losses or income 
and expenses arising from intra-group trading are eliminated. Where accounting policies used in individual financial 
statements of a subsidiary company differ from Group policies, adjustments are made to bring these policies in line 
with Group policies.
Joint ventures
Prior to the acquisition of the outstanding 50% of the ordinary shares of Gocompare on 31 March 2015, the Group’s 
interest in Gocompare was classified under IFRS 11 – Joint Arrangements as a joint venture.
A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of 
the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The Group’s interests in jointly controlled 
entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Group recognises the cost of the investments which, 
together with the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-acquisition changes to shareholders’ funds, is included in the 
consolidated statement of financial position. The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income is stated after appropriate adjustments to align the accounting policies of the joint venture with those of the Group. 
In addition, adjustments are made for the amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets recognised on acquisition 
and to eliminate unrealised profits relating to commission charged to esure Group plc by the joint venture. Carrying values 
are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any such indications 
exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised 
through the income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve and credited through the 
income statement.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the 
aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree, plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity 
interest in the acquiree. Any gain arising from the difference between the fair value of the Group’s pre-existing 
equity interest and its carrying value is recorded as a deemed disposal gain in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Goodwill is recognised at the date of acquisition as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the 
identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any deferred tax asset or liability recognised as part of the business 
combination according to the requirements of IAS 12 – Income Taxes. Where the excess is negative a gain is recognised 
in the income statement at the date of acquisition.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification 
and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the 
acquisition date. All acquisition-related costs are expensed in the income statement when incurred.
Revenue
Gross written premiums
Gross written premiums, being the total premiums receivable for the whole period of cover provided by contracts entered 
into during the accounting period, excluding taxes or duties based on premiums, are recognised on the date which the 
policy commences. Gross written premiums include any adjustments arising in the accounting period for premiums 
receivable in respect of business written in prior accounting periods.
Unearned premiums
The proportion of gross written premiums that are to be earned in the accounting period after the balance sheet date are 
deferred as a provision for unearned premiums. Premiums earned are computed separately for each insurance contract 
and are recognised as revenue using the daily pro rata method, which is consistent with the incidence of risk assumed 
over the coverage period of the related policy.
Reinsurance premiums ceded
Reinsurance premiums are recognised and measured in a manner consistent with the related insured contracts issued by 
the Group and the specific terms of each reinsurance contract. Reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that 
the reinsurance cover is provided based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks. The unexpired portion of ceded 
reinsurance premiums is included in reinsurance assets.
Unearned reinsurance premiums ceded
Unearned reinsurance premiums are those proportions of premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after 
the reporting date. Unearned reinsurance premiums are deferred over the term of the underlying direct insurance policies 
for risks-attaching contracts and over the term of the reinsurance contract for losses-occurring contracts.

2. Accounting policies continued
Revenue
Other income
Other income comprises sales of non-underwritten additional insurance products to Motor and Home insurance 
customers; policy administration fees; fees generated from the appointment of firms used during the claims process and 
car hire suppliers.
Revenue earned on the sale of additional services includes both brokerage fees and commission, where the Group has a 
continuing relationship with the customer, and introducer fees where the Group does not have a continuing relationship 
with the customer.
Revenue relating to insurance broking is brought into account when the policy placement has been completed and 
confirmed. Where the Group has an obligation to provide future services to the customer an element of income relating 
to the policy is deferred to cover the cost of fulfilling the associated contractual obligation plus a reasonable profit margin. 
Deferred revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Group’s obligations to provide those 
services. Where the Group has no contractual obligation to provide future services, the revenue is recognised immediately.
In certain circumstances, where the revenue cannot be reliably measured at the contract or policy inception date, broking 
fees and commission are recognised on a periodic basis when the consideration becomes due. Rebates of commissions 
and fees relating to the return of premiums for additional insurance products and services are recognised at the point the 
return is due.
Administration fees and referral fees from credit hire are recognised in the period in which the related services are provided.
Investment income and instalment interest
Investment income comprises interest and dividend income and net gains (both realised and unrealised) on financial 
assets classified at fair value through profit or loss, including derivative financial instruments. Dividends are recognised 
when the right to receive payment is established. For listed securities, this is the date the security is listed as ex-dividend.
Interest income (including interest received from policyholders who pay by instalment) on assets classified as loans and 
receivables or as available for sale is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated using the 
effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of 
allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the asset or liability. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the instrument’s initial carrying amount. Calculation of 
the effective interest rate takes into account fees payable or receivable that are an integral part of the instrument’s yield, 
premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue, early redemption fees and transaction costs. All contractual terms of a 
financial instrument are considered when estimating future cash flows.
Investment income also includes rental income. Rental income represents income arising from operating leases and is 
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attached 
conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as other income (as fees for 
additional services) over the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to 
compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as deferred income and released to the income 
statement in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.
Claims and expenses recognition
Gross claims incurred and claims handling expenses
Gross claims include all claims incurred during the year, whether reported or not, less recoveries, together with related 
internal and external handling costs that are directly related to the processing and settlement of claims, and any 
adjustment to claims outstanding from previous years.
Reinsurance claims
Reinsurance claims are recognised and measured in a manner consistent with the related insurance contracts issued by 
the Group and the specific terms of the reinsurance contract.
Finance costs
Finance costs comprise interest paid which is recognised in the income statement as it accrues and is calculated by 
using the effective interest rate method. Accrued interest is included within the carrying value of the interest bearing 
financial liability.
Taxation
Current tax
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the 
reporting date. Current tax assets and liabilities also include adjustments in respect of tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable in respect of previous periods. 84 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Accounting policies continued
Taxation continued
Current tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income is recognised in equity or other 
comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes. It is 
calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is recovered, 
using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination (e.g. fair 
value adjustments for brands and customer relationships) in which case the deferred tax is included as part of the assets 
and liabilities assumed for the purposes of calculating goodwill. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the 
income statement is also recognised outside the income statement, either in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity as appropriate.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets 
against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to Sterling at the exchange rate at the 
reporting date. Foreign currency differences are recognised in profit or loss in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised on business combinations and the acquisition of joint ventures at cost less accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations is presented in intangible assets. For joint ventures, goodwill is not 
separately presented but is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Negative goodwill is recognised in the 
Group income statement at the date of acquisition. Positive goodwill is not amortised.
Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised if the 
carrying amount of the cash generating unit (or units) to which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount. 
A recognised impairment loss is not reversed.
Goodwill attributed to an investment in a joint venture accounted under the equity method is not tested for impairment 
separately. The entire carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment only if there is objective evidence of 
impairment. A recognised impairment loss may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve.
Software
Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset, with the carrying value being reviewed at every reporting date 
for evidence of impairment and the value being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions subsequently improve, 
the previously recognised impairment may be reversed.
Amortisation of software begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for 
it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The cost of purchased software is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the intangible asset. This has been set between two and seven years.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. Costs associated 
with the development of software for internal use are capitalised only if the software is technically feasible for sale or 
use on completion and the Group has both the intent and sufficient resources to complete the development. Subsequent 
expenditure is capitalised only if the cost of the asset can be reliably measured, will generate future economic benefits 
and there is an ability to use or sell the asset.
The cost of internally generated software is amortised over the expected useful life of the intangible asset on a straight-
line basis. The expected useful life is between three and five years.
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives. For intangible assets that are recognised as part of business 
combinations, the Group makes an assessment of the fair value of the identified intangible assets acquired in the business 
combination. Intangible assets other than those arising as part of business combinations are recognised as long as it is 
probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and its cost 
can be measured reliably. The Group holds no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives other than goodwill. The carrying 
value of intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at every reporting date for evidence of impairment with the 
value being written down if any impairment exists. If conditions subsequently improve, the previously recognised 
impairment may be reversed and credited through the income statement.

2. Accounting policies continued
Intangible assets continued
The economic lives and amortisation methods of acquired intangible assets, other than software, are as follows:
Insurer customer relationships 5 to 6 years, based on the pattern of consumption of the benefits 
Gocompare.com customer relationships 2 years, on a straight-line basis
Insurer brands 8 to 10 years, on a straight-line basis 
Gocompare.com brand 5 years, on a straight-line basis
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises land and buildings occupied by the Group and fixtures, fittings and equipment 
(including computer hardware). Land and buildings are stated at their revalued amount, which is the fair value, less 
subsequent depreciation for buildings. All other assets are stated at cost less depreciation and accumulated impairment. 
Replacement or major inspection costs are capitalised when incurred if it is possible that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method 
to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their economic lives, with the exception of freehold land which 
is not depreciated. The economic lives are as follows:
 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment between 3 and 8 years
Freehold buildings 100 years
 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed and adjusted prospectively, 
if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits 
are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year 
in which the asset is derecognised.
Impairment and revaluation of property, plant and equipment
Carrying values are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment. If any 
such indications exist, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less costs to sell and the asset’s value in use. Impairment losses are 
recognised through the income statement. Impairment may be reversed if conditions subsequently improve and credited 
through the income statement.
Revaluations of land and buildings are undertaken annually, with more frequent revaluations occurring where an 
assessment is made that the carrying amount may differ materially from its fair value. Where a revaluation occurs, 
any accumulated depreciation at the time of the revaluation is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset.
Increases in the carrying amount arising on the revaluation of Group occupied property are credited to revaluation 
reserves in other comprehensive income, unless they offset previous decreases of the same asset that have been charged 
to the income statement, in which case the increase is also charged to the income statement. Similarly, decreases that 
offset previous increases of the same asset that have been credited to a revaluation surplus are recorded directly in other 
comprehensive income as a reduction in the revaluation surplus; other decreases are charged to the income statement.
Financial assets
Classification
Financial assets falling within the scope of IAS 39 – Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are designated / 
classified as “at fair value through profit or loss” (‘FVTPL’), “loans and receivables”, “available-for-sale” (‘AFS’) or “held for 
trading”. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. The Group does not classify 
any financial assets as held to maturity financial assets.
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, other debtors and quoted and unquoted financial 
investments including derivatives. Insurance receivables are also presented as financial assets.
Initial recognition of financial assets
The Group designates on initial recognition its financial assets held for investment purposes at FVTPL or AFS with the 
exception of derivatives, which are classified as held for trading. All other financial assets are classified as loans and 
receivables. For those financial investments designated at FVTPL or AFS, this is in accordance with the Group’s documented 
investment strategy. Information relating to these investments is provided internally to the Group’s Directors and key 
managers on a fair value basis. 86 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Accounting policies continued
Financial assets continued
The Group’s financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus any directly attributable transaction costs, with 
the exception of financial assets at FVTPL for which directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred. If the 
Group determines that the fair value of a financial asset on initial recognition differs from its transaction price, but the fair 
value measurement is not evidenced by a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets, then this 
difference is deferred and is subsequently recognised as investment income only to the extent that there is a change in 
factor (including time) that would result in a market participant taking the data into account when setting a price for 
the financial asset.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at the trade date.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through profit or loss in the 
statement of comprehensive income. AFS financial assets are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss (other 
than impairments and foreign currency movements) recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the available for sale reserve. Interest income is recognised as investment income through the statement of comprehensive 
income and is calculated based on amortised cost using the effective interest rate. When available for sale financial assets 
are derecognised, the gain or loss accumulated in the available for sale reserve is reclassified to profit or loss in the 
statement of comprehensive income.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses using the effective interest 
rate method.
Financial assets
Impairment of financial assets
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows from the asset and reporting financial difficulty of the 
issuer or counterparty.
Financial assets measured at amortised cost
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether any financial assets held at amortised cost are impaired. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset 
may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arising from the asset. Impairment losses on financial assets 
classified as loans and receivables are calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Impairment losses and any reversals 
of impairments are recognised through the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets
Assets classified as available for sale are initially recognised at fair value with subsequent fair value gains or losses (other 
than impairments and foreign currency movements) recognised through other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the available for sale reserve.
Interest income is recognised as investment income through the income statement and is calculated based on amortised 
cost using the effective interest rate.
If the financial asset is sold, unrealised gains or losses recognised in other reserves will be recognised in the income 
statement under investment income.
Impairment losses on available for sale financial assets are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in the 
available for sale reserve to the income statement. The amount reclassified is the difference between the value on initial 
recognition and the current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in the income statement. If the 
fair value of an impaired available for sale financial asset subsequently increases, then the impairment loss is reversed 
through the income statement to the extent that it offsets impairment losses previously recognised; otherwise, it is 
recognised in the available for sale reserve.
Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired or when the Group 
transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.
Offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial 
position if, and only if, the Group has a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and it intends to 
settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Income and expenses are not offset 
in the income statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or interpretation.
Reinsurance
The Group cedes insurance risk in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its potential losses from 
accepting insurance risk. Reinsurance assets represent amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurers in respect 
of claims incurred under the related insurance contracts and are estimated in a manner consistent with the outstanding 
claims provision or settled claims under the related insurance contracts.

2. Accounting policies continued
Reinsurance continued
Reinsurance assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date or more frequently when an indication of 
impairment arises during the reporting period. Impairment occurs when there is objective evidence as a result of an event 
that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset that the Group may not receive all outstanding amounts due 
under the terms of the contract and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will 
receive from the reinsurer. Any impairment loss is recorded in the income statement.
Insurance receivables
Insurance receivables are recognised when contracts are entered into and are measured on initial recognition at the fair 
value of the consideration received or receivable. Subsequent to initial recognition, insurance receivables are measured 
at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses, using the effective interest rate method. The carrying value of 
insurance receivables is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable, with the impairment loss recorded in the income statement.
Deferred acquisition costs (‘DAC’)
Acquisition costs comprise all commission and other direct and indirect acquisition costs arising from the conclusion of 
insurance contracts. Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds to 
the unearned premiums provision at the reporting date, and are deferred to the extent that these costs are recoverable 
out of future premiums. All other acquisition costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Subsequent to initial recognition, DAC assets are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned. 
DAC assets are derecognised when the obligations under the related insurance contracts are either transferred or settled.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term deposits with 
original maturities of three months or less that are held to meet short-term cash commitments rather than for investment 
or other purposes.
Insurance contract liabilities
Provision for unearned premiums
The provision for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums received or receivable that relates to risks that 
have not yet expired at the reporting date. The provision is recognised when the contracts are entered into and premiums 
are charged, and is released as earned premium in the income statement over the term of the contract in accordance with 
the pattern of insurance service provided under the contract.
Liability adequacy test
At each reporting date the Group reviews its unexpired risk and performs a liability adequacy test to determine whether the 
estimated cost of future claims and deferred acquisition costs exceeds the provision for unearned premiums. This calculation 
uses current estimates of future contractual cash flows after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on 
assets relating to the relevant technical provision. If these estimates show that the carrying amount of the unearned premium 
is inadequate, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement and a corresponding provision for unexpired risk is 
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Outstanding claims provision
The provision for claims outstanding comprises provisions for the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but not 
settled at the balance sheet date including related claims handling expenses, whether reported or not. Anticipated 
reinsurance recoveries and salvage and subrogation recoveries are disclosed separately as assets.
Insurance payables
Insurance payables are recognised when due and measured initially at the fair value of the consideration received. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities falling within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as “derivatives held for trading”, or “other financial 
liabilities”. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
The Group’s “other financial liabilities” include other payables and borrowings. Insurance payables are also presented as 
other financial liabilities.
Initial recognition
All financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value less, in the case of other financial liabilities, directly attributable 
transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of effective interest 
rate, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. The amortisation is included in finance costs in the 
income statement. 88 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
2. Accounting policies continued
Financial liabilities continued
Derecognition of financial liabilities
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. When an 
existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an 
existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification, is treated as a derecognition of the original 
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the 
income statement.
Derivatives
Derivatives are measured at fair value both initially and subsequent to initial recognition. All changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement. Derivatives are presented as assets when the fair values are positive and as 
liabilities when the fair values are negative.
Hedge accounting
The Group does not currently designate any derivatives as hedging instruments.
Share Capital
Shares are classified as equity when there is no contractual obligation to transfer cash or other assets to holders of the 
financial instruments.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and 
it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a 
reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or all of the expenditure 
required to settle a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the 
reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statement net of any 
reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate 
that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision 
due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Employee benefits – pensions
The Group contributes to a defined contribution scheme for its employees. The contributions payable to this scheme are 
charged to the income statement in the accounting period to which they relate.
Leases
Group as a lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified 
as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the 
leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as the related income. Contingent rents are recognised 
as revenue in the period in which they are earned (i.e. when virtually certain).
Group as a lessee – operating leases
Leases which do not transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased 
items are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments, including the effects of any lease incentives, are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals are 
recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the grant date at the fair value of the equity 
instruments (excluding the effect of non-market vesting conditions but including the effect of market vesting conditions). 
Fair value is not subsequently remeasured.
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, based on the best estimate of the number of awards which will ultimately vest 
unconditionally with employees. The estimate of the number of awards expected to vest (excluding the effect of market 
vesting conditions) is revised at each reporting date, with any consequential changes to the charge recognised in the 
income statement.
Where equity-settled share-based payments are modified, any incremental fair value is expensed on a straight line basis 
over the revised vesting period.
Discontinued operations
Under IFRS 5, following the demerger, Gocompare.com plc represents a discontinued operation and the post-tax profit or 
loss, including direct transaction costs, is presented as a single amount on the face of the statement of comprehensive 
income in both current and prior year.
The demerger is a distribution of non-cash assets to the owners and, as such, falls under IFRIC 17. A fair value uplift, 
being the difference between the book value and the fair value at the date of distribution, of £213.6m is therefore seen on 
demerger, this is based on the market capitalisation at the date of demerger (note 12).

3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these 
estimates; however the consolidated financial statements presented are based on conditions that existed at the balance 
sheet date.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Insurance contract liabilities
Estimates have to be made both for the expected ultimate cost of claims reported at the reporting date and for the 
expected ultimate cost of claims incurred but not reported (‘IBNR’) at the reporting date. It can take a significant period 
of time before ultimate claims cost can be established with certainty for some types of claims.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is estimated by carrying out standard actuarial projections in line with the 
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries Technical Actuarial Standards. These techniques use past claims information and 
development patterns of these claims to project the expected future claims cost both for notified and non-notified claims.
Similar judgements, estimates and assumptions are employed in the assessment of adequacy of provisions for unearned 
premium and hence whether there is a requirement for an unexpired risk provision.
Please refer to note 20 for additional details.
4. Segmental information
The Group makes decisions on customer acquisition and retention based on contribution. In addition to the underwriting 
contribution from Motor and Home, a diversified suite of additional insurance products and services provide opportunities 
to deliver enhanced customer contributions.
Operating segments
The Group has four operating segments as described below. These segments are also the Group’s reportable segments 
and represent the manner in which the business is regularly reported to the Group’s executive and Board of Directors.
Motor underwriting
This segment incorporates the revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Group’s Motor insurance underwriting 
activities inclusive of additional insurance products underwritten by the Group.
Home underwriting
This segment incorporates the revenues and expenses directly attributable to the Group’s Home insurance 
underwriting activities.
Non-underwritten additional services
This segment represents the revenue and expenses relating to sales of third-party additional insurance products to Motor 
and Home insurance customers; policy administration fees; instalment interest income; fees generated from the 
appointment of firms used during the claims process and car hire suppliers.

There are no other material components of income and expense or non-cash items.
Trading profit from continuing operations, being earnings before interest, tax, non-trading expenses and amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, is management’s measure of the overall profitability of the Group’s operating activities. The 
Group’s segmental trading profit, comprising Motor underwriting, Home underwriting, Non-underwritten additional 
services and Investments is £84.6m (2015: £72.1m).
The Group’s profit in respect of continuing operations after tax is £59.5m (2015: £49.9m).
The Group incurred non-trading costs of £0.9m in 2016 of which £0.4m related to share-based payments in respect of the 
long service and one-off awards disclosed in note 27 and £0.2m related to stamp duty and legal fees in respect of the new 
Manchester lease. The Group incurred non-trading costs of £0.2m in 2015, however this comprised of a charge in relation 
to share-based payments in respect of the long service and one-off awards disclosed in note 27 of £1.5m, which was 
offset by a £1.3m upwards revaluation of the Group’s land and buildings.
Segmental profit drivers
Motor and Home underwriting
The performance of the Motor and Home underwriting segments is measured by reference to a number of performance 
metrics, including in-force policies and the combined operating ratio.
Profitability of segmental underwriting activities is measured by reference to the net loss ratio, being net incurred claims 
as a percentage of earned premiums, net of reinsurance. For the year ended 31 December 2016, the Motor underwriting 
net loss ratio was 75.7% (2015: 76.3%) and the Home underwriting net loss ratio was 66.0% (2015: 62.2%). The total net 
loss ratio was 74.2% (2015: 74.0%).
The overall profitability of the Group’s underwriting activities is measured by reference to the combined operating ratio, 
being the net expense ratio (net insurance expenses plus claims handling costs as a percentage of earned premiums, net

23.8%) giving a combined operating ratio of 98.8% (2015: 97.8%).
In order to get a holistic view of the contribution from Motor and Home underwriting it is also necessary to consider the 
impact of Non-underwritten additional services and Investments.

basis; at 31 December 2016, revenue per IFP was £51.07 (2015: £51.70).
Investments
The performance of investments is measured by reference to gross investment return on invested assets. For the year 
ended 31 December 2016, this was 2.2% (2015: 0.8%). In addition, the Group received income from its investment in IMe 
Law Limited.

Gocompare.com and related work including tax advice specific to the demerger and a review of the accounting 
treatment proposed by management.
12. Acquisition and demerger of Gocompare.com
On 31 March 2015, the Group acquired the outstanding 50% of the ordinary shares of Gocompare.com. Following the 
acquisition, the Group owned 100% of the ordinary share capital of Gocompare.com and controlled 100% of the voting rights.
On 7 June 2016 the Board announced a strategic review which concluded that a demerger should be pursued. At a 
General Meeting on 1 November 2016, the Company’s shareholders approved the demerger of Gocompare.com plc. 
On 3 November 2016, the demerger was completed and the shares in Gocompare.com were admitted to the premium 
segment of the Official List and to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
Gocompare.com is an internet based price comparison website for financial and non-financial products.
Consideration transferred
In 2015, the Group paid £96.2m in cash for the outstanding 50% of the ordinary share capital of Gocompare.com, being 
the £95.0m committed to as at 31 December 2014 and £1.2m arising as a result of the adjustment mechanism described 
in the Group’s 2014 annual report and accounts.
In line with the requirements of IFRS 3, the Group’s existing 50% interest in Gocompare.com was remeasured to fair value 
at the acquisition date, with the resulting gain of £63.8m recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as a joint 
venture deemed disposal gain. This treatment effectively considers that the Group’s existing interest is sold immediately 
prior to the acquisition at its fair value, and subsequently repurchased at the same value at the acquisition date. The fair 
value of the Group’s existing interest immediately prior to the acquisition has been estimated to be equal to the fair value 
of consideration offered by the Group for the other 50% of Gocompare.com.
The table below summarises the acquisition date fair values of each major class of consideration transferred:

Measurement of fair values
Identifiable intangible assets at the acquisition date include fair values of £40.9m for the Gocompare.com brand and 
£10.2m for the Gocompare.com customer relationships (with a related deferred tax liability recognised of £10.2m for 
these intangible assets). The brand and customer relationships were valued according to the relief-from-royalty method 
and the multi-period excess earnings method respectively.
The relief-from-royalty method considers the notional present value of estimated royalty payments that would be payable 
were the Gocompare.com brand to be licensed from a third party owner. A royalty rate of 10% of revenue was used for 
the Gocompare.com brand based on comparable royalty rates in the market place, applied to the brand’s estimated useful 
economic life of five years.
The multi-period excess earnings method considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by 
Gocompare.com customer relationships over their estimated useful economic life of two years, by excluding from 
Gocompare.com total forecast cash flows any estimated cash flows relating to other contributory assets.
For all other assets the IFRS book values were considered to approximate fair value.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition of £127.7m relates to future value derived from the Group having gained control of 
Gocompare.com, planned strategic developments and other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition 
under IFRS 3. No goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Impact on reported revenue and profit after tax
Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2015, assuming that the same joint venture deemed disposal gain and fair 
value adjustments that arose at the date of acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2015, the adjustments to the Group’s 
income, profit after tax and trading profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 would have been as follows:
• Increase in other income of £29.0m to £151.2m for the year ended 31 December 2015 following inclusion of revenue 
relating to Gocompare.com;
• Increase in profit after tax of £0.5m to £122.4m for the year ended 31 December 2015, including £3.3m of additional 
other operating expenses relating to amortisation of acquired intangibles; and
• Increase in consolidated trading profit of £3.4m to £95.7m for the year ended 31 December 2015. 96 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
12. Acquisition and demerger of Gocompare.com continued
Dividends received from the joint venture
Prior to the acquisition, the Group received dividends from Gocompare.com during 2015 of £10.0m.
Demerger
The demerger was effected by the Group making an interim in-specie distribution of Gocompare.com shares to 
shareholders. Following approval of the demerger by shareholders, but before the approval of the demerger dividend by 
the Board, Gocompare.com plc drew down debt of £75m under a term loan facility and paid a cash dividend to the Group 
of £73.3m.
Gocompare.com has been presented as a discontinued operation with all income and expenses shown as a single 
line in the statement of comprehensive income. The demerger is considered a distribution of non-cash assets to owners 
and, as such, falls under IFRIC 17 which requires a revaluation to fair value. A non-cash gain of £213.6m, based on the 
fair value of the assets at demerger (based on the market valuation on the date of demerger), is therefore recorded in the 
statement of comprehensive income. There is no impact on the prior year financial statements as a result of this 
demerger other than a change in the presentation of the results in the statement of comprehensive income and the 
cash flows of the Gocompare.com business to discontinued operations – the notes reflect the transfer of individual 
line items to discontinued operations.

In 2016 there is also deferred tax recognised directly in other comprehensive income that relates to AFS investments.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future periods
A reduction in the standard rate of Corporation Tax from 21% to 20% was effective from 1 April 2015. There will be 
further reductions in the rate of Corporation Tax to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 17% from 1 April 2020. These changes were 
substantively enacted at the year end date and have been taken into account in the calculation of the deferred tax liability.
15. Dividends
A 2016 interim dividend per share of 3.0p (£12.5m) was declared by the Board of Directors in August 2016 (2015: interim 
dividend per share of 4.2p, £17.5m). Subsequent to the year end, a 2016 final dividend per share of 10.5p (£43.9m) was 
declared by the Board of Directors (2015: final dividend per share of 7.3p, £30.3m).
16. Earnings per share
Basic
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group and the 
weighted average of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding Ordinary Shares held as employee trust shares. 
A calculation is also shown based on the earnings from continuing operations attributable to the owners of the Group.
Diluted
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to the owners of the Group by the weighted 
average of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period adjusted for any dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. A calculation is 
also shown based on the earnings from continuing operations attributable to the owners of the Group. Share issues during 
the year are set out in note 26.
The difference between the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year, being 
2,009,742 (2015: 1,202,953), relates to the dilutive potential of the share-based payment arrangements. Details of share 
awards are set out in note 27.

Underlying earnings per share
In 2016, as a result of the demerger of Gocompare.com plc the Group recognised costs relating to the transaction and 
a non-cash gain on demerger and, in 2015, as a result of the acquisition of the outstanding 50% of the share capital of 
Gocompare.com on 31 March 2015, the Group recognised a joint venture deemed disposal gain and amortisation relating to 
the intangible assets arising on the application of IFRS 3. In order to reflect better the Group’s performance for the period 
and its dividend paying capacity, an additional underlying earnings per share calculation is presented below. The reported 
profit after tax for each period is adjusted for the Group’s non-cash gain on demerger under IFRIC 17 (31 December 2016: 
£213.6m; 31 December 2015: £nil), the joint venture deemed disposal gain (31 December 2016: £nil; 31 December 2015:

of acquired intangibles, from continuing and discontinued operations, net of the deferred tax credit associated with the 
amortisation (31 December 2016: £10.4m; 31 December 2015: £10.1m). The number of shares is set at the number of 
Ordinary Shares in issue at the reporting date.

Goodwill of £127.7m as at 31 December 2015 relates to goodwill arising on the acquisition of Gocompare.com by the 
Group (see note 12).
Included in acquired brands and customer relationships were the Gocompare.com brand and the Gocompare.com 
customer relationships recognised on application of IFRS 3 to the acquisition of the outstanding 50% of the ordinary 
share capital of Gocompare.com on 31 March 2015. The Gocompare.com brand had an estimated fair value at the date 
of acquisition of £40.9m and was being amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life of five 
years. The Gocompare.com customer relationships had an estimated fair value at the date of acquisition of £10.2m and 
were being amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life of two years.
The other acquired brands and customer relationship intangible assets represent the Sheilas’ Wheels and esure brands 
and customer relationships acquired by the Group as part of the acquisition of esure Holdings Limited in February 2010. 
These assets were fair valued at the date of acquisition in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3. The brands are 
being amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of between eight and ten years. The 
customer relationships are being amortised on a reducing balance basis over their estimated useful economic lives of 
between five and six years.
Impairment testing on intangible assets
The Group tests intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment where there are indicators that their carrying 
value may be impaired. There were no indicators of impairment in the periods reported for any intangible assets with 
finite useful lives and as a result no impairment testing was performed.
Goodwill
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36, goodwill arising on the acquisition of Gocompare.com was tested annually 
for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill was allocated with its 
recoverable amount, which represented the higher of its estimated fair value and value in use. An impairment loss would 
have been recognised had the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Up until the time of the demerger of Gocompare.com the recoverable amount of the Gocompare.com cash generating unit 
was based on its value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by 
the Board covering a three year period. They reflect the Board’s expectations of revenue, earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’) growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on 
past experience and future expectations of business performance. Cash flows beyond the three year period were 
extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
A growth rate of 3% was applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity. Growth was reviewed and held at 3% so as 
not to exceed the long-term expected growth rate of the country and industry Gocompare.com operates in, in accordance 
with IAS 36. The pre-tax discount rate used was 13%. The Directors were comfortable that a reasonable change in the 
underlying assumptions would not have indicated an impairment.

were not yet available for use in the manner intended by management. These assets are now being used by the business 
and depreciation is being charged accordingly.
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, all 
with recent relevant experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS 
Valuation Standards in the UK (‘Red Book’). More frequent revaluations are performed by management to assess that 
the carrying amount does not materially differ from its fair value.
This assessment, on the basis of existing use value and in accordance with UK Valuation Standard 1.3, is the estimated 
amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an 
arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without 
compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business 
and disregarding potential alternative uses and any other characteristics of the property that would cause its market value 
to differ from that needed to replace the remaining service potential at least cost. The valuation assessment adopts 
market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the 
requirements of IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment.
Independent valuations were performed as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015. If land and buildings were not 
stated at their revalued amounts, and were instead held under the cost model, land and buildings would have a carrying 
value at 31 December 2016 of £11.8m (31 December 2015: £11.9m). 102 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016

Derivative financial instruments, at fair value through profit or loss
To eliminate as far as possible the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of investments denominated in 
currencies other than Sterling, the Group has purchased forward currency contracts. The Group also uses government

19.3. Financial risk management objectives
The Group is exposed to a range of financial risks through its financial assets, financial liabilities, reinsurance assets and 
policyholder liabilities. In particular, the key financial risk is that the proceeds from financial assets are not sufficient to 
fund the obligations arising from insurance policies as they fall due. The most important components of this financial risk 
are market risk (including interest rate risk, equity price risk and currency risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
(a) Market risk
These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general 
and specific market movements. The market risks that the Group primarily faces due to the nature of its investments and 
liabilities are interest rate risk and equity price risk.
The Group manages market risk by virtue of its risk management framework, incorporating the Group’s Risk Appetite and 
setting an appropriate investment strategy.
The majority of investments held are listed and traded on the UK and other recognised stock exchanges. The Group has a 
defined investment strategy and market risk policy which sets limits on the Group’s exposure by setting, where applicable, 
duration, issuer and other concentration limits for each asset class.
The Group’s Investment Management Committee are responsible for setting investment strategy, guidelines and policies, 
in line with the Board approved Risk Appetite. Ultimately, the Board retains oversight of investment strategy, whilst 
remaining responsible for the Group’s Risk Appetite. The Investment Management Committee agrees a Strategic Asset 
Allocation which is then implemented by its external investment managers. The Strategic Asset Allocation is reviewed 
annually and performance against the Strategic Asset Allocation is reviewed at the Investment Management Committees.
Investment Management Committee meetings, chaired by an Executive Director, are held at least six times per annum. 
At these meetings, Executive Directors and senior managers meet to discuss investment performance, composition and 
strategy across the Group’s portfolio.
(i) Interest rate risk
The Investment Management Committee balances the portfolio of investments to manage the exposure to interest rate 
risk. In addition, to the extent that claims inflation is correlated to interest rates, liabilities to policyholders are exposed 
to interest rate risk.
The Group monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis by calculating the mean duration of key elements of the investment 
portfolio and of the liabilities to policyholders under insurance contracts. The mean duration is an indicator of the sensitivity 
of the assets and liabilities to changes in current interest rates. The mean duration of the technical liabilities is determined 
by means of projecting expected cash flows using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions 
made by the Investment Management Committee give due consideration to the duration and profile of liabilities to avoid any 
significant mismatch in the asset and liability profiles. In order to preserve capital and to manage the risk of interest rate 
movements causing a material impact to the Group’s solvency coverage, which also reflect the impact of Solvency II, the 
Group aims to maintain a broad alignment of duration between the appropriate asset portfolios and its liabilities. The 
Group’s investment managers also have the ability to use Government bond futures as a mechanism to ensure portfolio 
duration remains within strict limits.
The sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of the financial 
investments bearing interest rate risk will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates at the reporting date.  
For an increase of 100 basis points in the Bank of England base rate the profit after tax for the period would decrease  
by £3.7m (2015: £4.8m), reflecting the reduction in fair value on assets designated as FVTPL and equity would decrease by 
£16.4m (2015: £4.1m). For a decrease of 25 basis points in the Bank of England base rate the profit after tax for the  
period would increase by £0.9m (2015: £1.2m), reflecting the increase in fair value on assets designated as FVTPL and 
equity would increase by £4.1m (2015: £1.2m). The increased sensitivity to interest rates, on an equity basis, is caused by 
the Group’s extension of duration from <1.0 years to 2.6 years and this change being predominantly driven by assets 
designated as AFS.
(ii) Equity price risk
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk as a result of its holdings in investments with prices quoted on a stock 
exchange which are designated as financial assets at FVTPL. Exposures to individual companies and to equity shares in 
aggregate are defined within the appropriate investment management guidelines and monitored on a regular basis.
If equity market indices had increased / decreased by 10%, the profit before tax for the year would increase / decrease by 
£3.9m (2015: £3.9m).
(iii) Currency risk
The Group has exposure to currency risk in respect of certain investments denominated in currencies other than Sterling. 
At the reporting date the most significant currencies to which the Group is exposed are Euros and US Dollars (USD). The 
Group seeks to mitigate currency risk by the use of forward contracts with a maturity of less than three months from the 
reporting date, matching the estimated foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities denominated in the same 
currency. Strict agreements are in place with investment managers to ensure all non-Sterling debt securities and other 
fixed income securities are hedged to between 99.5% and 100.5% of the carrying value. 104 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
19. Financial assets and liabilities continued
19.3. Financial risk management objectives continued
One investment manager, who holds shares and other variable yield securities, is permitted per their mandate to have 
unhedged currency risk exposure of up to £12.2m (2015: £11.4m). At the reporting date, the Group has direct exposure to 
both USD and Euros through shares with a value of £2.1m (2015: £2.2m). If the Sterling rates with either of these foreign 
currencies had strengthened / weakened by 10%, the profit before tax for the year would decrease / increase by £0.2m 
(2015: £0.2m).
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to pay amounts in full when due in accordance with the term of 
the contract, causing the Group to incur a financial loss.
Key areas where the Group is exposed to credit risk are:
• Credit instruments held within the investment portfolio;
• Other amounts due from investment counterparties;
• Reinsurers’ share of insurance contract liabilities;
• Amounts due from reinsurers in respect of claims already paid;
• Amounts due from policyholders; 
• Subrogation and salvage recoveries; and
• Amounts due from claims suppliers.
Reinsurance is used to manage insurance risk. This does not, however, discharge the Group’s liability as primary insurer. 
If a reinsurer fails to pay a claim, the Group remains liable for the payment to the policyholder.
The creditworthiness of reinsurers is considered on an annual basis by reviewing their financial strength prior to 
finalisation of any contract. In addition, management assesses the creditworthiness of all reinsurers by reviewing credit 
grades provided by rating agencies and other publicly available financial information. An analysis of the credit grade of the 
Group’s 10 largest exposures to reinsurers by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and A.M. Best ratings is produced and reviewed on 
a monthly basis. The minimum credit rating that the Group requires for participation in its reinsurance programmes is 
Standard & Poor’s A- or the A.M. Best equivalent.
The Group manages the levels of investment counterparty credit risk it accepts by placing limits on its exposure to a 
single counterparty, or groups of counterparties, and on geographical counterparties and geographical segments. Such 
risks are subject to regular review by the Investment Management Committee.
Investments bearing credit risk, and cash and cash equivalents, are summarised below, together with an analysis by 
credit rating as at the reporting date:

Investments bearing credit risk and cash and cash equivalents 822.0 718.7
For a widening of 100 basis points in credit spreads across the entire credit quality curve the profit before tax for the 
period would decrease by £5.0m (2015: £7.3m), reflecting the reduction in fair value on assets designated as FVTPL and 
the impact on equity would be a decrease by £7.4m (2015: £7.3m).
Shares and other variable yield securities and units in unit trusts do not bear credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents are  
‘A’ rated.
The analysis by credit rating illustrates a slight deterioration in credit quality over the period under review, with a higher 
proportion of assets rated ‘BBB’ or below in 2016 compared to 2015 (19% in 2016; 16% in 2015), however, diversification 
has increased.

19.3. Financial risk management objectives continued
Insurance receivables due from policyholders and other debtors are not subject to credit rating and are not included in 
the table above. Owing to the high number of individual policyholders through which the Group has minimal individual 
exposure, the overall risk of default to the Group is considered to be insignificant. The Group regularly reviews the ageing 
and individual characteristics of the counterparties of insurance receivables and other debtors to manage credit risk and 
to ensure that impairments are made where necessary. No credit limits were exceeded during the year, and no significant 
financial assets are past due but not impaired at the reporting date.
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group, although solvent, either does not have available sufficient financial resources to 
enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost. The primary liquidity risk of 
the Group is the obligation to pay claims to policyholders as they fall due. Liquidity risk is minimal due to the liquid nature 
of the Group’s investments and the nature of the business, which is such that material liabilities are driven by claims 
costs, which have a significant lead time from notification to payment.
In order to mitigate liquidity risk, the maturity of the technical liabilities is determined by means of projecting expected 
cash flows using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. Asset allocation decisions made by the Investment 
Management Committee give due consideration to the maturity and profile of liabilities to ensure that the maturity of 
assets is equal to or shorter than the maturity of liabilities.
During the year the Investment Management Committee agreed that in order to better match the liquidity needs of the 
Group some assets would be held as available for sale and accounted for accordingly.
The following table analyses the contractual maturity of the Group’s financial assets and salvage and subrogation assets 
(excluding shares and other variable-yield securities and units in unit trusts) and financial / insurance liabilities (plus social 
security and other taxes which are not financial liabilities). Salvage and subrogation assets, reinsurers’ share of outstanding 
claims and claims outstanding are presented at their carrying amount and their maturities are based on the expected dates 
on which the claims will be settled. Social security and other taxation liabilities are presented at their carrying amount and 
their maturities are based on the dates at which they are expected to be settled.
The table also indicates the expected timings of cash flows relating to the unearned premium reserve.
The analysis of non derivative financial liabilities and assets is based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to 
the contractual maturity date.

(d) Capital management and regulation
The Group maintains a capital structure consistent with the Group’s risk profile and the regulatory market requirements 
of its business. The Group’s objectives in managing its capital are:
• to match the profile of its assets and liabilities, taking account of the risk inherent in the business;
• to satisfy the requirements of its policyholders and regulators;
• to maintain financial and capital strength to support growth; and
• to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and access to a range of capital markets.
Solvency II is the new solvency framework implemented on 1 January 2016 as the capital adequacy regime for the 
European insurance industry. It establishes a set of EU-wide capital requirements and risk management standards with 
the aim of increasing protection for policyholders. The Group is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (‘PRA’) 
on both a Group basis and, for the Group’s sole underwriter, esure Insurance Limited, on a solo basis.
The Board has considered the risk appetite of the Group as part of the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment process under 
Solvency II. The Board believe an appropriate level of capital coverage of its Solvency Capital Requirement (‘SCR’) to be 
in the region of 130%–150%. The capital surplus above the SCR provides sufficient headroom to absorb adverse capital 
events and should enable the Group to continue to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
The Group’s dividend policy is to target a base dividend of 50% of underlying profit after tax and enhance the base 
dividend with a further special dividend, if the Group has sufficient capital and distributable reserves, after allowing 
for an appropriate level of capital coverage of the Group’s SCR and future growth opportunities. The Board remains 
committed to returning excess capital to shareholders where it does not believe it can utilise retained capital for 
further profitable growth.
Refer to page 21 for further information about the Group’s draft and unaudited 31 December 2016 Solvency II 
capital position.
(e) Fair value estimation
In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement financial instruments reported at fair value and revalued properties 
have been categorised into a fair value measurement hierarchy as follows:
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities – (Level 1)
Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets. An active market is a 
market in which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an 
ongoing basis.

107 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
19. Financial assets and liabilities continued
19.3. Financial risk management objectives continued
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as 
prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) – (Level 2).
Fair value measurements that are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, if all significant inputs 
required to fair value an instrument are observable, would result in the instrument being included in Level 2. The majority 
of assets classified as Level 2 are over-the-counter corporate bonds, where trades are less frequent owing to the nature of 
the assets. Inputs used in pricing the Group’s level 2 assets include:
• quoted prices for similar (i.e. not identical) assets in active markets;
• quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price 
quotations vary among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly;
• inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation; and
• for forward exchange contracts, the use of observable forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date, with the 
resulting value discounted back to present value.
The Group’s policy, should there be a change to the valuation techniques or level of activity in the market in which that 
asset is traded, is to transfer the asset between levels, effective from the beginning of the reporting period. In line with 
the requirements of IFRS – 13 Fair Value Measurement, the Group classifies all debt securities as Level 2 assets with the 
exception of Government backed securities which are classified as Level 1 unless they are illiquid.
There have been no changes in respect of the categorisation of debt securities between Levels 1 and 2 during the period 
(2015: £nil).
 
Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) – (Level 3)
Unobservable inputs have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby 
allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date (or market 
information for the inputs to any valuation models). As such, unobservable inputs reflect assumptions about the inputs 
that market participants would use in pricing the asset.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. 
The Group held Level 3 AFS financial assets of £3.2m as at 31 December 2016 (2015: £2.4m), representing an investment 
in an unquoted equity investment which has been valued using a discounted cash flow valuation model.
Under IFRS 13, land and buildings with a carrying value of £12.9m (2015: £12.9m) are classified as Level 3 assets. 
Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers annually, 
all with recent relevant experience. These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS 
Valuation Standards in the UK (‘Red Book’). The valuer’s opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable 
recent market transactions on arm’s length terms. No sensitivity analysis has been performed due to the nature of 
the valuation.

20. Reinsurance assets and insurance contract liabilities
20.1. Insurance Risk
Insurance risk arises from the inherent uncertainties as to the occurrence, amount and timing of insured events. These 
would include significant weather related events and personal injury claims. The Board is responsible for setting the overall 
underwriting strategy and defining the Risk Appetite, with monitoring delegated to the Pricing Committee. The Group uses 
excess of loss reinsurance contracts to mitigate insurance risk, essentially by reducing exposure to large individual claims or 
aggregated losses from single events.
Underwriting and pricing risk
The Group underwrites general insurance business for private cars and homes in mainland Britain and the associated 
additional insurance products. The book consists of a large number of individual policies spread across the whole geographic 
area which helps to minimise concentration risk especially in terms of weather-related risks. As well as pricing the Group has 
additional controls in place to segment the market and target those segments it wishes to underwrite. Further systems and 
controls are in place to mitigate application fraud risk.
The Group has systems and management information in place to continually monitor underwriting performance and 
pricing adequacy through the Pricing Committee.
Claims management risk
The Group employs a variety of strategies to ensure the correct claims are paid in a timely manner and reserve provisions 
made on a case by case basis to reflect the Group’s future liabilities.
These include:
• UK based claims centres, with over 600 specialists; well resourced and expertly trained staff benefit from image 
and workflow technology to control paper flow and procedures to enhance efficiency and effectiveness;
• its own network of motor repairers and dedicated teams offering an extensive range of services directly to ‘not at fault’ 
third parties to efficiently control credit hire cost and legal fees. Over 90% of accidental damage claims are settled 
through the repair network; and
• comprehensive anti-fraud strategies are in place to check both fraudulent claims and new business applications.
Reinsurance
The Group purchases reinsurance as a risk transfer mechanism to mitigate risks that are outside the Group’s appetite 
for individual claim or event exposure and to reduce the volatility caused by large individual and accumulation losses. 
By doing so the Group protects its capital and the underwriting result of each line of business.
Currently the Group has in place non-proportional excess of loss reinsurance programmes for its Motor and Home 
underwriting activities. The purpose of these programmes is to provide cover for both individual large losses, for Motor 
and Home, and accumulation losses arising from natural and other catastrophe events for Home. Motor reinsurance 
treaties are in place covering all years in which the Group has underwritten Motor policies.
The Group’s reinsurance programmes are reviewed on an annual basis and capital modelling is used to identify the most 
appropriate structure and risk retention profile, taking into account the Group’s business objective of minimising volatility 
and the prevailing cost and availability of reinsurance in the market.
Counterparty credit risk is a key consideration when the Group enters into reinsurance treaties. See note 19.3 (b) for 
more detail.

20.1. Insurance Risk continued
Reserving risk
Reserving risk is defined as the uncertainty regarding either the current level of reserves or the payment distribution 
over their lifetime. The Group analyses and projects historical claims development data and uses a number of actuarial 
techniques to both test and forecast claims provisions. In addition the Group also provides data to external actuaries who 
assess the adequacy of the Group’s claims provisions.
Apart from historical analyses the Group also takes into account changes in risk profile and underwriting policy conditions, 
changes in legislation or regulation and changes in other external factors.
The ultimate costs and expenses of the claims for which these reserves are held are subject to a number of material 
uncertainties. As time passes between the reporting of a claim and the final settlement of the claim, circumstances can 
change that may require established reserves to be adjusted either upwards or downwards. Factors such as changes in 
the legal environment, results of litigation, propensity of personal injury claims, changes in medical and care costs, and 
costs of vehicle and home repairs can all substantially impact overall costs and expenses of claims, and cause a material 
divergence from the bases and assumptions on which the reserves were calculated.
Claims subject to periodic payment orders (‘PPOs’) are an area of uncertainty relating to the claims provision at 
31 December 2016. For known PPOs and claims which have been identified as potential PPO awards, cash flow projections 
are carried out in order to estimate an ultimate cost on a gross and net of reinsurance basis. The cash flow projections are 
undertaken on a discounted basis. The total net claims provision recognised for PPOs and potential PPOs in the consolidated 
statement of financial position represents less than 5% of net claims outstanding at 31 December 2016. In the context of 
the Group’s approach to the mitigation and management of underwriting risk, its reinsurance programme (including its 
approach to mitigating counterparty credit risk) and the Group’s prudent approach to reserving for potential PPOs, the risk 
of an adverse development of the Group’s reserves for PPO claims is not considered to be significant.
In addition, the Ministry of Justice has reviewed the discount rate used in the calculation of damage awards in 
bodily injury claims and in February 2017 made an announcement reducing the rate from plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%. 
See note 31 for further discussion of the effect on the Group.
The Group’s policy is to hold sufficient provisions, including those to cover claims which have been incurred but not 
reported (‘IBNR’) to meet all liabilities as they fall due. Apart from that part of the provisions relating to PPOs, claims 
provisions are not discounted. The Directors remain satisfied that the outstanding claims reserves included in these 
financial statements provide an appropriate margin over projected ultimate claims costs.

Insurance payables and accrued expenses principally comprise amounts outstanding for suppliers and ongoing costs. 
The average credit period taken for invoiced trade purchases is 21.7 days (2015: 15.9 days). The Directors consider that 
the carrying amount of insurance and other payables approximates their fair value. All insurance and other payables are 
expected to be settled within one year aside from Government grants.
Included within deferred income is £0.2m in Government grants (2015: £0.4m). This is recognised as income over 
the period necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Scottish 
Executive Grants have been received by the Group based on two factors: expenditure on fixed assets and the creation of 
new jobs. In order for the Group to avoid repayment of the grants received, the new jobs created in order to meet the 
grant conditions must remain in existence for a period of at least five years.

27. Share-based payments
The Group has a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. An award will not be granted under the 
executive plans if it would cause the number of shares allocated in the ten calendar year period following flotation to 
exceed 5% of the ordinary share capital in issue at that time. Similarly, an award will not be granted under the employee 
plans if it would cause the number of shares allocated in the ten calendar year period following flotation to exceed 10% 
of the Ordinary Share capital in issue at that time. Holders of these awards (other than the three year and five year SAYE 
schemes) will receive dividend equivalents in respect of the dividends that would have been paid between grant date 
and vesting date for Ordinary Shares which vest under their awards, calculated on a basis and paid in a manner to be 
determined by the Remuneration Committee before the awards vest. Details of the share-based compensation plans 
and their financial effect are set out below.
(a) Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and the Strategic Leadership Plan (‘SLP’) are discretionary share plans for the 
Group’s Executive and Senior Management. Awards have been made under the PSP and SLP plan as follows:

Stuart Vann 571,807 321,155 338,926
Darren Ogden 322,970 275,275 189,594
Senior Management 1,318,574 1,440,107 1,211,351
Under the schemes, the shares vest at the end of a three year period dependent upon continued employment by the 
Group and achieving predefined performance conditions associated with the Group’s earnings per share (‘EPS’) and 
total shareholder return (‘TSR’). For the 2014 and 2015 Directors’ schemes, two-thirds of each award are based on EPS 
performance and one-third on TSR performance (with the two measures applying independently to different parts of 
each award). For the 2015 Senior Management scheme, 50% of the awards are subject to the EPS and TSR performance 
conditions (i.e. one-third and one-sixth respectively) and 50% of the awards are subject only to continued employment until 
vesting. For the 2016 Scheme 75% of the Awards are subject to an absolute TSR performance condition with the remaining 
25% of the Awards subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
Further information on the share-based payments, including the performance conditions and changes in the year is 
provided in the Directors’ remuneration report.

Valuation of SLP awards
As part of the awards are subject to a share-price related (‘TSR’) performance condition, the fair value of these awards 
was estimated using a Stochastic (Monte-Carlo) model.
The remaining awards are not subject to a share-price related performance condition (‘EPS’) and the fair value of the 
awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
The inputs into the models were:
2016 SLP 
awards
Share price at grant £2.56
Exercise price Nil
Volatility % p.a. (calculated on a weekly basis over a historical period in line with the expected term of the 
awards at the date of grant) 30.8%
Dividend yield % p.a. Nil
Risk-free rate % 0.41%
Expected life 3 years
The inputs were later adjusted as appropriate for those awards granted to employees upon joining the Group. The total 
estimated fair value of the 2016 SLP options at the dates of grant was £1.8m (2015 PSP awards: £3.8m; 2014 PSP awards: 
£3.6m). Refer to the Group’s 2015 and 2014 annual reports for the inputs to the models associated with the 2015 and 
2014 awards.
2014 senior management awards in addition to the PSP
During the year ended 31 December 2014, in addition to the PSP awards disclosed above, a new senior management hire 
was granted 171,621 shares without performance conditions with an estimated fair value of £2.22 at the date of grant. 
46% of these awards vested on 29 May 2015 when the share price was £2.59, 37% vested on 31 May 2016 when the 
share price was £2.84 and the remainder will vest on 31 May 2017 dependent upon continued employment by the Group. 
The Remuneration Committee made the awards to compensate for remuneration that was forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer.
(b) Restructuring Award Plan (‘RAP’)
RAP awards were made to Directors and senior management during 2016. The purpose of the RAP is to compensate for the 
significant opportunity lost under outstanding unvested incentive arrangements at the point of the Demerger as a result of 
any reduced market value of an esure Group plc share and the reduced size of the Group following the Demerger, as well as 
to reward selected employees of the Group with share-based awards in recognition of the strategic development of the 
Gocompare.com business since its acquisition and for the successful completion of the Demerger and Admission.
Where share awards preserve, rather than enhance the benefit to the award holders, an expense is not recognised for 
that element of the award. The RAP awards totalled £4.0m, of which £2.2m is being recognised as an expense over the 
12 month vesting period, the remaining £1.8m not being recognised.

Valuation of RAP awards
As the awards are not subject to external performance conditions the fair value of the awards was estimated using a 
Black-Scholes valuation model.
The inputs into the models were:
RAP Awards
Share price at grant £1.9292
Exercise price £nil
Expected life 1 year
Long Service awards
These awards were made to eligible employees who did not already own shares in the Group and had been employed by 
the Group for more than two years at the point of the Group’s Admission to the London Stock Exchange. The award levels 
were determined by length of service
The details of the award are set out below:

Contractual life 3 years
Vesting conditions Continuing employment or leavers under certain circumstances
The awards had no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment 
with the Group for three years and shall not be subject to clawback.
The estimated fair value of the Long Service awards at grant date was £4.1m. The estimated fair value of each award was 
based upon the share price of Ordinary Shares at grant date of £2.96.
(c) Save As You Earn (“SAYE”) schemes
The Group has a three year SAYE scheme and a five year SAYE scheme. Under the 2016 scheme employees are offered 
the opportunity to save between £5 and £500 each month in order to purchase shares in either three or five years time at 
an exercise price at a 20% discount on the share price at the date before invitations were issued to participate.

Valuation of SAYE awards
The fair values of the awards were estimated using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The inputs into the models used to 
value the 2016 awards were:
Scheme 3 year SAYE 5 year SAYE
Share price at grant £2.018 £2.018
Exercise price £1.5972 £1.5972
Volatility % p.a. 28.2% 30.0%
Dividend yield % p.a. 2.80% 2.80%
Risk-free rate % 0.32% 0.67%
Expected life (years) 3.33 5.33
For the three year scheme the volatility has been based on the daily historical volatility of the Group over a period 
commensurate with the expected term. For the five year scheme, as the Group listed in 2013, there is insufficient share 
price data to measure the historical volatility over the expected term. The historic volatility has therefore been calculated 
for the longest period for which trading activity is available with the historical volatility of similar entities following a 
comparable period in their lives being used to extend this period to the expected term.
The estimated fair value of the 2016 SAYE options at the date of grant was £0.1m (2015: £0.3m, 2014: £0.3m, 2013: 
£0.4m). Refer to the Group’s 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual reports for the inputs to the models associated with the 2015, 
2014 and 2013 awards.
(d) Financial effect of share-based payments made
The total expense recognised for the year arising from the share-based payments above was £2.4m (2015: £2.2m). 
All share based payment transactions were accounted for as equity-settled.
28. Commitments

Parent Company statement of changes in equity Strategic Report Governance Financials
125 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
1. Basis of preparation of financial statements
esure Group plc (the ‘Company’ or the ‘Parent Company’) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (‘FRS 101’).
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements 
of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, but makes amendments where necessary in order 
to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has 
been taken.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering the appropriateness of this 
assumption, the Board has reviewed the company’s projections for the next twelve months and beyond, including cash 
flow forecasts. The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for at least the next 12 months. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented.
The Parent Company audit fee is not disclosed in these financial statements as it is disclosed in the consolidated financial 
statements of esure Group plc (note 11).
2. Parent Company accounting policies
In these financial statements, the Company has not provided the following disclosures and will continue to take the 
exemptions available under FRS 101 in future years subject to no objection being raised by a shareholder:
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;
• Disclosures in respect of capital management;
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs;
• The disclosures required by IFRS 7 and IFRS13 regarding financial instruments; and
• Disclosures in respect of key management personnel required by IAS 24.
As the consolidated financial statements of esure Group plc include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has not 
provided the following disclosures and will continue to take the exemptions available under FRS 101 in future years 
subject to no objection being raised by a shareholder:
• The disclosures required by IAS 1 regarding movements in share capital;
• IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of Group settled share based payments (see note 27 of the consolidated 
financial statements); and
• The disclosures required by IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 regarding financial instrument disclosures.
The disclosures are available on written request to the esure Group plc address provided on page 81.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the financial statements:
Income from investments in Group undertakings
Income from investments in Group undertakings comprises dividend income. Dividends are recognised when the right to 
receive payment is established.
Taxation
The accounting policies applied to current and deferred tax are consistent with those disclosed in note 2 of the 
consolidated financial statements. No deferred tax arose in the year ended 31 December 2016 or the year ended

Investments in Group undertakings

Group plc above at note 26. Full details of dividends declared during the year are included in the consolidated financial 
statements of esure Group plc above at note 15.
8. Demerger of Gocompare.com plc
Full details of the demerger of Gocompare.com plc are included in the consolidated financial statements of esure Group 
plc above at note 12. As the cost of the investment in the Company accounts was £98.9m (based on the cost at which the 
investment was held in esure Services Limited) the non–cash gain seen on demerger under IFRIC 17 was £202.9m.
9. Dividends
The Directors have become aware of certain technical issues in respect of the Company’s procedures for the payment of 
the final cash dividend of 7.3 pence per share paid on 20 May 2016 and the interim cash dividend of 3.0 pence per share 
paid on 21 October 2016 (the ‘Relevant Distributions’).
The Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’) provides that a public company may pay a dividend out of its distributable profits as 
shown in the last accounts circulated to members, or if such accounts do not show sufficient distributable profits, more 
recent interim accounts which show sufficient distributable profits. Such interim accounts are also required to be filed at 
Companies House. At all relevant times the Company has had sufficient profits and other distributable reserves to justify 
the Relevant Distributions. However, the Company did not satisfy certain procedural requirements of the Act before 
making the Relevant Distributions, as follows:
(a) the Company did not deliver relevant interim accounts to Companies House before making the Relevant Distribution in 
May 2016; and
(b) the Board made its decision to make the Relevant Distribution in October 2016 based on information which did not meet 
the requirements for relevant interim accounts under the Act.
In each case this constituted a procedural breach of section 838 of the Act. Therefore, regrettably, the Relevant 
Distributions were made otherwise than fully in accordance with the Act. No fines or other penalties have been incurred by 
the Company.
At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 May 2017, a resolution will be proposed which authorises the appropriation 
of distributable reserves to the payment of the Relevant Distributions and puts all potentially affected parties in the 
position in which they were intended to be had the Relevant Distributions been made in accordance with the procedural 
requirements of the Act. This resolution constitutes a related party transaction under IAS24 and under the Listing Rules.
The Company has put in place new procedures relating to all distributions which will ensure that relevant legal 
requirements are complied with at all times. These procedures have been subject to external legal review and will be 
regularly re–assessed to ensure they remain appropriate.
This matter has no bearing on the financial strength of the Group. 128 esure Group plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016

Shareholder security
Shareholders may receive unsolicited and suspicious phone calls from ‘brokers’ offering to buy their shares at a price 
far in excess of their market value. We believe this may be a scam, commonly referred to as a ‘boiler room’. The callers 
obtain your details from publicly available sources of information.
Shareholders are cautioned to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount, or to sell your 
shares at a premium. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!

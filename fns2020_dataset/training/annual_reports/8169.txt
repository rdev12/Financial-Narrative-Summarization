chairman’s statement
Keith Tozzi
 “ The turnaround 
of Inspectorate 
has continued on 
track, with trading 
particularly strong 
throughout 2006.”
I am delighted to report Inspicio’s financial results for its first full year of 
operations. It has been a very busy period in which the turnaround of 
Inspectorate has continued on track and the Group made significant 
strategic acquisitions of the Environmental Services Group (“ESG”) in May 
and the Eclipse Scientific Group (“Eclipse”) in August which have added to 
the depth and strength of Inspicio’s global offering. We are very pleased 
with both these acquisitions. Their results have been strong and their 
integration into the Group has progressed well.
Turnover for the Group for the 12 months to 31 December 2006 was 
£161.9m (2005: £26.2m) and earnings, including income from joint 
ventures, before exceptional items, amortisation, interest and tax were 
£7.6m, compared to a loss of £0.5m in the 38 weeks to 31 December 2005. 
Group profit before interest and tax was £3.2m (2005: loss of £4.3m).
In Inspectorate, trading has been particularly strong throughout 2006. 
Inspectorate’s principal operational focus is in the commodity testing and 
inspection sector and the Company enjoys a strong brand and reputation 
for excellent client service. As a result, Inspectorate’s revenue growth for 
the 12 months to 31 December 2006 was 16.9 per cent at constant exchange 
rates. Operating profit before exceptional items was £5.2m at a margin 
of 4.1 per cent. This compares to a loss of £0.6m in the 12 months to 
31 December 2005 on a pro forma basis. Inspectorate is on track to 
achieve 8 per cent operating margins in the second half of 2007.
On 2 May 2006 Inspicio acquired ESG for £16.0m. ESG includes several 
businesses in the soil, environmental and building testing sector providing 
laboratory-based testing and consulting services. On 11 August 2006, the 
Group acquired Eclipse, the leading UK food testing business, for £47.0m. 
Both groups have traded well since their acquisition. 
“ The Group made 
significant strategic 
acquisitions of ESG 
in May and Eclipse 
in August.”
_0_ins_front_ar06.indd   3 24/05/2007   15:09:55 03
Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
“ The market continues 
to be driven by 
increased regulation, 
high barriers to 
entry and growing 
world trade.”
“ With our global 
infrastructure, Inspicio 
is very well positioned 
to expand all areas 
of its businesses.”
In addition to ESG and Eclipse, the Group also completed several small  
in-fill acquisitions, the total consideration for which was £4.9m (including 
expected deferred payments), which added £1.1m of turnover in 2006.
The Group’s strategy includes the buying out of minority interests and 
agents in the Inspectorate network, thus strengthening our control over 
the use of the Group’s brand as well as over the testing and inspection 
processes and standards. During 2006 a majority stake was acquired in 
our Libyan agent and the minority interest in Hungary was acquired 
outright. Inspectorate also acquired an agent in Portugal and expanded 
its Metals & Minerals capabilities in Australia through the acquisition of 
Renton Laboratory Pty Ltd (“Standard & Reference Laboratories”).
Two small in-fill acquisitions were also completed in Eclipse following 
its acquisition by Inspicio, which strengthened its service offerings and 
geographic food testing capabilities. 
The market continues to be driven by increased regulation, high barriers 
to entry and growing world trade. With our global infrastructure, Inspicio 
is very well positioned to expand all areas of its businesses and to capitalise 
on the strength of underlying demand for its services. We are delighted 
with progress to date and are confident of future prospects.
I would like to congratulate the rest of the management team for the success 
that we have achieved this year and to offer my continued thanks to each 
staff member for their commitment and dedication over the past year.

_0_ins_front_ar06.indd   4 24/05/2007   15:09:56 The results for the year to 31 December 2006 include 12 months of 
Inspectorate, eight months of ESG and 20 weeks of Eclipse. The comparative 
figures for the 38 week period ended 31 December 2005 include head 
office costs from the date of incorporation in April and the trading results 
of Inspectorate from its acquisition on 13 October 2005. 
Inspectorate 
Inspectorate’s results for 2006 were strong in both sales and margin 
improvement. Compared to the pro forma results for the 12 months 
to 31 December 2005, sales grew 15.3 per cent, or 16.9 per cent at 
comparable exchange rates (note 36). Excluding acquisitions, sales growth 
was 14.3 per cent. In the Oil & Petroleum business, an active trading market 
generated robust revenues in trader, blending and refining activities. In the 
Metals & Minerals business, high gold and other precious metal prices 
increased analysis requirements and encouraged significant mining and 
geochemical exploration. 
The operating margin improved from a pro forma loss (0.6 per cent) 
in 2005 to 4.1 per cent in 2006. This was achieved by reducing costs, 
undertaking a larger proportion of higher margin testing work, a more 
advantageous pricing regime, and the focus of management on financial 
targets in a decentralised structure. Inspectorate is on track to achieve 
the margin target of 8 per cent in the second half of 2007 as outlined 
by Inspicio’s management on its acquisition in October 2005.
Americas
The Americas generated revenue of £62.2m, representing 49.3 per cent of 
Inspectorate’s revenue and growth of 16.2 per cent over pro forma 2005. 
The US Oil & Petroleum division continued to be the largest revenue generator 
in this region. Demand for testing of biodiesel grew during the year to 
support increased biodiesel blending. Although biodiesel is a relatively 
small part of current revenues, Inspectorate has focused on gaining a lead 
position in this area and, as a result, has won several contracts in the Houston, 
New York, T ampa, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle markets.
Ultra Low Sulphur legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of the year 
increased the demand for testing of sulphur levels in diesel oil and ten 
laboratories have been equipped with new low level sulphur detectors.

“ New premises 
in Los Angeles 
doubled capacity 
in the year and 
attracted significant 
testing business.”
“ The US Oil & 
Petroleum division 
continued to be 
the largest revenue 
generator in the 
Americas region.”
New premises in Los Angeles doubled capacity in the year and attracted 
significant testing business as a result. A new division, servicing the liquefied 
natural gas sector, was set up in the year and a new contract with a major 
US pipeline operator was won to perform outsourced testing in the Gulf 
Coast and Eastern Seaboard. 
In South America, revenues increased across a variety of platforms. New 
laboratory facilities were built in Venezuela which enabled the business to 
expand into water testing and, in Argentina, revenues were boosted with 
a contract to test air, noise and water for a major mining consortium. The 
Colombian operation had a successful year following improvements to its 
service capabilities especially in the coal sector. Our minerals laboratory in 
Mexico was also expanded in response to growth in the geochemicals market. 
Asia
Asia generated £11.4m of revenue representing 9.1 per cent of Inspectorate’s 
revenue and growth of 34.2 per cent over pro forma 2005. 
Growth in this region has principally been driven by strong demand in 
China, India and Singapore. Penetration into the Chinese market continues 
to be successful, especially within our coal and coke business and we are 
developing plans to continue expanding Inspectorate’s laboratory capabilities. 
Our laboratory facilities in Singapore have been enhanced and now include 
full biodiesel testing capabilities. Singapore has also benefited from outsourced 
work from the Government of Singapore and services a high proportion 
of its petroleum blending activities. 
The acquisition of Standard & Reference Laboratories in Australia has given 
the Group a stronger position in the Metals & Minerals geochemicals market 
and is being successfully integrated into the Group.
Europe, Middle East and Asia
The combined revenues of the EMEA region were £52.4m representing 
41.5 per cent of Inspectorate’s revenue and growth of 11.6 per cent 
year on year. 
In the UK, trading improved through the year in the Metals & Minerals 
business. Our Witham laboratory is internationally renowned, particularly 
for the testing of precious metals. Commodity trading activity was very 
buoyant in 2006 and the division was successful in winning back business 
previously lost. Sales increased 20.7 per cent. In the Oil & Petroleum 
division, laboratory testing increased after the Buncefield oil depot fire.
The Inspectorate network was expanded by the purchase of an agent in 
Portugal and a majority stake in our Libyan agent and the outright purchase 
of the minority interest in Hungary. Operations commenced in Ghana and 
laboratory capabilities were enhanced in Nigeria, India and Saudi Arabia.
In Eastern Europe, our Russian business recovered from unprecedented 
winter conditions at the beginning of the year to exceed management 
expectations over the whole year. The Baltic operations were restructured 
to encourage opportunities across the region while the Swiss co-ordination 
centre was reduced in size to return more autonomy to individual businesses. 
Inspectorate’s strong position in Oil & Petroleum and fertiliser inspections 
in Eastern Europe was further consolidated during the year.
Metals and Minerals
During the year, the Metals & Minerals division was reorganised into 
a more global structure. The new Reno laboratory facility was completed 
and is now fully functional. New preparatory laboratories were opened 
in Colombia and Mexico to increase efficiency of the flow of samples 
into the Reno and Peru facilities. The acquisition of Standard & Reference 
Laboratories and the continued success of Witham meant that our Metals 
& Minerals business had an encouraging year.
Inspectorate continues to be driven by strong commodity volume movements 
and the globalisation of world trade, as manufacturing and the production 
of goods continue to migrate to developing countries. We see outsourcing 
opportunities within the operation, and the strength of the Inspectorate 
brand and breadth of our network means that we believe we are well 
positioned for the foreseeable future.
Environmental Services Group
Inspicio acquired the Environmental Services Group (“ESG”) on 2 May 2006 
and therefore eight months of its results are included in the 2006 consolidated 
results. Sales for the period were £28.1m and operating profit including 
income from joint ventures was £1.9m, in line with our expectations.
In Soil Mechanics, ESG’s largest business and a recognised market leader 
in UK ground investigation, the market was extremely buoyant, driven by

“ Soil Mechanics’ 
market place is 
extremely buoyant, 
driven by infrastructure 
improvements in the 
UK and Ireland, house 
building projects and 
site development in 
preparation for the 
2012 Olympics.”
infrastructure improvements in the UK and Ireland (both road and rail), 
house building projects and the development of the Lower Lea Valley and 
Thames Gateway in preparation for the 2012 Olympics. Soil Mechanics’ 
service capability has been expanded during the year to include materials 
testing (soil, rock and concrete) and by collaboration with research 
facilities, it established innovative in situ and laboratory techniques 
including geothermal and stress testing. In the latter part of the year plans 
were developed for Soil Mechanics to expand its geographical coverage in 
2007, leveraging Inspectorate’s global infrastructure with particular focus 
on the UAE and India.
TES Bretby, ESG’s second largest business, is one of the UK’s biggest 
testing laboratories and has performed encouragingly. The business tests 
a wide variety of products, including coal, minerals, soils and gases. 
It provides an extensive range of environmental monitoring services 
to the waste management sector such as landfill sites and also on-site 
monitoring of personnel and workplace exposure such as vibration, dust, 
noise and toxic substances.
The Group’s Environmental Chemistry testing capability was expanded in 
the second half of 2006 to increase sample volume throughputs to enable 
faster turnaround of analysed information. TES established new coal testing 
facilities at Immingham to service increased imports of coal, and initiatives 
are underway to capitalise on Inspectorate’s overseas network to expand 
TES’s coal testing services into the international market.
Registration of an ESG company in India was initiated at the end of 2006 to 
identify opportunities to provide environmental services to the Indian market. 
The establishment of a joint Inspectorate/ESG water hygiene service for the 
UAE was formulated in the second half of 2006 for implementation in 2007.
The loss making Global food testing division within ESG was closed during 
the second half of the year. Global’s losses included in the results for the 
year were approximately £0.5m.
Eclipse
Eclipse Scientific Group was acquired on 11 August 2006 and its performance 
from acquisition to 31 December 2006 has generated sales of £7.7m and 
operating profit of £1.7m, in line with management expectations.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Eclipse is the UK’s leading food testing business and has grown through 
a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. In addition to food 
testing, Eclipse also provides water and pharmaceutical testing services 
and has a laboratory supply company which has given the Group stronger 
purchasing power. 
The market in which Eclipse operates has seen good growth during the year 
and sample volumes have risen by around 25 per cent in 2006. Substantial 
investment is taking place in customer relationship management software 
to focus on improving the delivery of services to clients.
Eclipse has made two small acquisitions in the period since acquisition. 
The total consideration for these acquisitions was £0.4m. Promar was 
acquired in October 2006 and offers an opportunity to build on our strong 
relationships in the dairy sector, where test volumes have more than doubled 
in the year. Envirolab was purchased in December 2006 and has increased 
the national coverage the Group enjoys in Ireland. 
The Voelcker business within Eclipse was merged with CLA, our ESG 
environment consultancy, in the latter part of 2006, to provide integrated 
geotechnical and environmental consultancy services associated with 
assessment, utilisation and remediation of land.
The food testing market continues to be driven by increased regulation 
and food movements, boosted by one-off food scares. The trend to outsource 
food testing by the major food producers also represents an opportunity 
to increase sales and use laboratory assets more efficiently. Eclipse currently 
operates one outsourced laboratory and other opportunities to expand 
the Group’s capabilities in this area are being actively pursued. 
We are formulating plans to internationalise the Eclipse business either 
organically or by focused acquisition and intend to effect such plans in 2007.
Strategy 
The Board continues to believe that the fragmented inspection and testing 
market provides opportunities to consolidate inspection and testing businesses 
through acquisition and that, with the development of a global infrastructure, 
the Group can create value by exploiting these acquisition opportunities, 
integrating acquired businesses and implementing cost savings. 
Aside from these acquisition opportunities, there are a number of key 
underlying factors which the Directors believe will provide continued 
growth in the inspection and testing markets. These factors include 
regulatory and legislative changes driving the need for new and tougher 
testing regimes; buyers and sellers of goods and services seeking 
independent third party inspection; multi-national businesses requiring 
consistent inspection and testing services; commercialisation of 
performance conformity services; and globalisation of supply chains.
The Directors also believe that market factors, such as anticipated global trade 
and GDP growth, the increased propensity of businesses to outsource and 
significant barriers to entry, (such as complex regulation, the requirements 
of an international network and a established reputation) will provide 
opportunities for revenue growth amongst the major international providers 
of inspection and testing services.
The Board believes that the Company is successfully delivering on its strategy 
and will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as they arise.
Outlook
We are very pleased with the turnaround of Inspectorate and we remain 
on track to achieve the margin target of 8 per cent in the second half of 
2007, as anticipated at the time of the acquisition. 
We will continue to integrate the acquired businesses and leverage operational 
synergies and cross-selling opportunities. We will also continue to assess 
further acquisition opportunities as they arise, according to our stated strategy.
The drivers of our business remain strong. Trading in the early months of 
2007 has continued as expected. Despite some weakness of the US Dollar, 
we remain confident that Inspicio will continue to perform in line with 
management expectations in 2007.
I would like to thank the Board, management team and all of the employees 
for their outstanding contributions to a very successful year.

“ Inspectorate’s 
turnover grew by 
15.3 per cent at 
actual exchange rates 
and 16.9 per cent 
at comparable 
exchange rates.”
financial review
Richard McBride
Overview
Turnover for the 12 months to 31 December 2006 was £161.9m 
(2005: £26.2m). Of this, £125.0m was generated from continuing 
operations in Inspectorate, and £36.9m was generated from acquisitions, 
being £28.1m from ESG, £7.7m from Eclipse and £1.1m from the small 
in-fill acquisitions in Inspectorate.
Inspectorate’s turnover grew by 15.3 per cent at actual exchange rates 
and 16.9 per cent at comparable exchange rates. The main foreign currency 
affecting Inspectorate’s results is the US Dollar which weakened against 
Sterling from an average of US$1.82 in 2005 to US$1.84 in 2006. The year 
end rate against Sterling was US$1.96.
Earnings before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
(“EBITDA”) were £13.1m (2005: £0.9m note 36). After depreciation, 
EBITA was £8.3m (2005: nil) before charging £0.7m (2005: £0.1m) for 
share option charges. Profit before exceptional items, interest and tax 
was £4.7m (2005: loss £0.5m) and pre-tax profit after exceptionals 
was £0.5m (2005: loss £4.5m).
There were £1.5m of exceptional operating charges (2005: £3.8m) 
principally relating to corporate acquisition activity and the restructuring 
and laboratory closure costs, including the closure of the loss making 
Global food testing division in ESG and redundancy costs related to the 
acquisition of ESG. 
Turnover in Inspectorate was £126.1m (2005 pro forma: £109.3m note 36) 
and operating profit before exceptional items, fair value adjustments and 
transitional items was £5.2m (2005 pro forma loss: £0.6m) at an operating 
margin of 4.1 per cent. This was in line with management’s expectations 
at the time of the acquisition of Inspectorate in October 2005.
Interest and tax
Net interest charges before exceptional items amounted to £2.2m and 
were covered 5.9 times by EBITDA. £0.5m of bank arrangement fees for 
facilities arranged prior to the acquisition of Eclipse were written off as 
exceptional interest charges.
“ At the long run 
normalised tax rate 
of 35 per cent, the 
EPS was 4.4p.”

“ In the 12 month 
period to 
31 December 2006, 
there was an 
operating cash 
inflow of £13.2m 
(2005: outflow 
£5.6m).”
In the 12 months to 31 December 2006, tax has been charged at 60.5 per cent 
(before exceptional items, goodwill and share option charges) (2005: nil). 
This includes the accounting effect of offsetting post acquisition tax 
liabilities against deferred tax assets set up in the acquired balance sheets 
of ESG and Eclipse, rather than against losses included in other parts of 
the Group in the post acquisition period. This treatment has no impact on 
cash payments and excluding this effect, the tax rate was 43.5 per cent 
(before exceptional items, goodwill and share option charges). 
The tax rate is higher than the UK statutory rate of 30 per cent due to the 
mix of profits generated in higher rate tax jurisdictions, especially the US, 
and the effect of unrelieved losses principally in the UK. Initiatives are 
underway to reduce the Group’s effective tax rate. Management is targeting 
a medium-term Group tax rate of around 35 per cent (before amortisation 
of goodwill and share option charges). 
EPS
Basic and diluted loss per share for the 12 months to 31 December 2006 
was a loss of 4.5p (2005: loss 25.4p). Adjusted basic and diluted earnings 
per share (calculated on profit before amortisation of goodwill and exceptional 
items) were 1.8p (2005: loss 2.0p). At the long run normalised tax rate of 
35 per cent, the EPS was 4.4p.
Cash and financing
Net debt at 31 December 2006 was £37.8m compared to £3.4m at 
31 December 2005.
In the 12 month period to 31 December 2006, there was an operating 
cash inflow of £13.2m (2005: outflow £5.6m). Returns on investment and 
servicing of finance, including the cost of raising debt, represented a cash 
outflow of £3.1m (2005: £0.4m). Tax paid was £3.1m (2005: tax received 
£0.3m) and capital expenditure, net of disposals, was £5.1m (2005: £1.7m).
£58.8m was spent on acquisitions and investments (2005: £47.8m), net 
of £1.6m of cash acquired in the acquisitions (2005: £5.7m). Cash outflows 
on the acquisitions of ESG and Eclipse were £17.1m and £37.7m respectively. 
During the period, 33.3m shares were issued, raising £32.6m net of costs, 
and borrowings increased by £41.6m.
Dividends
In line with its stated strategy, the Board is not recommending a dividend 
for the 12 months to 31 December 2006. Group dividend policy remains 
under review and the Board will consider initiating a dividend payment 
when the circumstances of the business allow.
IFRS
As Inspicio is quoted on AIM, it is not required to adopt International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) until it reports its 2007 results. The 
attached results have therefore been prepared under UK GAAP . However, 
the Group has adopted early certain UK accounting standards which form 
part of the on-going process of convergence between UK GAAP and IFRS. 
In particular, under FRS 26’ derivative financial instruments’ have been 
measured at fair value.
Under FRS 20 (equivalent to IFRS 2), the share-based payment charge 
against operating profit included in the 12 months to 31 December 2006 
was £0.6m (2005: £0.1m).
The conversion to IFRS accounting standards is currently underway. The 
most significant change will be in the allocation of some of the Group’s 
goodwill to separate intangible assets which will be amortised over their 
useful economic lives. The remaining goodwill will be held on the balance 
sheet, subject to annual impairment tests rather than amortisation charges.

Group policy on payment of creditors
It is the Group’s policy to agree to the terms of payment with suppliers when entering into each transaction, and to abide by them. The creditor 
payment period at 31 December 2006 was 40.5 days (2005: 36.4 days).
Research and development
The Group does not undertake material research and development activities. 
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in the accounts.
Post balance sheet events
Post balance sheet events are disclosed in note 35 to the financial statements.
Financial risk management
Financial risk management is discussed in note 19 to the financial statements.
Employees
Inspicio seeks to involve its employees in its corporate objectives, plans and performance and in other relevant matters of interest to employees through 
various communication methods, including regular employee meetings and an employee newsletter. The Directors consider there to be a good relationship 
between employees and management. The Group is an equal opportunities employer and does not discriminate in the recruitment and promotion of 
staff, including applicants who are disabled. If an employee becomes disabled it is the policy, wherever practicable, to provide continued employment.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities for the Annual Report
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period, which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, 
the Directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable United Kingdom accounting standards have been followed; and
 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
All of the Directors have confirmed that there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and that they have taken 
all the steps (such as making enquiries of other Directors and the auditors and any other steps required by the Directors’ duty to exercise due care, skill 
and diligence) that they ought to have taken in their duty as a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. The Company notes that UK legislation governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial information may differ from that in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are willing to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
The Board recognises the importance of sound corporate governance and is committed to conducting the Company’s operations in accordance with 
the best principles of corporate governance in so far as appropriate for a company of Inspicio’s size quoted on the Alternative Investment Market 
(“AIM”). This report sets out the ways in which the principles of good governance and code of best practice identified in the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance are applied by the Company.
Directors
The Board currently comprises the non-executive Chairman, two executive Directors and three non-executive Directors. Two of the non-executive 
Directors, Chris Slack and Lesley James are considered to be independent.
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. Appropriate training, briefings, and induction are available to all directors on appointment and 
subsequently as necessary, taking into account existing qualifications and experience.
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association one third of the Directors are required to retire by rotation each year and may seek re-election 
at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and therefore each Director must stand for re-election at least once every three years. Accordingly Mark Silver 
and Keith Tozzi will retire by rotation and, being eligible, will seek re-election at the Annual General Meeting. Richard McBride was appointed as a 
Director on 27 June 2006, and in accordance with the Articles of Association is required to retire and seek election by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting. Lesley James was appointed as a non-executive Director on 1 November 2006, and in accordance with the Articles of Association 
is required to retire and seek election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
During 2006, the Board met ten times. At these meetings the Board reviewed and approved the Group’s strategy and financial plans for the coming 
year. Each Director is provided with sufficient information to enable them to consider matters in good time for meetings and enable them to discharge 
their duties properly. The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision.
The Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and they are able to seek independent and other professional advice, 
the cost of which would be met by the Company.
Board committees
The Company has established an audit committee and a remuneration committee to assist it in fulfilling its responsibilities, each having formally 
delegated duties and responsibilities.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises Chris Slack (Chairman) and Lesley James, both of whom are non-executive Directors, and Keith Tozzi, who is non-executive 
Chairman of the Company, and meets at least twice a year. No-one other than the audit committee’s Chairman and members is entitled to be present 
at a meeting of the audit committee but the Company’s external auditors together with the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Finance Director are 
regularly invited to attend the meetings. The audit committee has formal terms of reference approved by the Board.
The audit committee considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and control system of the Group. It reviews the scope and 
results of the external audit, its cost effectiveness and the objectivity of the auditors. It also reviews, prior to publication, the interim results, preliminary 
announcement, the annual financial statements and the other information included in the full Annual Report.
Nominations committee
Due to the size of the Board, the Directors do not consider there to be any need for a nominations committee. Issues that would normally be dealt with 
by a nominations committee are handled by the full Board. The Board will review the need for a nominations committee on a regular basis.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
Internal controls
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness whilst the role of management is to 
implement Board policies on risk management and control. It should be recognised that the Group’s system of internal control is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which has been in place during the year. 
This process has been reviewed by the Directors and accords with the internal control guidance prepared for directors by the Turnbull Committee.
The Group is further developing the risk management process, to embed it in normal management, and the governance process. As part of the annual 
strategic planning and budgeting process, each business unit identifies its significant risks, the probability of those risks occurring, their potential impact 
and the plans for managing and mitigating each of those risks. The budget plans will be reviewed by the Board as part of the strategic planning 
process. The plans are discussed, updated and reviewed during the course of the year, or when any control issues are identified, including matters 
arising from the external audit. As a part of a regular process, risks are highlighted and reported to the Board.
The Group operates a series of controls to meet its needs. These controls include, but are not limited to, the annual strategic planning and budgeting 
process, a clearly defined organisational structure with authorisation limits, reviews by senior management of monthly financial and operating 
information including comparisons with budgets, monthly treasury and cash flow reports and forecasts to the main Board and rules preventing 
speculation in derivatives.
The audit committee receives reports from management and the external auditors concerning the system of internal control and any material control 
weaknesses. Significant risk issues are referred to the Board for consideration.
When acquisitions are made, the Group’s controls are implemented during the first full year of ownership.
The Board obtains assurance directly from the Directors and appropriate senior management concerning compliance with the Group’s risk management 
and control policies and procedures, before making this statement. The Board also considers issues included in reports received during the year, how the 
risks have changed during the year and reviews reports on internal controls from management and any issues identified by external auditors. The Directors 
conduct an annual review of the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and risk management.
The Board does not believe it is currently appropriate to establish a separate, independent internal audit function given the size of the Group.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
This report sets out the Company’s policy and disclosures in relation to the Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Company has applied the principles of good corporate governance relating to the remuneration of its Directors and this report outlines how 
the Company has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code together with some of the guidelines issued by institutional bodies.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration (including bonuses) of executive Directors and the Company’s 
remuneration policy for certain other senior managers. The committee also determines all allocations of share options to executives and certain other 
senior management. To ensure that the Company’s remuneration practices are market competitive, the committee takes advice from various 
independent sources. The committee met seven times in the period. 
The remuneration committee comprises the following non-executive Directors:
Lesley James (Chairman);
Keith Tozzi;
Chris Slack; and
Mark Watts.
The Board determines the remuneration of the non-executive Directors including bonuses with the support of external professional advice if required. 
No Director participates in any discussion regarding his or her own remuneration. 
Policy on executive Directors’ remuneration
The policy of the Board is to provide executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain Directors of the calibre necessary to 
maintain the Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return. A significant proportion of executive 
Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration is structured to link rewards to both corporate and individual performance. 
There are three main elements in each executive Directors’ remuneration package:
 basic salary;
 annual bonus payments; and
 share option incentives.
All bonus payments are performance related. These elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of 
executive Directors and are designed to align their interests with those of shareholders and to give these Directors keen incentives to perform at the 
highest levels.
Basic annual salary
Each executive Director’s basic salary is reviewed annually by the committee. In deciding upon appropriate levels of remuneration the committee believes 
that the Company should offer average levels of base pay reflecting individual responsibilities compared to similar jobs in comparable companies. 
Annual bonus payments
The committee establishes the objectives which must be met for an annual cash bonus to be paid. Annual bonus payments are not pensionable.
Share option incentives 
The Company operates a number of employee share option schemes (note 26) and the committee has responsibility for supervising the schemes 
and the grant of share options under these schemes. 
Additional benefits
In addition to the above the executive Directors receive private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and life assurance cover. Pension provision 
is made at the rates of between 10 and 15 per cent of basic salary for executive Directors which is payable directly into a nominated pension fund.

Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior 
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial 
statements. The information given in the Directors’ Report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s 
Review and Financial Review that is cross referred from the Business Review section of the Directors’ Report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other 
information comprises only the Highlights, Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, the Financial Review, Directors and the Directors’ 
Report, the Corporate Governance Statement and the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of 
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with 
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state 
of the Group’s and the parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2006 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows for the year then ended;
 the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards. The Group has chosen to adopt FRS 23, ‘The effects of changes in 
foreign exchange rates’, FRS 24, ‘Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies’, FRS 25 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation’, 
and FRS 26, ‘Financial instruments: Measurement’ in these financial statements.
A summary of the Group accounting policies which have been reviewed by the Directors as required by FRS 18 ‘Accounting policies’ and applied 
consistently is set out below.
Consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 
31 December 2006. The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for acquisitions made by the Group during the year. All subsidiaries 
have been included in the Group financial statements using uniform accounting policies.
Turnover
Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents net amounts receivable from external customers for the value of services supplied.
Revenue is recognised when the test or inspection is complete. Amounts recoverable on contracts, which include attributable profit on contracts 
determined on the basis of measured work to the balance sheet date, are included in debtors. Deductions are made for net foreseeable losses and 
progress payments received.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales represents amounts paid for salaries and direct costs of running the laboratories around the Group, and amounts due to external third 
parties for inspection services directly related to revenue.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”).
Transactions denominated in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are translated into the functional currency at spot rates. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year end, are taken to the profit and loss account.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency. Profits and losses of subsidiary 
undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year. The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in 
Sterling at year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of overseas subsidiary undertakings are recorded as a movement 
in reserves, and are reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate.
Financial instruments – derivatives
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivatives used include forward currency contracts, currency 
options and barriers and interest rate caps.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the 
profit and loss account.
Debt instruments
Debt instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Issue costs are amortised over the period of the debt instrument using 
the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Bad debt allowance
Trade debtors are assessed individually for impairment. Movements in the allowance for bad debts are recorded in the profit and loss account.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1. Accounting policies continued
Finance and operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leasing agreements that transfer to the Group substantially 
all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright. The assets are included in fixed assets and 
the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases. The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and 
interest elements. The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit so as to give 
a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated 
over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Tangible fixed assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets is the purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition. The Group does not capitalise finance costs.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values, over the 
expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Freehold buildings 2 – 3.3%
Freehold and leasehold improvements  2 – 20% 
Plant and laboratory equipment 10 – 33%
Fixtures and fittings 10 – 33%
Computer equipment 20 – 33.3%
Motor vehicles 25 – 33.3%
Freehold land is not depreciated. Short leasehold assets are depreciated over the period of the lease.
The Group reviews these depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances. The principal factors that the Group takes into 
account are the expected rate of technological developments and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period which the Directors estimate that the values of the 
underlying businesses acquired are expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets, with a maximum period of 20 years. The Directors take into 
account the nature, age and stability of the industry in which the business operates.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment of fixed assets
Fixed assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs by comparing the carrying value with the post-tax realisable 
value of the asset being tested and its value in use. Value in use is calculated on the basis of future cash flows, using a discount rate appropriate to 
the Group.
Provisions
Provisions are made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably 
estimated. Where liabilities are expected to be discharged over a number of years, the provisions are discounted using an appropriate risk free rate.
In the case of claims against the Group, provisions are made on a case by case basis, with an additional amount allocated for claims incurred but 
not reported.
Pension costs
Pension costs for the Group’s money purchase pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account when the contributions become payable 
to the schemes.
Deferred and contingent consideration
In respect of acquisitions for which part of the purchase consideration is payable during future accounting periods, the full amount of the deferred 
consideration is recognised immediately, except in respect of acquisitions for which part of the purchase consideration is determined by the profits 
generated by the acquired Company during future accounting periods. In such cases the contingent consideration is included in the accounts based 
on the best estimates of future profitability at this time. Estimates are revised as further and more certain information becomes available. Goodwill 
and amounts to be paid are adjusted accordingly.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
1. Accounting policies continued
Stock
Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Consumables
Consumables are written off to cost of sales in the period in which they are purchased. 
Taxation
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, and any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is fully provided in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date. These are based on 
tax rates that are expected to apply at the time of the reversal, which will be the rates that have either been enacted, or substantially enacted, by 
the balance sheet date. No deferred tax is provided on permanent timing differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are 
regarded as more likely than not to be recoverable. Deferred tax on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries is only provided if dividends have been 
accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based instruments to certain employees and advisers. In accordance with FRS 20, ‘Share-based payments’, 
equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Fair value is normally measured by use of a binomial pricing model. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, 
based on the Group’s estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The share-based payments charge is included within administrative expenses as this is the category which includes the payroll costs of the 
relevant employees.
In the Company accounts, the granting of options to employees of subsidiaries and the granting of warrants for services performed in subsidiaries 
are deemed capital contributions.
Employer’s taxes on share options
Employer’s National Insurance in the UK and equivalent taxes in other jurisdictions are payable on the exercise of certain share options. In accordance 
with the provisions of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 ‘National Insurance Contributions on Share Options’, a provision is made based on the 
employer’s current National Insurance rate applied to the difference between the market value of the shares under option and the option exercise price 
at the balance sheet date where such liability has not been transferred to the employees. The provision is charged to the profit and loss account over 
the period in which the share options vest.
Employee share ownership plan
The Company’s Employee Benefits Trust (“EBT”) is a separately administered trust which will be funded by loans from the Company, the assets of which 
will comprise shares in the Company. The Company will recognise the assets and liabilities of the EBT in its own accounts and shares held by the trust 
will be recorded at cost as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
Related party transactions
FRS 8, ‘Related party disclosures’ permits groups to be exempt from disclosing transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group, 
where these transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation. The Group has taken advantage of this exemption.

8. Tax on profit/(loss) on ordinary activities continued
The tax charge on ordinary activities is driven by a combination of unrelieved Group losses, higher overseas tax rates and non-deductible items.
Taxation has been charged at the effective full year rate of 60.5 per cent (2005: nil) on profit before the amortisation of goodwill and share option charges.
The Group has potential deferred tax assets of £9.0m at 31 December 2006 (2005: £1.7m) in respect of Group tax losses, which have not been 
recognised due to uncertainty over their recoverability.
9. Loss for the financial year
The Company has taken advantage of Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, and has not included a profit and loss account in these financial 
statements. The loss attributable to the members of the parent Company is £1.7m (2005: £537,000).
10. Earnings per share
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year. The Group presents an adjusted earnings per share based on earnings excluding exceptional items and goodwill 
amortisation which the Directors believe aids the understanding of the Group’s trading performance.
For fully diluted EPS, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. 
The Group’s potentially dilutive securities consist of share options and warrants. As the Group is currently loss making on an unadjusted basis, none 
of the potentially dilutive securities are currently dilutive.
Details of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below:

The Company has no loans or finance leases.
As at 31 December 2006, the Group’s bank loans and finance lease obligations respectively comprised £47.8m (2005: £6.9m) secured loans and 
mortgages, £274,000 (2005: £225,000) unsecured loans and £329,000 (2005: £107,000) finance leases. The mortgage is secured against freehold 
property in Sweden. 
Bank loans are denominated in a number of currencies and bear interest based on LIBOR, or foreign equivalents plus a margin charged by the 
provider in the country in which the borrowing is incurred. Full details of the risk management strategy and interest rates applicable to the financial 
liabilities are shown in note 19.
The secured bank loans are secured by fixed charge and floating charges over the assets of certain Group companies.
The Group’s secured bank loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £585,000 (2005: £190,000). The Group incurred total issue costs of 
£1.0m (2005: £445,000) in respect of the five year committed revolving credit facility and the five year term loan facility entered into in July 2006 
under which amounts have been drawn down in part to fund the acquisition of Eclipse and in part to fund the Group’s ongoing activities. These costs 
together with the interest expense are allocated to the profit and loss account over the five year term of the facility on a sum of digits basis.

19. Financial instruments
a) Financial risk management
The principal aims of the Group’s financial risk management activities are to monitor and address the risks arising from the Group’s external and 
internal funding requirements, optimise net interest cost after tax and manage financial risk arising from the international business of the Group, 
principally interest rate and currency risk. 
Given the size of the Group, the Directors have not delegated the responsibility for monitoring financial risk management to a sub-committee 
of the Board. The policies set by the Board of Directors are implemented by the Group’s finance department.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s financial risk management activities in this area seek to achieve a balance between certainty of funding with committed facilities and a 
flexible, cost-effective structure. At 31 December 2006 the Group had bank facilities of £52.0m (2005: £20.0m) (of which £48.4m had been drawn 
down (2005: £7.0m)) and net cash of £10.7m (2005: £3.8m). The facilities comprise a £12.0m five year committed revolving credit facility and a 
£40.0m five year term facility loan. 
Of the total loans and facilities of £48.4m as at 31 December 2006 (2005: £7.2m), £48.2m are secured (2005: £7.0m), including £329,000 
(2005: £107,000) of finance leases and £63,000 (2005: £62,000) of secured mortgages.
Interest rate risk
The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities, with the main interest rate risk arising on the bank loan facilities drawn 
down. The Group has used an interest rate cap and floor to address this, which has the effect of capping the underlying base interest rate payable 
before paying a margin to the provider, on the first £16.1m of borrowing, at 5.75 per cent together with a floor of 4.60 per cent. The floating interest 
rate on the bank facility at 31 December 2006 was 5.19 per cent, and therefore the cap was not effective at that date. The Group has used a cap on 
its floating rate borrowing facilities as the most cost-effective means of hedging debt. The interest rate cap is settled on a quarterly basis, with the 
settlement amount being the difference between the capped and the floating interest rate amounts on the outstanding amount up to £16.1m.
The Group also holds an interest rate cap covering the first $15.0m of US$ borrowing which has the effect of capping the underlying base interest rate 
payable at 5.50 per cent before paying a margin to the provider. The interest rate cap is settled on a quarterly basis, with the settlement amount being the 
difference between the capped and the floating interest rate amounts on the outstanding amount up to $15.0m.
Currency risk
The Group operates internationally, giving rise to exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates between a number of currencies but, particularly 
to changes in the US Dollar and the Euro. 
The Group uses forward currency contracts or options to reduce the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. At 31 December 2006 the Group held 
simple currency options for the sale of US$8.4m for Sterling, at a US$/£ rate of 1.98 which expire between January and December 2007.
No financial instruments have been designated as accounting hedges.
In addition, the Group extended its foreign exchange options by a further US$9.6m at a US$/£ rate of 1.95 in January 2007.
Where possible the Group finances overseas investments through the use of foreign currency borrowings to hedge the foreign currency investment.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit related losses on financial instruments, in the event of non-performance by counterparties, but it does not expect any 
counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Group’s policy of selecting only counterparties with high credit ratings.
In territories such as emerging markets which may represent higher than usual concentrations of trading credit risk, instruments such as letters of 
credit are used.

Short term debtors, creditors, restricted cash and loan notes have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than currency risk disclosures 
as they are of a short term nature and therefore their fair value approximates to their book value.

In the case of long term bank loans, the fair value approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are subject to 
floating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year. For provisions the fair value approximates to the book value 
as they are expected to be utilised over a short period.
The fair value of short-term bank loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. 
The fair value of other short term payables and receivables equals their book value as this is the amount which would be payable if the asset had been 
realised or the liability had crystallised at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the simple currency options and the resettable forward has been determined based on the present value of the estimated future cash 
flows associated with the instruments. The fair value of the interest rate cap is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance 
sheet date.

26. Share options
The Company has three share option schemes and an Employee Benefit Trust Incentive Scheme for its employees and Directors. Options are normally 
granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option under 
these schemes is between three and seven years.
Options have been granted to key management, at the discretion of the Board.
Share options granted to employees and Directors at 31 December 2006 were as follows:

Marwyn Capital Ltd hold 990,000 warrants; the conditions for exercising these are as follows:
 495,000 vest after a period of three years (October 2008);
 247,500 vest after a period of three years and Inspicio achieves EBITA margin of 8 per cent in the published accounts; and
 247,500 vest after a period of three years and Inspicio achieves a positive EPS for two consecutive years.
The fair value of the share options was determined using a binomial option pricing model. Awards have been valued using an assumed exercise 
behaviour recognising the exercise restrictions. 
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the period and the weighted average assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

Inspicio does not consider that the historical volatility calculated from its share price since trading commenced on 29 April 2005 as representative of 
volatility over the expected life of the share options. The expected volatility used in the option pricing model is therefore based on the historical volatility 
over the last four years of a group of four comparator companies.
The expected life is the average expected time period for the exercise of an option by its holder. 
The risk free rate of interest is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed expected option life.

stock valuation, holiday pay accruals and bad debt provisioning), in addition to revising estimates of the recoverability of certain trade debtors balances.
Net asset values remain provisional where accounting and taxation estimates used have yet to be finalised.
In its last financial year to 31 December 2005, ESG recorded a loss after tax and minority interests of £626,000. For the period since that date to the

The acquisition contributed £2.8m to the Group’s net operating cash flows and it paid £9,000 of interest, £7,000 of tax and £779,000 of capital expenditure.
The exceptional items represent impairment of goodwill and closure costs of ESG’s food testing division.

Acquisition of Inspectorate
The provisional fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of Inspectorate which was purchased in October 2005, have been revised to reflect

The total impact of these adjustments was to reduce goodwill arising by £342,000.

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
The Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) of the Company will to be held at 16 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3ED on Tuesday, 26 June 2007 at 
9.00am. The notice convening the AGM is set out on pages 49 and 50. 
In addition to the routine business of the AGM, there are a number of items of special business to be transacted, as summarised and explained below:
1. Increase of share capital (resolution 8)
It is necessary to increase the authorised share capital of the Company from £10,050,000 to ensure that there is sufficient authorised share capital to 
be issued in the event of a further fund raising. It is proposed to increase the authorised share capital of the Company to £20,050,000 by the creation 
of an additional 100,000,000 Ordinary Shares of £0.10p each.
2. Authority to allot shares and disapply pre-emption rights (resolution 9 and 10)
The existing general authority of the Directors to allot shares and the current disapplication of the statutory pre-emption rights both expire at the 
conclusion of the 2007 AGM.
Article 8.2.1 of the Company’s Articles of Association contains a general authority for the Directors to allot shares in the Company for a period (not 
exceeding 15 months) (the “prescribed period”) and up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount (the “Section 80 amount”) approved by a special 
or ordinary resolution of the Company. In addition Article 8.2.2 empowers the Directors, during the prescribed period, to allot shares for cash in connection 
with a rights issue and also to allot shares for cash in any other circumstances up to a maximum aggregate nominal amount approved by a special 
resolution of the Company (the “Section 89 amount”).
Ordinary resolution 9 provides for the Section 80 amount to be £2,942,195 representing one third of the Company’s issued share capital at 30 April 2007 
(the latest practicable date before the printing of this document). 
Special resolution 10 provides for the Section 89 amount to be £441,329 representing five per cent of the Company’s issued share capital at the date 
referred to above. This limit conforms with the pre-emption guidelines issued by bodies representing institutional investors.
The prescribed period for which these powers and authorities are given will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held next year (or, if earlier, 
fifteen months from the date fixed for this year’s AGM, i.e. on 26 September 2008) when the Directors propose to seek a renewal of these authorities 
unless renewed earlier.
3. Purchase of own shares (resolution 11)
The Directors consider that it would be beneficial to the Company if, in certain circumstances, the Company had the power to purchase its own Ordinary 
Shares of 10p each (“Ordinary Shares”). The current authority given at the 2006 AGM for the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares of 10p each 
(“Ordinary Shares”) expires at the conclusion of the 2007 AGM.
At the present time, the Directors have no intention of exercising the power to purchase any of the issued Ordinary Shares of the Company. However, 
they consider it is appropriate to continue to have the flexibility to do so. Accordingly, they recommend that the existing power in certain circumstances 
to buy in Ordinary Shares up to a maximum prescribed limit be renewed for a further limited period.
The Directors will only implement such purchases if they are satisfied that these are in the best interests of the Company.
Resolution 11, which will be proposed as a Special Resolution, authorises the Directors to purchase up to a maximum of 8,826,586 Ordinary Shares, 
being 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company as at 30 April 2007 (the latest practicable date prior to printing of this document), and 
provides that the maximum price per Ordinary Share payable on any exercise of the authority shall not be more than five per cent above the average 
of the middle-market quotations for the Ordinary Shares as derived from the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days 
prior to making any purchase. The minimum price payable shall be 10p per Ordinary Share, being the nominal value of an Ordinary Share. For this 
purpose both the maximum and minimum prices permitted to be paid are exclusive of expenses.
The authority will expire on 26 September 2008 or at the conclusion of the next AGM, whichever is the sooner. It is envisaged that the Directors will 
continue to seek renewal of the authority annually.
ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY SHAREHOLDERS
Enclosed is a form of proxy for use at the AGM.
Shareholders are urged to complete the appropriate Proxy Form and return it to the Capita Registrars, Proxy Processing Centre, Telford Road, 
Bicester OX26 4LD so as to arrive not later than 9.00am on 22 June 2007.
The return of the appropriate Proxy Form will not prevent a shareholder from attending the Meeting and voting in person if he is entitled to do so and 
so wishes.
RECOMMENDATION
The Directors consider that the proposals set out above are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. They recommend that 
shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions set out in the Notice of Meeting as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.

Notes:
(a)  In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives notice that only those shareholders entered 
on the relevant register of members (the “Register”) for certificated or uncertificated shares of the Company (as the case may be) at 9.00am on 
22 June 2007 (the “Specified Time”) will be entitled to attend or vote at the AGM in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at 
the time. Changes to entries on the Register after the Specified Time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote 
at the AGM. Should the AGM be adjourned to a time not more than 48 hours after the Specified Time, that time will also apply for the purpose 
of determining the entitlement of members to attend and vote (and for the purpose of determining the number of votes they may cast) at the 
adjourned AGM. Should the AGM be adjourned for a longer period, then to be so entitled, members must be entered on the Register at the time 
which is 48 hours before the time fixed for the adjourned AGM or, if the Company gives notice of the adjourned AGM, at the time specified in 
the notice.
(b)  Any member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, to vote on his/her behalf. A proxy 
need not be a member. Proxy Forms should be lodged with the Company’s Registrar or submitted not later than 48 hours before the time for which 
the AGM is convened. Completion of the appropriate Proxy Form does not prevent a member from attending and voting in person if he/she is 
entitled to do so and so wishes.
(c)  Copies of service contracts between any Director and the Company or any of its subsidiaries are available for inspection at the Registered Office of 
the Company on each business day during normal business hours and will be available on the day of the AGM, at the place of the AGM, from at 
least 15 minutes prior to the AGM until its conclusion. The Register of Directors’ Interests will also be available for inspection from the commencement 
of the AGM until its conclusion.

The anatomy of allergy
The Science
An allergy is an immune hypersensitivity 
reaction in which the body’s natural defences 
react inappropriately to specific proteins or 
allergens from common substances such as 
pollen, mould spores, peanuts and many more. 
Allergic symptoms may vary depending on the nature 
and presentation of the specific allergens but all 
allergens, in some way or other, cause inflammation 
in mucosal surfaces such as those in the eyes, nose, 
upper and lower respiratory tracts. These symptoms are 
typically referred to as ‘hay fever‘ if they affect the eyes 
and nose, and allergic asthma if they affect the lower 
respiratory tract. Additionally, allergens such as house 
dust mite, whilst affecting both the upper and lower 
respiratory tract, can also cause allergic eczema through 
skin contact whilst food allergens also affect the gastro-
intestinal tract. Allergy Therapeutics currently focuses 
on vaccine treatments for the major problem of allergies 
caused by inhaled airborne allergens. 
What are allergies? Allergy vaccination
Allergy vaccination or immunotherapy  
treats the underlying cause of allergic 
disease, providing both symptomatic relief 
and the potential of a permanent cure. 
To achieve this the vaccine must modify the immune 
response by blocking the interaction of allergens 
with IgE and must prevent the production of 
allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Traditionally, this has 
required long courses of injections with gradually 
increasing doses of allergen to build the patient’s 
tolerance to the allergenic challenge whilst avoiding 
serious allergic reactions to the vaccine. Allergy 
Therapeutics has pioneered short–course vaccination 
in which the allergens are modified (allergoids) 
to prevent reaction with IgE, combined with the 
biocompatible depot L-tyrosine and a powerful toll 
receptor agonist (TLR4/TLR2) – monophosphoryl 
lipid A (MPL
®
) as adjuvants. These rapidly induce 
profound changes in the immune response to the 
allergens whilst substantially reducing the risk of 
allergic reactions.
Pollinex
®
 Quattro vaccines
Phase I and II clinical studies have included over 850 hay fever 
patients and have demonstrated significant clinical activity 
of Pollinex
®
 Quattro vaccines (4 injections). In a ‘Clinical Use’ 
study of over 3000 patients, approximately 90% demonstrated 
improvements in clinical symptoms. Patients also showed little 
or no seasonal rise in IgE and a significant increase in blocking 
IgG antibodies compared with the placebo patients where the 
reverse was true. In particular, production of allergen-specific  
IgG4 antibodies was correlated with successful treatment. 
T-helper cells isolated during the pollen season from patients 
treated with active vaccine showed an allergen-specific, highly 
significant, rise in the production of 
γ
 interferon and no seasonal 
rise in IL4 and IL5. In patients treated with the placebo the 
reverse was true. These results are entirely consistent with 
effective treatment of the underlying immunological cause of 
pollen allergy. Phase III registration trials are planned for the next 
pollen season in Europe and North America.
The key characteristic that distinguishes allergic individuals is 
the production of large quantities of IgE antibodies specific 
to the sensitising allergens. IgE is naturally important in 
handling parasitic infections and is highly bound to mast  
cells acting as a trigger for this class of immune cell. When 
the target allergens crosslink these bound antibodies, the 
mast cells release a wide range of inflammatory materials, 
including histamine, which are responsible for the allergy 
symptoms. Additionally, this process stimulates the production 
of further IgE antibodies. Antihistamines are effective in 
partially controlling allergic symptoms but have no effect on 
the course and development of the underlying disease which 
can progressively become worse.

Directors’ Report
The directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements for the 12 months ended 30 June 2005.  
The financial statements are for Allergy Therapeutics Plc (the Company) and its subsidiary companies (together, the Group). 
In September 2004, the shares of Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd were acquired by Allergy Therapeutics plc, by way  
of a share-for-share exchange, prior to completing a successful flotation on the AIM on 11 October 2004. 
Company statements for Allergy Therapeutics plc cover the period from incorporation, as detailed in the note below. Group 
statements have been prepared under the merger accounting basis and presented as though they had always been part of 
Allergy Therapeutics plc. 
Principal activities
The Group is engaged in the development, manufacture, marketing and sale of a range of pharmaceutical vaccine products 
designed for the immunological treatment of the allergic condition. Vaccinations take the form of allergen-specific, named-
patient-specific and standard products in injectable and sublingual presentations. The business is headquartered in Worthing, 
West Sussex, where development and manufacturing is based, whilst there are sales and marketing subsidiaries in Germany, 
Italy and Spain.
A review of the Group’s business and activities is contained in the Chairman’s Statement and Chief Executive’s Review.

The loss for the year after taxation was £1,929,000 (2004: £1,218,000 profit). The results for the year are set out on page 21

Changes to interest in own shares
During the year the Company allocated 1,166,524 shares out of the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy share options that  
were exercised.
Corporate governance
The Group has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated duties and 
responsibilities. The chairman of each committee reports directly to the Board. 
The Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee both comprise Stephen Smith (Chairman) and Ignace Goethals. 
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year to review a wide range of issues, including the annual financial statements 
and the Interim Statement, overseeing the objectivity and effectiveness of the auditors and regulatory compliance. The 
external auditors are formally invited to attend each meeting. The Committee reviews the Key Issues Memorandum produced 
by the external auditors. 
Full details of directors’ remuneration and a statement of the Company’s remuneration policy are set out in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
Engagement of auditors for the supply of non-audit services
It is the Company’s policy that it will only engage the Company’s auditor to supply other professional services to the Company and 
its subsidiary undertakings if it is satisfied that all the usual conditions of engagement and benchmarks are met. Any agreement to 
purchase services costing more than £10,000 per engagement must have the prior approval of the Audit Committee. 15 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
Internal control
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the system of 
internal control maintained by the Group. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risk. It can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss and includes the safeguarding 
of assets, the maintenance of proper accounting records, 
the reliability of financial information, compliance with 
appropriate legislation, regulation and best practice and the 
identification and management of business risk. During the 
year the Company established an internal audit function, 
reporting directly to the Audit Committee, which has carried 
out reviews of the policies and controls of the subsidiaries 
in Germany, Italy and Spain. A full review of policies and 
controls in the UK and follow-up reviews of the overseas 
subsidiaries are scheduled to take place during the financial 
year ending 30 June 2006.
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
Reporting under IFRS is due to be mandatory for the Group for 
the year ending 30 June 2008 onwards, although consideration 
will also need to be given to the 2007 results due to the 
requirement for comparatives on the implementation of 
IFRS. A project team will be set up to manage the Group’s 
transition from UK GAAP to IFRS and to ensure successful 
implementation within the required timeframe.
Research and development
The Group will continue its policy of investment in research 
and development in order to improve its competitive position 
in the market.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors continue to believe 
that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence and accordingly have applied the going 
concern principle in drawing up the financial statements.
Market value of land and buildings
In the opinion of the directors, the market value of the land 
and buildings of the Group is in excess of the current book 
values but a recent valuation has not been sought.
Charitable and political contributions
The Company made no political or charitable contributions 
during the year.
Creditors’ payment policy and practice
The Group agrees payment terms with suppliers when it 
enters into contracts for the purchase of goods or services 
and seeks to abide by those terms when it is satisfied 
that the supplier has provided the goods or services in 
accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. 
The number of trade creditor days at 30 June 2005 was  
52 days (2004: 51 days). 
Employment policies
Equal opportunities
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities 
in employment. All job applicants and employees shall 
receive equal treatment regardless of sex, race, colour, and 
nationality or ethnic origin.
Disabled people
The Group, in considering applications for employment from 
disabled people, seeks to ensure that fair consideration is 
given to the abilities and aptitudes of the applicant while 
having regard to the requirements of the job for which he 
or she has applied. Employees who become unable to carry 
out the requirements of the job for which they have been 
employed are given individual consideration and, depending 
on the nature, severity and duration of the disability, may be 
considered for alternative work.
Communication
The Group has an open communication policy with its 
employees. Regular communication on the strategy, plans 
and performance of the Group is undertaken and reinforced 
by site meetings of staff as well as by briefings through line 
management. In the UK, employees have access to Company 
information on the intranet. Information about the Group is 
also available on the Internet. 
The Group’s commitment to the performance management 
of its staff encourages both individuals and the Group to 
recognise individuals’ strengths and development potential 
and the remuneration programme is based on merit. 16 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Allergy Therapeutics plc

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law in the UK requires the directors to prepare 
financial statements for each financial period which give  
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  
and Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for  
that period. In preparing those financial statements, the 
directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records, for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection  
of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors’ 
report and other information included in the annual report is 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom company law.
The directors are responsible for ensuring compliance with 
the AIM rules.
The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website  
is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out  
by the auditors does not involve consideration of these 
matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility 
for any changes that may have occurred to the financial 
statements since they were initially presented on the 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of the financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Auditors
Grant Thornton UK LLP offer themselves for reappointment 
as auditors in accordance with section 385 of the Companies 
Act 1985. A resolution for their reappointment is to be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board on 12 September 2005,
Ian Postlethwaite
Company Secretary

Directors’ Report
continued 17 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
The Remuneration Committee (unaudited)
The Remuneration Committee was formed on 8 October 
2004 and comprises Steve Smith (Chairman) and Ignace 
Goethals. A remuneration committee was in place prior to 
8 October 2004 for the Group’s former holding company. 
The Committee held 2 meetings during the past financial 
year which were also attended by the Human Resources 
Manager. The principle purpose of the Committee is to agree 
the directors’ salary increases, annual bonuses and any 
changes in benefits. In addition, the Committee also agrees 
the share-related compensation for the directors and other 
executive management, approves performance-related pay 
schemes of the Group and other executive compensation 
matters. For the purpose of reaching appropriate decisions 
the Committee has used information from the Alan Jones 
& Associates ‘Pharmaceutical Salary Survey’, the Halliwell 
Consulting ‘Executive Pay in the Pharmaceuticals & Bio 
Tech Sector’ report and a sample taken from AIM listed 
pharmaceutical companies of similar size and value (the 
‘Comparator Group’).
Remuneration policy (unaudited)
The Committee’s policy is to set remuneration packages for 
executive directors that are competitive with the market, 
allowing the Company to attract, motivate and retain 
executives of the highest calibre. Remuneration packages are 
designed to reward executives for performance via annual 
bonus payments and awards of share-related compensation, 
which together constitute a potentially significant proportion 
of the total remuneration opportunity.
The remuneration of executive directors comprises the 
following five elements:
(i) Basic salary
Basic salary reflects the market rate for each position 
and the individual director’s experience and value to the 
business. Salaries are reviewed annually as at 1 October, 
taking into account personal performance, and are 
benchmarked against the Comparator Group.
(ii) Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits represent the provision of a car allowance 
and private medical insurance.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
(iii) Share options
Executive share options have been granted to directors and 
senior management under the Allergy Therapeutics plc 2005 
Executive Share Option Plan and are exercisable between 
3 and 10 years from the date of grant, subject to continued 
employment and the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The number of Executive share options were approved on 
the basis of 2 times annual salary for the Chief Executive 
and, for all other executive directors, 1½ times annual salary. 
The share options granted to individual executive directors  
to date are disclosed later in this report and include grants 
made in prior years under previous approved and unapproved 
option schemes. Share options previously granted by Allergy 
Therapeutics (Holdings) Ltd were surrendered on 5 October 
2004 for share options in Allergy Therapeutics plc, on 
substantially the same terms.
 
(iv) Bonus
In the case of the executive team the Company operates 
a performance related cash bonus based upon individual 
performance and achievement of personal and corporate 
objectives. The performance-related bonus for the year 
ending 30 June 2005 ranged between 25% and 40% of basic 
salary. Annual bonus payments are capped under service 
contracts at 40% for K Carter and 30% for all other directors 
except C Grätz, whose bonus is uncapped. 
 
(v) Pension arrangements
The UK Company operates a Group Personal Pension Scheme 
and currently makes pension contributions equal to 10% of 
salary for executive directors, with the exception of K Carter 
for whom the Company contributes 13% of salary. 
C Grätz is a member of Bencard Allergie’s pension scheme, 
which provides a defined benefit on retirement. Bencard 
Allergie’s contributions are based on actuarial reports provided 
by Swiss Life Pension Management. The pension liability is 
insured through a reinsurance contract with Swiss Life. 18 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Allergy Therapeutics plc

We have audited the financial statements of Allergy 
Therapeutics plc for the year ended 30 June 2005 which 
comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the 
consolidated and company balance sheets, the consolidated 
cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of total 
recognised gains and losses and notes 1 to 28. These 
financial statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited  
the information in the directors’ remuneration report that  
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as  
a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies  
Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we 
might state to the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law,  
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinion we  
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors
It is the directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual 
report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and United Kingdom accounting standards  
are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements 
and United Kingdom auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial 
statements give a true and fair view and are properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We 
also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is 
not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding 
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company 
is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report, and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. This other information comprises the chairman’s 
statement, chief executive’s review, financial review, directors’ 
report and the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration 
report. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our 
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom 
auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence 
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the 
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether  
the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances, 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all  
the information and explanations which we considered 
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence  
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion  
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation 
of information in the financial statements.
Opinion

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the Group’s financial statements and have remained unchanged from the prior year.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical convention of accounting and in accordance with 
applicable accounting standards.
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made 
up to 30 June 2005.  
On 14 September 2004 Netstamp Ltd (later to become Allergy Therapeutics plc) acquired, by way of a share-for-share 
exchange, the whole of the issued share capital of Allergy Therapeutics (Holdings) Limited (‘ATHL’). Accordingly, as permitted 
by Financial Reporting Standard 6, merger accounting has been applied for this combination as if the Group, as currently 
constituted, has been in place throughout the whole period covered by these financial statements.
The Group profit and loss account for the financial year and the comparatives for the Group balance sheet and Group  
profit and loss account have been presented as though they had always been part of Allergy Therapeutics plc, despite  
the fact that the Company was only incorporated on 1 June 2004, in order to compare meaningfully the performance  
of the underlying Group.
The share capital, share premium and shares held in EBT reserve is that of the Company in 2005. The share capital and 
shares held in EBT reserve is that of ATHL in 2004. The shares issued by subsidiary reserve relates to the premium on shares 
previously issued by ATHL. The profit and loss reserve includes all profits and losses for the Group formerly headed by ATHL 
prior to its merger with the Company.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separable 
net assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions is capitalised. Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by 
equal instalments over its estimated useful life. 
Depreciation
Depreciation has been provided on a straight line basis in order to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of 
depreciable fixed assets over their estimated useful lives.
The rates applicable are:
Plant and machinery       5–10 years 
Fixtures and fittings       5 years
Motor vehicles       4 years
Computer equipment       3–7 years 
Buildings       10 years
Operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Intangible fixed assets and amortisation
Non-competing know-how is amortised over 4 years reflecting its estimated useful life to the Group. Acquired licences, 
patents and manufacturing know-how are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives (15 years). 
Any development costs which are incurred by the Group and are associated with an acquired licence, patent and know-how 
are written off to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Pension
The Group operates a private personal pension for employees in the UK and Germany. The assets of the UK scheme are held 
separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The amount charged against profits represents 
the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period. The pension liability in Germany is ‘insured’ 
through a reinsurance contract with an independent insurance company. 27 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005
1 Accounting policies continued
Stock valuation
Stocks have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include materials, direct labour and an 
appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Research and development
Laboratory equipment used for research and development is capitalised as plant and equipment and written off in 
accordance with the Group’s depreciation policy. Other research and development expenditures are written off in the  
year when occurred.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the preceding month-end. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance  
sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates. Profit and loss 
accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the period. Gains and losses arising 
on these translations are taken to reserves.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting in respect of all timing differences, in the following year, between the 
treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance  
sheet date except as otherwise required by FRS 19. 
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts (excluding value added tax) derived from the provision of goods and services to third party 
customers, net of statutory rebates paid in Germany.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when contractual obligations are met and a right to consideration exists. Where a right to 
consideration is dependent on the occurrence of a critical event (i.e. when the Group has fulfilled all relevant conditions  
to be entitled to the revenue), such as for milestone payments, revenue is not recognised until that event occurs.
Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts 
payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are 
either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Employee Benefit Trust (EBT)
The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of a trust, set up for the benefit of the Group’s employees. 
The Employee Benefit Trust has acquired shares in the Company and these are deducted from shareholders funds on  
the balance sheet within ‘other reserve’ initially at the cost that the shares were acquired. The net proceeds received  
from the issue of these shares through the exercise of options are recognised through this reserve.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less amounts written off. 28 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Allergy Therapeutics plc

The fair values of intangible assets acquired as part of a business are determined by the realisable market value. The 
directors consider each acquisition separately for the purpose of determining the amortisation period of any goodwill and 
other intangible assets that arise. The following sets out the periods over which intangible assets are amortised and reasons 
for the periods chosen:
Goodwill, manufacturing know-how and other intangible assets arising on the acquisition of Allergy Therapeutics Limited 
and Bencard Allergie GmbH in June 1998 have been amortised over 15 years. The directors have estimated that this is the 
useful economic life of the assets, reflecting the expected financial benefits.
Non-competing know-how has been amortised over 4 years in the UK reflecting its estimated useful life to the Company.
‘Other intangibles’ includes trademarks and acquisition costs.

The bank loan was secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of Allergy Therapeutics (UK) Ltd. The loan was fully 
repaid in November 2004.
18 Financial instruments and derivatives
The Group uses financial instruments comprising borrowings, cash and various items, such as trade debtors and trade 
creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for  
the Group’s operations. 
The Group also enters into derivatives transactions such as forward foreign currency contracts. The purpose of such 
transactions is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
The main risk arising from the Group financial instruments is foreign currency risk while to a lesser extent there is interest 
rate risk and liquidity risk. The board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised 
below. These policies have remained unchanged from previous years.
All transactions in derivatives, principally forward foreign currency contracts, are undertaken to manage the risks arising  
from underlying business activities and no transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken. 
It is, and has been in previous years, the Group policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. 35 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005

Short-term debtors and creditors
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.
Currency risk
The Group does not hedge its exposure of foreign investments held in foreign currencies. 
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. In relation to translation risk the repatriation  
of assets is insignificant and the only exposure is revaluation of the assets at year end for accounting purposes. Therefore, 
Group policy does not deem it necessary to cover this risk. 
Transaction exposures are hedged, mainly using the forward hedge market. The Group seeks to hedge its exposures using  
a variety of financial instruments, with the objective of minimising fluctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and 
cash flows. 
The majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated in euros, whilst a material element of the cost base is denominated  
in sterling. The Group policy is to eliminate approximately 50% of currency exposures on a rolling 12 month basis through  
the use of forward currency contracts.
Gains and losses on hedges
The Group policy is to hedge exposures to currency risk. The table below shows the extent to which the Group has 
unrecognised and/or deferred gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning  
and end of the year. The table also shows the amount of gains and losses which have been included in the profit and  
loss account for the year and those that are expected to be recognised in future profit and loss accounts.

Interest rate risk
The directors do not consider that the business is exposed to material interest rate risk. The Group finances its operations 
through cash reserves. The cash reserves held by the Group since October 2004 have negated the need to use significant 
interest bearing short-term borrowings, whereas previously short-term borrowings were held. 36 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Allergy Therapeutics plc

Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest 
cash assets safely and profitably. Surplus cash is invested in various deposit accounts to spread the risk and to generate a 
higher return of interest.

The anatomy of allergy
The Science
An allergy is an immune hypersensitivity 
reaction in which the body’s natural defences 
react inappropriately to specific proteins or 
allergens from common substances such as 
pollen, mould spores, peanuts and many more. 
Allergic symptoms may vary depending on the nature 
and presentation of the specific allergens but all 
allergens, in some way or other, cause inflammation 
in mucosal surfaces such as those in the eyes, nose, 
upper and lower respiratory tracts. These symptoms are 
typically referred to as ‘hay fever‘ if they affect the eyes 
and nose, and allergic asthma if they affect the lower 
respiratory tract. Additionally, allergens such as house 
dust mite, whilst affecting both the upper and lower 
respiratory tract, can also cause allergic eczema through 
skin contact whilst food allergens also affect the gastro-
intestinal tract. Allergy Therapeutics currently focuses 
on vaccine treatments for the major problem of allergies 
caused by inhaled airborne allergens. 
What are allergies? Allergy vaccination
Allergy vaccination or immunotherapy  
treats the underlying cause of allergic 
disease, providing both symptomatic relief 
and the potential of a permanent cure. 
To achieve this the vaccine must modify the immune 
response by blocking the interaction of allergens 
with IgE and must prevent the production of 
allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Traditionally, this has 
required long courses of injections with gradually 
increasing doses of allergen to build the patient’s 
tolerance to the allergenic challenge whilst avoiding 
serious allergic reactions to the vaccine. Allergy 
Therapeutics has pioneered short–course vaccination 
in which the allergens are modified (allergoids) 
to prevent reaction with IgE, combined with the 
biocompatible depot L-tyrosine and a powerful toll 
receptor agonist (TLR4/TLR2) – monophosphoryl 
lipid A (MPL
®
) as adjuvants. These rapidly induce 
profound changes in the immune response to the 
allergens whilst substantially reducing the risk of 
allergic reactions.
Pollinex
®
 Quattro vaccines
Phase I and II clinical studies have included over 850 hay fever 
patients and have demonstrated significant clinical activity 
of Pollinex
®
 Quattro vaccines (4 injections). In a ‘Clinical Use’ 
study of over 3000 patients, approximately 90% demonstrated 
improvements in clinical symptoms. Patients also showed little 
or no seasonal rise in IgE and a significant increase in blocking 
IgG antibodies compared with the placebo patients where the 
reverse was true. In particular, production of allergen-specific  
IgG4 antibodies was correlated with successful treatment. 
T-helper cells isolated during the pollen season from patients 
treated with active vaccine showed an allergen-specific, highly 
significant, rise in the production of 
γ
 interferon and no seasonal 
rise in IL4 and IL5. In patients treated with the placebo the 
reverse was true. These results are entirely consistent with 
effective treatment of the underlying immunological cause of 
pollen allergy. Phase III registration trials are planned for the next 
pollen season in Europe and North America.
The key characteristic that distinguishes allergic individuals is 
the production of large quantities of IgE antibodies specific 
to the sensitising allergens. IgE is naturally important in 
handling parasitic infections and is highly bound to mast  
cells acting as a trigger for this class of immune cell. When 
the target allergens crosslink these bound antibodies, the 
mast cells release a wide range of inflammatory materials, 
including histamine, which are responsible for the allergy 
symptoms. Additionally, this process stimulates the production 
of further IgE antibodies. Antihistamines are effective in 
partially controlling allergic symptoms but have no effect on 
the course and development of the underlying disease which 
can progressively become worse.

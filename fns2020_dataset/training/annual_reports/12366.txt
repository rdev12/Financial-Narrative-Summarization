Polymetal at a glance
A year of robust progress
 Polymetal demonstrated strong operational 
performance throughout the year. Total gold 
equivalent production of 1,063 Koz was up 31% 
compared to 2011, exceeding the original projection 
of 1 Moz. This reﬂects stable operations at all  
of our mature mines, with a notable improvement  
at Dukat and growth at Omolon and Albazino. 
 Metal sales for the full year exceeded production  
for both gold and silver.
 The Amursk POX, the ﬁrst operating POX plant  
in Russia’s gold industry, has been slower than 
planned to come online, but the ramp-up is 
progressing and we expect it to reach full  
capacity by the end of 2013. 
 There has been a dramatic increase of the resource 
base at Albazino and potential new growth assets 
have been identiﬁed through successful exploration 
at Kutyn and Svetloye.
 We have implemented a new dividend policy,  
raising the payout ratio to 30% and introducing 
special dividends. The ﬁrst special dividend in the 
Company’s history of US$0.50 per share was  
paid in January 2013; a ﬁnal dividend for 2012  
of US$0.31 per share is proposed.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the 
operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, 
rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory 
to net realisable value) and general, administrative 
and selling expenses of the operating assets.  
Gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on 
average realised metal prices in the relevant period. 
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is 
calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold 
equivalent unit ounces sold.

  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are estimated  
in accordance with the JORC Code (2004).  
Mineral Resources are additional to Ore Reserves.
How we’ve delivered
Our original objective for 2012 was to deliver  
1.0 Moz of gold equivalent, and we are  
naturally pleased to have exceeded this  
target. Since our operating activities remain  
on track, we are conﬁdent that we will achieve 
production of 1.2 Moz in 2013 and 1.4 Moz of 
gold equivalent in 2014.
How we’ve performed
We have demonstrated strong ﬁnancial performance for the year,  
driven by excellent operational performance and tight cost and capital 
discipline. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders  
by proposing a ﬁnal dividend which, combined with special dividends, 
will result in sector-leading yield combined with solid growth proﬁle.

Overview Business review 
Chairman’s statement
and the active stewardship of risk management. For the Board 
to maximise its effectiveness it must ensure that the proper 
governance and strategy setting procedures are in place so 
that the Company can maintain its ability to sustain ﬁnancial 
performance, dividend ﬂow to shareholders, and to generate 
value to all its stakeholders. 
We remain committed to ensuring that the Company is run  
in the best interests of all its stakeholders and that the Board  
is accountable for responsible stewardship, disciplined 
performance and sustainable value delivery.
People
Polymetal’s good performance this year is entirely due  
to the talent, dedication and hard work of all our employees. 
Our strong prospects for future growth are equally dependant  
on their continuing commitment. We are not only highly 
appreciative of the efforts of our employees at all levels,  
but are also absolutely clear that the wellbeing of everyone 
associated with Polymetal is of critical importance.
 
Maintaining focus  
on delivery
Performance
We have consistently demonstrated strong operational 
performance throughout the year, with total gold equivalent 
production 31% up on 2011 and 6% ahead of original 
expectations. This excellent result was driven in particular by 
solid performance at our mature mines, robust performance  
at Dukat and successful ramp-ups at Omolon and Albazino.
While the completion of major projects and signiﬁcant resource 
expansion have both contributed signiﬁcantly to our success 
during the year and helped to develop a distinctive competitive 
proﬁle for Polymetal, we have also made progress against wider 
strategic objectives. Throughout the year, we have announced 
several resource increases, the most important being the 
twofold resource expansion at Albazino as a result of our 
ongoing exploration efforts. In December we announced the 
completion of the acquisition of the Olcha gold-silver deposit 
and a greenﬁeld PGM project, our ﬁrst platinum asset.
On behalf of the Board, I am delighted 
to be reporting on a year of tremendous 
progress for Polymetal. In our ﬁrst full 
year as a premium listed company on 
the London Stock Exchange, we have 
successfully delivered on our promises 
in terms of production, performance, 
governance and the generation  
of value for our stakeholders. 
Dividend
Our dividend policy in 2012 has evolved in response to 
increased demand for dividend ﬂow from institutional investors 
across the world. It also highlighted our ability to generate free 
cash ﬂow at the current stage of our development. As a result, 
a new dividend policy has been adopted by the Board, raising 
the regular dividend payout ratio to 30% of net earnings, and 
introducing interim dividends and an annual consideration of  
a special dividend. We ﬁrmly believe that the amended 
dividend policy will be signiﬁcantly more aligned with the 
interests of the Company’s stakeholders and global trends  
in the sector, reafﬁrming the Company’s commitment  
to capital allocation discipline and value distribution while 
retaining ﬂexibility to invest in attractive projects.
The Board was delighted to declare, in accordance with the 
new policy that, having considered the performance of the 
Group during the year to date, available free cash ﬂows  
and future investment requirements, a special dividend  
of US$0.50 per ordinary share, representing a total of 
approximately US$191 million. This was paid in January 2013. 
In addition, a ﬁnal dividend of US$0.31 per share is proposed, 
representing 30% of our net proﬁt for the year.
The declaration of the ﬁrst special dividend in the Company’s 
history and the increased regular payout reafﬁrm our 
commitment to capital discipline and is also a result  
of solid operating and ﬁnancial results of the Group to date. 
The implementation of our new dividend policy reﬂects the 
importance we place on delivering meaningful cash returns  
to our shareholders and sustainable value creation.
The Board and Governance
Governance is at the heart of our culture, providing a 
framework within which we can maintain and develop the 
values and practices that support our corporate objectives, 
and which ensure that Polymetal reﬂects high levels of ethical 
and responsible behaviour.
During our ﬁrst full year as a premium listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange we have worked hard to ensure that 
we reﬂect both the letter and the spirit of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. Our approach is designed to achieve  
a balance between encouraging positive commercial values, 
and applying the appropriate disciplines where required. 
We have been particularly focused on the Code’s emphasis  
on the alignment of remuneration with shareholder interests,  
the balance and effectiveness of the Board and its composition,

Chief Executive’s review
average grade processed and increased volumes, and  
coupled with moderate Russian Rouble depreciation against 
the US Dollar, offset the combined impact of domestic inﬂation 
and adverse movement in gold/silver price ratio.
In line with industry best practice, we started to report all-in 
cash costs, which comprised US$1,047/GE oz, a 15% 
decrease year-on-year, driven mostly by reduction in capital 
expenditure at our operating mines and stable total cash costs.
Net earnings were US$401 million, up 39%, and basic EPS  
was US$1.03, up 30% year-on-year driven by strong increase  
in adjusted EBITDA. The net earnings and EPS were negatively 
affected by additional tax provisions booked in respect of prior 
years and 2012 in the amount of US$ 116 million, which are  
not expected to be recurring. The earnings growth resulted  
in improved returns on equity and capital employed reaching  
20% and 22% respectively.
Net operating cash ﬂow more than doubled to US$496 million 
while capital expenditures declined 24% to US$351 million, 
resulting in total positive free cash ﬂow of US$139 million.
Our balance sheet remains strong, and liquidity proﬁle 
comfortable, with the net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio further 
reduced from 1.4 to 1.1 during 2012, with 59% of borrowings 
being long-term.
Following the successful performance during 2012, a ﬁnal 
dividend of US$0.31 per share is proposed by the Board  
in accordance with our new dividend policy, reiterating  
our commitment to capital discipline and delivering value  
to our shareholders. The cumulative dividend payout during  
the last twelve months, including the payment of the ﬁrst  
special dividend, puts us among the leaders in the sector  
in terms of dividend yield.
Employees and communities
As one of the largest employers and taxpayers in many areas 
of our operations, with more than 9,000 employees in Russia 
and Kazakhstan, we are very conscious that our achievements 
are totally dependent on their commitment and dedication.  
We have a clear focus on the wellbeing of all our staff, and  
our health and safety procedures are subject to constant 
scrutiny, assessment and development. We continue to invest 
signiﬁcantly in all areas relating to safety systems, procedures 
and equipment, which naturally remain central to our culture 
and working practices. 
A successful year  
of delivery and growth
2012 has proved to be a strong year, 
with a solid set of operating results, 
favourable market conditions, 
signiﬁcant progress across our key 
investment projects and exploration 
targets, and a continuing focus on 
safety and employee welfare. 
Robust production results
This year we achieved total gold equivalent production  
of 1.06 Moz – 31% up on 2011 and 6% ahead of original 
forecasts, representing our biggest annual increase in absolute 
numbers to date. These excellent results were driven by stable 
performance at all mature mines, with a notable improvement 
achieved at Dukat, and successful ramp-up at Omolon and 
Albazino, our key growth projects.
Annual gold production increased to 589 Koz, up 33% 
compared to 2011, driven principally by robust operating 
results at Omolon and Albazino, both achieving or exceeding 
design capacity. Silver production was 26.5 Moz – also up 
33% on 2011 – as a result of higher grades and recoveries  
at Dukat, successful processing of high-grade Sopka  
ore at Omolon, and increased grades at Khakanja.
We have commissioned our ﬂagship Amursk POX plant and 
poured ﬁrst gold in April 2012 as planned. However, while 
throughput reached expected levels in late November, we 
experienced some operational issues during the ramp-up  
and have not yet achieved expected sustainable performance.  
We are already implementing the necessary remedial 
measures, and are expecting a gradual improvement 
throughout the year with full capacity being achieved by  
the fourth quarter of 2013. In the meantime, we will be able  
to generate cash ﬂows by continuing concentrate sales  
to third-party off-takers.
Development and exploration
I am pleased to report that our development projects are well 
on track. The commissioning of Mayskoye, our most remote 
and northerly mine, is scheduled to take place in April 2013. 
Furthermore, a substantial increase in the gold resource base  
at Albazino to nearly 6 Moz and successful exploration results 
at Kutyn and Svetloye indicate that we are in a strong position 
to make decisions on signiﬁcant new asset developments in the 
second half of 2013 and the beginning of 2014. These projects, 
if undertaken, will form a third generation of growth assets  
after reaching the target level of 1.4 Moz of gold equivalent 
production on the current asset base, which is expected  
in 2014.
The in-house exploration programme in 2012 and in the 
beginning of 2013 has been complemented by acquisition 
activity, including acquisition of the Olcha deposit, which  
will be part of the Dukat hub; the Svetlobor project, our ﬁrst 
greenﬁeld project in platinum; and, most recently, Maminskoye, 
a development stage asset in a perfect location with access  
to infrastructure. Both organic and inorganic growth projects 
are complementary with our business model, with capital 
discipline and commitment to return on capital as the core 
criteria of value creation.
Strong ﬁnancial performance
We have achieved excellent ﬁnancial results for the year  
driven by robust operating performance and tight cost and 
capital discipline. 
Revenue increased by 40% to US$1,854 million compared  
to 2011, driven mostly by robust production growth resulting  
in a 33% increase in sales of gold equivalent ounces. Metal 
sales exceeded production for both gold and silver as a result  
of destockpiling of concentrate inventories at Dukat.
Group total cash cost was US$703/GE oz, and remained 
almost ﬂat compared to the 2011 level of US$701/GE oz  
as a result of intense management focus on cost control  
and despite external and inﬂationary cost pressures.  
Strong operating performance, resulting in increased

Koz of gold equivalent 
+31%
increase on 2011 
I am very pleased to report that we experienced zero fatalities 
for a second year in a row, and the lost time injury frequency 
rate has also decreased in 2012 by another 6%, following 
major improvements in 2011. The tragic loss of the dry-cargo 
freighter Amurskaya, operated by a contractor of one of our 
subsidiaries, which capsized in the Sea of Okhotsk in October 
2012, is a matter of lasting sadness and regret for everyone  
at Polymetal. We have already taken appropriate steps  
to roll-out our safety and risk management procedures  
to our large supplier and contractor network.
We have a long history of involvement and support for the 
communities in which we operate, and which are in any  
way affected by our activities and operations. We continue  
to be committed to playing a signiﬁcant role in the social  
and economic development of communities and indigenous 
populations, and have an ongoing programme of investment 
and ﬁnancial support in terms of job creation, the development 
of local and regional infrastructure, health, education, culture, 
welfare and sports. 
Looking ahead
We have a great deal to look forward to – the results for 2012, 
and the strength of our development and exploration activities, 
give a good indication as to our prospects for the future. In the 
year ahead, we will be fully focused on unlocking the potential 
of the Amursk POX plant and the launch of Mayskoye, while 
continuing to work on the third generation of growth assets.
We remain conﬁdent in our production guidance of 1.2 Moz  
for 2013 and in our commitment to both cost and capital 
discipline. While there are always risks associated with future 
prospects, we ﬁrmly believe that we have the assets, strategy 
and expertise to continue to build Polymetal as a world class 
business and continue to deliver value to all our stakeholders.

Our original production target for  
2012 was 1.0 Moz of gold equivalent.  
This represented a 23% increase over 
2011 compared to an 8% increase 
achieved in the period of 2011  
over 2010.
What we did
 Increase in production of gold 
equivalent of 31% to 1,063 Koz

Chief Executive’s Q&A
A conversation with  
the Chief Executive
Q.  What are the key challenges in 
respect of safety and responsible 
development – and how do you  
address them?
While our in-house safety performance was excellent –  
this was the second year in a row that we were able to  
record not only zero fatalities but also a continuing trend  
of reduced injury rates – we of course deeply regret the  
loss of one of our suppliers’ ships in the Sea of Okhotsk.  
We are now taking measures to roll out our health and  
safety approach to our supplier network to address this risk  
in future. Our environmental and social performance remains 
fundamentally important to our sustainable growth, and 
consequently a key area of focus for us. We have made  
a positive impact in every region where we operate, and 
continue to invest heavily in our environmental, safety  
and social programmes.

Q.  What are your key operational 
priorities for 2013?
While we’re naturally focused on a complete range of 
operational activities, we do have two signiﬁcant priorities – 
achieving our targets for operations at Amursk POX, and the 
completion and ramp-up of Mayskoye. These two objectives 
are pre-requisite to achieving the 1.4 Moz production target 
from our existing asset base in 2014, and to delivering on our 
estimate of 1.2 Moz in 2013. We’re conﬁdent that both these 
priorities will be achieved during the coming year. 
Q.  A production target of 1.4 Moz 
seems now achievable – how do  
you see strategic development  
of the Company beyond 2014?
Although we have yet to deliver the 1.4 Moz, we are already 
looking at the next generation of assets to ensure growth 
beyond 2014. There are key decisions to be made in respect  
of this third generation of assets, including the expansion  
of Albazino and development of the two most signiﬁcant 
greenﬁeld targets, Kutyn and Svetloye. Albazino is the nearest 
target, and represents an excellent example of our exploration 
success. All three of these projects are subject to ongoing 
evaluation and the relevant development decisions will be 
made by the end of 2013 – beginning of 2014.
Q.  How has the Company changed 
since moving to London’s  
main market?
While we continue to go from strength to strength operationally, 
a key area of development has been the compliance with wider 
international standards of corporate governance. Clearly there 
is a far greater amount of attention on Polymetal from a far 
greater range of stakeholders, commentators and press 
regarding the Company’s performance, as well as more  
focus on governance and sustainability from an expanded  
and more demanding investor base. We are therefore 
continuing to focus strongly on governance, transparency  
and stakeholder relations. In general though, we are proud  
of our record of delivering on our promises as this has  
enabled us to outperform both the market and our peer  
group in terms of Total Shareholder Return and to deliver  
real value to our shareholders.
Q.  What would you describe as  
your main achievements and main 
disappointments during the year?
I’m pleased that our achievements have strongly outweighed 
any disappointments, so that while Amursk POX – despite 
achieving its ramp-up and initial production targets – did not 
deliver fully on target, the Company as a whole achieved an 
impressive 31% growth in production. The delay in full ramp-up 
of the Amursk POX does not undermine our conﬁdence for the 
future, and this conﬁdence is further boosted by the great 
progress we have made in other areas, such as the success  
of our growth projects at Omolon and Albazino, and signiﬁcant 
exploration success at both brownﬁeld and greenﬁeld projects.
M&A activity was limited, although a number of relatively small 
acquisitions may offer additional expansion opportunities – in 
particular the new platinum project and the Olcha brownﬁeld 
expansion at Dukat.
“ We are proud of our record of delivering  
on our promises as this has enabled us  
to outperform both the market and our 
peer group in terms of Total Shareholder  
Return and to deliver real value to  
our shareholders.”
 
 Vitaly Nesis
 Chief Executive
Q.  How are these achievements and 
areas for further focus impacting  
on your ﬁnancial performance?
The fact that we achieved production growth ahead of 
expectations, along with our stable performance at mature 
mines, meant that we also delivered improved cost efﬁciency 
and proﬁtability levels, including adjusted EBITDA growth of 
47% and stable total cash costs. In addition, the completion of 
some major growth projects combined with a strong operating 
cash ﬂow resulted in free cash ﬂow generation, a comfortable 
level of debt and solid proﬁtability. Importantly, this also 
enabled us to implement our industry-leading dividend policy, 
with a sizeable US$0.50 per share special dividend.

Business model Polymetal’s business model
Performing in line  
with our business model
Success in our market depends to a large 
extent on our ability to increase our resource 
base, continually develop systems that 
increase production efﬁciency, and improve 
grades. Our business model has therefore 
been developed to ensure that we have the 
best methodology and approach to address 
these issues, and ultimately to ensure that 
we continue to deliver sustainable value. 
Area of focus What we said What we are doing The future
Focusing on  
high-grade assets 
22
Read more about our assets on 22-59
We have a preference for open-pit 
mining unless higher grades justify 
underground development. Grades  
and mining conditions are the key cost 
factors that drive return on invested 
capital in the precious metals industry. 
By setting appropriate thresholds  
on head grades and focusing on 
open-pit mines we are achieving  
better returns and lower risks from  
our project portfolio.
The newest mines which were ramped 
up and/or are under construction –  
most importantly, Omolon hub, Albazino 
and Mayskoye – are all characterised  
by high reserve and resource grades, 
which reduces the project risk and 
ensures good cost levels despite 
complex logistics and weather 
conditions. Further, grade control 
remains a top priority at our existing 
operations thus supporting intense 
management focus on cost control.
Our focus on grade is also embedded 
in our thresholds and targets set for 
assessing organic and inorganic growth 
opportunities, in order to support 
Company’s grade proﬁle going forward. 
At the operational level, we are 
continuing to implement various 
initiatives both at mine planning and 
processing level to ensure continuous 
grade and recovery improvements.
Leveraging our  
hub-based system

Read more about our hubs on pages 6, 28-51
Creation of centralised facilities for the 
treatment of materials from different 
sources allows us to minimise 
processing and logistics costs and 
achieve economies of scale.
Omolon and Khakanja are both good 
examples of asset transformation 
supported by the hub concept.  
Both demonstrate solid performance 
improvement in 2012 in terms of 
production growth and cost reduction 
driven by addition of high-grade ore 
sources from medium and small-sized 
satellite deposits.
We are continuing to invest in 
brownﬁeld exploration and searching 
for synergistic M&A targets which  
could extend the life of existing 
operations and/or improve grade 
proﬁle, with acquisition of Olcha  
in 2013 being the latest example.
Investing in exploration
60
Read more on pages 20, 24, 60
This will allow us to ensure a cost-
effective increase in our reserve  
base which is, in turn, the key source  
of long-term organic growth.
Our exploration efforts in 2012 have 
resulted in meaningful growth in 
reserves and resources without 
compromising the grade. New resource 
additions at Albazino are the largest 
success of 2012.
Greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld exploration 
will continue to serve as the principal 
source of future growth assets, some  
of which (Albazino expansion,  
Kutyn and Svetloye) have already  
been identiﬁed.
Maintaining exemplary 
governance

We strive to ensure proper steering  
of the Company, accountability to 
shareholders and attention to other 
stakeholders’ interests.
Good corporate governance and 
listening to our shareholders remains  
a top priority of Polymetal Board and 
executive management, with key  
2012 developments including new 
progressive dividend policy and 
adopting best practices in executive 
remuneration. Health and Safety,  
as well as environmental and social 
performance, are also embedded  
in the management’s KPIs and  
remain an area of focus.
Going forward, the Board will 
continuously focus on compliance  
with UK best practice in corporate and 
on further improvement in health and 
safety record, as well as on maintaining 
a robust system of internal control.

and capital and cost effectiveness. We have 
further developed this system during the year,

This has been a very rewarding  
year in terms of production results, 
with total gold equivalent production  
of 1.06 Moz – 31% up on 2011, 
representing our best ever  
annual increase
Achievements
This excellent result was driven by strong all-round 
performance, with a notable improvement at Dukat and 
successful ramp-up at Omolon and Albazino, our key growth 
projects. Annual gold production increased to 589 Koz, up 
33% compared to 2011. Silver production was 26.5 Moz –  
also up 33% on 2011 – as a result of higher grades and 
recoveries at Dukat, successful processing of high-grade 
Sopka ore at Omolon, and increased grades at Khakanja.

The Group’s gold equivalent production (Kt)
+31%
We commissioned our ﬂagship Amursk plant and poured  
our ﬁrst gold in April 2012 as planned. While throughput did 
reach expected levels in late November, we then experienced 
some operational issues which have meant that we have not 
yet achieved expected levels of sustainable performance.  
However we have already implemented the necessary  
remedial measures, and are expecting recovery throughout  
the year with full capacity being achieved by the fourth quarter 
of 2013. In the meantime, we will be able to generate cash 
ﬂows by continuing concentrate sales to third-party off-takers.
What we said
Our original annual gold equivalent production estimate  
of 1 Moz for 2012 was increased during the year to  
1.05 Moz, and although we had set ourselves some  
typically stretching targets we ﬁnished the year delighted  
with the outcome.
What we did
 Achieved an increase of 14% in ore mined to 12,591 Kt.
 Achieved actual gold equivalent production for the year  
of 1,063 Moz, a 31% increase compared to 2011.
Production highlights included:
Dukat
Increased grade proﬁle, expansion of mining  
at Goltsovoye, and improved recovery levels  
at the main Omsukchan concentrator. 
Albazino/Amursk hub
The Albazino mine and concentrator reaching design 
capacity, start of commercial production at Amursk,  
combined with continued concentrate sales  
to third-party off-takers.  
Omolon
Dramatic increase in capacity at the Kubaka plant,  
higher than planned amounts of ore transported  
from Sopka. 
Khakanja
Grade proﬁle increase generating 28%  
production growth.  
Processing 
plants
The 46% increase in volume of ore processed and 114% 
growth in gold is a tremendous turnaround story from  
a previously under-performing asset, with production  
of 173 Koz of gold equivalent after transportation  
of high-grade ore from Sopka and the commissioning  
of the Merrill-Crowe circuit at the refurbished Kubaka plant.

strong position to make decisions on 
signiﬁcant new asset developments  
in the second half of 2013-early 2014.

Dividends
Our dividend policy in 2012 evolved  
in response to increased demand  
for dividend ﬂow from institutional 
investors across the world. It also 
highlighted our ability to generate 
meaningful free cash ﬂow at the 
current stage of our development.
Strong results from  
our exploration activities
Committed to capital  
discipline and a progressive 
dividend policy
What we said
At the time of our listing, we adopted a new dividend policy  
to reﬂect our commitment to meet shareholder expectations  
in an environment characterised on the one hand by high 
commodity prices, and tight ﬁnancial markets on the other.  
A dividend of US$0.20 per share was proposed, along with  
the intention to pay annual dividends of 20% of net income, 
provided that net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio is less  
than 1.75.
Greenﬁeld exploration
Investment in greenﬁeld exploration remains a key objective  
for us. Our target standalone mines need to meet the stringent 
criteria that drive the cost efﬁciencies and a strong return on 
capital invested. These criteria include high grade, preference 
for open-pit mining, potential operational synergies with 
existing assets and, most importantly, new projects will need  
to exceed our minimum hurdle rates in terms of internal rate  
of return, which are set based on the complexity and risk level 
of a particular project.
Greenﬁeld exploration efforts for new precious metals  
deposits are set to form the next generation of our growth 
assets and contribute to our longer-term growth prospects. 
The exploration expertise is therefore crucial for the  
long-term strategic development of the Company.
Key exploration results in 2012:
Albazino
The exploration results at Albazino highlight the tremendous 
potential of this asset, and are an excellent example of
Polymetal’s ability to create value by discovering high-grade 
resources close to existing processing facilities.
Khakanja, Dukat, Omolon, Varvara and Voro
Ongoing brownﬁeld exploration activities aimed at extension  
of life-of-mine of our existing operations. At Varvara, signiﬁcant 
resource and reserve additions were achieved as a result  
of in-ﬁll and step-out drilling.

Analysis of production results 
Mining 
Stripping volumes in 2012 grew by 6%, while underground 
development increased by 33% to 46.7 thousand metres, 
mainly due to our Dukat hub where ore is increasingly sourced 
from underground. Ore mined was 12,591 Kt, a 14% increase 
over 2011 level. The bulk of ore mined (87%), is sourced from 
open-pit. The key contributors of growth in ore mined were 
Khakanja (due to intensiﬁed mining at pit 3 and completion of 
underground mining at Yurievskoye) and Omolon (full capacity 
achieved at Sopka and commencement of mining at Tsokol), 
further complemented by a 45% increase in ore mined at 
Albazino as the mine achieved full capacity.
The average gold equivalent grade in ore mined was 4.1 g/t, 
increasing by 10% over the 2011 level of 3.8 g/t. The solid 
increase in grade proﬁle was driven mainly by increased share 
2012 became a year of solid operating 
results, with reliable delivery on 
increased production guidance revised 
upwards by 5% during the year, and 
successful ramp-up of new mines. 
This robust operating performance 
was further supported by a substantial 
increase in resource base, paving the 
way for development decisions on the 
third generation of growth assets.
Total gold equivalent production of 1,063 Koz was up 31% 
compared to 2011 and exceeded the original guidance  
of 1 Moz by 6%. These excellent results were driven by  
stable performance at all our mature mines, with a notable 
improvement achieved at Dukat, and successful ramp-up  
at Omolon and Albazino.
The strong operating results were combined with considerable 
exploration success, a dramatic increase of resource base at 
Albazino to nearly 6 Moz of gold and successful exploration 
results at Kutyn and Svetloye. As a result, the Company is 
steadily approaching development decisions on new asset 
development in the second half of 2013 – beginning of 2014. 
These are set to build up the ‘third generation’ of growth 
assets, ensuring growth beyond 2014.
Delivering on production and sales targets
Annual gold production was 589 Koz, up 33% year-on-year, 
driven mainly by successful ramp-up at Omolon and Albazino. 
Annual silver production was 26.5 Moz, up 33% year-on-year, 
as a result of higher grades and recoveries at Dukat, 
successful processing of high-grade Sopka ore at Omolon, 
and increased silver grades at Khakanja.
Importantly, metal sales for the full year exceeded production 
both for gold and silver. This was achieved by expected 
de-stockpiling of concentrate and reﬁned metals inventories 
– most importantly at Dukat and Omolon – accumulated  
in the ﬁrst six months of the year, and contributed to stronger 
operating cash ﬂows.
Delivering on key capital projects
We have made solid progress across our key construction 
projects, although some of them did not progress fully  
in line with our expectations, with a three-month delay in 
commissioning at Mayskoye and issues arising during the 
ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant. However, these issues  
did not have a material effect on our 2012 results and 2013 
production targets. Both Amursk and Mayskoye are now the 
key focus of 2013 for our management team, with deﬁned 
action plans in place.
In 2012, the key achievements across our growth projects 
included:
 The Albazino mine and concentrator reached design 
throughput and recovery from the second quarter  
of the year.
 The refurbished processing plant at Omolon with  
Merrill-Crowe section performed fully in line with 
expectations, processing more than 300 Kt of high gold  
and silver grade ore from satellite Sopka deposit.
 The majority of construction works were completed at the 
Mayskoye concentrator. Currently construction is on track  
for the revised start-up deadline in April 2013, with the  
only remaining works including installation of electrical, 
controlling, and auxiliary equipment.
of ore mined at Omolon and Albazino, our new higher grade 
mines, combined with increased average grades at these 
operations by 13% and 27% respectively. Importantly,  
average grades were also supported by a stable grade  
proﬁle at Dukat while ore mined grew 8% year-on-year.
Processing 
Ore processed was up 13% in 2012 and reached 9,925 Kt. 
This solid increase was mainly driven by full ramp-up of 
processing facilities at Albazino (reaching design throughput 
and recovery in the ﬁrst half of the year, resulting in a twofold 
increase) and commencement of processing of ore from 
Sopka at the newly commissioned Merrill-Crowe section  
of Kubaka plant (Omolon hub). Our mature mines 
demonstrated stable performance at their nameplate  
capacity or slightly above. 
As expected, average gold equivalent grade in ore processed 
grew by 15% to 4.4 g/t (slightly above our average reserve 
grade of 3.9 g/t) as the growth in processing volumes came 
mainly from our new high-grade mines – Omolon (with 
processing high-grade ore from Sopka, average grade 
processed grew almost threefold year-on-year) and Albazino 
(contributing 12% of total ore processed by the Group in 2012, 
up from 7% in 2011). At Khakanja, there was an increase in 
average silver grade due to processing of higher-grade ores 
from Khakanja’s pit 3 and Avlayakan.
Production 
Our original annual gold equivalent production guidance  
of 1 Moz for 2012 was subsequently increased to 1.05 Moz  
by the end of the third quarter, on the back of the strong 
operating results achieved. Actual gold equivalent production 
for the year was 1,063 Moz, a 31% increase compared  
to 2011, and exceeded the elevated guidance.
Major contributions to production growth were attributable  
to four operations: 
 Dukat – with the increased grade proﬁle due to 
implementation of new underground mining methods, 
expansion of mining at Goltsovoye, and sustainably 
improved recovery levels at the main Omsukchan 
concentrator.
 Albazino/Amursk hub – as a result of the Albazino mine 
and concentrator reaching design throughput and recoveries 
by the second quarter of the year and commencement  
of commercial production at the Amursk POX, combined 
with continued concentrate sales to third-party offtakers.

The key highlight of our exploration activities in 2012 was  
a signiﬁcant resource expansion at Albazino (see page 44).  
The updated resource estimate will be further converted  
to reserves in 2014, with an objective to produce a feasibility 
study for the expansion at Albazino and take construction 
decisions in the ﬁrst half of 2014.
In addition, we have increased mineralised potential (internal 
non-JORC estimate, inclusive of resources) at some of our 
greenﬁeld targets, notably Kutyn (+0.6 Moz of gold contained). 
We have also made solid progress at the other greenﬁeld 
targets, locating additional ore intercepts at Svetloye and Elmus.
At the operating mines, further progress was made at:
 Ozerny (Khakanja hub) – mining started in Q4 2012, 
resources converted to reserves;
 Avlayakan (Khakanja hub) – while trial open-pit mining 
continued, additional in-ﬁll drilling was performed in 
preparation for underground mining; resource to reserve 
conversion achieved;
 Varvara – signiﬁcant resource and reserve additions 
achieved as a result of in-ﬁll and step-out drilling; and
 Burgali and Prognoz (Omolon hub) – additional drilling  
results received and ongoing preparation for resource 
estimates for these potential additional ore sources  
for the Kubaka plant is underway.
 Omolon – as originally planned, the amount of ore 
processed at the Kubaka plant increased dramatically  
due to processing of high-grade ore from Sopka at the  
newly commissioned Merrill-Crowe section. The amount  
of ore transported from Sopka by winter road was higher 
than planned. As a result, some ore trucking and  
processing was shifted from 2013 to 2012.
 At Khakanja, growth of 28% has been achieved due  
to increased grade proﬁle.
 Voro and Varvara demonstrated stable performance  
in terms of grades and recoveries.
Production dynamics on a quarterly basis are represented  
on the graph below. The seasonal ore transportation at 
Omolon (trucking of ore from Sopka by winter road in the ﬁrst 
quarter, processing in the second and third quarter), as well  
as seasonal heap leaching operation at Voro contributed to  
a stronger production proﬁle in the second and third quarters 
of the year. Such seasonality is expected to continue in 2013.  
In 2014, after full ramp-up of the Mayskoye concentrator and 
commissioning of an all-year-round heap leaching facility at 
Birkachan, the seasonal ﬂuctuations are set to reduce.

Metal sales in 2012 were 1,092 Koz of gold equivalent, 
representing an impressive 43% increase over 2011.
In 2012, the Company continued sales of concentrates  
from Dukat (gold-silver), Varvara (gold-copper) and Albazino 
(refractory gold) to off-takers in Kazakhstan and China.  
For Dukat and Varvara, the off-take allows us to maximise 
margins compared to in-house processing of these materials. 
Sales of concentrates to third party off-takers will continue in 
2013, while the Company will seek to diversify off-taker base  
in order to achieve an optimal combination of transportation 
costs and treatment charges/recoveries.
For Albazino, sales to off-takers in China allow us to receive 
immediate cashﬂows and avoid building excessive stockpiles 
while the Amursk POX plant is undergoing the ramp-up 
process. In 2012, a total of 63.5 Koz of payable gold was sold 
to Chinese off-takers, and we are currently considering the 
option to continue sales of Albazino concentrate to third-party 
off-takers for 2013 until the POX plant reaches its full capacity.
Exploration 
We are conducting exploration works in four regions of  
Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Karelia, and Sverdlovsk –  
as well as in Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently has 54 licences 
for geological studies, exploration and gold, silver and copper 
mining, and one coal mining licence. Our current exploration 
portfolio includes 43 licences with a total area of approximately 
10,503 km
2
.
Exploration activities in 2012 were concentrated on 31 licensed 
areas, of which seven are at an advanced stage.
Key exploration objectives for 2012 were: 
 ongoing brownﬁeld exploration activities aimed at extending 
mine lives at our existing operations: Khakanja (with the 
shortest current life-of-mine), Dukat, Omolon, Varvara,  
and Voro; 
 continued exploration activities at Albazino with a view to 
considerably expanding the resource base, as suggested  
by earlier exploration results; and
 greenﬁeld exploration for new precious metals deposits  
with a potential resource base which would be sufﬁcient  
in grade and size to justify construction of a standalone  
mine. Such targets are set to form the next generation  
of our growth assets and ensure the Company’s long-term  
growth prospects.

Average resource grade, GE g/t 3.3 3.9 -16%
In 2012, we have achieved meaningful increases both in ore 
reserves and mineral resources. Ore reserves grew by 6% to 
15.1 Moz of gold equivalent, more than offsetting the depletion 
at our operating mines. The key additions were the resource-
to-reserve conversions at Tsokol and Dalneye (Omolon hub)  
and Avlayakan and Ozerny (Khakanja hub), adding a total of 
0.8 Moz of gold and 8.7 Moz of silver, as well as Goltsovoye 
(Dukat hub) where following an external audit we have 
converted a total of 20.1 Moz of silver to reserves. At Varvara, 
copper ore reserves nearly doubled to 83 Kt and gold reserves 
increased by 39% to 1.2 Moz as a result of additional in-ﬁll  
and step-out drilling performed at the ﬂanks of the deposit.
More importantly, our resource base grew 35% during the year 
in gold equivalent terms. The major contributor of growth in 
gold resources was the doubling of the resource base at 
Albazino (+ 3.1 Moz, reaching a total of 5.7 Moz inclusive of 
reserves), marking an important exploration success for the 
Company. In addition, an initial resource estimate was made 
and audited for Tamunier, our greenﬁeld exploration property  
in the Urals, resulting in resource addition of 1.5 Moz of gold. 
The decrease in silver resources is mainly attributable  
to resource-to-reserve conversions at Goltsovoye,  
Tsokol, Ozerny and Avlayakan (see above). Re-evaluation  
of resources at Varvara resulted in a four-fold increase  
in copper resources to 281 Kt, in addition to a 1.0 Moz  
increase in gold mineral resources.

Operating review The year ahead
In 2013 our team will be fully focused on achieving our 
production guidance of 1.2 Moz of gold equivalent, most 
importantly by achieving full ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant 
and timely commissioning and ramp-up of the Mayskoye 
concentrator. By completing these two complex projects, we 
will ensure that the second generation of growth assets fully 
achieves design capacity, allowing us to reach the strategic 
level of 1.4 Moz annual gold equivalent production in 2014. 
Subsequently we will be increasingly focused on growth 
opportunities beyond 2014, representing a new third 
generation of growth assets. 
Operations
We are aiming to produce approximately 1.2 Moz of gold 
equivalent in 2013, including approximately 760-800 Koz  
of gold and approximately 23-24 Moz of silver and 5-6 Kt  
of copper. Growth will be mostly achieved in gold, which  
in 2013 will represent approximately 65% of the total gold 
equivalent production.
The key growth contributions will be coming from Albazino, 
which is to deliver full year of production at design capacity, 
combined with ramp-up of the Amursk POX. To secure our 
production proﬁle in 2013, we will additionally consider sales  
of Albazino concentrate to third-party off-takers in order  
to avoid excessive build-up of concentrate inventories  
during the ramp-up process of the POX plant. 
Another important milestone will be the commissioning and 
start of commercial production at Mayskoye, which is 
scheduled for April 2013. The concentrate produced in the 
second and third quarters will then be shipped to the Amursk 
POX for processing and/or to potential off-takers – an option 
which we would welcome in the light of potential expansion  
at Albazino.
By 2014, the existing portfolio of assets – including Albazino 
and Mayskoye – should achieve full capacity, with annual gold 
equivalent production reaching at 1.4 Moz.
Another area of focus in 2013 will be the progress on 
development decisions for the third generation of growth 
assets, including potential expansion at Albazino, and 
development of Kutyn, Svetloye and Maminskoye projects. 
These decisions will be based on reserve estimates and 
feasibility studies which are expected to be completed  
in the second half of 2013.
In pursuit of synergistic M&A
Growth through synergistic, value-driven M&A is an important 
part of our strategy. While there were no large or medium-sized 
transactions during the year, we continued to closely monitor 
the market and made a number of smaller transactions which 
meet our stringent acquisition criteria.
Acquisition of Svetlobor platinum exploration project
In December 2012, we acquired a 25% interest in the Svetlobor 
project, a greenﬁeld platinum deposit, with another 75%  
to be acquired upon receipt of regulatory approvals. The 
transaction was settled in Polymetal share, valuing the project 
at approximately US$10 million. The acquisition of Svetlobor 
represents our ﬁrst acquisition in PGMs (platinum group 
metals), driven by combination of outstanding exploration 
potential and the expected platinum price upside on the back 
of recent labour disruptions and production cuts in South 
Africa, currently accounting for 73% of global supply.
The Svetlobor project is a hard-rock source of the largest 
platinum alluvial deposit in the world, located in a developed 
industrial region approximately 250 km north of Ekaterinburg, 
Urals. Polymetal has an established presence in the region, 
which will allow us to leverage both its developed infrastructure 
and our own skill base there.
We believe this early-stage exploration project has the potential 
to grow into a world-class asset in terms of the size and quality 
of its mineral resource base, potentially resulting in a very  
large low grade (approximately 1.5 g/t) open-pit operation with 
low stripping ratio and simple metallurgy. We plan to publish  
a mineral resource estimate for the project under JORC 
guidelines in Q4 of 2014.
Acquisition of Olcha deposit (completed in January 2013)
In December 2012, we agreed to acquire the Olcha gold-silver 
deposit for 775,000 of the Company’s ordinary shares, valuing 
it at approximately US$13.5 million. The transaction was 
completed in January 2013.
Olcha represents a good opportunity to add another high-
grade source of feed for the Lunnoye plant, with total resources 
currently estimated at 0.7 Moz of gold equivalent. In addition, 
Olcha is a natural extension of our portfolio of advanced 
exploration properties in the Magadan Region. The mining  
and exploration licence covers an area of 2.5 km
2
 in the region 
and is located approximately 215 km from the  
Lunnoye processing plant and 230 km from the Kubaka 
processing plant, part of the Dukat and Omolon processing 
hubs respectively.
In line with Polymetal’s strategy, acquisition of Olcha is 
expected to:
 extend life-of-mine at Lunnoye by processing high-grade  
ore from the new source; 
 ensure effective use of open-pit mining equipment and 
qualiﬁed personnel after the cessation of open-pit mining  
at Dukat and Arylakh in 2013; and
 gain exploration upside within a substantially under-explored 
licence area.
We plan to start open-pit mining at Olcha in Q1 2014 and 
processing in Q2 2014.
Acquisition of Maminskoye (completed in April 2013)
Subsequent to the year-end, the Company agreed to  
purchase the Maminskoye project for a total consideration of 
US$77.2 million, mostly payable in shares. Maminskoye is a 
sizeable gold deposit which could potentially be quickly turned 
into a 2-3 Mtpa heap leach operation yielding 80-120 Koz  
of gold production per annum. The deposit is located in the 
well-developed Sverdlovsk Region (Urals) which is familiar to 
the Company and has excellent infrastructure and availability  
of qualiﬁed labour. The transaction was completed in April 
2013, with the ﬁrst gold production scheduled for Q2 2016.  
The project enjoys easy open-pit mining conditions and simple 
metallurgy, allowing signiﬁcant optionality in development 
routes for Polymetal and an excellent return on capital at a low 
level of risk.
Restructuring of interest in Veduga project
In the ﬁrst half of 2012, we completed the restructuring of our 
interest in the Veduga deposit in Krasnoyarsk region, previously 
held as a 50:50 joint venture with Anglo-Gold Ashanti. 
Anglo-Gold Ashanti has sold its share in the project, and a new 
company, Polygon Gold Inc., took over a 100% interest in the 
deposit. Polymetal currently holds a 43% stake in the new 
company. Polygon will operate as a standalone company with 
independent management, while Polymetal plans to provide 
certain technical and regulatory assistance to Polygon on  
an ongoing basis. The transaction has allowed us to ﬁnd  
a competent owner for this non-core asset that is prepared  
to take it into production.
In terms of development of the existing asset portfolio and 
continuous improvement of our mining and processing 
facilities, the priorities for 2013 are:
 commencement of underground mining at Arylakh  
(Dukat hub) and Avlayakan (Khakanja hub);
 commencement of open-pit mining at Olcha (Dukat hub) 
and Dalneye (Omolon hub);
 continued development of the complex logistics chains  
in the remote locations of our operations, including 
development of the own barge ﬂeet and construction  
of winter roads, thus ensuring reliability and safety  
of supply of ores and consumables;
 continued implementation of best practices in health  
and safety risk management, with rolling out the existing 
processes to our key suppliers; and
 development of infrastructure at Kutyn and Svetloye  
for the extension of exploration activities there.
Exploration
In 2013, our exploration activities will be concentrated on:
 continued resource-to-reserve conversions and resource 
category updates at our advanced standalone exploration 
targets and brownﬁeld targets through in-ﬁll drilling; 
 additional drilling at the ﬂanks of Ozerny and Avlayakan with 
a view to extend life-of-mine at Khakanja;
 further increase of resource potential at Albazino through 
additional underground development and drilling at Olga 
zone, in-ﬁll drilling at Ekaterina-1 and Ekaterina-2 zones, and 
additional step-out drilling at the ﬂanks of the Albazino ﬁeld;
 completion of resource estimate at Burgali and continued 
exploration at the other brownﬁeld targets in the Omolon  
hub area;
 in-ﬁll drilling and ﬁnalisation of resource estimates at Olcha 
and preparation for open-pit mining. Exploration for new ore 
bodies in the area; 
 continued exploration at the two key greenﬁeld targets –  
Kutyn and Svetloye, followed by resource estimates and 
preparation of oxidized ores for open-pit; 
 continued scoping and exploration at Elmus and Semchen 
areas in Karelia, with a view to developing a new standalone 
asset in the region; and
 preparation of Maminskoye resources for open-pit mining 
and step-out drilling at the ﬂanks of the deposit.
All of these activities are focused on delivering production 
growth beyond 2014, when we will have achieved our target 
level of production for the existing asset portfolio. With a 
diversiﬁed set of targets at various stages of development, 
some of them already approaching construction decisions  
in 2013, this growth already has a solid foundation.

Priorities for 2013
In 2013, development of our mining 
operations at Dukat will be increasingly 
focused on the efﬁciency of our 
underground operations. At our main 
Dukat mine we will completely shift  
to underground mining, with an 
automated ore trucking system 
expected to be commissioned in the 
second half of 2013. The system will 
allow fully automated ore underground 
transportation by rail, allowing us to 
achieve a total 1500 Ktpa capacity at  
the Dukat mine in the medium term. 
Mining works will also develop at  
the Vostochny part of the deposit.  
At Goltsovoye, we expect signiﬁcant 
growth in ore mined following the 
completion of preparatory works and  
a change in mining method. At Arylakh, 
along with the start of underground 
mining, exploration of ore zone 9 will be 
performed. At Lunnoye, mining works 
will continue at ore zone 7.
In 2013 we plan to construct a winter 
road to access the newly acquired 
Olcha deposit, which will start to supply 
ore to the Lunnoye plant from 2014 
(open-pit mining to start in Q1 2014).  
At the Lunnoye processing plant, 
operations will be focused on the 
automation of the processing facility  
and debottlenecking with a target to 
increase capacity to 400 Ktpa in 2014.

Mining
Our Dukat hub currently has ﬁve ore sources, with another 
three deposits in the exploration and/or development stage.  
In 2012, solid progress was achieved across the operating 
mines, resulting in an 8% increase in total ore mined  
to 1,782 Kt and stable average silver grade mined  
of nearly 400 g/t.
At the main Dukat mine, open-pit mining has been  
completed, with further mining works from 2013 fully focused 
on underground mining. Underground development grew  
by an impressive 55% to 24.3 thousand metres in 2012.  
The amount of ore mined was 1,328 Kt, an 11% growth, with 
almost 90% of ore sourced from underground. Stable average  
grades of 387 g/t silver were achieved, backed by completion 
of implementation of automated mine planning using  
Datamine software.
At Goltsovoye, underground development was focused  
on access to ore bodies 9 and 3 and grew by 24% to  
5.2 thousand metres. The amount of ore mined was lower 
compared to 2011, at 84 Kt; however it is set to grow almost 
twofold in 2013 since the development works have now been 
completed. The test works performed in 2012 for sublevel 
blast-hole stoping method have yielded positive results 
compared to previously used shrinkage stoping method,  
and the application of this mining method in 2013  
is expected to increase both efﬁciency and grade control.
At Arylakh, open-pit mining is approaching completion  
which is expected in Q2 2013, to be followed by underground 
development. Ore mined in 2012 grew by 6% to 167 Kt, 
combined with increased average silver grade of 519 g/t,  
a 10% growth.
Underground development at Lunnoye focused on ore zone 7 
and grew 88% compared to 2011. Ore mined was 24% above 
2011, with the average silver grade slightly short of 300 g/t.
Processing
Ore processed at the main Omsukchan concentrator was 
stable at 1,439 Kt. Due to increased silver grades driven by 
stable grade proﬁle at Dukat and growth in silver grades at 
Goltsovoye, average grade processed was up 5% compared 
to 2012. Average recoveries grew by 7% for gold and  
by 10% for silver to 81% and 84% respectively, following  
a refurbishment of the plant and installation of the gravity circuit 
in 2011, and full implementation of the geotechnical mapping 
system in 2012 which is used to determine technological 
parameters of the process adjusted for the mineralogical 
properties ore feed. As a result, annual silver production  
at the Omsukchan concentrator grew by 14% to 15.5 Moz 
while average gold production was stable at 25 Koz.
At the Lunnoye processing plant, a record 333 Kt of ore has 
been processed, exceeding nameplate capacity of 300 Ktpa. 
While average silver grades and recoveries were stable, an 
increase in throughput allowed us to achieve an increase  
in silver production to 3.7 Moz, growth of 9% compared to 
2011. Ongoing debottlenecking at the plant is expected to 
increase throughput to 400 ktpa by 2014 with additional  
ore to be sourced from the recently acquired Olcha deposit.

Priorities for 2013
In the coming year, mining volumes  
at Birkachan and Sopka will decrease  
as we are planning to draw down the 
existing ore stockpiles. We are planning 
to truck more than 280 Kt of high-grade 
ore from Sopka by winter road, and 
mining at Tsokol will grow since the mine 
will be operational for the full calendar 
year. Development of the Dalneye 
deposit is underway, with mining 
scheduled for the second half of 2013.
In 2013, an all-year-round heap leach 
facility will be commissioned at 
Birkachan, with production scheduled 
for the second half of 2013. Low-grade 
ore stacking at Birkachan HL 
continues, with a total 116 Kt of ore 
stacked in the second half of 2012.  
A stationary carbon-in-column plant  
at Birkachan to recover gold from  
heap leaching is on track to be 
commissioned in June 2013.
Preparatory works for the installation  
of heap leaching pads at Sopka will  
take place in 2013, with commissioning  
of the facility scheduled for 2015.
Average grades processed at the 
Kubaka plant will be slightly lower than 
in 2012 due to lower volumes of Sopka 
ore which will be processed in the year. 
This will be compensated for by an 
expected increase in total throughput  
to more than 770 Ktpa.

Mining
Mining works at the Omolon hub are now performed at three 
deposits: Birkachan (where high-grade ore is processed at  
the Kubaka plant and lower grade ore is prepared for year-
round heap leaching on-site, which will be started in 2013); 
Sopka (high-grade ore trucked to Kubaka by winter road,  
lower grade ore stockpiled for further heap leaching which  
is expected to be commissioned in 2015); and Tsokol where 
mining started in the second half of 2012 (also processed  
at the Kubaka plant).
Stripping volumes grew by 67% year-on-year, mostly due  
to a massive stripping campaign at Sopka in the middle of the 
year to prepare ore bodies for active mining in Q4 and in 2013, 
and due to an initial stripping campaign at Tsokol. Total ore 
mined grew to 2,662 Kt, an increase of 38% compared to 2011, 
mostly as a result of major increase in mining at Sopka (by 73%), 
and the start of mining at Tsokol in the third quarter of the year. 
At Sopka, ore mined grew to 1,271 Kt, with 324 Kt representing 
high-grade ore for processing at the Kubaka mill (average 
grades of 6.2 g/t gold and 248 g/t silver), and 947 Kt of heap 
leach ore (0,9 g/t gold and 45 g/t silver). The construction of the 
heap leaching facility at Sopka will start in the summer of 2013.
A major success of the year was the operation of a 180-km 
long winter road from the Sopka mine to the Kubaka mill, 
which allowed us to truck more than 330 Kt of ore during 
January-April, exceeding our initial expectations. This high-
grade ore was then processed during the second and third

quarters of the year. The winter road set up in December 2012 
opened on time and it began successful operation in the 2013 
trucking season.
In the third quarter we started mining high gold grade ore at 
Tsokol, a new satellite deposit for Omolon located near Kubaka 
plant. The ﬁrst 101 Kt grading 5.2 g/t gold were mined and 
processed in 2012.
At Birkachan, ore mined grew by 8% year-on-year, while 
average gold grade in ore mined grew by 5% for heap leach 
ore and by 9% for milling ore (to 3.2 g/t). In 2013, we expect  
a decrease in mining volumes in order to de-stockpile the 
operation after intensive mining during 2011 and 2012. 
Processing
The refurbished processing plant with its Merrill-Crowe section 
has performed fully in line with expectations. Total throughput 
increased by 26% compared to 2011 to 724 Kt, while average 
grades in ore processed grew dramatically, due to inclusion of 
ores from Sopka and Tsokol, to 5.9 g/t gold and 135 g/t silver, 
a multiple-times increase compared to 2011. Average recovery 
also grew to 94% for gold and 88% for silver as a result  
of commissioning the Merrill-Crowe section which  
quickly achieved the design parameters.
As a result, gold production grew to 129 Koz and silver 
production to 2.7 Moz, representing a nearly four-fold increase 
compared to 2011 in gold equivalent terms. Due to the larger 
than expected volume of ore trucked and processed from 
Sopka, some of the planned 2013 production was shifted to 2012.

Exploration
During 2012, based on prior exploration results, we converted 
resources at Tsokol and Dalneye to reserves, resulting in  
a total addition of nearly 0.5 Moz of gold equivalent to the  
hub’s reserve base.
Our current exploration programme is aimed at further 
extension of the life-of-mine at the Kubaka plant by discovering 
additional resources within 150-180 km range from the 
processing facility. Key targets include Burgali, where we are 
currently preparing a resource estimate, and Prognoz, where 
substantial in-ﬁll drilling and geotechnical studies were carried 
out. The ore properties at Prognoz indicate that it is easily 
amenable for leaching and can be economically processed  
at the Kubaka plant, whereas at Burgali a resource estimate  
is expected in 2013.

The Amursk pressure oxidation plant 
(POX) is unquestionably a key project 
and one that will give us a signiﬁcant 
competitive advantage both nationally 
and in the global gold industry.  
This state-of-the art facility is the ﬁrst 
operating POX plant in the former 
Soviet Union’s gold sector, and by 
exploiting this technology we will open 
up opportunities for the economic 
processing of refractory gold deposits 
in Russia and the CIS which are 
currently idle due to the low recovery 
rate achievable by conventional 
processing methods. Further, Amursk 
POX’s location, with its access to 
cheap power, infrastructure, and 
qualiﬁed labour, will ensure attractive 
cost levels and stability of output.

Priorities for 2013
Full ramp-up of the Amursk POX  
to capacity throughput and recovery 
remains a top priority of our 
management team.
The POX was successfully restarted  
in mid-January. Gold recoveries are 
expected to normalise once all chlorine 
is removed from the ﬂow sheet (with 
water in dry tailings) and additional 
water treatment equipment is installed 
to handle ﬂuctuations in the chemical 
composition of concentrate and 
make-up process water. Throughput  
will continue to be affected until  
Inconel parts are replaced by the  
ones made from titanium and ferralium 
(not susceptible to corrosion in the  
presence of chlorine-ion). 
Full replacement of inconel by titanium 
will require a six-week shutdown in  
Q2 2013. During this shutdown certain 
changes to lime/limestone preparation 
and concentrate intake sections will be 
undertaken as the actual properties  
of concentrate in the process differ  
from certain design assumptions.  
We therefore expect to achieve  
a steady level of operation at capacity 
throughput and recovery in Q4 of 2013.
To avoid build-up of excessive 
concentrate stockpiles, we are  
currently reviewing the possibility  
to restart sale of concentrates from 
Albazino in Q2 of 2013.

Performance in 2012
Construction of the Amursk POX facility was completed in 
2011, and the plant started the commissioning process at the 
beginning of 2012. The ﬁrst gold was poured in April, and the 
ramp-up process started with a gradual increase in throughput 
applied across all of the plant’s sections. Lower grade third-
party and own concentrates were used during the ramp-up 
process in order to avoid excessive losses into tailings.
The ramp-up process however did not develop fully in line  
with our expectations. In the third quarter, due to mechanical  
issues – mainly defective stainless pipe welding – the facility 
underwent several lengthy maintenance shutdowns which  
led to a material delay in the original ramp-up schedule.
During October and November the plant was steadily ramping 
up towards capacity daily throughput, with several scheduled 
shutdowns which were required to complete the necessary 
upgrades of high-pressure stainless-steel pipes, weighing 
down on the total amount of concentrate processed and 
average recoveries. In early December the plant successfully 
ramped up to full throughput and approximately 90% recovery. 
However in mid-December the presence of chlorine in the 
process water caused a signiﬁcant decrease in recoveries and 
accelerated the corrosion of certain parts of the circuit made 
from complex alloys. To prevent loss of gold to tailings, the 
facility was shut down in late December. Subsequently, the 
source of the chlorine in the process water was traced to 
limestone used to neutralise discharge from the autoclave. 
Limestone supply was changed accordingly and measures  
to implement chlorine control for all incoming consumables 
were put in place.
As a result, a total of 16 Kt of Albazino concentrate was 
processed at Amursk POX during 2012, below our initial 
expectations. With artiﬁcially lower average gold grades  
in concentrate of 38 g/t, and an average recovery of 79% 
(including periods of shutdowns and restarts, when the 
recoveries are lower due to lower-than-designed pressure  
and temperature), this has resulted in total gold production  
of 14 Koz in 2012.
Potential impact from Albazino expansion
The expected expansion of mining operations and 
concentrator capacity at Albazino will also require additional 
capacity at the POX plant, which was originally designed to 
process 225 Ktpa of concentrate from a mix of Albazino and 
Mayskoye output. This capacity can be freed up by redirecting 
concentrate from Mayskoye to third-party off-takers instead  
of internal processing at the Amursk POX – a much preferred 
option which will allow signiﬁcant capital expenditure savings. 
The POX facility will then be fully focused on processing 
concentrates from Albazino with uniform chemical content. 
Alternatively, we are considering the simultaneous expansion  
of the mine and concentrator at Albazino and the POX facility  
at Amursk, which has sufﬁcient land and infrastructure on-site. 
This decision will largely depend on the potential off-take 
conditions for Mayskoye. We expect that even in the event  
of POX expansion, the experience gained during construction 
and ramp-up of the existing facility will be of great value, 
allowing us to reduce cost and time to launch.

Albazino is our newest operating 
mine, and is a major greenﬁeld 
exploration success. 2012 was a 
remarkable year for the asset, with 
the mine and concentrator achieving 
expected throughput and recoveries, 
and a major exploration success 
during the year which places 
Albazino in the world class assets 
league. As a result, Albazino 
produced more than 180 Koz  
of gold in concentrate in 2012, and 
the resource base has doubled 
compared to the beginning of the 
year. In 2013, further improvements 
in performance are expected as soon 
as the Amursk POX plant reaches 
capacity. On the back of this sizeable 
resource increase, we are now 
undertaking a feasibility study for 
Albazino-2 with a view to expanding 
the mine and concentrator.

Priorities for 2013
The year ahead will be an important 
milestone in the development  
of Albazino.
In 2013, the Albazino mine and 
concentrator will operate at capacity  
for a full year, which will lead to further 
growth in mining and processing 
volumes. We will reconsider the option 
to use the off-take agreements during 
the continued ramp-up of the Amursk 
POX plant, which is expected to 
achieve capacity for throughput and 
recoveries by Q4 2013. Therefore gold 
production will be split between POX 
and off-take.
A number of cost saving and 
debottlenecking measures will be 
implemented, in addition to the 
expected cost savings which will 
emerge as soon as the concentrate 
processing is fully redirected  
to the POX plant.
We will continue the development of the 
underground decline and underground 
in-ﬁll drilling at the Olga zone, and will 
also focus on detalisation of the ore 
bodies at zones Ekaterina-1 and 
Ekaterina-2. Further exploration will  
be performed at the ﬂanks of the 
Albazino ﬁeld, with a view to 
discovering additional resources.
A conversion of the newly discovered 
mineral resources to reserves and  
the feasibility study for the Albazino 
expansion project are expected to be 
produced in the ﬁrst half of 2014, with  
the construction decision to be put  
to the Board for approval by the middle 
of 2014.

Exploration success and our expansion plans
As a result of our extensive exploration programme between 
2009 and 2012, several new zones were identiﬁed and a new 
mineral resource estimate totalling 37 Mt at an average grade 
of 4.8 g/t, more than doubling the total resource base to  
a total of 5.7 Moz (inclusive of ore reserves), was prepared  
and audited in 2012. The cost of discovery was approximately  
US$12 dollars per ounce of resources.
The mineral resources and ore reserves estimates now cover 
ﬁve ore zones: Olga, Anﬁsa, Nadezhda, Ekaterina-1 and 
Ekaterina-2. Anﬁsa is currently subject to open-pit mining.  
The development plan for other zones will be determined after 
the completion of the optimisation study, currently expected  
in Q2 2013.
In 2012, the Nadezhda and Olga zones were combined in  
a single ore zone, and new mineralised intersections were 
discovered south of Ekaterina-2. We have also started 
underground exploration of deep ore bodies in the Olga zone.
Active exploration at Albazino is ongoing with further resource 
potential identiﬁed, most importantly at Ekaterina-2 and the 
new Tatyana zone. In-ﬁll underground drilling in 1H 2013 is 
expected to lead to a substantial upgrade of inferred resources 
and allow meaningful resource-to-reserve conversion.
The exploration results at Albazino highlight the tremendous 
potential of this asset and pave the way for an expansion 
decision to be taken in the second half of 2013 – beginning  
of 2014. Albazino has become an excellent example of 
Polymetal’s ability to create value by discovering high-grade 
ounces close to existing processing facilities. 
Different options are currently being considered for the 
Albazino expansion, and decisions are to be made in 2013-
2014 during the feasibility study. The expansion project will 
beneﬁt from a common infrastructure with the current mine, 
but power generation capacity and concentrator expansion  
will still require signiﬁcant additional capital expenditure.  
We are also evaluating different options for mining operations 
at the new zones, including a combination of open-pit and 
underground mining or a large single open-pit.
Further, the refractory nature of the ore, similar to the current 
ore mined at Albazino, will require additional capacity at the 
POX plant. This capacity can be secured by re-directing 
concentrate from Mayskoye to third-party off-takers instead  
of internal processing at the Amursk POX – a much preferred 
option which will allow signiﬁcant capital expenditure savings. 
Alternatively, we are considering simultaneous expansion  
of the mine and concentrator at Albazino and the POX facility  
at Amursk, which has sufﬁcient land and on-site infrastructure 
available. This decision will largely depend on the potential 
off-take conditions for Mayskoye.
Mining
The open-pit mine at Albazino quickly achieved its target 
capacity in 2012, with 1,216 Kt of ore mined in the year,  
a 45% increase over 2011. Importantly, as the mine has 
accessed deeper levels of the pit, grades grew from 4.3 g/t  
in 2011 to 5.4 g/t in 2012, a 27% increase. Mining volumes  
are set to further increase in 2013.
Processing
The ﬂotation concentrator at Albazino, commissioned in 2011, 
reached capacity throughput and recovery by Q2 2012.  
Total ore processed grew twofold to 1,226 Kt of ore,  
while average gold grade processed grew 23% to 5.3 g/t. 
Recoveries to concentrate grew to 87%, up from 70% in 2011, 
marking a successful ramp-up of the plant. As a result, gold  
in concentrate produced was 181 Koz, a threefold increase 
compared to 2011. Out of 115 Kt of concentrate produced  
(with an average gold grade of 49 g/t), 40 Kt with 63.5 Koz  
of payable gold content was sold during the year to third-party 
off-takers in China, allowing us to maximise cash ﬂows during 
the ramp-up period at the Amursk POX plant. As the POX 
facility has started its ramp-up process from April 2012, a 
further 16 Kt of concentrate were processed at the POX plant 
in 2012, yielding production of 14 Koz of gold. Total Albazino 
gold production in the year was 77 Koz, up 2.6 times 
compared to 2011.
Ongoing improvement process
In 2012, several small-scale infrastructural projects were 
underway at Albazino. All of them are focused on 
debottlenecking the mine and enhancing its infrastructure.  
We have started construction of an all-year-round road which 
will connect Albazino and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in order to 
optimise outbound concentrate logistics for delivery to Amursk 
POX and inbound supplies and personnel logistics. The road  
is expected to be commissioned in the middle of 2013.  
An emulsion explosives plant has been constructed, with 
operations starting in early 2013.

operation and our second mine  
with refractory ore brought into 
production. The development of this 
underground mine in a distant region 
of Chukotka – with access by sea  
only possible during the summer 
navigation period – is justiﬁed by its 
average reserve grade of 9.6 g/t, one 
of the highest across our portfolio.

Priorities for 2013
We continue to deliver the remaining 
small batches of equipment for  
the construction of the Mayskoye 
concentrator. Construction is on track  
for the revised start-up deadline in April 
2013, with works currently concentrated 
on the installation of electrical, 
controlling, and auxiliary equipment.
Given the more than twofold resource 
expansion at Albazino and targeted 
construction decision for the expansion 
of the Albazino mine and concentrator  
in H2 2013, we will assess and make  
the decision on the option of third-party 
concentrate off-take for Mayskoye  
in 2013. This will potentially allow  
us to signiﬁcantly reduce capital 
expenditure on the expansion project  
by fully re-allocating existing POX 
capacity to the processing of 
concentrate from Albazino.
Negotiations with potential off-take 
partners have already started, and the 
decision will be taken upon start-up of 
the Mayskoye concentrator after larger 
samples of concentrate have been 
tested by off-takers, and the treatment 
charges and the transportation costs 
are known.

Mining
Underground development at Mayskoye is continuing as 
planned, with the ﬁrst ore mined from stopes in December.  
A total of 11,068 m of underground development was 
completed during 2012. A relatively small amount of ore –  
40 Kt – was mined in 2012, as our focus remained on the 
underground development in preparation for active mining 
upon start-up of the processing facility. Nevertheless, current 
stocks of ore mined to date are sufﬁcient to provide the 
processing plant with more than three months of feedstock.  
As the plant commissioning date approaches, we have 
continued active ore mining from stopes, with the annual 
amount of ore mined expected to exceed 600 Kt in 2013.
Construction
Originally, the start-up of Mayskoye concentrator was 
scheduled for the end of 2012. However, during the second 
half of 2012 there were signiﬁcant delays in delivering  
the remaining construction materials by rail to the ports  
for onward shipping to Mayskoye. As a result, some of the 
materials had to be airlifted after the navigation period was 
over. Given this fact, the start-up of Mayskoye concentrator is 
now scheduled for April 2013. This will allow the concentrator 
to produce and ship concentrate to the POX facility and/or 
off-takers in the summer navigation period of 2013,  
as originally planned, albeit in lower than expected volumes.
During 2012, all major construction works were completed at 
the processing plant, including installation of equipment at the 
crushing, grinding, ﬂotation, thickening, ﬁltering and drying 
sections. In Q1 2012, the site was connected to a local  
110 KW power grid. A coal-ﬁred heat plant was also launched 
in late 2012.
At the underground mine, construction and commissioning  
of the main ventilation unit was completed. All work on water 
supply and the construction of tailing facilities were completed. 
Initial accumulation of water in the tailings pond was performed 
in spring 2012.

Khakanja delivered a strong 
performance in 2012, with a 28% 
growth in gold equivalent production 
driven by the increased grade  
proﬁle from different ore sources.  
The increased average grades 
supported excellent proﬁtability  
of the operation in 2012, marked  
by 9% reduction in total cash costs 
to US$614/GE oz and growth  
of adjusted EBITDA by 57% to 
US$178 million. In 2013 the  
Khakanja plant will operate as  
a genuine processing hub treating 
ore from four deposits – Khakanja, 
Yurievskoye, Avlayakan, and Ozerny.

Priorities for 2013
After conducting geotechnical studies, 
the decision was made to postpone the 
development of an underground mine  
at the Khakanja main deposit in favour 
of another pushback at the open pit 1.  
This approach will reduce short-term 
capital costs and the risks associated 
with underground mining in difﬁcult 
geotechnical conditions.
At Avlayakan, open-pit mining will 
continue, followed by the start of 
underground mining in Q4 2013/early 
2014. Port facilities at Kiran will be 
upgraded in order to achieve the 
appropriate stability and safety  
of ore shipping conditions. 
At Ozerny, mining volumes will grow  
in 2013 as the mine will be operating  
for a full calendar year, with seasonal 
trucking by winter road.
Accordingly, in the structure of ore  
feed for the Khakanja plant’s the share 
of Avlayakan and Ozerny will increase 
while the total volume of ore processed 
will be unchanged. This will result  
in a reduction of silver production 
year-on-year and the growth of gold 
production driven by structural grade 
proﬁle change.

appropriate safety procedures in this complex logistic chain in 
the future, we are currently engaged in consultations with the 
regulatory authorities, and are investing around US$10 million 
in our own barge ﬂeet in the region. In addition, we are carrying 
out a port infrastructure modernisation project at Kiran.
In 2012, mining started at Ozerny, a new satellite mine located 
40 km from the Khakanja plant, where a winter road and mine 
infrastructure have been constructed during the year. Mining at 
Ozerny started on schedule in the fourth quarter, with the ﬁrst 
56 Kt grading 4.8 g/t gold and 46 g/t silver mined and 13 Kt 
successfully processed in 2012. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2013,  
ore mined will be trucked by winter road, and the mine will  
then build up an ore stockpile for processing in 2014.
Processing
Total ore processed at the Khakanja plant in 2012 was stable 
compared to 2011 and comprised 622 Kt. However, gold 
production grew by 8% to 91 Koz and silver production grew 
by 66% to 4.4 Moz. This impressive growth has been achieved 
on the back of increased average grades, mostly due to high 
gold grade ore from Avlayakan and high silver grade from 
Khakanja’s pit 3. Average gold grade processed increased  
by 4% to 4.8 g/t, and silver grade grew by 60% to 277 g/t.  
The growth in grades was further supported by increased 
recoveries of 96% for gold and 80% for silver.
Mining
At the main Khakanja deposit, ore mined grew more than 
twofold to 1,211 Kt, with mining works concentrated on  
pit 3. This resulted in increased silver grade proﬁle  
(average of 220 g/t, an increase of 7% compared to 2011).
Ore mined at Yurievskoye reached a record 148 Kt, with mining 
works on the deposit completed in January 2013. High average 
grades at Yurievskoye (6.5 g/t gold) supported the overall 
grade proﬁle at the Khakanja processing facility. The remaining 
ore and equipment will be trucked from the deposit by winter 
road in early 2013, and rehabilitation of the land will take place.
At Avlayakan, open-pit mining volumes decreased to  
79 Kt as open-pit mining (based on current resources)  
is expected to be completed in 2014, followed by underground 
development. 47 Kt of ore mined was shipped by sea  
to the port of Okhotsk and further trucked to Khakanja for 
processing. This complex logistic chain is justiﬁed by the  
high gold and silver grades (15 g/t and 124 g/t, respectively) 
mined at Avlayakan.
We deeply regret the loss of the ship Amurskaya and its  
crew in the Okhotsk Sea in October 2012. This third party 
vessel was contracted by Polymetal to transport the Avlayakan 
ore from the local port of Kiran for further processing  
at Khakanja. In order to secure ore supplies and ensure

remaining to extend the current life of mine by identifying 
medium-sized high-grade deposits in the area. Additional 
drilling has been performed at Kundumi, where a number  
of high-grade ore intercepts were identiﬁed. However, the key 
results of the 2012 season are resource-to-reserve conversions 
at Ozerny, where mining started in Q4 2012, and Avlayakan, 
where in-ﬁll drilling has been performed to prepare for 
underground mining. Total reserve growth was 0.45 Moz

Operating review Ongoing improvement process
Voro continues to be the lowest cost and highest margin mine, 
mostly due to solid grade proﬁle, stable operating performance 
and favourable location allowing access to cheap power and 
infrastructure. Nevertheless we are committed to continuous 
improvement, searching for further measures to enhance 
efﬁciency and proﬁtability of the operation. In 2012, such 
measures included additional automated components,  
and further development of computerised mine planning, 
including implementation of medium and long-term plans.
2012 highlights
Mining
Stripping and ore mining volumes at the main Voro deposit 
were largely ﬂat, at 11,265 Kt and 1,684 Kt respectively.  
The average grades both in primary and oxidised ore were 
stable at 5.8 g/t and 1.7 g/t. The preparations for mining  
at the south part of the Voro pit, which will be a main source  
of the oxidised ore in 2013, were completed during the year.
At Degtyarskoye, mining was fully completed in November, 
with 104 Kt of ore grading 3.0 g/t mined during 2012.  
Some of the ore from Degtyarskoye was processed  
at the Voro CIP plant, while the bulk of the ore was sent  
for processing to Varvara. 
Both Degtyarskoye and Fevralskoye, satellite deposits of Voro, 
were sold in December 2012.
Processing
At the heap leach circuit the amount of ore stacked was in line 
with previous year, and recoveries were stable – all of which 
resulted in stable production output at 32 Koz of gold. At the 
CIL plant, ore processed was at 917 Kt, 2% above 2011, and 
recoveries increased to 78.9%, also a 2% increase. These 
improvements helped to partially compensate for the decline  
in average grade processed (5.3 g/t in 2012 compared to  
5.9 g/t in 2011, a 11% decrease), and total production at the 
CIL circuit comprised 118 Koz of gold, 6% below 2011.

Varvara is running fully in line with 
expectations. Nevertheless, we 
remain focused on continuous 
improvement, implementing best 
practices in mining and processing 
technologies and leveraging existing 
capacity by the use of third-party  
ore sources. A major highlight of the 
year was the increase in reserves  
and resources on the back of 
exploration results on the ﬂanks of 
Varvarinskoye – gold equivalent ore 
reserves up 50% to 1.6 Moz, mineral 
resources more than doubled  
to 3.6 Moz of gold equivalent.

Priorities for 2013
In 2013 we will continue mining works  
in the central and northern parts of 
Varvara’s main pit, and plan to start 
stripping in the pit’s southern part.  
The use of third-party ores is set  
to continue as this will allow the plant  
to maintain full capacity utilisation at the 
leach circuit. Exploration at the ﬂanks  
of Varvara will continue in order to 
further strengthen the reserve and 
resource base.

Operating review  Ongoing improvement process
In 2012 we carried out a number of projects aimed at 
debottlenecking and efﬁciency improvement. These included 
the design of an additional cyanidation tank, a control ﬂotation 
cell on the ﬂotation circuit, and construction of a railway spur 
which will be used for the transportation of supplies, most 
importantly ore from third-party sources, and shipping of 
concentrates sold to off-takers from Varvara. In addition,  
in 2012 we installed a walking excavator which will allow  
us to reduce stripping costs through the use of relatively  
cheap electricity and improved stripping methods.  
The excavator was commissioned in January 2013.
2012 highlights
Mining
Ore mining at Varvara was 9% lower year-on-year while 
stripping volumes were ﬂat, due to volatility of the stripping 
ratios at different parts of the deposit. However, the average 
gold grades for both ﬂoat and leach ores demonstrated 
positive dynamics. Average gold grade was up 13% for the 
ﬂoat ore (to 1.3 g/t) and up 11% for the leach ore (to 0.9 g/t), 
while copper content in the ﬂoat ore grew 31% to 0.8%. 
Processing
Gold production grew 10% year-on-year, exceeding the  
100 Koz level. This growth was mainly attributable to the  
leach circuit where throughput, grades and recoveries 
increased by 5%, 9% and 3%, respectively. The leverage  
in throughput was achieved by securing third-party sources  
of ore in the region, and the Company expects to continue this 
practice in 2013. Copper production in 2012 was 6.6 Kt, down 
5% year-on-year as a result of lower grades in ore processed  
in the period, partially compensated for by increased 
throughput and improved recoveries (+4% and +2%  
year-on-year, respectively).

Operating review
Polymetal pursues standalone 
exploration projects with the aim  
of discovering sizeable and high 
quality deposits.
Exploration 
We are conducting exploration works in four regions  
of Russia – Khabarovsk, Magadan, Karelia, and Sverdlovsk – 
as well as in Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently has 54 licences 
for geological studies, exploration and gold, silver and copper 
mining, and one coal mining licence. Our current exploration 
portfolio includes 43 licences with a total area of approximately 
10,503 km
2
.
Exploration activities in 2012 took place in 31 licensed areas, of 
which 7 areas are at an advanced stage. Greenﬁeld exploration 
continues to be one of the principal sources of growth for 
Polymetal, as demonstrated in the past by our success at 
Albazino which has seen multiple resource increases since its 
acquisition as an exploration property in 2006. Our greenﬁeld 
exploration programme is focused on prospecting for new 
precious metals deposits with a potential resource base 
sufﬁcient in grade and size to justify construction of a 
standalone mine. Such targets are set to form the next 
generation of our growth assets and ensure Company’s 
long-term growth prospects
The most signiﬁcant exploration targets include:
01 Svetloye
Svetloye is located 220 km south west of Okhotsk, in an 
undeveloped and sparsely populated region. Open-pittable 
inferred resources of 4.1 Mt at 5.9 g/t for 0.8 Moz of contained 
gold (to a depth of 100 m). Mineralised potential of the zone 
(inclusive of resources) is estimated at 30-40 Mt at 1.8-2.2 g/t 
for 2-2.5 Moz of gold (internal non-JORC estimate).
In 2012, we have performed technological mapping and bulk 
lab sampling in the Elena and Emi zones, and the ores were 
determined to be suitable for heap leaching. Prospecting at  
the south-west ﬂank of the Emi zone continued to delineate  
the zone and identify potential additional resources. In the 
Elena zone, in-ﬁll drilling has started in order to prepare for 
reserve estimation. We have also commenced construction  
of the winter road from Svetloye to Unchi,the nearest seaport, 
for delivery of fuel and inventories.
Currently the metallurgical test work to determine viability of 
heap leaching is continuing, with a reserve estimate for the bulk 
heap leach processing option targeted for the fourth quarter  
of 2013. The deposit could deliver potential annual gold 
production of 100-150 Koz at full capacity should the decision 
to develop the heap leaching be taken.
02 Kutyn
Kutyn, a licence area located 113 km north-east of Albazino, 
currently has open-pittable inferred resources of 5.5 Mt at  
4.1 g/t for 0.7 Moz of contained gold (to a depth of 140-240 m). 
Only 25% of the 120 km
2
 licence territory has been tested by 
drilling. The mineralised potential of the zone (inclusive of 
resources) is estimated at 10-15 Mt at 2.5-3.5 g/t for  
1-1.2 Moz of gold (internal non-JORC estimate).
This deposit has two types of ore – oxidised and sulphide, and 
an intensive exploration programme is under way with 11 km 
drilled in 2012 and a further 23 km planned for 2013. In 2012 
we continued prospecting in the Geoﬁzicheskaya, 
Sedlovinnaya, Yubileynaya and Delinskaya zones, and started 
preparation of a temporary winter road for fuel and inventory 
supply. The additional mineralised potential identiﬁed as a 
result of the 2012 drilling campaign comprised 0.6 Moz  
of gold contained. In 2012, we also started in-ﬁll drilling  
at the Sedlovinnaya zone in order to delineate the oxidised  
ore body and start preparation for trial open-pit mining.
In the coming year, we will be continuing drilling activities 
across the deposit to establish resources, with a focus on the 
Sedlovinnaya zone which is most promising for heap leaching. 
After completion of the 2013 exploration season, we are 
planning to produce an initial JORC reserve estimate, with 
either heap leach or CIP plant on site options to be examined 
for the oxidised ore. Based on current assessment of the 
oxidised resources, 100-150 Koz of annual gold equivalent 
production could be achieved from 2017. 
03 Tamunier
Located in the Sverdlovsk Region of Russia, the Tamunier 
licence covers 23 km
2
. Tamunier is located in a historical 
mining area with good infrastructure and the project is 
accessible by year-round gravel road. The nearest paved  
road is 5 km away, a 110-kV power line is 18 km away,  
and the nearest railway spur is 41 km away.
Following geophysical and geochemical studies and the drilling 
of 155 prospecting holes, we have drilled 129 exploration 
diamond holes. The new holes are up to 200 m depth from the 
surface with 100 m x 50 m and 50 m x 25 m drill patterns. In 
2012, an initial JORC resource estimate was prepared for the 
deposit of 50Mt at 1.2 g/t gold. Further substantial exploration 
potential has been identiﬁed with ongoing exploration seeking 
to expand and upgrade the resource estimate. However, the 
Tamunier project does not ﬁt with our strategy of concentrating 
on higher-grade assets and we will, therefore, consider a sale 
or partnership to advance the development of the asset.
04 Maminskoye (purchased in April 2013)
Maminskoye is located in the Sverdlovsk Region of Russia, 
approximately 70 km from the regional capital Ekaterinburg 
and 30 km from the city of Kamensk-Uralsk (population 
130,000). Our Voro mine is approximately 450 km to the north. 
The 17.8 km
2
 licence area is accessible by a paved highway 
and is adjacent to a 10 kV power line. The Maminskoye licence 
area covers a 1205 ha (2978 acre) site which includes the 
potential mine, processing facilities, and waste rock stockpile.
Probable ore reserves at Maminskoye have been estimated  
by Snowden in accordance with JORC guidelines at 12.2 Mt  
of ore at 1.9 g/t gold, representing 0.7 Moz of contained gold. 
Mineral resources additional to reserves were estimated at  
5.1 Mt at 1.9 g/t, representing 0.3 Moz of contained gold. 
These estimates were prepared for the previous owner and are 
based on construction of a CIP mill on site. Ore bodies have 
been drilled out to a depth of 200-250m and remain open at 
depth and along strike in one direction.

We believe that heap leaching is the preferable option to treat 
mineralised material at Maminskoye, as it is expected to be 
signiﬁcantly less capital intensive and likely to result in lower 
unit operating costs. Lower costs, in turn, may permit 
expansion of both resources and reserves. Extensive test work 
is ongoing to determine the optimum parameters (crushing size 
and stacking height) for heap leaching. Scoping study-level 
estimates indicate the potential for a 2-3 Mtpa operation 
yielding 80-120 Koz of gold per year.
05 Elmus
The Elmus licence area covers 188 km
2
 in the Republic of 
Karelia in north-west Russia and was acquired in 2011.  
During 2012 exploration season, new areas of mineralisation 
were discovered and several intercepts were identiﬁed: 
 Gavshlamonya – 11.6 g/t at 1 m, 2.9 g/t at 2.9 m
 Talpus – 3.1 g/t at 11.9 m and 1.55 g/t at 6.7 m
The anomalies identiﬁed in the above zones support their 
further strong exploration potential.
Prospecting started at a new Semchenskaya area, where  
a major drilling campaign is scheduled for 2013.

Highlights
Financial highlights
 Revenue in 2012 increased by 40% to US$1,854 million compared to 2011 (‘year-on-year’), driven mostly by a 33% increase  
in gold equivalent sold. In addition to robust production growth, metal sales in 2012 exceeded production for both gold and 
silver mainly due to destockpiling of concentrate inventories at Dukat.
 Group total cash cost
1
 was US$703/GE oz, and remained almost ﬂat compared to the 2011 level of US$701/GE oz as a  
result of intense management focus on cost control and despite external and inﬂationary cost pressures. Strong operating 
performance, resulting in increased average grade processed and increased volumes, coupled with moderate Russian Rouble 
depreciation against the US Dollar, offset the combined impact of domestic inﬂation and adverse movement in the gold/silver 
price ratio.
 All-in cash costs
1
 comprised US$1,047/GE oz, a 15% decrease year-on-year, driven mostly by reduction in capital expenditure 
at our operating mines and stable total cash costs.
 Adjusted EBITDA
1
 grew by 47% to US$918 million, ahead of revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up by 3 pp to 50%.
 Net earnings were US$401 million, up 38% year-on-year driven by the strong increase in adjusted EBITDA. Net earnings were 
negatively affected by additional tax provisions booked in respect of prior years and 2012 in the amount of US$116 million, 
which are not expected to be recurring. 
 Pre-tax return on capital employed (ROCE
1
) was 22%, and after-tax return on equity (ROE
1
) was 20%, increasing from  
18% and 18%, respectively, and marking the improved capital efﬁciency of the Group. Basic EPS was US$1.03 per share, 
increasing 30% year-on-year.
 A ﬁnal dividend of US$0.31 per share (a total of US$119 million) in respect of FY 2012, representing 30% of net earnings is 
proposed by the Board in accordance with the new dividend policy.
 Net operating cash ﬂow more than doubled to US$496 million while capital expenditures declined 24% to US$351 million, 
resulting in a total positive free cash ﬂow
1
 of US$139 million in 2012.
 Group’s liquidity proﬁle remains comfortable with net debt/adjusted EBITDA further reduced from 1.4 as at YE 2011  
to 1.1 as at 31 December 2012, with 59% of borrowings being long-term.

Market summary
Precious metals
The precious metals price dynamics in 2012 were mixed, and continued to be largely driven by investment demand. The 
continued monetary easing in the US and Europe, as well as uncertainty over the future of the Eurozone, were the main drivers 
moderately pushing the gold price up in the ﬁrst nine months of the year to a high of US$1,790/oz recorded in the beginning of 
October, although there was signiﬁcant volatility in gold prices in the middle of the year. Subsequently, the gold price went down 
on the back of improving macroeconomic statistics from the US which triggered doubts over the continuation of the quantitative 
easing policy of the Federal Reserve. As a result, the average gold price in 2012 was US$1,668/oz, up 6% compared to 2011.
Silver price dynamics generally followed gold, also displaying signiﬁcant volatility during the year. However the average price level 
of US$31.1/oz was 12% lower year-on-year after abnormal spikes in 2011. The average gold/silver price ratio decreased from 
45/1 in 2011 to 54/1 in 2012, a level close to the long-term average. 
Foreign exchange
The Group’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Group’s costs 
are denominated in Russian Roubles. Therefore changes in exchange rates are affecting its ﬁnancial results and performance. 
Both year-end and average RUB/US$ exchange rates have decreased during the year, resulting in moderate strengthening  
of the Rouble against US Dollar. The average rate decreased by 3%, from 31.88 RUB/US$ in 2011 to 31.09 RUB/US$ in 2012.  
The year-end rate was 30.37 RUB/US$, representing a 6% strengthening compared to the beginning of the year. During the  
year the exchange rate was subject to a greater volatility, with a signiﬁcant Rouble strengthening in the ﬁrst quarter, followed  
then by depreciation in the second quarter (with lowest level of 34.04 RUB/US$ in June). In the second half of the year,  
the Rouble strengthening resumed, driven by tight liquidity conditions and stable oil prices.

In 2012, revenue grew by 40% year-on-year to US$1.85 billion, driven mostly by 33% growth in gold equivalent metal sold, to 
1,136 Koz. Gold sales volume was up by 32%, and silver sales were up by 63% year-on-year on the back of production growth 
of 33% and 33%, respectively. Sales of both gold and silver exceeded production, with a notable excess in silver by 2.9 Moz 
driven by de-stockpiling of saleable concentrates at Dukat. Growth in gold equivalent sales was less due to adverse movement 
in gold/silver ratio in 2012 compared to 2011 (refer to market summary on page 63).
The average realised price for gold was US$1,631/oz, up 5% year-on-year and in line with market price of US$1,668/oz.  
The average realised silver price was US$30.0/oz, 12% lower year-on-year, also closely reﬂecting market price movements.
The share of gold in total revenue declined from 53% in 2011 to 52% in 2012, while the share of silver grew from 44%  
to 45%. This was due to more signiﬁcant increases in silver sales offsetting changes in gold/silver price ratio from 1/45  
to 1/54 year-on-year.
Dukat continues to be the largest segment of the Group, with a 36% share in total revenue. In 2012, Dukat demonstrated robust 
growth of 26%, driven by a 45% increase in silver equivalent sold. Among other mature mines, only Voro experienced a slight 
reduction of revenue of 4% due to lower production driven by a moderate decrease in average grades processed. Other mines, 
Varvara and Khakanja, performed strongly in line with their production growth. Omolon, having successfully reached full capacity 
with processing of high-grade ore from Sopka, achieved a more than four-fold increase in revenues year-on-year and contributed 
16% of the Group’s total revenue. At Albazino, revenue grew to US$99 million, a more than twofold increase, driven by full 
ramp-up of the mine and successful sales of concentrates to third-party off-takers in Q2 and Q3. In 2013 we expect further 
signiﬁcant growth on the back of ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant, combined with additional off-take sales.

Total cost of sales grew by 40% in 2012 to US$890 million, mostly driven by volume-based factors: ore mined grew  
by 14%, and ore processed grew by 13%. Key external cost drivers included the domestic inﬂation in Russia (6.6% in 2012).  
The increased operating asset base, which now fully includes Omolon and Albazino, contributed 25 pp of the 40% increase,  
while volume growth at other mines and inﬂationary factors made up another 15%.
 
The cost of services, consumables and spare parts grew by 37% and 21% respectively, mainly affected by mining and 
processing volume increases (14% and 12% respectively). Speciﬁc cost increases in 2012 compared to 2011 were related  
to increased share of remote mines in total production as a result of full ramp-up at Omolon and Albazino, both with higher 
logistics and power generation costs. Speciﬁc cost increases include ore haulage costs at Omolon and concentrate 
transportation costs at Albazino, and increased underground development at Dukat hub (53% year-on-year).
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2012 was US$157 million, a 21% increase. This mainly stemmed from 
growth in the average number of employees directly involved in production by 8%, as well as a review of the staff pay levels 
which are linked to the Russian CPI at our operating mines (6.6% in 2012). 
Cost of purchase of ore from third parties increased by 94% to US$33 million in 2012, mainly as a result of increased volumes  
of ore purchases at Varvara, allowing us to leverage the existing processing capacity at the leach circuit and contribute  
additional margin.
Mining tax represents a consistent 14% share of total cost of sales in both 2012 and 2011 and increased by 25% to US$121 million 
driven by revenue growth.
Depreciation and depletion was US$202 million, up 44% year-on-year, as the Group continued to commission new mining and 
processing assets, most importantly at Albazino, Omolon and Amursk POX. Out of US$202 million, an amount of US$51 million 
of the depreciation charges was included in metal inventory, mainly in ore and concentrate stockpiles at Omolon and Albazino, 
respectively.
In 2012, our metal inventories increased by US$224 million. This increase was mainly represented by concentrate produced at 
Albazino (awaiting processing at Amursk POX and further sales to off-takers), and ore stockpiled at Omolon (mainly represented 
by low-grade heap leach ore at Birkachan and Sopka) and Khakanja (ore from Avlayakan and Ozerny awaiting transportation for 
further processing at Khakanja plant). The concentrate stockpile is set to reduce as soon as the Amursk POX plant is fully 
ramped up, expected in 2013. The drawdown of low-grade ore at Omolon is expected as soon as heap leaching is started in 
2013 at Birkachan and in 2016 at Sopka. Ore stockpiles at Avlayakan and Ozerny are largely seasonal – with Avlayakan ore 
transported during summer navigation and Ozerny ore transported in the beginning of the calendar year by winter road.

component of the increase was labour costs of US$92 million, with the growth driven mainly by scheduled increases in 
administrative personnel at the new mines, including Amursk POX and Mayskoye, and as a result of regular salary reviews.

tax claims by the Russian tax authorities after relevant court decisions were made. For more information refer to page 71 and  
Note 13 of the consolidated unaudited ﬁnancial statements. Other components of other expenses demonstrated moderate 
increases on the back of increased production, a larger asset base and general cost inﬂation.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable  
value and certain other adjustments) and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent sales volume calculation is based on average 
realised metal prices in the relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold equivalent unit ounces sold. 
In 2012 the Company demonstrated strong cost performance on the back of solid production results and successful ramp-up  
of the new mines, Omolon and Albazino. Total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold (TCC) in 2012 were US$703/GE oz, 
and remained almost unchanged compared to 2011, demonstrating the Company’s strong focus on cost control despite the 
external pressures.

  Effect of mix change between mines with different cost levels.
Total cash cost by mine: 
 Dukat’s total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold decreased by 13% year-on-year to US$12.1/AgEq oz. Sustainable 
improvement in both grades and recoveries, resulting in 13% growth in silver production, more than offset signiﬁcant increases 
in underground development, and increases in electricity tariff rates and other external factors.
 At Voro, TCC in 2012 was US$559/GE oz, just 1% above the 2011 level of US$553/GE oz. The robust operating performance 
at Voro, with stable grades, throughput and recoveries at both heap leach and CIP circuits, fully offset the external cost 
inﬂation drivers.
 Khakanja’s TCC was US$614/GE oz, a 9% decrease year-on-year. This superior cost performance was mainly driven by 
signiﬁcant improvement in average grade processed (from 7.4 g/t to 9.4 g/t year-on-year) as the plant treated higher gold 
grade ore from Yurievskoye and high silver grade ore from deep levels of Khakanja’s pit 3. Due to scheduled reduction in 
average grade processed in 2013 (completion of mining at Yurievskoye, pushback at pit 1 at the main Khakanja deposit),  
and higher share of remote mines in ore processed (Avlayakan and Ozerny), we expect cost levels at Khakanja in 2013  
are set to increase over 2011 levels.
 At Varvara, TCC was US$804/GE oz, growing by 8% year-on-year. The growth was mainly driven by increased purchases  
of third-party ore combined with reduction of copper production due to scheduled grade decline.
 At Omolon, total cash costs reduced by a notable 38% to US$918/GE oz as the processing hub reached its design capacity 
and processed signiﬁcant volumes of high-grade ore from Sopka. However, cost levels at Omolon remained above average  
for the Group’s assets due to a) higher stripping ratios in 2012, driven by massive stripping campaigns at Birkachan and  
Sopka deposits and by commencement of mining at Tsokol; b) reallocation of costs from low-grade stockpiles to higher-grade 
current feed at Sopka and Birkachan as a result of reﬁnements in cost allocation models undertaken by the year-end.
 At Albazino/Amursk hub, TCC was US$767/GE oz, which is 25% lower compared to 2011, as the mine and concentrator has 
ramped up to the design throughput, combined with improved recoveries and grades. However, due to slower than expected 
ramp-up of the Amursk POX, the Company had to reallocate signiﬁcant volumes of concentrate produced to third-party 
off-takers in China, resulting in total cash cost level which is higher than the average expected over the life of mine. We expect 
further signiﬁcant improvement in total cash costs at Albazino/Amursk in 2013 upon full ramp-up of the Amursk POX to its 
design throughput and recovery.

Polymetal, in line with the industry best practices, will from now on report an additional cost metric – ‘all-in cash costs’ – which  
is intended to include all ongoing operating and capital expenditure of the Group (excluding only capital expenditure on separate 
growth projects). We believe that all-in cash costs are an important metric to analyse the cash ﬂow generation capacity in our 
capital-intensive sector.
All-in cash costs are comprised of:
 total cash costs (current conventional deﬁnition);
 all selling, general and administrative expenses for operating mines and head ofﬁce not included in TCC (mainly represented  
by head ofﬁce SG&A);
 other expenses (excluding write-offs and non-cash items, in line with the methodology used for calculation of adjusted  
EBITDA); and
 current period capex for operating mines (i.e. excluding new project capex, but including all exploration expenditure  
(both expensed and capitalised in the period) and minor brownﬁeld expansions).
All-in cash costs in 2012 and 2011 include total capital expenditure for Omolon and Albazino from the start of commercial 
production at those mines, despite some of the capital spending being related to plant expansion and/or completion of the major 
construction projects. This approach was taken to ensure transparency of the all-in cash costs calculation.

to net realisable value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, additional mining taxes, penalties and accrued interest, gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals, 
foreign exchange gain/(loss), change in fair value of derivatives, change in fair value of contingent consideration, ﬁnance income, ﬁnance costs, and income tax expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The ﬁgures presented above have been rounded and accordingly may not sum to the total shown.

  These additional charges principally relate to interest and penalties on lost tax litigation and cumulative mineral extraction tax exposures which do not meet the deﬁnition  
of a tax for accounting purposes. See page 67.
In 2012, adjusted EBITDA grew by 47% to US$918 million, ahead of revenue growth, with adjusted EBITDA margin reaching 
50%. The key growth and proﬁtability drivers were production growth, reduction of cost levels at our growth projects, Omolon 
and Albazino, and excellent operating and cost performance at Dukat and Khakanja. Adjusted EBITDA at Dukat grew by 34%  
to US$378 million, at Khakanja by 57% to US$178 million. Omolon and Amursk POX hub (excluding Mayskoye) contributed 
US$124 million and US$35 million, respectively. 
Other income statement items
Foreign exchange differences in 2012 resulted in a net gain of US$7 million versus a US$13 million loss in 2011. These gains/
losses are unrealised non-cash items and represent the appreciation/depreciation of the Group’s mostly US Dollar denominated 
borrowings against the Russian Rouble, the functional currency of the Group. The US$60 million non-cash net foreign exchange 
loss recorded in 1H 2012 due to devaluation of the Russian Rouble in May-June 2012 was more than offset by subsequent 
appreciation in the second half of the year.
The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising 
from the fact that the majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated or calculated in US Dollars. Though income statement 
volatility may arise in the ﬁnancial reporting, the Company believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash ﬂows against 
debt repayments and related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
A US$10 million net gain on acquisition and disposal of subsidiaries was recorded in 2012 mainly as a result of transactions with 
the Group’s holding in Amikan Holding Limited, which owns the Veduga gold deposit in the Krasnoyarsk Region of the Russian 
Federation. The Group has initially consolidated 100% holding in Amikan, previously held in joint venture with AngloGold Ashanti 
Holdings, and then formed a new entity, Polygon Gold Inc., in which it currently owns 42.6%.
Additional mining and proﬁt tax charges and provisions
In 2012, the Group lost two court cases in respect of its tax litigations related to prior periods at Dukat (Magadan Silver) and 
Varvara, resulting in US$29.5 million and US$23.1 million of additional taxes paid during the year, respectively.
Further, there is an ongoing litigation at Dukat (CJSC Magadan Silver) where the application of technical loss limits applied in the 
calculation of Mineral Extraction Tax has been challenged by the tax authorities. The Group assesses the probability of additional 
taxes to be accrued as high and accordingly has created provisions for the tax exposure in the amount of US$9.2 million.
None of the above provisions or additional taxes is expected to be recurring and/or to signiﬁcantly affect the Group’s future 
effective tax rate.
The Group has also provided for a number of other tax exposures in the amount of US$36.6 million in respect of other taxes  
it considers likely to be payable, and US$17.1 million in respect of excess proﬁt tax in Kazakhstan.

Financial review Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends
Proﬁt before tax in 2012 was US$617 million, up 51% compared 2011, exceeding the adjusted EBITDA growth mostly due to 
positive impact of the foreign exchange gains/losses. The Group’s effective income tax rate in 2012 was 35%, up from 29% in 
2011. This is mainly due to the fact that it includes US$49.6 million of additional proﬁt tax charges (see page 71). The effective tax 
rate for the reporting period which excludes additional mining and income tax charges (see page 71), was 24.3%. The difference 
between this rate and the statutory proﬁt tax rate of 20% arises mainly from non-deductible expenses, most importantly 
share-based compensation (a non-cash item, US$54 million in 2012).
As a result, net proﬁt for the year in 2012 was US$401 million, up 38% from the US$290 million in 2011. Basic earnings per share 
were US$1.03, up 30% year-on-year. Return on equity (ROE) and return on capital employed (ROCE) increased to 20% and 
22% in 2012 from 18% and 18% in 2011, respectively, demonstrating the increased capital discipline and operating efﬁciency  
of the Group.
In accordance with the new dividend policy (revised in October 2012) the Board proposes a ﬁnal dividend of US$119 million,  
or US$0.31 per share, representing 30% of the Group’s net proﬁt for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company. 
In addition to that, a special dividend of US$191 million, or US$0.50 per share, was declared in December 2012 and paid  
in January 2013. With the two dividend payments taken together, the Group’s payout ratio

 increases dramatically from 26%  
in 2011 to 79% in 2012.

 Total capital expenditure includes amounts payable at the end of the period. On a cash basis, capital expenditure was US$351 million in 2012 (2011: US$462 million).
In 2012, total capital expenditure was US$372 million, down 22% year-on-year which reﬂects the completion of several major 
Group investment projects in 2011, including construction of Albazino and Amursk POX and expansion at Omolon. The only 
continuing major project in 2012 was the construction of Mayskoye which is on track to be completed in April 2013. Capital 
expenditure exceeded the Group’s original target, mainly due to accelerated development at the Group’s new growth  
projects (Albazino-2, Kutyn, Svetloye), and additional expenses incurred during ramp-up of the Amursk POX plant.
The major capital expenditure items in 2012 were:
 US$79 million were invested at Albazino/Amursk, most importantly in commissioning activities at POX (60% of total), and 
drilling and underground exploration drift at the newly discovered ore bodies in the licence area (Albazino-2) (27% of total),  
and infrastructure development at Albazino (all-year round access road, explosives plant etc.).
 US$66 million was spent on construction of the processing plant and underground mine at Mayskoye, where the Group  
is targeting completion in April 2013. The investments in 2012 were concentrated on installation of equipment at the site  
(mills, ventilation, piping, power substation etc.), while the remaining activities in 2013 only include air-lifting remaining auxiliary 
equipment and its installation.
 US$40 million was invested in the Omolon hub operations. The expenditure in 2012 mainly represented expansion of the hub’s 
mining ﬂeet with growing mining and stripping volumes at Birkachan and Sopka (46% of total spending) and development of 
Tsokol mine (4% of total). In addition, the construction of an all-year-round heap leaching facility at Birkachan commenced in 
2012 (19% of total).
 Capital expenditure at Dukat was US$49 million, a 10% decrease. The expenditure, apart from mining ﬂeet upgrades and 
maintenance capex, mainly comprises expansion of underground operations (development at Dukat, Lunnoye, Goltsovoye 
totalling approximately 20% of capital expenditure) and maintenance at the Omsukchan concentrator (approximately 14%).
 US$20 million was invested in the Khakanja hub, representing mainly development of a new mine at Ozerny where mining 
started in Q4 2012.
 Voro and Varvara’s capital expenditures in 2012 were less signiﬁcant and mainly represented routine maintenance investment 
and upgrades to the mining ﬂeet and the total amount remained slightly below 2011 level at US$27 million.
 The Company continues to actively invest in greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld exploration (included in Corporate segment). Capital 
expenditure on exploration in 2012 was US$68 million, and focused on key advanced targets such as the expansion of 
Albazino (US$8 million in 2012), in-ﬁll drilling at Mayskoye prior to start of stoping, and development of Kutyn (US$4 million) 
and Svetloye (US$5 million), our two greenﬁeld projects with highest potential.
 Total capital expenditure in 2012 includes US$14 million of capitalised interest (2011: US$12 million).
 In addition to capital expenditure, additions to property, plant and equipment in the ﬁnancial statements also include asset 
purchases during the year in the total amount of US$12 million, the most signiﬁcant being the acquisition of Svetlobor platinum 
project (see page 26).

Operating cash ﬂows in 2012 strengthened dramatically, supported by excellent operating results and consequent EBITDA 
growth. Operating cash ﬂows before changes in working capital grew 49% year-on-year to US$710 million. Net operating cash 
ﬂows more than doubled and comprised US$496 million, as a result of decreasing demand for working capital in 2012 (19% 
lower year-on-year). 
Investing cash ﬂows’ dynamics were mainly driven by decreasing capital expenditure (down 24% from US$462 million in 2011  
to US$351 million in 2012) investment in the major growth projects (Omolon, Albazino and Amursk POX) is completing.  
As a result, free cash ﬂow
1
 was positive at US$139 million in 2012 compared to a negative of US$260 million in 2011.
Total cash and cash equivalents decreased from US$659 million as at 31 December 2011 to US$19 million as at 31 December 
2012 as a result of the following:
 settlement of the MTO obligation and further buyouts of the remaining shares in JSC Polymetal, totalling US$569 million;
 inaugural dividend payment of US$77 million in June 2012; and
 net repayment of borrowings of US$149 million during 2012.
Balance sheet
In 2012, the Company recorded the following signiﬁcant movements of key balance sheet items:
 net increase in current inventories of US$261 million incurred mainly due to growth of low-grade ore inventories at Omolon  
and concentrate inventories at Albazino (awaiting further processing at the POX facility or sale to off-taker); 
 net increase in current payables of US$205 million, mainly due to recognition of a dividend payment liability for special 
dividends of US$191 million declared in December 2012 and the subsequently paid in January 2013; and
 full settlement of the MTO obligation (US$534 million as at 31 December 2011) and additional repurchases of shares in JSC 
Polymetal of US$27 million during 2012, resulting in reduction of non-controlling interest and share purchase obligation balances 
within equity, and a corresponding net decrease in retained earnings balance attributable to the equity holders of the Company.

The Group continues to maintain a safe liquidity and funding proﬁle, underpinned by strong operating cash ﬂows and robust 
short-term and long-term liquidity management policies.
The Group’s net debt stood at US$1,037 million as of 31 December 2012, representing a net debt/adjusted EBITDA ratio  
of 1.1, down 20% from 1.4 as at 31 December 2011. The decrease was a result of strong growth in operating cash ﬂows 
combined with completion of a major investment cycle and a corresponding decrease in capital expenditure. 
The Group continues to focus on building a healthy debt proﬁle, which is comfortable both from the liquidity and cost 
standpoints. The majority of our borrowings (59%) were long-term as of 31 December 2012, while the average cost of debt 
remained at a low 3.1% in 2012 (2011: 3.2%), supported by low base interest rates and our ability to negotiate competitive 
premiums on the back of the improved ﬁnancial position of the Company and our excellent credit history. 
2013 outlook
The ﬁnancial performance in 2013 will be driven by the following key factors:
 the Company is on track to deliver on its 1.2 Moz of gold equivalent production guidance; 
 our revenue base will be dependent on the gold and silver price dynamics, currently demonstrating signiﬁcant volatility in 
response to uncertainty in the global ﬁnancial markets;
 in the cost base, while the appreciation of the Russian rouble may have an adverse effect, the continued increase in operating 
efﬁciency and throughput at the new mines, most importantly Albazino/Amursk, will serve as a key internal factor supporting 
the current cost levels; and
 low capital requirements due to completion of all current major investment projects, and resulting signiﬁcant free cash  
ﬂow generation.

Risks and risk management
Effective risk identiﬁcation  
and management
Managing our risks well is critical  
to the long-term sustainability and 
success of the Company. We believe 
that delivery of sustainable value  
to our stakeholders should be based 
on effective risk identiﬁcation and  
an appropriate response to each risk.
Risk management process
Polymetal’s risk management process is designed to minimise 
the potential threats to achieving our strategic objectives.  
The process incorporates the following stages:
 identiﬁcation and documentation of risks;
 assessment, qualiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of each risk;
 development and implementation of risk mitigation/ 
control strategies; 
 monitoring, reporting and reviewing risks; and
 input of effective internal control procedures.
The Audit and Risk Committee of the Board sets the agenda 
for the risk management policies and procedures of the Group 
and is responsible for reviewing their effectiveness. Its duties 
include the review of:
 policies and overall process to identify and assess  
business risks and manage their impact on the Company 
and the Group;
 regular assurance reports from management, internal audit, 
external audit and others on matters related to risk and 
control; and
 the timeliness of, and reports on, the effectiveness  
of corrective action taken by management.
Risk identiﬁcation
An awareness of risk is embedded within the Group and is 
grounded in our strong ethical values and proactive corporate 
culture. Our risk management philosophy is driven by the 
Company’s Board of Directors and runs through all our 
management, employee and connected stakeholder  
activities – from developing strategy to day-to-day operations. 
Risk management is one of the key functions of the Audit  
and Risk Committee. Strategic risks are identiﬁed by the  
Board based on a detailed understanding of the Company,  
its markets and the legal, social, political, economic, 
technological, environmental and cultural environments  
in which we operate. Our risk identiﬁcation system considers 
not only single, mutually exclusive risks, but also multiple linked 
and correlated risks.
Risk matrices are used to record, prioritise and track each risk 
through the risk management process. These are regularly 
reviewed by the Audit and Risk Committee.
Risk assessment
Once identiﬁed, potential risk factors are assessed to consider 
the impact (consequences) the event or events may have on 
achieving objectives and the likelihood (probability) of the event 
(see table on top of page 77). Together these create a risk proﬁle.
Risk response
When the appropriate ranking has been identiﬁed, a response 
to each risk is formulated and implemented. Management 
assesses the effects of a risk’s likelihood and impact, as well  
as costs and beneﬁts. A response is then evaluated, that brings 
the risk within acceptable tolerance levels.
Monitoring and reporting
Ongoing monitoring processes are embedded in Polymetal’s 
business operations. These track the effective application of 
internal control and risk management policies and procedures, 
including internal audit and speciﬁc management reviews.  
Risk matrices are used to re-evaluate and adjust controls in 
response to changes in Company’s objectives, business and 
the external environment.
Management is responsible for the implementation of effective 
follow-up procedures to ensure appropriate actions occur  
in response to changes in risk and control assessments.

Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
1 
Market risk
Gold and silver price volatility can result in material and 
adverse movement in the Group’s operating results, 
revenues and cash ﬂows.
Movement in gold equivalent price for all metals produced 
of 10% will cause EBITDA to increase/decrease by 
approximately 25% in accordance with Group budgeted 
ﬁgures for 2013.
The Group monitors gold and silver prices on an ongoing basis. 
The Group has decided not to hedge gold prices in order to 
maximise the beneﬁts from the positive price trends. In order  
to manage the risk of potential decline in the metal prices,  
the Group uses price conservative estimates for budgeting 
purposes (usually below spot prices by 10-20%) and actively 
manages cut-off grades and medium-term mine planning in 
response to changes in metal prices
2 
Production risks
The risk of failure to meet the planned production 
programme.
Failure to meet production targets may adversely affect 
operating performance and ﬁnancial results of the Group.
Annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and 
subsequent monthly control against budget is designed to 
mitigate the risk. The effectiveness and efﬁciency of the 
production process is ensured by the Group’s engineering 
team senior management.
2.1 
Production risk –  
low grade/potential 
dilution of ore
The risk of lower than expected metal grade or dilution  
is caused by complex mining and geological conditions, 
mainly at underground mines.
An approved production programme includes increased 
volume of operational prospecting works, such as in-ﬁll  
drilling and grade control sampling.
2.2
Production risk –  
ore and concentrate 
shipping
The Company operates in remote locations that require 
complex and signiﬁcant transportation of ore and gold/
silver concentrates, most of which is conducted by third 
party contractors. Production targets may not be reached 
if any element of the logistics chain is disrupted. In 2012, 
some ore losses took place, in transit from remote sites 
via sea routes.
To mitigate the logistics risk the Group invests considerable 
amounts into construction and maintenance of permanent  
and temporary winter roads at exploration and production 
sites. The Group exercises effective control over the whole 
logistics chain, including selection and operation  
of contractors.
2.3
Production risk –  
supply chain risks
The Group’s production activity depends heavily on the 
effectiveness of supply chains. These might be negatively 
affected by complex logistics to remote locations and delays 
in construction and delivery of purchased mining and 
processing equipment or spare parts.
The Group has implemented and constantly improves the supply 
chain system to closely link the production demand of resources 
with inventory levels, optimise the number of order placements 
and ensure the in-time inventory and equipment delivery  
to production sites.
2.4
Production risk –  
low recovery rate 
Recoveries at the Group’s processing plants may not  
reach planned levels due to complex technological 
properties of ore processed.
To mitigate the risk the Group invests considerable amounts  
in ore quality assessment procedures and seeks to control  
ore quality by formation of ore stacks with the required 
characteristics.
The use of such methods at the Group’s production  
plants in 2012 was deemed effective. It allows the Company  
to reduce this type of risk to medium.
 
2.5
Production risk –  
construction and 
renovation
Failure to meet return required from the major capital 
expenditure projects, such as building new mines and 
processing facilities or production capacity increase/
renovation at existing mines, as a result of failure to meet 
project delivery timeline and budgets which can adversely 
affect the Group’s ﬁnancial results, cash ﬂow position  
and increase capital costs.
Most signiﬁcant ongoing projects include construction  
of Mayskoye concentrator.
The Company implements global best practices in project 
management. The Group’s engineering team is responsible for 
the oversight of capital expenditure projects, including project 
support, coordination of service organisations, contractors, 
constructors and cooperation with regulatory bodies.
Signiﬁcant parts of exploration and development projects are 
performed by the Group in-house by Polymetal Engineering,  
a subsidiary company with signiﬁcant expertise and track 
record of designing and commissioning mines and  
processing plants.
On complex projects, such as construction of the Amursk 
POX plant, the Group employs world class consultants with 
recognised international experience.

3
Legal risk
Operating in developing countries, such as Russia and 
Kazakhstan, involves the risk that changes in tax and 
other legislation may occur from time to time. The most 
sensitive areas are regulation of foreign investments, 
private property, environmental protection and taxation. 
In recent years, however, the governments of both  
Russia and Kazakhstan have become more consistent 
regarding the introduction of new regulations and taxes, 
demonstrating awareness of investment climate issues. 
However, in the application of existing legislation requiring 
interpretation, courts often uphold the more assertive 
position of the tax authorities, which does not always 
coincide with the Company’s position.
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating in both 
Russian and Kazakh jurisdictions, having developed its own 
expertise in corporate, tax, licensing and other legal areas. 
The Group’s ﬁnancial and legal teams monitor current 
legislation and proposed changes and incorporate these  
into the practice.
Corporate and operating management teams are responsible 
for meeting the legal requirements in their operating activities. 
Head ofﬁce and on-site legal teams guarantee appropriate 
controls over compliance issues.
The Group takes into account the results of tax audits and 
court rulings when interpreting taxation rules and determining 
future tax positions.
4
Taxation risk
Due to frequent changes in tax legislation in Russia and 
Kazakhstan, lack of established practices in tax law 
means that additional costs such as taxes or penalties 
may occur.
The taxation risk level correlates with the legal and  
political risks levels.
The Company’s policy is to comply fully with the requirements 
of the applicable tax laws, providing adequate controls over 
tax accounting and tax reporting.
Given the prevailing practice accepted by arbitration tribunals 
when deciding on certain cases in tax disputes in 2012, as 
well as particular outcomes of tax disputes involving Kazakh 
and Russian subsidiaries of the Group, the tax risk is  
assessed as ‘High’.
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements reﬂect provisions 
booked in connection with the Company’s evaluation  
of tax risks.
To date the Company is not aware of any signiﬁcant 
outstanding tax claims, which could lead to additional taxes 
accrued in the future (except for amounts already booked  
or disclosed in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements.)
5
Mergers and 
acquisitions
The Group invests considerable amounts in gold mining 
assets and operations in the Russian Federation and 
Kazakhstan. There is a risk of failure to achieve expected 
beneﬁts from any acquisition in the case of adverse 
changes in assumptions or inaccuracy of estimates made, 
or where the information used for decision making was 
incomplete or inaccurate.
Failure to deliver expected beneﬁts from an acquisition 
can results in adverse ﬁnancial performance, lower 
planned production volumes or problems with  
product quality.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are applied to the 
evaluation and execution of all acquisitions to assess the 
consequences of the acquisition, based on economic, 
ecological, political and social factors.
Board and/or shareholder approval is required for  
any acquisition. 
6
Environmental risks
Environmental damage may arise from operations, 
including air and water pollution from toxic waste.  
Waste storage and recycling is subject to government 
regulation. Potential impacts include ﬁnes and penalties, 
statutory liability for environmental rehabilitation and other 
ﬁnancial consequences that may be signiﬁcant.
The Group has implemented a number of initiatives to monitor 
and limit the impact of its operations on the environment.  
These include external expert assessment of pollution 
generated and adoption of industry best practice  
on the corporate level policies and procedures.  
Refer to pages 80-83 of this report.
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
7
Political risk
Operating in Russia and Kazakhstan involves some  
risk of political instability, which may include changes  
in government, negative policy shifts and civil unrest. 
These may have an adverse effect on the Group’s  
market value and operating environment.
The Group actively monitors political developments  
on an ongoing basis.
We aim to maintain open working relationships with local 
authorities in the countries where we operate.
8
Currency risk
Currency risk arises as the Group’s revenue is linked to 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) gold and silver 
ﬁxings and denominated in US Dollars. The expenses are 
mostly incurred and denominated in Russian Roubles.
Natural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure:  
revenue is matched with US Dollar denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect of exchange 
rate ﬂuctuations on the Group’s ﬁnancial results.
9
Human resources
Failure to retain key employees or to recruit new staff 
mainly at the Group’s mining and processing facilities  
may lead to increased staff costs, interruptions to existing 
operations and delay in new projects.
Lack of skilled and knowledgeable staff at remote  
locations may occur due to extreme weather conditions.
A working conditions improvement programme is in place.
Remuneration policies are designed to incentivise, motivate 
and retain key employees.
There is an increased focus on health and safety –  
refer to page 84 of this report and there is active promotion  
of a positive corporate culture within the Group.
10
Liquidity risk
Inability to raise sufﬁcient funds to meet current  
operating or ongoing ﬁnancial needs, to develop new 
projects and growth. 
The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for ensuring  
that there are sufﬁcient funds in place, including loan facilities,  
cash ﬂow from operating activities and cash on hand to meet 
short-term business requirements. Long-term credit lines  
are used to ﬁnance new projects and organic growth.
11
Failure to meet 
exploration objectives
Exploration and development are capital- and time-
intensive activities and may involve a high degree of risk. 
They are, however, necessary for the future growth.  
Failure to discover new reserves of sufﬁcient magnitude 
could adversely affect the Group’s medium and long-term 
growth prospects. 
The Group invests considerable amounts in focused 
exploration projects to obtain sufﬁcient information about the 
quantity and quality of expected reserves and to estimate 
expected cash ﬂows. The Group’s team of geologists and 
engineering specialists has a track record of successful 
greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld exploration leading to subsequent 
development of exploration ﬁelds into commercial production.
12
Interest rates
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as signiﬁcant 
part of the Group’s debt portfolio comprises US Dollar 
denominated ﬂoating rate borrowings.
Based on analysis of the current economic situation, the 
Group has decided to accept the risk of ﬂoating interest rate 
rather than hedge it or borrow at ﬁxed rates. However the 
Group does not rule out the possibility of ﬁxing the interest  
rate on its borrowings in the future, should assessment of the 
on going economic situation suggest this may be proﬁtable.
13
Inﬂation risk
The Group is exposed to potentially high rates of inﬂation  
in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Higher rates  
of inﬂation may increase future operating costs and have  
a negative impact on ﬁnancial results if there is no related 
depreciation of the local currency against US Dollar  
or an increase in LBMA gold and silver ﬁxings. 
As part of the budgeting process, the Group estimates  
possible inﬂation levels and incorporates them into  
cost planning.

Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 79 78 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Sustainability – 
ensuring progress
Our approach to sustainability
We regard sustainability as an 
essential element of our activities.  
It is an investment in society as well  
as in our own future. That’s why  
we ﬁrmly believe that anchoring 
sustainability as part of our business 
strategy will lead to economic, 
environmental and social progress.
Sustainability is the ultimate responsibility of our Group  
CEO, Vitaly Nesis. To help him in this, a Technical Council  
is convened monthly to monitor, among other issues, 
performance against our sustainability priorities and 
implementation of associated policies across all of the 
operating companies. Our heads of department report  
into the Council, covering employees, community outreach, 
health and safety and environmental management. 
The UN Global Compact
The overall sustainability strategy is designed to meet the 
requirements of the UN Global Compact. This voluntary 
international standard commits afﬁliated companies  
to comply with ten principles in the areas of human rights, 
labour, environment and anti-corruption. Polymetal became  
a signatory in 2009 and is an active member of the  
UN Global Compact Network Russia.
The UN Global Compact and our corporate values deﬁne  
the focus for more detailed policies and associated 
management systems, all of which are deﬁned at Group level 
and implemented through our head ofﬁce and the subsidiary 
companies. Ongoing monitoring and regular audit ensures  
that performance is measured against the relevant regulatory 
and Company internal requirements.
Assessing risks
The CEO, Board of Directors and Technical Council, aided by 
the Internal Audit Department, identify risks to the business 
and associated management operations. In doing so, they are 
informed by interaction with government agencies, the ﬁnancial 
community, employees, local communities, NGOs, customers 
and suppliers. Our risk management process is deﬁned and 
monitored by the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board. 
Stakeholder engagement 
Our stakeholders help to deﬁne sustainability priorities and 
provide a vital check on how we are performing. We are 
therefore open, honest and clear in the way we communicate 
through many channels, including corporate reporting, 
Company news, brieﬁngs, hotlines and digital technology. 
We have identiﬁed ﬁve main stakeholder groups: 
Shareholders and investors
They are interested in governance, strategy and sustainable 
ﬁnancial returns.
Employees
They are interested in careers, beneﬁts, health and safety, 
corporate reputation and clear lines of communication.
Partners and suppliers
They are interested in fair dealing, openness and transparency.
Government
They are interested in compliance, transparency and  
economic development.
Communities and NGOs 
They are interested in directing investments, openness  
and transparency, economic opportunity and long-term 
relationships.
For more details on our sustainability performance, including 
compliance with GRI recommendations and meeting level B  
of reporting, please refer to our Sustainability Report 2012.
Our sustainability focus for 2013-2014
Our sustainability focus is inﬂuenced by those issues that 
present a risk to our business performance and those that are 
deemed important by our stakeholders. While our focus for 
2013-14 is deﬁned, our approach is ﬂexible and responsive to 
changes in the policy and ﬁnancial environment, developments 
in best practice regarding employee relations and safety and 
new or heightened concerns for communities that inﬂuence  
our investments. 
Through our risk management and stakeholder engagement 
programmes we have identiﬁed ﬁve key sustainability priorities, 
which are material for the business: 
 to maintain positive working relationships with local 
government, NGOs and communities by enhancing our 
partnership agreements and increasing the effectiveness  
of our investments;
 to attract and retain high quality people and ensure and 
improve the quality and terms of their employment;
 to further improve our health and safety systems through 
more sophisticated visualisation, risk management and  
more rigorous monitoring, as well as to enrol it to our wide 
supplier network;
 gaining third party certiﬁcation for our environmental 
management system and embedding the system into 
production operations; and
 to enhance the rigour and transparency in our 
communications with suppliers, customers and partners.
Environmental responsibility
The Group operates complex 
processes on a large scale in remote 
locations, some of which are home  
to indigenous people. These processes 
create waste and emissions, including 
toxic substances, therefore we operate 
a management system to reduce the 
associated impacts while complying 
with national and international 
Government regulations. 
We operate a Group-wide environmental management  
system that is planned and co-ordinated by our Deputy Chief 
Operating Ofﬁcer and Director for Environment, Health and 
Safety from our headquarters in St. Petersburg. The system  
is based on international best practice, applies across all 
Group businesses and complies with relevant Russian and 
Kazakh legislation. One of our priorities for 2012 was to 
prepare for independent certiﬁcation to ISO 14001. This 
certiﬁcation was granted in March 2013, after an external audit 
by Bureau Veritas, an independent environmental assurance 
ﬁrm. The environmental management system is also subject  
to regular internal review. 
The core of the system is an environmental policy, which is 
available at www.polymetalinternational.com. This focuses  
on the use of best practice, continuous improvement, risk 
reduction, compliance and issues management. There is a 
strong focus on incident and emergency control, use of the 
most environmentally friendly materials and resource efﬁciency.
Each of our subsidiary companies has its own environmental 
team which runs and monitors the system and provides 
monthly performance reports to the Group. Air quality,  
surface water and ground water samples collected through  
the system are analysed at laboratories certiﬁed to international 
standards. Our in-house engineering operation, Polymetal 
Engineering, employs more than 100 specialists in the

Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 81 80 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Auditing and compliance
Regular audit and monitoring activities are built into the 
management system and comply with the requirements of 
relevant Russian and Kazakh legislation. External audits are 
undertaken by state supervisory authorities such as the 
Russian Federal Service for Supervision of Natural  
Resource Usage. 
Employee environmental training
Our Human Resources department annually reviews 
environmental training opportunities at national and 
international level. An in-house training programme also 
supplements ongoing professional development with site  
visits and attendance at conferences. Each year, our 
environmental managers attend the All-Russian Industrial 
Ecologists’ Seminar for an update on environmental legislation. 
Speciﬁc courses attended by environmental specialists  
include those covering environmental management systems, 
hazardous waste, land reclamation, water quality assessment 
and environmental security.
Investment in environmental protection
Our overall investment in environmental management and 
monitoring has increased from US$5.6 million in 2011 to  
US$7.8 million in 2012, reﬂecting growth in the scope and 
intensity of external monitoring and expenditure on equipment, 
people and training. In 2012, 48% of this investment went into 
protection of water resources, 33% into land reclamation and 
19% into reductions in atmospheric emissions.
Regulatory authorities specify that we make quarterly 
payments in line with the intensity of monitoring and auditing 
required. In 2012 these payments amounted to US$2.7 million 
compared to US$2.3 million in 2011, reﬂecting continued 
expansion of our production capacity. 
Future plans
Our action plan for 2013-15, focuses on continuous 
improvement to our environmental management systems, 
including improving performance against the most signiﬁcant 
environmental impacts at each site and embedding this into 
standard operating procedures.
Maintaining and managing biodiversity
In accordance with the Federal Law of the Russian Federation 
we do not operate in or near ’Special Protected Areas’, nor 
those that are designated of natural, historical or cultural value 
by IMN. Prior to operating on any site we are required to 
undertake comprehensive surveys and impact assessments. 
Of the 11 mineral ﬁelds that we are currently developing, seven 
are situated in areas where rare, endemic and vanishing ﬂora 
and fauna are found. In all seven, as well as the remaining four 
sites, we operate a system designed to protect ﬂora and fauna. 
This involves baseline monitoring of the pre-development state 
and the creation of protection and buffer zones, away from key 
extraction, transport and construction activity.

accounts for our main GHG emissions. During 2012  
we increased our diesel generation capacity, however, 
our ability to use this energy more efﬁciently saw  
an incremental reduction in GHG emission intensity.

Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 83 82 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Health and safety
A safe and healthy working 
environment is a fundamental right  
for all employees and a measure  
of management effectiveness.
Polymetal’s approach to Health and Safety is set by its 
employee protection and workplace safety management 
system. This is designed to detect, assess and manage 
production risks; ensure employee health and workplace  
safety and deﬁne the safe use of buildings, other structures 
and all equipment. The system complies with ILO-OSH 2001,  
OHSAS 18001 and GOST R 12.0.007-2009.
In 2012, health and safety activity focused on:
 ongoing implementation, operation and reﬁnement  
of the system;
 reducing workplace injuries;
 enhancing the culture of safety within every operation;
 ensuring that the latest safety techniques and equipment  
are applied;
 enhancing safety training.
We operate 102 production sites and processes, each with  
its own inherent risks, including open and underground mines, 
geological exploration sites, ore processing, explosive depots, 
as well as transportation of people, equipment, waste and  
ore. Every employee receives illustrated guides, backed  
up by regular brieﬁngs and formal training sessions, as well as 
the provision of necessary equipment and work wear. This is 
backed up by ongoing internal audits that identify areas of poor 
and positive practice that maintain the integrity of the system.
Workplace accidents
In 2012, there were 11 workplace accidents across the Group, 
none of which were fatal, one of which was serious and ten of 
which were minor. Of this total, 62% of the accidents involved 
being struck by an object, 18% involved falling from height,  
9% falling while walking and 11% were burns related. While the 
total number of non-fatal accidents in 2012 was the same as in 
2011, there was only one serious accident, compared with two 
the previous year (the remainder being classiﬁed as minor).  
Our target is to get the accident rate as close to zero as 
possible, therefore we will continue to improve our health  
and safety systems to prevent incidents.
A key corporate KPI is the ongoing reduction of the Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). This has reduced from 0.63  
in 2011 to 0.59 in 2012, following a major improvement from  
1.9 in 2010. We have also experienced our second consecutive 
year with zero fatalities, which is a tangible and meaningful 
outcome from the measures taken to improve safety systems 
and risk management.
In 2012 we initiated daily risk assessments (DRAs), introduced 
a 5S programme at all of our processing plants and transport 
depots, started to integrate contractors into the health and 
safety system and established ongoing monitoring of risk.

Work-related illness
Zero cases of production-related illness were recorded in 2012. 
Each employee receives, as a minimum, an annual health 
check from one of our medical professionals. In some cases, 
these checks identify the need for speciﬁc treatment, perhaps 
involving time away from the workplace in one of our  
health centres.
Focus for 2013-15
Our health and safety focus for 2013-2015 is on enhancing our 
capabilities in training, visualisation and monitoring, as well as 
rolling out the system to our supplier and contractor network. 
Employees
Our employees are contributors to  
and beneﬁciaries of our commercial 
success. They expect a high quality 
working environment, direction  
and a career pathway. In return  
we expect a clear commitment  
to our corporate goals. 
As a key stakeholder group our employees expect a certain 
standard of behaviour from the Company and in turn we 
provide a Code of Conduct to which they commit to adhere. 
The Code of Conduct is supported by speciﬁc policies on 
recruitment and equality, professional development, appraisal, 
training, resources and skills, organisational design, motivation 
and reward and productivity. The Code also summarises  
our position on harassment and bullying, drugs, conﬂicts of 
interest, bribery, entertainment/gifts, government relations, 
anti-trust and anti-competition laws, community relations, 
insider dealing, data protection, transparency/disclosure and 
environmental protection.
Employment policies and proﬁle
In line with the UN Global Compact principles, our main 
employment objectives are:
 to build a team that is motivated to achieve business 
performance targets;
 to create working conditions and a system of incentives  
that improves safety;
 to supply Company operation projects with appropriately 
skilled personnel; and
 to operate a continuous employee skills improvement 
programme. 
Human resources policies are co-ordinated by our Group Head 
of Human Resources from our headquarters in St. Petersburg. 
These are implemented by the Managing Directors of our 
operating companies, working through their human  
resources teams.
As at 31 December 2012, we employed 9,237 people across 
the Group, with 7 ,862 in production, 554 in exploration and 821 
in research, development, design, logistics and management. 
Most of those working in extraction and exploration work on  
a shift basis, due to the demanding nature of the work and the 
remote locations of many sites. On average, shift workers 
account for 60% of the headcount. The growth in employee 
numbers between 2011 and 2012 is largely accounted for  
by the development of the Amursk and Omolon hubs.
More than 60% of all employees work in Magadan and 
Khabarovsk regions in the hubs at Omolon, Dukat and 
Amursk, as well as Khakanja and Albazino.

efforts to work with local universities to provide internships and 
a pathway for graduates and young specialists into the 
business. In 2012, we employed 260 people under this 
scheme, up from 190 in 2011.

Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 85 84 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Skills development and training
All Polymetal employees have access to a comprehensive 
training programme, covering general aspects of our 
operations and speciﬁc technical curricula. This is delivered  
as part of an appraisal system that measures employee 
development and maps out career pathways. When new 
employees join the Company, they undergo an initial appraisal, 
as part of which a detailed training plan is drawn up  
and agreed.
Over 2012 we invested US$1.1 million (2011: US$0.9 million)  
in professional training across all disciplines. In 2012, this 
meant that 2,096 employees had some form of additional 
professional development training. In 2012, the average 
number of hours of training was the same as for 2011:  
41 hours per person for managers and 42 hours per person  
for specialists. Between 2011 and 2012 the average hours  
of training for all other employees increased from 47 to 90, 
reﬂecting the work done to enhance our occupational  
health and safety system. 
Employee relations
We support our employees’ right to freedom of association  
and their desire to enter into collective agreements. In 2012, 
7 ,526 employees (or 81% of the total workforce) were 
participating in collective agreements at our eight main 
operating sites in Russia and Kazakhstan. Some of the 
agreements expire and will be renegotiated in 2013, while  
most will run to mid/late 2015. At each of these sites, at least 
one employee (with a maximum of nine) sits on a Labour 
Relations Commission (LRC), a vehicle for discussing work-
related queries and concerns. In tandem with the LRC, six  
of the sites hosted Workers’ Councils, which act as a further 
voice for employees in that operation. On the two sites that  
do not, those contributing to the LRC act as the conduit for 
views from the workforce.
The principles that we adhere to when engaging with local 
communities and indigenous peoples in these locations are:
 to be open to ideas and comments from those living and 
working close to our operations;
 to be transparent in our dealings with those living and 
working close to our operations – providing timely, relevant 
and accurate information on the progress of corporate and 
community investment projects; 
 to take a long-term view of interaction and investment and 
put in place systems for identifying investment priorities  
and monitoring progress;
 to identify and act on the most signiﬁcant issues for local 
communities and indigenous peoples – entailing open and 
regular dialogue; and
 to provide real and tangible beneﬁts to local communities 
and indigenous peoples.
Investing in communities
Our community investment priorities have been determined 
through feedback from our employees and our experience  
of working with communities and indigenous peoples over  
many years. At least once a year, we evaluate local community 
requirements through public meetings, questionnaires,  
surveys and one to one dialogue. This allows us to identify  
key investment targets and assess the impact of existing 
investments. In the main, these investments focus on the 
following activities and groups:
 Education and healthcare
 Infrastructure
 Sports facilities and healthy lifestyle initiatives
 Cultural and creative development with indigenous peoples
 Indigenous Minorities of the North (IMN).
These investments totalled US$6 million in 2012, more than 
80% of which was directed towards sports, education and 
healthcare projects.

Community
Our aim is to operate with the tacit 
support of our neighbours in the form 
of local communities and indigenous 
peoples. Our relationship with these 
communities has many facets, as an 
employer, a user of services, a user  
of resources, producer of waste 
materials and emissions and as an 
investor in local infrastructure and  
the social fabric. We therefore offer 
multiple contact points, both formal 
and informal, such that needs are 
addressed and the beneﬁts of the 
relationships are maximised.
We recognise that our business cannot operate without formal 
and informal licence to operate from local authorities and their 
associated communities. In our areas of operation we are  
a signiﬁcant employer and creator of infrastructure that  
impacts upon adjacent communities and indigenous peoples. 
Consequently we have formalised our approach to and  
attitude towards local and indigenous peoples in our Code  
of Corporate Governance and Policy on Social Investments 
that are informed by the UN Global Compact and the UN 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Compliance 
with the Code is monitored by the Technical Committee  
and implemented through our Group companies by their  
respective management teams.
Our operations – and hence the regional and local populations 
with which we interact – are numerous and widespread, 
including Russia’s Far East (Omsukchan, Srednekansk and 
Severo-Evensk districts in Magadan Region, Okhotsk, Amursk, 
Ayano-Maysk and Polina Osipenko, as well as the town of 
Amursk in Khabarovsk Territory); Northern Urals (the towns  
of Krasnoturinsk, Karpinsk, Degtyarsk and Sukhoi Log and 
Vorontsovka village); Chaun district in Chukotka Autonomous 
Territory and Taranovka district in Kazakhstan.
Community engagement
In 2011-12, we organised 30 meetings with local communities 
and IMN groups, eight round table discussions and 
consultations with the representatives of local ecological and 
social welfare groups and organised six sites visits for nature 
conservation organisations. 
Feedback obtained from these meetings, informal contact  
and ongoing evaluation of community investment work was 
overwhelmingly positive. While this is a pleasing outcome, we 
are conscious of our long-term commitments to the economic, 
social and environmental wellbeing of the people and places 
associated with our operations.
In line with our own codes and policies, we have six 
agreements in place with IMN communities in our Russian  
Far East operations. These agreements are drawn up in 
consultation with IMN and local authority representatives and 
focus on support for traditional reindeer breeding activity, 
educational and cultural programmes designed to celebrate 
and preserve language and traditions, provision of fuel, food, 
vehicles and building materials, maintaining and restoring 
festival and holiday traditions, learning about local ecosystems, 
exchanging knowledge on environmental protection and 
facilitating exchanges between others in the local area and  
IMN representatives.
Community beneﬁt
Over and above our tax commitments and employment 
commitments, we maintain and enhance local infrastructure 
and services, maintain and grow the working population, 
increase employment opportunities, provided training and 
education for local people and operate a long-term programme 
of community investment. As an average, the proportion of 
employees drawn from the local population, across all of our 
sites, is about 90% of the total workforce. In addition, at the 
end of 2012, we also employed more than 80 people from 
indigenous minorities living and working adjacent to our 
production sites.

Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholders
Governance is at the heart of our culture, providing a 
framework within which we can maintain and develop the 
values and practices that support our corporate objectives, 
and which ensure that Polymetal reﬂects high levels of ethical 
and responsible behaviour.
During our ﬁrst full year as a premium listed company  
on the London Stock Exchange we have worked hard to  
ensure that we follow both the letter and the spirit of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code. We have a disciplined 
approach characterised by a system of regular review and 
assessment, and a programme of continuous improvement. 
This approach is designed to achieve a balance between 
encouraging positive and dynamic commercial values, and 
applying the appropriate discipline and regulatory guidance 
where required. Such balance ensures that we achieve our 
business objectives by operating a rigorous system of internal 
control, supported by culture of control and accountability 
throughout the organisation.
In 2012, we have been particularly focused on the Code’s 
emphasis on the analysis of alignment of remuneration with 
shareholder interests, the balance and effectiveness of the 
Board and its composition, and the active stewardship of risk 
management. 
With the exception of certain legacy share option scheme 
arrangements (which will be subject to changes in June 2013 
and which are already addressed by forward-looking changes 
to the remuneration policy), we are complying with the 
provisions of the Code, and will continue to assess and 
develop our governance framework as appropriate. Part  
of this process encompasses a formal internal evaluation  
of the performance of the Board, its Committees and individual 
members. While evaluation during the year has conﬁrmed the 
Board’s effectiveness, further feedback will form part of 
ongoing recommendations for its development.
Polymetal is a unique and strongly focused business.  
We believe that our robust corporate governance structure  
and effective operation of the Board are already translating into 
delivery of our tactical and strategic targets and shareholder 
value creation: delivery on projects and production targets, and 
consequently our ability to sustain ﬁnancial performance and 
dividend ﬂow to shareholders. All these solid achievements are 
already meaningfully differentiating Polymetal from many  
of our peers in the sector.
We are on track with our strategy, both operationally and 
ﬁnancially. Going forward, we are committed to ensuring that 
the Company is run in the best interests of all its stakeholders 
and that the Board is accountable for responsible stewardship, 
disciplined performance and sustainable value delivery.
Bobby Godsell
Chairman
Statement of compliance with UK Corporate 
Governance Code 
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of 
corporate governance. As a premium listed company, during 
the year ended 31 December 2012 Polymetal International was 
required to comply with the UK Code of Corporate Governance 
(‘the UK Code’) published in June 2010 and available at the UK 
Financial Reporting Council’s website or, where the provisions 
of the UK Code have not been complied with, to provide 
appropriate explanations. In 2012, the Company has complied 
with the provisions of the UK Code, except for the following:
 Schedule A of the UK Code recommends share options and 
awards should not vest in less than three years. The existing 
option scheme will become fully compliant with Schedule A 
from June 2013. 
The reason for non-compliance was the existence of share 
option arrangements prior to admission. 
The UK Code recommends that share options and awards 
should not vest in fewer than three years. In November 2010, 
prior to the UK Code becoming applicable to the Company, 
share-based payment awards were granted to certain 
employees that could, subject to the meeting of speciﬁc 
performance criteria, vest in June 2013 (a period of two years,  
7 months). This vesting period was considered appropriate as 
it aligned employee incentives with the Company’s objectives. 
In June 2013 option holders will either exercise their options  
or have an opportunity to extend them for a further year at a 
higher performance condition level (see details on page 109 
below), following which the existing option scheme will become 
fully compliant with Schedule A as no outstanding share 
options and awards granted under it will vest in less than three 
years from the date of their grant.
The Board has already made appropriate amendments  
to the Company’s remuneration policy so that any future 
share-based payment award arrangements will comply with 
the recommendations of the UK Code. Refer to the Directors’ 
Remuneration report on page 105 for more detail.
Role and structure of the Board
The Company’s Board comprises one executive Director, the 
non-executive Chairman and seven non-executive Directors. 
Excluding the Chairman, four members of the board are 
independent non-executive Directors. Refer to the schedule 
below for the structure of the Board and its Committees, 
showing the status of each Director.
The independent non-executive Directors are those determined 
by the Board to be independent in character and judgement 
and to be free from relationships or circumstances, which may 
affect, or could appear to affect, the Director’s judgement.
The role of independent Directors on the Board is: to challenge 
the strategy and scrutinise the performance of management in 
meeting agreed goals and objectives; to monitor performance 
of the Company; to review the integrity of ﬁnancial information 
and to review the appropriateness of the Company’s internal 
controls and risk management systems. 
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations and  
the Company Secretary is notiﬁed promptly of any changes  
to those interests. Before each Board meeting, Directors 
reconﬁrm their independence and all Directors disclose 
whether they hold any interests in any matters to be reviewed 
at the Board meeting. 
The signiﬁcant shareholders of the Company are represented 
on the Board by Mr Yanakov (who is a representative of 
Powerboom Investments Limited); Ms. Grönberg (who is  
a representative of Vitalbond Limited, A&NN and Capital 
Management Fund Limited) and Mr Duvieusart (who is a 
representative of PPF Group BV). Mr Nesis is the brother of the 
beneﬁcial owner of Powerboom Investments Limited. Save for 
the potential conﬂicts inherent in these relationships, there are 
no potential conﬂicts of interest between the duties owed by 
the Directors or senior management to the Company and their 
private interests or other duties.
The Board has determined Charles Balfour, Jonathan Best, 
Russell Skirrow and Leonard Homenuik to be independent 
non-executive directors. Bobby Godsell met the independence 
criteria on appointment. Jonathan Best has been on the Board 
of the Company since September 2011 and on the Board of 
JSC Polymetal since December 2006 and his reappointment  
is subject to particularly rigorous review. The Board believes 
that Jonathan continues to display all of the qualities of 
independence pursuant to the criteria set out in the Code.
In 2012 the Company sold 100% of Amikan Holdings Limited, 
which owns the Veduga gold deposit (‘Veduga’) in the 
Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation, to Polygon Gold 
Inc. (‘Polygon’). Mr Homeniuk serves as Polygon’s Executive 
Chairman and CEO. Polygon operates as a standalone 
company with independent management and Polymetal 
provides certain technical and regulatory assistance to Polygon 
on an ongoing basis. Polymetal currently holds 42.6% equity 
ownership in Polygon and one of the four board seats and 
therefore has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but does not have control 
over its activities. The Board continues to consider Mr 
Homeniuk to be an independent non-executive Director.  
The Board concluded that the relationship between Polymetal 
and Polygon is not material, given the carrying value of Veduga 
which is US$19.3 million and represents approximately 0.5%  
of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2012.

Corporate Governance
continued
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management  
of the Group and developing the Group’s business strategy, 
objectives, budget and forecasts and, once approved  
by the Board, overseeing their successful implementation.  
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer reports to the Chairman and  
to the Board directly. The Board interacts with the executive 
management on a regular basis. Directors welcome senior 
executives to attend relevant parts of the Board and  
committee meetings for reporting on items of the agenda  
and participating in discussion. All members of executive 
management report directly to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.  
His responsibilities include:
 development and proposal of Group strategy, including 
communicating annual plans and commercial objectives  
to the Board; 
 upholding the Group’s responsibilities to its shareholders, 
customers, employees and other stakeholders;
 identifying and executing strategic opportunities;
 regularly reviewing the operational performance and 
strategic direction of the Group;
 making recommendations on remuneration policies, 
executive remuneration and terms of employment  
for senior employees;
 ensuring the development needs of the executive Directors 
and senior management are identiﬁed and met and ensuring 
effective succession planning; and
 ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
appropriate, timely and accurate information is disclosed to 
the market, with issues escalated promptly to the executive 
management and the Board.
Senior Independent Director
Charles Balfour acts as the Board’s Senior Independent 
Director. Mr Balfour is available to shareholders and as an 
intermediary for the other Directors if necessary. He attends 
meetings with major shareholders to listen to their views in 
order to help develop a balanced understanding of the issues 
and concerns of major shareholders. Meetings between 
independent Directors, including Mr Balfour, and major 
institutional shareholders took place in 2012. The Board  
is regularly updated on the shareholders’ opinions following 
meetings with the Company’s management. 
Separate meetings are held between with the non-executive 
Directors without the Chairman or executive Directors being 
present; and between the independent non-executive 
Directors without the other non-executive Directors being 
present. This includes both formal and informal meetings 
between Directors.
Constructive use of the AGM
The Board uses the AGM to communicate with investors and 
to encourage their participation. To ensure the Company’s 
shareholders have time to consider our Annual Report and 
Accounts and Notice of the AGM and lodge their proxy votes  
in good time, all meeting materials are mailed more than  
20 working days prior to the meeting. Separate resolutions  
are proposed on each substantially separate subject and all 
resolutions are put to a poll. The Company also offers 
shareholders the ability to abstain.
Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM are 
encouraged to submit proxy votes either electronically or in 
paper format. At the Company’s 2012 AGM we received votes 
representing approximately 85% of our issued share capital. 
The results of the proxy vote are read at the meeting with the 
ﬁnal results announced via the London Stock Exchange and 
available on the website. 
In addition, our AGM provides a valuable opportunity for 
shareholders to meet with and put questions to the Directors  
in person. The 2012 AGM was attended by all Directors, 
including the Chairmen of the Audit and Risk, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees. Live webcast and conference 
call facilities are available for the shareholders unable to be 
present in person and a recording of the AGM webcast  
is made available on the Company’s website.
The primary means of communication with the majority  
of our shareholders, who have not requested paper copies  
of our documentation, is through our corporate website  
www.polymetalinternational.com.

Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Godsell and  
its other members are Mr Homenuik and Mr Balfour. The 
Committee has responsibility for making recommendations  
to the Board on the composition of the Board and its 
Committees, including appointments of additional and 
replacement Directors. The Committee:
 leads the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board;
 regularly reviews the Board structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, independence, experience 
and diversity) and makes recommendations to the Board 
about any changes that the Committee considers necessary;
The Company considers that the Board and its Committees 
have the appropriate balance of skills, experience, 
independence and knowledge of the Company to enable  
them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities 
effectively. All Directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary, and are able to take independent 
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Board meetings
In 2012, the Board met seven times. Further business was 
approved by written resolutions of the Board on two occasions. 
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for:
 deﬁning the commercial strategy and long-term objectives  
of the Group;
 approving annual operating and capital expenditure budgets 
and any material changes to them; 
 overseeing the Group’s operations, ensuring: competent and 
prudent management; sound planning; a strong system of 
internal control; and compliance with all statutory and 
regulatory obligations; 
 reviewing the performance of the Group in the light of its 
business strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets 
and ensuring that any necessary corrective action is taken; 
 approving any material extension of the Group’s activities  
into new businesses or geographic areas and any decision 
to cease to operate all or any material part of the Group’s 
business; and
 ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives and 
maintaining constructive dialogue with shareholders. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the Board is reviewed  
at least annually.
Roles of the Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and  
Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved the division of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO) 
and the role of the Senior Independent Director (SID). 
The Chairman reports to the Board and is responsible for the 
leadership and overall effectiveness of the Board and setting 
the Board’s agenda. His responsibilities include:
 effective running of the Board;
 ensuring there is appropriate delegation of authority from the 
Board to executive management; 
 promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating 
the effective contribution of non-executive Directors in 
particular and ensuring constructive relations between 
executive and non-executive Directors;
 encouraging active engagement by all members of the 
Board; and
 ensuring that the views of the shareholders are 
communicated to the Board as a whole. 
Mr Godsell is able to commit sufﬁcient time to his role as 
non-executive Chairman of Polymetal International.  
Mr Godsell’s other signiﬁcant commitment is membership  
of the South African National Planning Commission, a 
government commission, and up to March 2012 was the Chair 
of the board of Optimum Coal Holdings, a Johannesburg listed 
medium size coal mining company. In January 2012 he also 
accepted a non-executive directorship in the South African 
state owned Industrial Development Corporation, however,  
the additional time commitment required by this additional  
role is more than offset by the termination of his role on the 
board of Optimum Coal Holdings, acquired by Glencore 
International plc.

Audit and Risk Committee report
Dear Shareholders
As part of the Board’s overall responsibilities – in particular  
as they relate to risk management and internal control – the 
Audit and Risk Committee has a speciﬁc role in the review  
and supervision of the Company’s ﬁnancial reporting and 
internal controls. In addition, it has responsibility for the  
review, evaluation and stewardship of the Company’s risk 
management processes with particular emphasis on areas  
of possible or likely change.
The Audit and Risk Committee is a fully independent body, 
consisting only of Independent non-executive Directors with 
relevant skills and experience in ﬁnancial reporting and risk 
management.
In 2012 three meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee were 
held and further business conducted by the Committee was 
approved by written resolutions on two further occasions.  
The Audit and Risk Committee dealt with the following matters:
 reviewed and recommended for approval ﬁnancial and risk 
information included in the Annual Report 2011;
 reviewed and recommended for approval Polymetal’s results 
for the six months to 30 June 2012;
 discussed and approved the Committee work plan;
 supervised compliance with the Company’s Anti-Bribery  
and Corruption Policy;
 reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan and monitored the 
effectiveness of internal audit;
 reviewed the Group’s external audit plan and recommended 
for approval the year end audit fee; 
 reviewed the actual audit fee in 2012 compared to the 
authorised amount;
 approved the terms of engagement, including engagement 
letter issued at the start of each audit and the scope of  
the audit;
 reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the  
external auditor;
 reviewed the critical risks and exposures of the Group, 
including tax risks;
 recommended approval of Deloitte LLP as external  
auditors; and
 reviewed the capability of Group’s ﬁnance team.  
Performed a self assessment review of the Committee’s 
effectiveness relative to the requirements of its terms  
of reference.
In 2012 the Committee focused in particular on risks – 
including those relating to tax following recent rulings – and 
made signiﬁcant progress in improving the quality of external 
and internal reporting.
Further, the Audit and Risk Committee has reviewed the 
approach taken both by management and the external auditors 
in the key judgements and risk areas of the ﬁnancial reporting, 
ensuring the fair presentation of the Company’s ﬁnancial 
statements, supported by an independent external audit.
In common with the Company’s overall approach to 
governance, we have instilled a strong culture of discipline 
throughout our business, and are conﬁdent that we have  
a strong system of ﬂexible processes which enable the 
Committee to operate effectively.
At a meeting of the Committee held on 23 April 2013 the 
Committee reviewed the ﬁnancial statements for the 2012 
ﬁnancial year and the report from the external auditors  
was considered. After due consideration the Committee 
recommends the approval of the 2012 ﬁnancial statements  
by the Board and shareholders.
The Committee also reviewed various assurance reports 
provided by the external auditor, internal audit and 
management and concluded that – in respect of the 2012 
ﬁnancial year – the system of internal ﬁnancial controls is 
adequate and that there were no signiﬁcant breakdowns  
in internal controls.
Going forward, we as a Committee are set to operate 
effectively as a key body scrutinising the reporting, internal 
control and risk management process in order to ensure 
transparency and objectivity of the Company’s reporting.
Jonathan Best
Chairman, Audit and Risk Committee
 considers plans and makes recommendations to the  
Board for orderly succession to the Board and to senior 
management, so as to maintain an appropriate balance of 
skills and experience within the Company and on the Board 
and to ensure progressive refreshing of the Board, taking 
into account the challenges and opportunities facing  
the Company;
 keeps under review the leadership needs of the Group, both 
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the 
continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in the 
marketplace;
 before any appointment is made by the Board, evaluate the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience, independence  
and diversity of the Board, and in the light of this evaluation 
prepares a description of the role and capabilities required 
for a particular appointment and the expected time 
commitment; and
 reviews the results of the Board’s performance evaluation 
process that relate to the composition of the Board and 
whether non-executive Directors are spending enough  
time to fulﬁl their duties.
There were no changes to the Board structure in 2012 and the 
Company has not employed external search consultants.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company 
(the Articles), at every Annual General Meeting one third of the 
Directors on the Board must retire or, if the number of Directors 
is not divisible by three, the number of Directors nearest to one 
third shall retire from ofﬁce but any Director who has held ofﬁce 
for three years or more since he or she was last appointed  
(or re-appointed) at the date ﬁxed for the annual general 
meeting must retire. In accordance with the UK Code, all 
Directors are subject to annual re-election. 
Full terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive 
Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered ofﬁce.
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 88 to 
89 and the Board considers that each of the Directors will be 
an effective contributor to the success of the Group. Following 
their performance evaluations, the Chairman believes that each 
Director standing for re-election continues to be effective  
and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role.  
A performance evaluation of the Chairman was conducted  
by the Board in 2012, and the Board believes that the 
Chairman continues to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to his role. 
Upon appointment, Directors receive a full induction, including: 
information about the Company; an outline of the role of a 
Director and a summary of his or her responsibilities and 
ongoing obligations under legislation, regulation and best 
practice; a Copy of the UK Listing Authority (‘UKLA’) Model 
Code, and details of the Company’s policies regarding 
Directors’ share dealings and the disclosure of price sensitive 
information. Directors also receive the Company’s guidelines 
on matters reserved for the Board and terms of reference of 
the Board committees and other governing documents of the 
Company. Directors and chairmen of the Board committees 
regularly receive updates on changes to the corporate 
governance and regulatory requirements and other changes 
affecting the Company. The Board is kept informed of relevant 
developments in the Company by way of monthly management 
reports, including comprehensive information on operating and 
ﬁnancial performance and progress of capital projects. A ﬁeld 
trip to the Omolon and Dukat hubs for non-executive Directors 
took place in October 2012. 
There were two meetings of the Nomination Committee in 
2012. Evaluation of performance of the Board, its Committees 
and individual Directors was performed in 2012.
The Nomination Committee at its meetings discussed diversity 
and ways of helping to promote women in the Company.  
The Board welcomes diversity at all levels; it believes that the 
right way to approach diversity is not to introduce ﬁxed quotas, 
but to seek the right qualities in every appointment, where 
competence comes ﬁrst. Diversity becomes a bonus of such 
an approach. Despite challenges presented by the industry  
the Company operates in, it takes steps to promote women 
including hiring women in positions traditionally held by men. 
This approach has led to an increase in the number of women 
holding senior positions in the Group from 19% in 2011  
to 23% in 2012. 
Full terms of reference of the Nomination  
Committee are available at the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com
The Board considers that the composition of the Board and 
the Nomination Committee complies with the requirements  
of the UK Code.
Board evaluation
The Board carried out a performance evaluation of itself, its 
Committees, the Chairman and CEO. This was conducted 
without the assistance of an external facilitator. In accordance 
with the UK Code, it is the Board’s intention that the evaluation 
process will be externally facilitated every three years.
The process consisted of the Board discussing its composition 
and operational integrity; the balance of executive and 
non-executive Directors, independent Directors and Directors 
representing major shareholders; the balance of skills, 
experience, and knowledge of the Company; and international 
diversity. The number of Board and Committee meetings held 
was discussed as well as the performance of each Committee 
of the Board; it was agreed that the Board worked effectively 
together as a unit. The remuneration of Directors and senior 
management was also considered. Areas for further 
development identiﬁed included the enhancement of formal 
succession planning, and the process by which assessment  
of individual Board member performance was performed.  
The overall conclusion was that the Board and its Committees 
operated successfully and that Directors receive accurate, 
timely and clear information ensuring ongoing board 
effectiveness. Each Director continues to contribute effectively 
and to demonstrate commitment to the role (including 
commitment of time for board and committee meetings  
and any other duties).

Audit and Risk Committee report

Internal control and risk management
The Company aims to ensure that all its activities are 
adequately controlled to mitigate risk and support the 
achievement of its objectives, while avoiding the creation  
of excessive bureaucracy. The system of internal controls  
is designed to manage rather than completely eliminate  
the risk to achieve the Company’s business objectives  
in order to bring the residual risk to an acceptable level.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk 
management and internal control (including ﬁnancial, operating 
and compliance controls), the Board considers the key ﬁndings 
from the ongoing monitoring and reporting processes, 
management assertions and independent assurance reports. 
The Board also takes account of material changes and trends 
in the risk proﬁle and considers whether the control system, 
including reporting, adequately supports the Board in achieving 
its risk management objectives.
During the course of the year the Board considered the 
Group’s responsiveness to changes within its business 
environment. The Board is satisﬁed that there is an ongoing 
process, which has been operational during the year, and  
up to the date of approval of the Annual Report, for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by  
the Group.
Internal audit
The internal audit function supports this aim by providing the 
Directors, through the Audit and Risk Committee, with an 
objective evaluation of the Company’s and the Group’s 
governance framework. The internal audit function also aims  
to raise levels of understanding and awareness of risk and 
control throughout the Group.
The head of internal audit reports to the CEO and, through the 
Audit and Risk Committee, to the Board of Directors. Where 
relevant, the internal audit function will additionally report its 
ﬁndings to members of the Company’s executive management.
The internal audit function’s annual work plan is designed to 
focus on matters arising from the operational risk matrix and  
is approved by the Audit and Risk Committee in advance.
The internal audit function uses an annual self-certiﬁcation 
process, which requires managers throughout the Group  
to personally conﬁrm the testing of internal controls and 
compliance with Group policies within their business or 
function and the steps taken to address actual or potential 
issues that are identiﬁed.
Management provides a timely response to issues raised by 
internal audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved within 
one reporting period.
Internal control framework and activities
The management structure of the Group and internal policies 
and procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust control 
framework within the Group which will result in the 
achievement of strategic objectives within the set risk tolerance 
levels. This framework includes:
 appropriate tone set from the top from the Board level, 
aimed at building the appropriate control environment;
 a proper risk identiﬁcation and management system  
(for more detail please refer to page 76);
 the strict division of responsibilities and adequate delegation 
of authority;
 speciﬁc control activities implemented at all levels of the 
Group; and
 a periodic review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The governance framework reﬂects the speciﬁc structure and 
management of the Group, where authority and control are 
delegated by the Board to different levels, from the Chief 
Executive to the managers of the Group’s operating entities 
and then downward to business and project managers  
as appropriate. 
Within this framework, authority is delegated within clearly 
prescribed limits and decisions are escalated where either 
project size or risk proﬁle require a higher level of authority.
In addition to controls operating in speciﬁc areas (production, 
exploration, construction, procurement), the control framework 
also includes a set of common procedures for ﬁnancial 
accounting, reporting and budgeting – see details below. 
The Board conﬁrms that the actions it considers necessary 
have been or are being taken to remedy any failings or 
weaknesses in the Group’s system of internal controls.  
This has involved considering the matters reported to it and 
developing plans and programmes that it considers are 
reasonable in the circumstances. Based on the results of the 
review of risk management and internal control activities, 
undertaken by the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, 
the Board considers that the risk management and internal 
control systems are in accordance with the Revised Guidance 
for Directors on the UK Code.
Audit and Risk Committee 
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Mr Best and its 
other members are Mr Skirrow and Mr Balfour, all independent 
non-executive Directors. The Directors consider that Mr Best 
has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience (refer to page 89 
for details of Mr Best’s experience). In addition, the other 
members of the Committee have a wide range of ﬁnancial  
and other relevant experience.
The responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee comprise:
 monitoring the integrity of the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements and reviewing its annual and interim ﬁnancial 
statements, including, but not limited to: the consistency of, 
and any changes to, accounting and treasury policies across 
the Company and the Group; the methods used to account 
for signiﬁcant or unusual transactions; the reasonableness  
of signiﬁcant estimates and judgements, taking into account 
the views of the external auditor; and the clarity and 
completeness of disclosure in the consolidated  
ﬁnancial statements;
 considering and making recommendations to the Board, to 
be put to the shareholders to consider at the annual general 
meeting, in relation to the appointment, re-appointment, 
resignation or removal of the Group’s external auditors;
 overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external auditors 
and reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process; 
the Committee meets with the external auditors at least once 
a year without management being present, to discuss their 
remit and any issues arising from the audit;
 reviewing the independence of external auditors and the 
appropriateness of the provision of any non-audit services  
by the external auditor;
 reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal 
controls and risk management systems;
 monitoring and review of the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function in the context of the Group’s overall 
risk management system; 
 reviewing the Group’s policies and procedures for preventing 
and detecting fraud, the systems and controls in place for 
preventing bribery, and its policies for ensuring that the 
Group complies with relevant regulatory and legal 
requirements; and
 approving signiﬁcant transactions.
Full terms of reference of the Audit and Risk  
Committee are available at the Company’s website:  
www.polymetalinternational.com 
The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the 
interim and annual ﬁnancial statements remains with the  
Board. The Committee gives due consideration to applicable 
laws and regulations, the provisions of the UK Code and the 
requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Company’s 
relationship with its external auditors relating to the provision  
of non-audit services to ensure that auditor objectivity and 
independence is safeguarded. This is achieved by disclosure  
of the extent and nature of non-audit services (see Note 14  
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) and the prohibition 
against selected services being provided by the external 
auditor. Policy on the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor was approved by the Committee in 2012 and 
deﬁnes permitted audit and non-audit services. Pre-approval 
thresholds are in place for the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor, for which the pre-approval of the  
CFO (if below US$5,000), Chairman of the Audit and Risk 
Committee (if between US$5,000 and US$20,000), and Audit 
and Risk Committee (if above US$20,000) is required. Above  
a certain threshold, if it is determined that the external auditor 
has no obvious competitive advantage in the performance of 
proposed non-audit services, then the provider of those 
services must be chosen by way of a competitive tender. 
Certain types of non-audit work may be undertaken by the 
auditors without prior referral to the Audit and Risk Committee 
up to a cumulative annual value of US$100,000. Any further  
non-audit work is subject to approval by the Audit and Risk 
Committee in further tranches of US$100,000. In the event  
that the cumulative value of non-audit fees exceeds 
US$500,000 in any given year, separate approval of the  
Audit and Risk Committee is required explaining why there  
is no threat to independence. A copy of the policy is available 
on the Company’s website. 
The Audit and Risk Committee has considered information 
pertaining to the balance between fees for audit and non-audit 
work for the Company in 2012 and concluded that the nature 
and extent of non-audit services provided do not present  
a threat to the external auditor’s objectivity or independence.
The re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external 
auditors is reviewed annually by the Audit and Risk Committee. 
Deloitte LLP were appointed auditors in 2011, with Deloitte CIS 
having been auditors of JSC Polymetal since the last tendering 
process in 2007. 
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditors’ 
performance and independence underpins its recommendation 
to the Board to propose to shareholders the re-appointment  
of Deloitte LLP as auditors until the conclusion of the AGM  
in 2014. Resolutions to authorise the Board to re-appoint and 
determine their remuneration will be proposed at the AGM  
on 12 June 2013. 
The Board considers that the Audit and Risk Committee 
complies with the requirements of the UK Code.

Directors’ report
Financial reporting systems
The quality of the ﬁnancial accounting and reporting is ensured 
through a set of control procedures in the following areas: 
accounting methodology, preliminary review of the new 
transactions, documentation, accounting techniques and 
ﬁnancial closing procedures. 
Accounting policies are developed centrally for each of the 
Group’s subsidiaries and are adapted for the peculiarities  
of each entity and the Group-wide policies. Employees 
responsible for accounting and reporting functions have 
powers to review upcoming transactions and propose 
adjustments, where necessary, to ensure proper accounting 
and tax treatments. 
The use of a centralised ERP system in each of the Group 
companies ensures uniﬁcation of the business and accounting 
processes. The Group implements a multi-level set of controls 
over ﬁnancial and accounting data recorded in the system. 
These controls involve the accounting department of each 
subsidiary, senior management of the subsidiary and controls  
at the Head Ofﬁce level. In addition, the accounting and 
reporting data are regularly audited by internal and  
external auditors. 
 
Procedures for approval of capital and current 
expenditures 
The Company prepares annual operating and capital 
expenditure budgets based on its current and strategic  
goals and objectives. In addition to periodic control of actual 
ﬁnancial performance versus budgeted, a procedure of 
ongoing control and authorisation of expenses is in place.  
The current system of pre-approval of signiﬁcant transactions, 
along with accounting procedures in the ERP system,  
achieves a level of control over the amount and 
appropriateness of expenses. 
Treasury operations
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which  
is responsible for payments on behalf of all subsidiaries  
of the Group. Use of such a centralised system achieves  
the best level of control over the payments function without 
compromising the speed and reliability of payments.  
All interactions with banks on accounts maintenance,  
deposits and borrowings and foreign currency transactions  
is also performed at the Head Ofﬁce level.
Controls over IT systems used in ﬁnancial accounting 
and reporting
The Group uses a 1C: Enterprise 8 ERP system for automation  
of everyday enterprise activities. These include various 
business tasks of economic and management functions,  
such as management accounting, business accounting,  
HR management, CRM, SRM, MRP . Polymetal also uses the 
ERP system for budgeting, accounting, HR record keeping  
and payroll, supply chain management, operational reporting,  
and procurement. The Group operates an IT management 
framework based on COBIT (Control Objectives for Information 
and Related Technology), which provides a complete set  
of high-level requirements to be considered by for effective 
control of each IT process.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and the Directors are committed to ensuring 
adherence to the highest legal and ethical standards. This 
must be reﬂected in every aspect of the way in which the 
Group operates. Bribery is a criminal offence in the countries  
in which the Group operates, and corrupt acts expose the 
Group and its employees to the risk of prosecution, ﬁnes  
and imprisonment, as well as endangering the Company’s 
reputation. The Group has anti-bribery policies in place, which 
extend across all of Group’s business dealings in all countries 
and territories in which the Group operates and apply to all 
employees of the Group, as well as relevant business partners 
and other relevant individuals and entities. The Board attaches 
the utmost importance to this policy and applies a ‘zero 
tolerance’ approach to acts of bribery and corruption by any of 
the Group’s employees or by business partners working on the 
Group’s behalf and prohibits the payment, offer or authorisation 
of bribes, the receipt or acceptance of a bribe, or the payment, 
offer or promise to pay any facilitating payments. Any breach of 
this policy is regarded as a serious matter by the Company and 
is likely to result in disciplinary action.
As part of its implementation of internal procedures to comply 
with the UK Bribery Act, the Group has in place a formalised 
whistle-blowing policy which describes processes in place for 
staff to communicate, in conﬁdence, concerns about possible 
improprieties, unethical or illegal activities and ensures that 
arrangements are in place for independent investigation  
of such matters.
Copies of the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and the 
whistle-blowing policy are available on request from the 
Company’s ofﬁces.
The Directors submit the Annual Report of Polymetal 
International Plc together with the audited ﬁnancial  
statements of Polymetal International Plc for the year  
ended 31 December 2012.
Principal activities and business review 
Polymetal International is a large gold and silver mining 
company, operating central processing hubs and a number  
of standalone mines in Russia and Kazakhstan. Detailed 
information on the Group’s business, activities and ﬁnancial 
performance can be found in Overview and Business Review 
sections of this report on pages from 2 to 61. These sections 
also include description of likely future developments and any 
research and development activities held by the Company  
and the Group.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Refer to pages 77 to 79 for a description of principal risks and 
uncertainties and the Group’s response and pages 97 to 98  
for a description of the main features of Group’s system of 
internal control. For details of ﬁnancial risk management,  
please refer to Note 30 on page 152.
Corporate governance 
Refer to pages 90 to 98 for a description of the Group’s 
corporate governance structure and policies.
Going concern 
The business of the Group, its strategy and the factors  
that may affect future performance are described on pages 2 
to 61 of this report. The risks in achieving the Group’s strategic 
objectives, together with assessment of their potential impact 
and mitigating actions are set out on pages 77 to 79 of this 
report. The ﬁnancial position of the Group, its cash ﬂows and 
liquidity are further analysed on pages 62 to 75 of this report.
The Board, having considered all relevant factors related  
to ﬁnancial position, risks and business prospects of the 
Group, and its projected future cash ﬂows, has a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue operations in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the 
Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012. 
Refer also to Note 1 of the ﬁnancial statements.
Financial and business reporting
The Board believes that the disclosures set out on pages 2  
to 75 of this Annual Report provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Directors
The Directors, their status and Board Committee memberships 
are set out on pages 88 to 92 of the report.
Directors’ interests
Information on Directors’ interests in shares of the Company  
is set out in the Remuneration report on page 108.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company indemniﬁed every Director or other ofﬁcer of the 
Company (other than any person (whether an ofﬁcer or not) 
engaged by the Company as auditor) out of the assets of the 
Company against any liability incurred by him for negligence, 
default, breach of duty, breach of trust or otherwise in relation 
to the affairs of the Company. This provision does not affect 
any indemnity that a Director or ofﬁcer is otherwise entitled to.
Supplier payment policy
The Company’s and the Group’s policy is to set the terms  
of payment with suppliers when agreeing the terms of each 
transaction, ensure that the suppliers are made aware of the 
terms of payment and abide by the agreed terms of payment. 
Polymetal International plc itself is a holding company and 
therefore did not have any material trade creditors as at  
31 December 2012.
Charitable and political donations
The Company may not make a political donation to a political 
party or other political organisation, or to an independent 
election candidate, or incur any political expenditure, unless 
such donation or expenditure is authorised by an ordinary 
resolution of shareholders passed before the donation is  
made or the expenditure incurred. No such donations were 
made in 2012 (2011: none).
Many of the regions in which the Group operates are 
considered socially and economically undeveloped areas of 
Russia and Kazakhstan. The Group pursues a responsible 
social strategy in those regions and views the implementation 
of long-term social programmes as a key factor in the 
sustainability of the Group’s operations.
The Group’s social programmes focus on the social and 
economic development priorities in the regions in which it 
operates and aims to improve education and healthcare, 
develop local infrastructure, promote sports and healthy 
lifestyles, promote the cultural and artistic potential of the  
local population and support local communities.
As part of this social programme, the Group has entered into 
social partnership agreements with municipalities and regional 
governments. Under these social partnership agreements, the 
Group organises and ﬁnances a variety of humanitarian 
projects and development and maintenance projects in these 
communities. In addition, the Group also undertakes various 
social projects in accordance with the agreements with the 
public organisations of indigenous minorities of the north  
of Russia (‘IMN’) and in accordance with the Group’s own 
charitable programmes. More detail on these activities  
can be found on pages 86 to 87 of this Annual Report.
In 2012, the Group spent US$6.1 million on social and 
community projects (2011: US$4.0 million).

Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed in 
Note 31 to the ﬁnancial statements.
There are no speciﬁc restrictions on the size of a holding or on 
the transfer of shares, which are both regulated by the Articles 
of the Company and applicable legislation. The Directors  
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the 
Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the  
transfer of shares or on voting rights.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the Company such as 
commercial contracts, bank loan agreements, and employees’ 
share plans. None of these is considered to be signiﬁcant in 
terms of their likely impact on the business of the Group as  
a whole. Furthermore, the Directors are not aware of any 
agreements between the Company and its Directors or 
employees that provide for compensation for loss of ofﬁce  
or employment, that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
Substantial shareholdings in the Company are disclosed  
on page 169.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the 
Remuneration report on pages 104 to 109.
There were no acquisitions of the Company’s own shares in 
2012. At 31 December 2012, the Group and its subsidiaries 
held no treasury shares (31 December 2011: no shares). As at 
31 December 2012, the Company had shareholders’ authority 
to purchase up to 38,268,578 of its own ordinary shares.
 
The Articles of the Company can be altered by a special 
resolution of the Company. A resolution is a special resolution 
when it is passed by three-quarters of the members who 
(being entitled to do so) vote in person, or by proxy, at a 
general meeting of the Company.
 
The Board may appoint a person, who is willing to act to be a 
Director, either to ﬁll a vacancy or as an additional Director and 
in either case whether or not for a ﬁxed term. Irrespective of the 
terms of his or her appointment, a Director so appointed shall 
hold ofﬁce only until the next following annual general meeting. 
If not re-appointed at such annual general meeting, he or she 
shall vacate ofﬁce at its conclusion.
 
The Company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director 
from ofﬁce (notwithstanding any provision of the Company’s 
Articles or of any agreement between the Company and such 
Director, but without prejudice to any claim he or she may have 
for damages for breach of any such agreement). No special 
notice needs to be given of any resolution to remove a Director 
and no Director proposed to be removed has any special right 
to protest against his or her removal. The Company may, by 
ordinary resolution, appoint another person in place of a 
Director removed from ofﬁce.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles, Directors have the power 
to allot Equity Securities (as deﬁned in the Articles). At the 
Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2012 the 
power to allot Equity Securities was renewed up to an 
aggregate number of 127 ,561,927 ordinary shares, provided 
that the Directors’ power in respect of such an amount may 
only be used in connection with a pre-emptive issue (as 
deﬁned in the Articles). The Directors are further empowered 
pursuant to Article 12.4 of the Company’s Articles to allot 
Equity Securities for cash as if Article 13 of the Articles 
(Pre-emptive rights) did not apply and for the purposes of 
paragraph (b) of Article 12.4 of the Articles, the Non Pre-
emptive Shares (as deﬁned in the Articles) are an aggregate 
number of up to 19,134,289 ordinary shares. In 2012, the 
Company used the above powers to allot 520,422 new 
ordinary shares relating to the Svetlobor acquisition and  
a further 775,000 new ordinary shares in respect of the  
Olcha acquisition. 
Pursuant to Article 57 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991,  
the Company is authorised to make market purchases of 
ordinary shares of the Company, provided that: 
 the maximum number of ordinary shares to be purchased  
is 38,268,578 ordinary shares; 
 the minimum price (excluding expenses) which may  
be paid for each ordinary share is 1 penny; 
 the maximum price (excluding expenses) which may  
be paid for each ordinary share is the higher of: 
 (a)  an amount equal to 105 per cent of the average of the 
middle market quotations of an ordinary share in the 
Company as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Ofﬁcial List for the ﬁve business days immediately 
preceding the day on which the ordinary share is 
contracted to be purchased; and 
 (b)  an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last 
independent trade of an ordinary share and the highest 
current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived 
from the London Stock Exchange Trading System; 
 pursuant to Article 58A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, 
the Company may hold as treasury shares any ordinary 
shares purchased pursuant to the authority conferred  
in this Resolution. 
The authorities above shall, unless previously revoked or 
varied, expire at the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting (or, if earlier, at the close of business on the 
date which is 15 months after the date of this Resolution, being 
13 September 2013).
Approval of share issues, consideration for which does not 
exceed US$15 million, is delegated to a committee of the CEO, 
the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and the SID.  
If the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and/or the 
SID are not available, then any independent non-executive 
Director(s) may act as their alternates on the Committee.
Dividends
The Group’s net proﬁt for the year ended 31 December  
2012 attributable to equity holders of the Company was 
US$394 million (2011: US$ 290 million). In December 2012  
the Company declared a special dividend of US$ 0.50 per 
share which was paid in January 2013. The Directors have 
proposed the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of US$0.31 per share 
(2011: US$ 0.20 per share).
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of shareholders of the Company 
will take place on 12 June 2013 at 11am BST in Le Hocq Suite, 
Radisson Blu Waterfront Hotel, Rue De L ’Etau, St Helier,  
Jersey JE2 3WF, Channel Islands. A webcast will be available 
for shareholders who will not be able to attend the meeting  
in person.
Auditors
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval  
of this Annual Report conﬁrms that:
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Group’s auditors are unaware; and
 the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have 
taken as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Group’s auditors are aware of that information.
Deloitte LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in 
ofﬁce as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The 
Audit and Risk Committee reviews both the level of the audit 
fee and the level and nature of non-audit fees as part of its 
review of the adequacy and objectivity of the audit process.

Remuneration report
Message from the Chairman  
of the Remuneration Committee 
Dear Shareholders
Over the past year the Remuneration Committee has made 
good progress in ensuring that our remuneration policy 
continues to evolve in line with best practice, and that it is 
aligned with business strategy and performance while 
remaining ﬁrmly focused on supporting the creation of 
sustainable longer-term value to shareholders.
The Company had a successful year delivering on its tactical 
and strategic objectives, as well as delivering superior 
shareholder returns, which were well ahead of our peer group. 
Our Total Shareholder Return during 2012 was 9% (including 
1.1% of dividends) compared against the FTSE Gold Mines 
Index decreasing by 15.4% over the same period. In addition  
to that, in January 2013 the Company paid a special dividend 
of US$0.5 per share.
The Committee’s activities during 2012 included external 
benchmarking of pay levels and a review of our system of 
compensation, as well as a detailed analysis of performance 
against targets. The results of this review showed that the total 
remuneration package is competitive against our peers and 
that the remuneration policy taken as a whole effectively 
motivates the executive team in its objective of building 
long-term shareholder value. No change to the base salary or 
maximum annual bonus opportunity available to the CEO has 
been proposed by the Committee as a result of this review. 
The Committee is aware that the legacy option scheme, which 
was put in place prior to the Company’s IPO, is not in line with 
typical practice for FTSE-listed companies. However the 
scheme will expire in 2013/2014 and the options currently have 
zero intrinsic value. The Committee has already taken steps to 
ensure that the remuneration arrangements going forward are 
in line with best practice by adopting relevant changes to the 
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is shown in the table below.
Name Role
Leonard Homeniuk Chair
Jonathan Best Member
Charles Balfour Member
All Committee members are independent non-executive Directors.
The principal functions of the Remuneration Committee under its terms of reference are: 
 to make recommendations to the Board on the Group’s policy on the remuneration of executive management; 
 to determine, within agreed terms of reference, the remuneration of the Chairman and of speciﬁc remuneration packages for 
each of the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and the members of the senior management, including pension rights 
and any compensation payments;
 to formulate suitable performance criteria for the performance-based pay of the executive management;
 to review and oversee all aspects of any executive share scheme operated by or to be established by the Company; and
 to oversee and advise the Board on any major changes in employee beneﬁt structures throughout the Company  
or the Group.
The full Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance section on the 
Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Committee met twice in 2012 and undertook the following key activities:
 Approved the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2011;
 Reviewed and approved a more detailed remuneration policy of the Company and increased the number of senior executives 
whose annual bonus would depend on achieving individual KPIs;
 Appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent external remuneration consultants to provide a review of the 
Company’s senior executive pay and the market practice for long-term incentive schemes. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  
is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group and incorporates the principles of its Voluntary Code of Practice  
into its engagement. No other services were provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP during 2012;
 Analysed the Company’s existing remuneration policy and practices and subsequently reviewed comments from shareholder 
bodies. Following such discussions in the second part of 2012 and beginning of 2013 the Remuneration Committee further 
reviewed the Company’s remuneration policy and practices to ensure that they remain aligned with the objectives of the 
business and in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code and best practice. As a result, the Committee has proposed the 
introduction of a new long-term incentive scheme, the Performance Share Plan, to replace the Long-term Employee Incentive 
Programme once it expires. Further information is provided on page 105. 
 Reviewed proposed changes to the remuneration report regulations and agreed approach to disclosure in future years. 
Although these regulations are not expected to formally apply to the Company, the Committee believes that as a FTSE 100 
company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange, it is an element of good corporate governance to voluntarily 
adopt the new disclosure provisions including the binding vote on remuneration policy at the 2014 AGM.
Further business conducted by the Remuneration Committee was approved by written resolutions on three occasions. 
During its work in 2012, the Committee was also aided by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, and senior ﬁnance and human resources 
executives of the Company. 
The Board considers that the composition and work of the Remuneration Committee complies with the requirements  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Executive Director remuneration policy 
The Company’s executive remuneration policy for Directors and senior management is comparable to FTSE 100 and other 
international mining companies and is designed to attract and retain high quality executive talent at the top level that will help 
maximise shareholder value.
Company’s remuneration policy, which was approved by the 
Board on 24 April 2013. As a result, the Company is proposing 
the adoption of a new long-term share plan, the Performance 
Share Plan, at the AGM in June 2013. Under the Plan, awards 
will only be earned subject to Polymetal’s TSR being positive 
and also outperforming that of the FTSE Gold Mines Index over 
a four year period. The Plan’s main features are described in 
more detail on page 105 of this report and in the Notice of the 
2013 Annual General Meeting. Other key changes adopted  
by the Committee, which are consistent with best practice, 
include the introduction of signiﬁcant shareholding 
requirements for the executive team, deferral requirements 
under the annual bonus plan and clawback provisions for any 
bonus deferred in shares as well as any awards made under 
the Performance Share Plan. 
Our remuneration policy remains a key element in providing  
a clear framework to motivate, incentivise and retain our senior 
management team. Our objective is to continue developing 
these policies in order to strengthen the link between reward 
and performance, thus ensuring that our management team is 
continuously focused on delivering value to our shareholders.
On behalf of the Committee, I welcome all feedback from 
shareholders and look forward to receiving your support  
at the AGM. 
Yours sincerely,
Leonard Homeniuk
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
This report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy  
and practice for its Directors and provides details of their 
remuneration and share interests for the year ended  
31 December 2012. Although it is not a requirement of  
Jersey company law to have the Directors’ remuneration  
report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that  
as a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, it is an element of good corporate governance for it 
to do so. Accordingly, a resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 
12 June 2013.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (the 
“Regulations”). It also meets the relevant requirements of the 
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes 
how the Board applied the principles relating to Directors’ 
remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
In line with the Regulations, the report has been split into 
audited and unaudited sections.

The table below sets out the basis for the remuneration of Mr Nesis, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the only executive  
Board Director. 
Element Policy and objectives Details
Base salary Provides the ﬁxed element of the remuneration package
 Competitive base salary to attract and retain high  
calibre executives based on personal proﬁle  
and relevant experience
 Takes into account the overall potential value  
of the package 
 The Committee reviews base salary annually
 Any increases are determined with reference to 
underlying Company performance and benchmarking 
against FTSE 100 and global mining peers and also 
within the context of salary increases provided to 
employees throughout the Group
Annual bonus Designed to focus on achieving annual performance 
goals, which are based on the Company’s KPIs and 
strategy
 Maximum and target annual incentives are expressed  
as a percentage of base salary
 Currently paid 100% in cash
 With effect from the 2013 bonus, 50% of annual bonus 
earned will be paid in cash and the remaining 50%  
will be compulsorily deferred into shares, released 
annually to the employee during the next three years  
in equal instalments
 Target bonus opportunity – 100% of base salary
 Maximum bonus opportunity – 150% of base salary
 Performance metrics for the CEO for 2012 and  
2013 include:
 – production
 – total cash costs
 – completion of new projects on time and within  
budget; and
 – health and safety
 Compulsory bonus deferral over three years starting 
from 2013, with one third released each year
 Deferred bonus settled in shares to encourage retention 
and alignment with shareholders
 Claw-back provisions will apply for the unvested portion
The new Long-Term 
Incentive Plan
 Provides long-term alignment with shareholders’ 
interests
 Aligns long-term incentive provision with  
UK market practice
 Stretching performance targets reward participants  
for delivering positive absolute and superior relative  
TSR performance against global peers over a  
long-term horizon
 If approved by shareholders at the AGM in June 2013, 
the plan will replace the legacy long-term employee 
incentive programme (see page 109)
 The plan provides for annual rolling awards with a  
four year vesting period and an additional mandatory 
holding period of one year following vesting
 Performance condition – relative TSR measured against 
the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index and 
absolute TSR of Polymetal share above zero
 20% vesting for median performance and 100% for 
performance in top decile of the FTSE Gold Mines Index
 150% of base salary policy grant to CEO
 Claw-back provisions will apply for the unvested portion
Pension and  
other beneﬁts
The Company does not fund any pension contributions  
or beneﬁts except for contributions to mandatory pension 
fund of the Russian Federation as required by Russian law
Remuneration policy for other senior executives 
The remuneration policy described above for the Chief Executive is consistent in structure and key performance indicators with 
the policy of the other members of the Company’s executive team and broader management team of the Group.
Whilst the value of remuneration will vary throughout the Group depending on the role, criticality to the business and level of 
seniority, the remuneration of all senior executives consists of base salary, an annual bonus and participation in the new LTIP. 
Employees up to three levels below the Board (up to 200 employees throughout the Group) are expected to participate in the 
LTIP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee following its approval at the AGM in June 2013.
Chief Executive – Remuneration elements 
Base salary
Mr Nesis receives a salary of RUB14,400,000 per annum (equivalent to US$463,000 in 2012) under his employment contract 
with Polymetal.
Following a review of the total remuneration package of the CEO, the pay and employment conditions of the broader executive 
team and other employees of the Group, and benchmarking performed against FTSE and global peers, it has been decided that 
for a second year in a row there will be no increase in the base salary of the CEO for 2013. 
Annual bonus
Variable remuneration comprises an annual bonus opportunity subject to the achievement of stretching performance criteria.
The CEO’s bonus is based on achievement of the following performance metrics:
KPIs Weight
Production 30%
Total Cash Cost per ounce of gold equivalent produced 30%
Completion of new projects on time and within budget 30%
Health and safety 10%
The maximum bonus payable is 150% of base salary and the bonus at target performance is 100% of base salary. Annual bonus 
is payable for achieving target performance on a sliding scale. No bonus is payable unless at least 90% of the annual budget for 
the relevant KPIs has been achieved. The maximum bonus becomes payable for achieving 110% of the annual budget.
Currently any bonus earned is paid fully in cash. Starting from any bonus earned in respect of 2013, the Committee has 
introduced mandatory deferral of 50% of annual bonus into shares, with one third of the shares released each year following  
the year when the respective annual bonus is earned. 
The table below summarises the actual KPIs achieved in 2012:
KPIs Actual performance
Production 1,063 Koz, 31% growth 
Total Cash Cost per ounce of gold equivalent produced US$703/GE oz, 0% increase
Completion of new projects on time and within budget Amursk POX and Kubaka Merrill-Crowe plants launched
Health and safety 0 fatalities, second year in a row
As a result, the annual bonus receivable by Mr Nesis for 2012 is US$ 542,000, or 118% of base salary.
Following a review of the KPIs of the CEO and benchmarking against FTSE and global peers, it has been decided that there will 
be no changes in the CEO’s annual bonus opportunity and structure of KPIs for 2013.
The new Long-Term Incentive Programme
In April 2013, following a detailed review of market practice and the remuneration packages of the Company’s executive 
management, at the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors proposed to put in place  
a new long-term incentive programme (the ‘Performance Share Plan’) after the vesting of awards under the current  
Long-term Employee Incentive Programme.
The Board believes that the Performance Share Plan will ensure alignment of the executive team’s performance with shareholder 
interests and provide reward for superior long-term performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Board 
also believes that the Plan is in line with and, in some elements beyond UK best practice and fully follows the provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and other relevant guidelines.
The key terms of the proposed Long-Term Incentive Programme are as follows:
Design element Description 
Plan type Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
Participation CEO and three levels below Board (100 to 200 participants at the discretion of the  
Remuneration Committee)
Policy award level The proposed award levels are:
 CEO: 150% of base salary 
 Executive Committee: 100% of base salary 
 Below Executive Committee: 50-100% of base salary 
Frequency of award Annual award 
Performance period and holding period Four year performance period 
 Participants will be required to hold any vested shares for a further year 
Governance
Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 105 104 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Governance 
Remuneration report
continued
Design element Description 
Performance condition Relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) against the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines  
Index. In addition, no part of the award will vest unless Polymetal’s TSR has increased on an 
absolute basis 
 TSR measured in US Dollars 
 For the purposes of measuring TSR, a three month averaging period at the start and end of the 
performance period will be used 
 Retesting of the performance condition in future years will not be allowed under any circumstances
 Unvested awards will be subject to a clawback provision 
Vesting schedule Peers are ranked and Polymetal’s position determines vesting:
 0% vest below median
 20% vests at median
 100% vests at top decile performance and above 
 Straight-line vesting between these points
 0% vests if absolute TSR is negative, regardless of relative performance 
Dilution Awards will normally be settled by newly issued shares, subject to the following dilution limits:
 The number of shares issued under the discretionary executive schemes cannot exceed 5%  
of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten year rolling period
 The overall number of shares issued under all share plans (including any all employee plans)  
cannot exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the Company in any ten year rolling period
The Performance Share Plan will be put to a shareholder vote at the AGM in June 2013 and, following approval by shareholders, 
will be implemented upon vesting of the current Employee Incentive Programme (see details on page 109).
Shareholding requirements
There is an increasing view from shareholders and other commentators that there should be a requirement for signiﬁcant 
long-term shareholding by senior executives. Therefore, the Committee is proposing to implement substantial minimum 
shareholding requirements for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the executive management team, with the following minimum 
levels set:
 Chief Executive Ofﬁcer – 500% of base salary.
 Chief Financial Ofﬁcer – 250% of base salary.
 Other executives reporting to CEO – 100% of base salary.
These requirements have been set by the Committee at a level that is signiﬁcantly above typical market practice for companies  
of Polymetal’s size in keeping with the Company’s objective to be consistent with best practice and to further strengthen the 
alignment between executives and shareholders. The position should be built over four years and can include vested shares 
received under short-term and long-term remuneration schemes. 
Pension and retirement beneﬁts
Save for the Group’s contributions to the mandatory pension fund of the Russian Federation during the ﬁnancial year ended  
31 December 2012, no amounts were set aside or accrued by the Group to provide pension, retirement or other beneﬁts to the 
Directors and senior management. 
Executive Director – appointment and service contract
Mr Nesis has entered into an appointment letter with the Company in relation to his appointment as a Director. This appointment 
took effect from the date of admission of shares to trading on the LSE on 28 October 2011 and is subject to annual re-election. 
Mr Nesis does not receive any fees in respect of his appointment as a Director of Polymetal International plc but is entitled to 
reimbursement of his reasonable expenses incurred in relation to the carrying out of his duties as a Director. Appointment of  
Mr Nesis as a Director may be terminated at any time in accordance with the Articles of Association. Mr Nesis can terminate his 
appointment as a Director on one month’s notice. He is not entitled to receive any compensation in respect of his role as Director 
on termination of this appointment.
On 25 July 2008, JSC Polymetal, a 100% subsidiary of the Company incorporated in Russia, entered into an employment 
contract with Mr Nesis as its Chief Executive Ofﬁcer. The contract became effective on 1 September 2008 and was 
subsequently amended on 5 September 2011. The contract was entered into for a period of ﬁve years and expires on 31 August 
2013. Under the terms of the contract the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer undertakes to perform general management of JSC Polymetal, 
arrange for its commercial, economic, social and other activities with a view to provide for JSC Polymetal’s further development. 
The employment contract does not contain any speciﬁc grounds for early termination. The contact can be terminated at any time 
on one month’s notice by Mr Nesis and with immediate effect by JSC Polymetal in accordance with the Russian labour law. This 
could result in compensation of up to a maximum of three average monthly salaries.
Remuneration policy – non-executive Directors
The fees of the independent non-executive Directors are set by reference to those paid by other FTSE 100 mining companies. 
Fees are reviewed, but not necessarily increased, annually. No fees are paid to the non-independent non-executive Directors.

FTSE Gold Mines Index for the period since the admission of the Company’s shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange  
to 31 December 2012. The Committee considers that the selected FTSE 100 index and FTSE Gold Mines Index are the most 
appropriate benchmarks for the Company as it is a constituent of both of these indexes and its performance is measured 
externally and internally against them.

No share options vested or were exercised in 2012. There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance 
criteria for share options during the ﬁnancial year. No options were granted to Mr Nesis or other Directors in 2012.
The Long-term Employee Incentive Programme (‘EIP’) was adopted in September 2010, prior to the Company’s IPO, to reward 
key senior executives, including the CEO, for increasing the share price and delivering superior performance over a long-term 
horizon. A total of over 150 employees participate in the EIP, selected at the discretion of the Board. 
The principal terms of the EIP, are summarised below:
 The total size of the Bonus Fund is to be determined according to a prescribed formula, which is linked to share  
price performance.
 Exercise price: Shares from the Bonus Fund may be purchased by Participants at the price of one penny per share.
 Maximum number of shares: 30 million shares for the EIP as a whole; maximum number of shares awarded to each 
participant is described in performance conditions below.
 Performance conditions: the number of shares awarded to each Participant from the Bonus Fund is based on certain 
non-ﬁnancial performance criteria, such as job performance and career growth potential, all at the discretion of the Board  
or the executive management.
 The Employee Incentive Programme vesting date is 11 June 2013 and may, with respect to a particular Participant,  
at such Participant’s discretion during an election window of 11 June 2013 to 11 July 2013, be postponed for one year  
until 11 June 2014. 
 Vesting period, if 2013 is chosen, is 2.6 years which is shorter than the three years recommended by the UK Code.  
If 2014 is chosen, the vesting period is 3.6 years.
 Vesting mechanism: in the base case scenario the aggregate number of shares comprising the Bonus Fund will  
be determined on June 11, 2013 (the ‘Programme Implementation Date’) according to the following formula: 
BF = M * (X – S) / X, where M – Maximum Number of shares; X – Average Weighted Price of a share (quotation period  
from 11 December 2012 to 11 June 2013); and 
S – Strike Price (US$16.74 per share) adjusted by the amounts of dividends paid.  
 
e.g, if the share price during the quotation period is US$18.00, then the Bonus Fund will be determined  
as (18.00 – 16.74)/18.00 = 7% of the Maximum Number of shares.
The possible deviations from the base case scenario include:
 extension of the participants’ rights to purchase shares from the Bonus Fund by one year (at the sole discretion of each 
participant) until 11 June 2014. In this case, X will be equal to the weighted average price of Polymetal shares in US Dollars 
during the quotation from 11 December 2013 to 11 June 2014, and S will be equal to US$18.75 per share; and
 the option to execute the rights to purchase all or part of the shares from the Bonus Fund before the Programme 
Implementation Date under certain circumstances, such as change of control of the Company. In this case, both  
X and S will be adjusted accordingly.
Each time the dividends upon shares are paid prior to the Exercise Date, the Strike shall be reduced by the amount  
calculated according to the following formula:
D*1.12^(T/365), where D – dividend paid per share;  
T – number of calendar days from the date of payment of dividends to the relevant Exercise Date.
 
Additional disclosures required by the Regulations 
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was £11.75 (US$ 19.08) and the range during the year  
was £7.65 (US$ 11.75) to £11.89 (US$ 19.26). This compares with the minimum price for any EIP vesting of $16.74.

Annual Report 2012 Polymetal International plc 109 108 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2012 Financial statements 
Directors’ responsibility statement Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Polymetal International plc
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
for use in the European Union (IFRS). The ﬁnancial statements are required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. International Accounting Standard 1 requires that ﬁnancial statements present fairly for each 
ﬁnancial year the Group’s ﬁnancial position, ﬁnancial performance and cash ﬂows. This requires the faithful representation  
of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the deﬁnitions and recognition criteria for assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and 
presentation of ﬁnancial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. However, the Directors 
are also required to:
 properly select and apply accounting policies;
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRS are insufﬁcient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and  
ﬁnancial performance; and 
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK and Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view  
of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
 the management report, which is incorporated into the directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board
Bobby Godsell
Chairman of the Board of Directors

Chief Executive
24 April 2013
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements (the ﬁnancial statements) of Polymetal International plc for the year ended  
31 December 2012 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the related notes 1 to 35. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) 
Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are 
required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept 
or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes  
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the ﬁnancial statements:
 give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31 December 2012 and of the Group’s proﬁt for the year  
then ended;
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by European Union; and
 have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters, where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us  
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have

Company had been incorporated in the UK and have nothing to report to you in that respect.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
1. General
Corporate information
Polymetal International plc (the Company) was incorporated on 29 July 2010 as a public limited company under Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991.
On 2 November 2011, the Company was admitted to the Ofﬁcial List of the UK Listing Authority and commenced trading on  
the London Stock Exchange’s premium listed market. The Company became the new ultimate parent company of Joint Stock 
Company Polymetal (JSC Polymetal) and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (the JSC Polymetal Group) and owned 
83.26% of the issued share capital of JSC Polymetal as at 31 December 2011, with 8.11% held by third parties and 8.63% 
effectively held as treasury shares.
On 17 February 2012, the Company executed the Mandatory Tender Offer (‘the MTO’) made on 23 November 2011 at a cost  
of US$534 million acquiring 30,317 ,610 shares in JSC Polymetal via its wholly-owned subsidiary PMTL Ltd.
On execution of the MTO, Otkritie Securities Ltd tendered the shares it had legally acquired in JSC Polymetal, which for 
accounting purposes were then effectively transferred from being shown as treasury shares in JSC Polymetal to being held by 
PMTL Ltd with a corresponding reduction in the level of the non-controlling interest. The Group settled the loan balance with 
Otkritie Securities Ltd through a payment of US$250 million.
Through these two transactions, the Company’s holding in JSC Polymetal increased to 397 ,287 ,592 Ordinary Shares, 
representing approximately 99.48% of the total share capital of JSC Polymetal. On 20 April 2012, the Company delivered notice 
of its intention to proceed with a statutory squeeze out (i.e. purchase) of the remaining JSC Polymetal shares on terms and within 
the period as provided under applicable Russian law. In the period to 10 July 2012 2,087 ,408 additional shares in JSC Polymetal 
were acquired such that at that date the Company’s holding in JSC Polymetal had further increased to 399,375,000 shares, 
representing 100% of the total share capital of JSC Polymetal.
Total cash outﬂows in respect of the MTO and Squeeze Out for the year amounted to US$569 million, offsetting the share 
purchase liability recognised when the offer was initially made. This comprised MTO payments of US$534 million and other 
payments of US$35 million.
On execution of the MTO and the Squeeze Out, the non-controlling interest balance in reserves was derecognised in proportion 
to the percentage acquired in the period, with the minority’s share of the other reserves previously transferred to ‘non-controlling 
interests’ on the original formation of the Group transferred back. The treasury shares balance and the share purchase obligation 
reserve were also eliminated. The difference of US$399 million was recognised within retained earnings.
Signiﬁcant subsidiaries
As disclosed above at 31 December 2012, the Company held an effective 100% interest in JSC Polymetal. Through this 
subsidiary, the Company held the following signiﬁcant mining and production subsidiaries:

(see Note 35) on 9 April 2013, the signiﬁcant shareholders are as follows: Pearlmoon Limited (20.50%), Powerboom Investments 
Limited (17.59%), Vitalbond (9.95%), MBC Development Limited (4.36%), Staroak Limited (4.19%) and Morgan Stanley & Co 
International Plc (4.11%). 
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Directors have taken account of the Group’s ﬁnancial position, anticipated future 
trading performance, its borrowings and other available credit facilities and its capital expenditure commitments and plans.
The Board is satisﬁed that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the  
next 12 months from the date of this document and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and 
endorsed by the European Union. IFRS includes the standards and interpretations approved by the IASB including International 
Accounting Standards (IAS) and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain ﬁnancial instruments which are 
measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies set out in Note 2 have been applied in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2012. 
Reclassiﬁcations
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and current year ﬁnancial statements has been made  
during the period, comparative ﬁgures have been restated accordingly. 
In the current period shipping expenses have been presented within cost of sales rather than within general, administrative and 
selling expenses. The comparative information has been revised to be on a consistent basis with costs of US$9.6 million for the 
year ended 31 December 2011 being reclassiﬁed.
At 31 December 2012 US$39 million of ore stock piles at Omolon were classiﬁed as non-current inventories following 
management’s assessment that these stock piles will be processed starting from 2016. Previously these amounts were  
included within current metal inventories. The comparative ﬁgures of US$14 million have been restated to be presented  
on a consistent basis.
At 31 December 2012 US$4 million on capital spare parts were classiﬁed as property, plant and equipment rather than  
non-current inventories. The comparative ﬁgures of US$2.3 million have been restated to be presented on a consistent basis.

Standards and interpretations in issue not yet adopted
The following new or amended IFRS accounting standards not yet adopted may have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group:
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine provides a model for accounting for costs associated 
with the removal of waste during the production phase of a surface mine, including guidance on the apportionment of the 
costs incurred for obtaining a current and future beneﬁt and how capitalised costs are depreciated. This interpretation applies 
to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The following new, amended or revised IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted are not expected  
to have a signiﬁcant impact on the Group:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – Classiﬁcation and Measurement reﬂects the ﬁrst phase of the IASB’s three stage project  
to replace IAS 39. The ﬁrst phase deals with the classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities.  
The standard applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements  
that addresses accounting for consolidated ﬁnancial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 
provides a single basis for consolidation with a new deﬁnition of control. The standard applies to annual periods beginning  
on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary 
Contributions by Venturers. Under IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is classiﬁed as either a joint operation or a joint venture, and the 
option to proportionately consolidate joint ventures has been removed. Interests in joint ventures must be equity accounted.  
This standard applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities will accompany IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. This standard combines the disclosure 
requirements previously covered by IAS 27 , related to consolidated ﬁnancial statements, IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures and  
IAS 28 Investments in Associates, as well as including additional disclosure requirements. This standard applies to annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement provides a single framework for all fair value measurements and applies to annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
An amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements which requires items to be grouped in other comprehensive 
income based on whether those items are subsequently reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss. The amendment is to be applied  
for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
An amendment to IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013.
Amendments have been made to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and it has been reissued as IAS 27 
Separate Financial Statements. The revised standard prescribes the accounting and disclosure requirements for investments in 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when an entity prepares separate ﬁnancial statements. The accounting and disclosure 
requirements for investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in consolidated ﬁnancial statements are prescribed by 
IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IFRS 12. The revised standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. 
Amendments have been made to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and it has been reissued as IAS 28 Investments in 
Associates and Joint Ventures. The revised standard prescribes the application of the equity method when accounting for 
investments in associates and joint ventures. The revised standard is to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2013.
Amendments to IFRS 1 Government loans and to IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  
are effective for annual periods on or after 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments – Presentation is effective for annual periods on or after 1 January 2014.
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group include the ﬁnancial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and,  
if applicable, special purpose entities, from the date that control effectively commenced until the date that control effectively 
ceased. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of an entity  
so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with 
those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-Group balances, transactions and any unrealised proﬁts or losses arising from intra-Group transactions are eliminated  
on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as 
equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reﬂect the change 
in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted 
and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Parent.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the proﬁt or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between 1) the 
aggregated fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous carrying amount 
of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion 
of the fair values of net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the proﬁt or loss for the ﬁnancial year and other 
movements in the net assets or liabilities of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income 
statement and balance sheet.
Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the deﬁnition of a business combination. When 
acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
constitute an integrated set of activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business 
by a market participant, and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance provided in 
the standard. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition 
is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and 
equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination are 
expensed. Provisional fair values are ﬁnalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration 
arrangement. Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration 
transferred in a business combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition 
retrospectively with the corresponding adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. 
Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement 
period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The measurement period may not exceed one year 
from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration that does not qualify for as  
a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classiﬁed. Contingent consideration that  
is classiﬁed as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration that is classiﬁed as an asset or liability is 
remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets  
or IAS 39 Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being recognised in proﬁt or loss.
The identiﬁable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee beneﬁt arrangements are recognised and 
measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Beneﬁts, respectively;

 liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment 
arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment at the acquisition date; and
 assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale  
and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured 
to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised  
in the consolidated income statement. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have 
previously been recognised in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest 
was disposed of.
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests  
in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the 
acquisition-date amounts of the identiﬁable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest  
in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill  
is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an 
indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, 
the impairment loss is allocated ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other 
assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for 
goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁt or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent  
a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the deﬁnition of a business combination and, accordingly, the 
transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint 
venture. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence constitutes the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of the investee 
but does not extend to a control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of 
associates are incorporated in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Interests in joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject 
to joint control (i.e. when the strategic ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities of the joint venture require 
the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control). Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate 
entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities. The Group reports its interests in jointly 
controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity (investee) is initially recognised in the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of the proﬁt or loss and other 
comprehensive income of the investee. When the Group’s share of the losses of an associate exceeds the Group’s interest  
in that entity, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent  
that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of an investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying 
amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and  
contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect  
to the Group’s investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with  
an indeﬁnite useful life, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance 
with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (IAS 36) as a single cash generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount 
(the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part  
of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, proﬁts and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are recognised 
in the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
it operates. For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB). The investment holding companies, 
including Polymetal International plc, also have a Rouble functional currency as they are in substance an extension of the Russian 
group and have signiﬁcant Rouble-denominated intercompany loans in most cases. The functional currency of the Group’s entity 
located in Kazakhstan and operating with signiﬁcant degree of autonomy is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT).
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated ﬁnancial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes it is a more 
convenient presentation currency for international users of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group as it is a common 
presentation currency in the mining industry. The translation of the ﬁnancial statements of the Group entities from their functional 
currencies to the presentation currency is performed as follows:
 all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
 all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for signiﬁcant 
transactions that are translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
 resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation to the 
Group’s presentation currency within the Translation reserve; and
 in the consolidated statement of cash ﬂows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented are 
translated using exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash ﬂows in the period are translated at the average 
exchange rates for the periods presented, except for signiﬁcant transactions that are translated at rates on the date of transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving 
loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled 
entity that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of signiﬁcant inﬂuence over an associate that includes a 
foreign operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners  
of the Company are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign 
operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership interest 
in associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result in the Group losing signiﬁcant inﬂuence or joint control), the 
proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassiﬁed to the consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identiﬁable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation 
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each 
reporting period. Exchange differences arising are recognised in equity.
Exchange rates used in the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements were as follows:
31 December 
2012
31 December 
2011
Russian Rouble/US Dollar
Year end 30.37 32.20
Average for the year 30.09 29.39
Kazakh Tenge/US Dollar
Year end 150.74 148.40
Average for the year 149.11 146.60
The Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan 
and, accordingly, any translation of Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated assets and liabilities into US Dollar for the 
purpose of the presentation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future realise 
or settle in US Dollars the translated values of these assets and liabilities.

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates 
prevailing on the dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at 
the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the exchange 
rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing 
on the date on which the most recent fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising from changes in exchange rates 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are 
depreciated to their residual values using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves under the 
Russian Resource Reporting Code (GKZ), which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven 
and probable reserves are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining ventures from the date that the 
mining asset is capable of commercial production. In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are expected to be 
less than the life of the mine, depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. The difference in the depreciation 
charge which would have been applied had the Group based the depreciation expense on JORC reserves is considered to be 
immaterial. When there is little likelihood of a mineral right being exploited, or the value of the exploitable mineral right has 
diminished below cost, an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences 
when the assets are ready for their intended use. Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, 
geological and similar types of costs, are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can  
be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred in exploration and 
development of such property, including costs to further delineate the ore body, are capitalised.
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When parts 
of an item of property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and depreciated 
separately. Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
Machinery and equipment Up to 20 years
Transportation and other assets Up to 10 years
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the 
asset’s carrying amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable 
reserves, the costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping 
costs, are capitalised as a part of mining assets.
Post-production stripping costs are recognised as a component of inventory and included in cost of sales in the same period  
as the revenue from the sales of inventory is recognised.
Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proven and probable ore reserves reﬂect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally recovered in 
the future from known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with the GKZ and JORC Codes.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases under which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. 
Assets subject to ﬁnance leases are capitalised as property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value or present value  
of future minimum lease payments at the date of acquisition, with the related lease obligation recognised at the same value. 
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over their estimated economic useful lives or over the term of the lease,  
if shorter. If there is reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the period  
of expected use is useful life of the asset.
Finance lease payments are calculated using the effective interest rate method, and allocated between the lease ﬁnance cost, 
which is included in ﬁnance cost, and the capital repayment, which reduces the related lease liability payable to the lessor.
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals arising 
under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable 
amount of the asset in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted. If the 
recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense 
immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased  
to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  
the original carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including reﬁned metals, metals in concentrate and in process, Doré and ore stock piles are stated at the lower of 
production cost or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures and expenses 
incurred directly or indirectly in bringing inventories to their existing condition and location. Reﬁned metals are valued at the 
average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-process, metal concentrate and Doré are valued at the 
average total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stock piles are valued at the average cost of 
mining that ore. Where ore stock piles are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are classiﬁed as 
non-current.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated 
costs to complete production and selling costs.
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average 
moving cost. The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classiﬁed  
as a long-term asset in the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less 
all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the 
acquisition or issue of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (other than ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities, as appropriate, 
on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value 
through proﬁt or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
Financial instruments designated as fair value through proﬁt and loss (FVTPL)
A ﬁnancial instrument other than a ﬁnancial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
 such designation eliminates or signiﬁcantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise  
arise; or
 the ﬁnancial instrument forms part of a group of ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities or both, which is managed and its 
performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment 
strategy, and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis; or
 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.

continued
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in proﬁt  
or loss. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 29.
Effective interest rate method
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial instrument and of allocating interest 
income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts  
or payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction 
costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter 
period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets are classiﬁed into the following speciﬁed categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) ﬁnancial 
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classiﬁcation depends on the nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets and is 
determined at the time of initial recognition. No ﬁnancial instruments have been classiﬁed as available for sale.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for ﬁnancial instruments other than those ﬁnancial assets classiﬁed as at FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. 
Interest income is determined by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of 
interest would be immaterial.
AFS ﬁnancial assets
Investments other than those classiﬁed as held for trading, held-to-maturity or loans and receivables are classiﬁed as available  
for sale ﬁnancial assets. These assets are subsequently measured at fair value and unrealised gains and losses are recognised  
in equity until the investment is disposed or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity  
is included in the consolidated income statement.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. 
Financial assets are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that 
occurred after the initial recognition of the ﬁnancial asset, the estimated future cash ﬂows of the investment have been affected. 
For equity investments classiﬁed as AFS, a signiﬁcant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost  
is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other ﬁnancial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
 signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or counterparty; or
 breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial re-organisation; or
 the disappearance of an active market for that ﬁnancial asset because of ﬁnancial difﬁculties.
For ﬁnancial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original effective 
interest rate.
The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all ﬁnancial assets with the exception  
of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable  
is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement.
For ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and 
the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised 
impairment loss is reversed through the consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment 
at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not  
been recognised.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets
The Group derecognises a ﬁnancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the asset expire, or when it 
transfers the ﬁnancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group 
neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, 
the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group 
retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred ﬁnancial asset, the Group continues to recognise  
the ﬁnancial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other ﬁnancial liabilities
Other ﬁnancial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they 
expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to certain risks. Further details  
of derivative ﬁnancial instruments are disclosed in Note 29.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the 
timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics 
are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that 
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets  
is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities  
of three months or fewer, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk  
of changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the 
reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using 
the cash ﬂows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash ﬂows.
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused  
by the development or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other 
site preparation work, discounted to their net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash ﬂows, are provided 
for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are recognised 
in the consolidated income statement over the life of the operation, through the depreciation of the asset in the cost of sales line 
and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in the ﬁnance costs line. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and recognised in the 
consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from 
changes in the estimated timing or amount of the cash ﬂow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the 
cost of the related asset in the current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess  
is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
2. Signiﬁcant accounting policies continued
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and 
circumstances. Changes in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased 
obligations arising from additional mining and exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free 
interest rate.
Employee beneﬁt obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in that 
reporting period. The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the Russian 
Federation and Kazakhstan, which are expensed as incurred.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed  
in accordance with the laws of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the period. Taxable proﬁt differs from proﬁt as reported in the 
consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and items 
that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted  
or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax liabilities are 
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible 
temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which those deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities  
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and 
it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible 
temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
there will be sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts against which to utilise the beneﬁts of the temporary differences and they are expected  
to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability  
is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of 
the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reﬂects the tax consequences that would follow from 
the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets 
and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when they relate to items that are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred 
tax also recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or 
deferred tax arises from the initial accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the 
business combination.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullion and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured  
at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and 
rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over 
the goods sold, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with 
the transaction will ﬂow to the Group. Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal 
shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes Doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Khakanja, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino)  
into London Good Delivery Bars prior to sale. This ﬁnal stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four 
state-owned reﬁneries. The Group sells gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, as 
determined in the agreement, may be variable based upon the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot price or ﬁxed. 
But the Group’s policy is not to enter into ﬁxed price contracts. For domestic sales, title passes from the Group to the purchaser 
at the reﬁnery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver bars have been approved 
for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located in London.  
Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where ﬁnal prices are determined by quoted 
market prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for 
the expected date of ﬁnal settlement. Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass  
to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward 
London Metal Bulletin (LMB) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price to the estimated ﬁnal pricing date, adjusted for the speciﬁc 
terms of the relevant agreement. Until ﬁnal settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue are made to take into account the changes 
in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of reﬁning and treatment charges which 
are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced.
The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded 
derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable 
from the sale of the concentrate at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not 
qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the consolidated 
income statement for each period prior to the ﬁnal settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to its accounting for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies 
to recognise compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
The fair value of share-based payments was calculated by the Group at the grant date using the two-stage Monte-Carlo 
simulation model. The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period with 
a corresponding increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards, the proceeds received, 
net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts recognised within 
the share-based compensation reserve transferred to retained earnings.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise 
of dilutive stock options with exercise prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed to 
be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares at their average market price for the period.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that the management has made  
in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognised 
in consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Production start date
The Group assesses the stage of each mine or plant construction project to determine when an asset moves into the 
commercial production stage. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined by the unique nature of each 
construction project and include factors such as the complexity of a plant and its location.
The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended  
use and moves into the production stage. Criteria considered but are not limited to the following:
 the level of capital expenditure incurred compared to the construction cost estimates;
 the completion of a sufﬁcient level of testing on the mine plant and equipment;
 the ability to produce gold, silver or copper in saleable form (within speciﬁcations); and
 the ability to sustain ongoing commercial levels of production.
When a construction project moves into the commercial production stage and depreciation commences, the capitalisation  
of certain mine construction costs and interest ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for 
capitalisable costs related to mining asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or ore reserve 
development.
The Omolon Merrill-Crowe plant achieved commercial production in April 2012 and the Albazino mine achieved commercial 
production in 2011.
The Amursk POX plant commenced commercial production in November 2012.
Acquisitions
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the deﬁnition of a business combination.  
When acquiring new entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed constitute an integrated set of activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination,  
using the guidance provided in the standard. In making this determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes  
and outputs of the asset or entity acquired. 
As a result of this evaluation process, management has determined that its 2012 acquisitions of Semchenskoye and Svetlobor 
did not meet the deﬁnition of a business combination and as such the Group has accounted for these transactions as asset 
acquisitions (see Note 4). 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Group’s management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are based on historical experience, current and 
expected economic conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the 
reporting period that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial period.
The most signiﬁcant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
 fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
 ore reserve estimates;
 depreciation;
 impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment;
 inventory obsolescence and write-downs;
 share-based compensation;
 environmental obligations;
 contingencies; and
 income taxes.
Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired 
entity and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises signiﬁcant 
judgement in the process of identifying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and 
estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that,  
in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash ﬂows. 
If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the 
fair values of assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a remeasurement 
could have an impact on the amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods.
Ore reserve estimates
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s 
properties. Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-
production method; impairment charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration 
costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land 
restoration costs, management may take into account mineral resources in addition to ore reserves where there is a high degree 
of conﬁdence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, 
including quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, 
commodity prices, discount rates and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, 
shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. 
This process may require complex and difﬁcult geological judgements and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course  
of operations or if there are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect 
the Group’s ﬁnancial results and ﬁnancial position in a number of ways, including the following:
 asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash ﬂows;
 depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the units-of-production 
method;
 provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about  
the timing of the payment of such costs; and
 carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value of the 
relevant assets and liabilities.
Depreciation
Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter than 
the life of mine. The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under the Russian 
Resource Reporting Code (GKZ), which is the basis on which the Group’s mine plans are prepared as the useful lives of these 
assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. For other property, plant and equipment, the straight-line 
method is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the estimated mine life. 
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production in the future 
is different from current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves. This would generally arise when there 
are signiﬁcant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves. The Group’s units-of-production 
depreciation rates are based on the GKZ reserves ﬁgures which are different to the reserves calculated under the JORC 
reporting code and included into the Group’s external reporting.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment
The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that 
goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired. External sources of 
information the Group considers include: changes in the market and economic and legal environment in which the Group 
operates, that are not within its control and that affect the recoverable amount of goodwill, mining assets or other property, 
plant and equipment.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Internal sources of information the Group considers include the manner in which mining properties, plant and equipment are 
being used or expected to be used and indications of economic performance of the assets. In determining the recoverable 
amounts of the Group’s mining assets and other property, plant and equipment, the Group’s management determines the fair 
value less costs to sell by estimating the discounted future after-tax cash ﬂows expected to be derived from the Group’s mining 
properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, 
increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount  
of recoverable reserves and resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts  
of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash inﬂows are allocated to an appropriate 
cash-generating unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash 
inﬂows to appropriate cash-generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash ﬂows within the 
value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash ﬂows could impact 
the carrying value of the respective assets.
Stock piles and work in-process
In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management makes 
estimates of quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in this material to 
determine the average costs of ﬁnished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a change in mine 
operating costs of future periods and carrying amounts of inventories. At 31 December 2012 the carrying value of the ore stock 
piles was US$336 million and work in-process was US$66 million.
Share-based compensation
In November 2010, the Group issued equity-settled share appreciation rights to certain employees. Equity-settled share 
appreciation rights are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the awards is expensed as services are rendered over the vesting period, based  
on the Group’s estimate of the rights that will eventually vest.
The fair value of share-based compensation is measured using the Monte-Carlo two-stage simulation model. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. The awards include an option, exercisable at the discretion of the participant, to 
defer the measurement period by one year. For further details see Note 32.
The most signiﬁcant assumptions used in estimation of the cost of equity-settled stock appreciation rights are: the expected 
volatility of the Company’s share price over the life of the award; the risk-free interest rate used; the level of expected forfeitures 
and the expectation at the grant date of the dividends to be paid over the life of the awards. 
Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of return on the Company’s GDRs.
The risk-free rates used in the valuation model are based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal  
to the expected life assumed at the grant date.
Expected forfeitures are estimated using historical trends of executive director and employee turnover.
At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends. As such, the expected annual dividend per share was 
therefore nil. Subsequent changes in the Group’s dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted  
in the future.
Environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the 
environment. The Group’s provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best 
estimate of the present value of the future cash outﬂows required to settle the liability which reﬂects estimates of future costs, 
inﬂation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions of risks associated with the future cash outﬂows; and the 
applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outﬂows. Actual costs incurred in future periods could differ materially 
from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates and discount 
rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision.
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment  
of such contingencies inherently involves the exercise of signiﬁcant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.
Income taxes and mining taxes
The Group is subject to income tax and mining taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Mining taxes do not meet 
the deﬁnition of a tax under IAS 12 Income taxes. Signiﬁcant judgement is required in determining the provision for these taxes 
due to the complexity of legislation. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be 
due. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient 
taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes 
judgements based on the expected performance. Various factors are considered in order to assess the probability of the future 
utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and 
tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the 
ﬁnancial position, results of operations and cash ﬂows may be negatively affected.
4. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) Asset acquisitions
Veduga 
On 7 February 2012 the Group completed the acquisition from AngloGold Ashanti Holdings PLC (AngloGold) of AngloGold’s 
50% interest in various companies held in joint venture with Polymetal comprising the AngloGold Ashanti – Polymetal Strategic 
Alliance for US$20 million. It subsequently entered into a series of transactions with new investors (unrelated parties), retaining 
a 42.65% economic interest in the principal asset – the Veduga licence. See Note 20 for further information.
Semchenskoye Zoloto
On 22 August 2012 the Group acquired 100% interest in ‘Semchenskoye Zoloto LLC’ (Semchenskoye Zoloto) from Suntsov V.A. 
(25% interest) and Polister Limited (75% interest), both unrelated parties. Semchenskoye Zoloto holds the exploration licence for 
Semchenskoye ﬁeld in Karelia. The Group paid cash consideration of US$0.8 million; in addition, a contingent consideration  
of US$0.5 million is payable by the Group in case the exploration of the licence area proves to be successful and the mining 
licence for the new gold deposit is received before 25 December 2014. Another US$1.2 million is payable depending on the level  
of proved and probable ore reserves of the new deposit. 
After evaluation of the possible outcome of the contingency, the Group estimated fair value of the contingent consideration  
to be US$0.1 million.
Semchenskoye Zoloto does not meet the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008), thus it was accounted for as 
an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$0.8 million and other current liabilities of 
US$0.024 million.
Svetlobor
On 17 December 2012, the Group acquired 24.99% interest in JSC Nevyansk Group (NG), a Russian legal entity whose wholly-
owned subsidiary holds a mining and exploration licence for the Svetlobor area. The Group issued consideration in the form  
of 130,053 new ordinary shares in the Company. Simultaneously, CJSC VTB Capital (VTB) purchased a 75.01% stake in NG  
in exchange for 390,369 new Polymetal ordinary shares, which were subscribed for by a subsidiary of VTB for a total cash 
consideration of US$6.9 million. 
 
The Group also entered into legally binding agreement to acquire the 75.01% stake in NG from VTB, as soon as this transaction 
is approved by the Government Commission on Monitoring of Foreign Investments, for cash consideration of US$6.9 million, 
plus any interest accrued on this amount at a rate of 7.25% per annum.
 
The Group determined 17 December 2012 to be the date when it obtained control over NG, and consolidated the acquiree from 
that date. The cash received from VTB has been accounted for as a loan and included within borrowings (Note 25). NG does not 
meet the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) and this transaction has been treated as an acquisition of assets.  
The allocation of the consideration paid to the assets acquired was as follows:
 US$’000
Net assets acquired 
Mineral rights 9,449 
Other assets 299 
Other liabilities (11)
Net assets acquired 9,737 
Consideration: 
Fair value of shares issued 9,737

4. Acquisitions and disposals continued
In the prior year, the following transactions took place:
Kutyn LLC
On 29 April 2011, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Kutynskaya GGK LLC (Kutyn) from Olsen Business Limited, an 
unrelated party, in exchange for 3,500,000 JSC Polymetal GDRs. The GDR share price on the acquisition date was US$19.14. 
The Group acquired Kutyn as it holds the mining licence for Kutyn gold deposit located in the Khabarovsk region.
Kutyn does not meet the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus this acquisition was accounted for as an 
acquisition of a group of assets. The allocation of the cost of acquisition to the group of assets acquired was as follows:
US$’000
Mineral rights 67 ,719
Property, plant and equipment 618
Other liabilities (1,347)
Net assets acquired 66,990
Consideration:
Fair value of GDRs transferred 66,990
Industriya LLC
On 27 May 2011, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Industriya LLC (Industriya) from Kuzmichev V.V., an unrelated party.  
The Group acquired Industriya as it holds the hard-rock gold exploration and mining licence for the Elmus property. The Group 
paid cash consideration of US$1.787 million. Industriya does not meet the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus 
it was accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$1.82 million and other 
current liabilities of US$(0.042) million.
Ofﬁce LLC
On 13 May 2011, the Group acquired a 100% interest in Ofﬁce LLC (Ofﬁce) from ICT-Kolyma LLC, an unrelated party, for 
US$10.3 million, of which US$6.2 million was netted against advance provided to ICT-Kolyma LLC in 2010. The Group acquired 
Ofﬁce as it holds three storeys of an ofﬁce premises in Magadan. The cost of the ofﬁce premises was US$9.76 million, with the 
residual amount of US$0.56 million representing other assets and liabilities acquired.
(b) Disposal of subsidiary
In December 2012 the Group disposed of following minor subsidiaries: Ural’skoye GRP LLC, Severno-Ural’skoye GRP LLC and

5. Segment information
The Group has seven reportable segments:
 Voro (CJSC Gold of Northern Urals);
 Khakanja (LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company);
 Dukat (CJSC Magadan Silver);
 Omolon (Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC);
 Varvara (JSC Varvarinskoye);
 Amursk-Albazino (Albazino Resources Ltd, Amur Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC); and
 Mayskoye (Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports and are separated based on the 
Group’s geographical proﬁle. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) which 
do not meet the reportable segment criteria are disclosed within Corporate and other. Each segment is engaged in gold, silver  
or copper mining and related activities, including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. The Group’s segments are 
all based in the Russian Federation other than Varvara which is based in Kazakhstan.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance of the 
Group is segment adjusted EBITDA, which is deﬁned as proﬁt for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortization, write-
downs of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, gains or losses arising 
on disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of derivatives, changes in the fair value  
of contingent consideration, ﬁnance income, ﬁnance costs and income tax expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable 
segments are consistent with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS as described in Note 2.
Revenue shown as Corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, spare 
parts and ﬁxed assets to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue is recognised based on costs incurred plus  
a ﬁxed margin basis. External revenue shown within Corporate and other represents revenue from services provided to third 
parties by the Group’s non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore  
are not disclosed in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.

Mining tax is a royalty payable in Russian Federation and Kazakhstan which is calculated based on the value of the precious 
metals extracted in the period. This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price of precious metals or, in case  
if there were no sales during the period, cost of sales of metals extracted (Russian Federation) or the average market price 
(Kazakhstan) during the period. 
Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional 
mining tax accruals in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses (see Note 12).

16. Income tax continued
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20%  
for the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to proﬁt before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax 
regulations, which disallow certain deductions which are included in the determination of accounting proﬁt. These deductions 
include share-based compensation, social related expenditures and other non-production costs, certain general and 
administrative expenses, ﬁnancing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation and 
Kazakhstan. Out of the large operating companies of the Group, tax authorities have audited CJSC Gold of Northern Urals, 
CJSC Magadan Silver for the period up to 2009, LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company and JSC Varvarinskoye  
for the period up to 2010. According to Russian and Kazakhstan tax legislation, previously conducted audits do not fully exclude 
subsequent claims relating to the audited period. 
Income tax and other expenses arising in respect of lost litigation
The additional income tax charges incurred in respect of litigations in the year total US$27.5 million and comprise US$14.5 million 
in respect of a case concerning Magadan Silver sales to ABN AMRO in 2007 and US$13.0 million in respect of cases relating to 
the deductibility of transportation and processing expenses and of foreign exchange losses in Varvara. Including US$5 million of 
additional income tax exposures provided for and US$17.1 million excess proﬁt tax in Kazakhstan recognised for the ﬁrst time in 
2012, there was total additional income tax expense of US$49.6 million in the year.
The Group has also provided for mining taxes, interest and penalties totalling US$65.9 million which are recognised within  
Other Operating Expenses (see Note 12). These expenses comprised US$15.0 million in respect of the Magadan Silver/ABN 
AMRO case, US$9.2 million in respect of the Magadan Silver MET case, US$10.1 million in respect of Varvara litigation and 
US$31.6 million in respect of other exposures. These principal cases are described below. Other exposures considered possible 
but not probable and therefore not provided for total to US$3 million and are described in Note 28, Contingent Liabilities.
Magadan Silver litigation in respect of ABN AMRO sales
On 10 July 2012, the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation (SAC) made a ﬁnal ruling on the tax dispute between 
CJSC Magadan Silver, a subsidiary of the Group, and tax authorities in relation to the sale of silver by the Group in 2007 pursuant 
to certain sale contracts with ABN AMRO Bank.
As a consequence of the Supreme Arbitration Court decision, the Group recognised in full the tax liabilities, interest and penalties 
of US$29.5 million indicated in the judgement. This amount comprised US$14.5 million in income tax and US$15.0 million in 
mining taxes, penalties and accrued interest (see Note 12). 
Varvara litigation
On 5 November 2012 the Kostanay regional court (in Kazakhstan) issued a ruling on the tax dispute between JSC Varvarinskoye 
and the tax authorities in respect of the deductibility of non-cash foreign exchange losses and of transportation, treatment and 
reﬁning charges levied by copper concentrate off-takers. As a consequence of the regional court’s decision, the Group 
recognised liabilities of US$23.1 million as indicated in the judgement. The liability comprised US$13.0 million in income 
tax and US$10.1 million in penalties and accrued interest recognised within Other Operating Expenses (see Note 12).
Magadan Silver litigation in respect of Mineral Extraction Tax (‘MET’)
In March 2012, a ﬁeld tax audit was concluded in relation to CJSC Magadan Silver with respect to all taxes, duties and 
contributions to social funds for the period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009. As a result of this audit the tax authorities 
issued an assessment in relation to the alleged misapplication of technical loss limits in the calculation of mineral extraction tax. 
The case has been heard by the ﬁrst level of the Russian courts, which ruled in favour of the tax authorities on 21 January 2013. 
Whilst the Group intends to appeal the decision to the next court, it has provided for liabilities arising comprising US$6.5 million 
in respect of mineral extraction taxes, and related interest and penalties of US$2.7 million. These amounts are recognised within 
Other Operating Expenses (see Note 12).
Other Exposures
At 31 December 2012 the Group had raised an additional provision for certain additional exposures of US$5.0 million in respect 
of income tax and US$31.6 million in respect of other taxes it considers will likely be payable, plus related interest and penalties. 
These amounts are recognised within Other Operating Expenses (see Note 12).
Excess proﬁt taxes in Kazakhstan
Under Kazakhstan law, excess proﬁt taxes arise where a company’s proﬁt for the year after tax exceeds 25% of allowable 
contractual expenses incurred, which was the case for Varvara in 2012. Excess proﬁt tax is calculated on a sliding scale; the 
additional current tax charge accrued for the year was $17.1 million. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is attributable to the temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for 
ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the 
reporting period.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following analysis 
shows deferred tax balances (after offset) presented for ﬁnancial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax liabilities (75,938) (79,342)
Deferred tax assets 58,024 62,118
(17,914) (17 ,224)
Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by JSC Omolon Gold 
Mining Company, ZK Mayskoye LLC, Albazino Resources LLC, Amursky Hydrometallurgy Plant LLC and the Company during 
the period up to 2021. Each legal entity within the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. 
The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2012 
and 31 December 2011 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were US$288.1 million (RUB 8.8 billion) and US$268.3 million 
(RUB 8.6 billion), respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised net deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$57.6 million at 31 December 2012 is 
more likely than not based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and available 
tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2012. The Group 
has concluded that there is sufﬁcient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufﬁcient taxable 
income in the carry-forward period.
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically 
developed. The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufﬁcient supporting evidence that the Group will generate 
taxable earnings to be able to fully realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount of the DTA considered 
realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are 
reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve estimates, increases in environmental obligations, or 
reductions in precious metal prices.
The Group’s tax losses carried forward expire as follows:

16. Income tax continued
The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group subsidiaries have 
not been recognised as the Group has determined that the undistributed proﬁt of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the 
foreseeable future. The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities have 
not been recognised, amount to US$1,712 million (2011: US$1,066.3 million).
 
17. Dividends
On 14 June 2012 a dividend of 20 cents per share was paid to shareholders by the Company resulting in cash outﬂows of 
US$76.5 million. No dividends were paid in 2011. 
On 5 December 2012, the Board approved the payment of a special dividend of US$0.50 per ordinary share, which will result in 
a cash outﬂow of US$191 million. The dividend was paid on 21 January 2013.
A ﬁnal dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 31 cents per share (2011: 20 cents per share) giving a total expected 
dividend of US$119 million (2011: US$76.5 million). This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
and has therefore not been included as a liability in these ﬁnancial statements.

Mining assets at 31 December 2012 included mineral rights with net book value which amounted to US$370 million  
(31 December 2011: US$363.5 million). Mineral rights of the Group comprise assets acquired upon acquisition of subsidiaries 
and asset acquisitions.
The additions and the disposals of property, plant and equipment in the year ended 31 December 2012 are shown net of 
US$67.8 million of exploration and development assets recognised on acquisition of a controlling interest in Amikan Holding Ltd 
in February 2012 and subsequently derecognised on loss of control in that entity following its disposal in May 2012 (see Note 20).
In the period US$9 million of pre-production stripping costs at Mayskoye were transferred from inventory to exploration and 
development assets (2011: US$nil).
No property, plant and equipment were pledged as collateral at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.

Khakanja 14,237 13,431
Dukat 8,738 8,242
Total 115,106 108,587
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed annually to determine whether it is in excess of its recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is 
based on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash ﬂows, and the tail margin method. 
The DCF method is attributable to the development of proved and probable reserves. The tail margin method, an extension of 
the DCF method, is attributable to the development of resources beyond proved and probable reserves, assuming they could 
be developed after the end of the DCF forecast period. Resources used in calculations are based on the amounts of measured 
and indicated and inferred resources, which are adjusted for a conversion factor in order to obtain a forecast production ﬁgure. 
A steady state cash ﬂow per unit of subject metal is usually applied to the annual resource recovery amount to determine the 
total annual cash ﬂow, based on past experience with an appropriate risk adjustment.
The Group used a post-tax nominal discount rate in the DCF calculations equal to its weighted average cost of capital of 9% 
(2011: 9%). The DCF method used is based on proved and probable reserves and uses the following key assumptions:
 production volumes;
 commodity prices;
 proved and probable reserves; and
 production costs.
 
Recoverable reserves and resources are based on the proven and probable reserves and resources in existence at the end of 
the year. Production costs are based on management’s best estimate over the life of the mine. Estimated production volumes are 
based on detailed life of mine plans and take into account development plans for the mines approved by management as part of 
the long-term planning process. Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources 
of information.

19. Goodwill continued
The tail margin method is used to value resources not currently included within an asset’s mine plan. The methodology involves 
calculating an estimated unit cost per ounce in order to forecast net operating cash ﬂows which are discounted to present value. 
While applying the tail margin method the Company used the following key assumptions:

resources with a conversion factor of 0.7 for measured and indicated resources and 0.5 for inferred resources; and
 of subject metal for the period during which their values in real terms were relatively stable.
In management’s view, no reasonably possible changes in a key assumption would trigger an impairment of goodwill.

Joint venture with AngloGold Ashanti Limited
In February 2008, the Company signed an agreement to set up a strategic alliance and entered into a series of joint ventures with 
AngloGold Ashanti Limited with each party owning 50% of each joint venture. The joint ventures were created in order to execute 
development projects in several territories of the Russian Federation. 
On 7 February 2012, the Company acquired AngloGold’s 50% equity interest and debt investments in the various joint venture 
companies held with Polymetal (Note 4). The principal company acquired was Amikan Holding Limited, which owns the Veduga 
gold deposit in the Krasnoyarsk region of the Russian Federation, with other entities acquired not holding any material assets or 
liabilities. The consideration for the acquisition was US$20 million in cash comprising US$18.4 million for the equity and US$1.6 
million for debt investment in Amikan. At the acquisition date, the Group’s existing 50% investment had a carrying value of 
US$14.2 million together with a loan asset of US$6.9 million. The transaction costs were nil. Amikan Holding Limited meets the 
deﬁnition of a business under IFRS 3 (2008) Business combinations and the transaction was accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The allocation of the purchase price based on the consideration paid and on the fair value of Amikan net assets 
acquired is as follows:

Bargain purchase gain (negative goodwill) 8,400
Total 55,226
The total gain on acquisition of the remaining interest in the joint venture was US$21.1 million, comprising a US$12.7 million 
revaluation to fair value of previously held interest and a bargain purchase gain of US$8.4 million. The bargain purchase gain 
resulted from AngloGold Ashanti Limited’s strategic decision to exit the Russian Federation.
Equity investment in Polygon Gold Inc.
Polygon Gold Inc. (‘Polygon’), a private shell company, was initially set up between Polymetal and Tyner Enterprises Inc. (‘Tyner’) 
which initially held 250 and 100 shares respectively in the new venture. Tyner is controlled and managed by Len Homeniuk,  
a non-executive Director of Polymetal International plc.
On 14 May 2012, Polymetal sold 100% of Amikan Holding Limited to Polygon in exchange for consideration of US$20 million  
in cash and 750 ordinary shares of Polygon. In addition, Sibproekt LLC (‘Sibproekt’), an unrelated local partner, provided  
a US$21 million loan to Polygon and received 100 newly-issued Polygon shares for no consideration. This resulted in Polymetal 
holding an initial 81.8% equity ownership in Polygon. Under the new shareholder agreement, Polymetal obtained one of the  
four board seats giving it signiﬁcant inﬂuence.
On 4 June 2012, Polygon’s share capital was increased to 1,571 shares by the issuance of 471 new shares to an afﬁliate of 
Gazprombank OJSC (‘Gazprombank’) for a total consideration of US$14.2 million paid in cash. The proceeds from the offering 
will be used to ﬁnance the Veduga project and repay part of Polygon’s debt. In addition, Gazprombank has expressed an interest 
in providing project ﬁnancing to Polygon to develop Veduga into a producing mine.
On 7 June 2012, Polymetal sold 230 of its shares in Polygon to Sibproekt for a total consideration of US$8.0 million payable  
in cash, US$5 million of which was paid with US$3.0 million payable by 28 February 2013.
The Group’s equity ownership in Polygon Gold Inc. had now decreased to 42.65%. It continued to exercise signiﬁcant inﬂuence 
over Polygon.
In addition, the Group has provided a US$10 million convertible debt facility to Polygon (see Note 33). 
 
The effects of these transactions are shown on a combined basis below:
 US$’000
Net assets of subsidiary disposed of (100% basis) 53,654
Intercompany debt asset transferred to Polygon 3,331
Less fair value of interest in associate undertaking retained (20,201)
Net assets disposed of 36,784
Loss on disposal (8,784)
Total consideration 28,000
Less unpaid consideration (3,000)
Proceeds from disposal of subsidiary 25,000
  
The above loss on disposal arose partly due to the 6.4% interest in Polygon, which has a fair value of $3 million, being transferred 
to Tyner, a related party, for a cash consideration of US$ nil in exchange for introducing the other funding partners into the 
project and for assuming an ongoing management role. The remaining loss arose principally due to the dilution in Polymetal’s 
economic interest as a result of the 100 shares being issued to Sibproekt on 14 May 2012 for no consideration. The Group 
considers that Sibproekt’s local operating expertise will though be of signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the project.
Equity investment in JSC Ural-Polymetal
In November 2010, a Group subsidiary signed an agreement to establish JSC Ural-Polymetal (Ural-Polymetal), with Valentorskiy 
Rudnik LLC and Kuzmichev V.V. The Group contributed 100% of its interest in North Ural LLC, a subsidiary of the Group, holding 
Galka gold, zinc and silver mining licences to Ural-Polymetal. In addition to Galka, assets contributed to Ural-Polymetal by other 
investors consist of an operating copper and zinc open-pit mine, an operating copper and iron ore underground mine and a 
processing plant. Within the framework of this agreement the Group, Valentorskiy Rudnik LLC and Kuzmichev V.V. each own 
33.3%, 55.7% and 11% of Ural-Polymetal, respectively. Ural-Polymetal was established in order to execute development projects 
in the North Ural region of the Russian Federation concerned with silver, zinc, copper and iron ore extraction and processing.

were included within work in-process. The comparative ﬁgures have been adjusted to be presented on a consistent basis.
At 31 December 2012 US$39 million of ore stock piles at Omolon were classiﬁed as non-current inventories following 
management’s assessment that these stock piles will be processed starting from 2016 (31 December 2011: US$14 million). 
Previously these amounts were included within current metal inventories. The comparative ﬁgures have been adjusted  
to be presented on a consistent basis.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group recognised a US$4 million write-down to net realisable value of its Doré  
in Albazino-Amursk and US$10 million write-down to net realisable value of its ore stock piles at Omolon due to low content of 
precious metals. During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group recognised a US$2.8 million write-down to net realisable 
value of its ore stock piles in Varvara due to poor gold and copper recovery on ore with lower content of precious metals.
In addition, during the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group wrote-down US$5 million of costs (2011: US$3.5 million)  
in Omolon which did not signiﬁcantly enhance the value of the ore stock piles.
During the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group reversed previous obsolescence provisioning against consumables  
and spare parts inventory in the amount of US$3 million (year ended 31 December 2011: reversal of US$0.6 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2012 is US$83.7 million (31 December 2011: nil).

Less: Allowance for doubtful debts (1,551) (980)
Total 107,596 67 ,991 
Trade receivables mainly relate to JSC Varvarinskoye for their sales of provisionally priced copper and gold concentrate, and  
to CJSC Magadan Silver and Albazino Resources Ltd for their sales of provisionally priced silver concentrate. Of the trade 
receivables balance as of 31 December 2012, US$47 million (2011: US$31 million) is due from one customer. There are  
no other customers who represent more than 10% of the total balance of trade receivables.
The average credit period on sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate at 31 December 2012 was 30 days (2011: 28 days).  
No interest is charged on trade receivables. The Group’s allowance for doubtful debt relates to its non-trade receivables.  
There are no trade receivables either past due or impaired as at 31 December 2012 (31 December 2011: US$ nil).
Non-trade receivables include amounts receivable from sale of fuel or operating lease of machinery to contractors, the  
average credit period for non-trade receivables at 31 December 2012 was 93 days (2011: 143 days). No interest is charged  
on non-trade receivables.
Non-trade receivables disclosed above include those that are past due at the end of the reporting period for which the Group 
has not recognised a bad debt allowance because there has not been a signiﬁcant change in credit quality and the amounts are 
still considered to be recoverable. Such past due but not impaired receivables amounted to US$3.7 million as at 31 December 
2012 (2011: US$2.8 million), the majority of which mature within 90 days. The Group does not hold any collateral or other 
security over these balances nor does it have a legal right of offset against any amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty.

Bank loans
The Group has a number of borrowing arrangements with various lenders. These borrowings consist of unsecured and secured 
loans and credit facilities denominated in Roubles, US Dollars, Euro and Canadian Dollars. Where security is provided it is in the 
form of pledge of revenue from certain sales agreements.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group drew down a total of US$1,236 million and repaid US$1,385 million,  
a net repayment of US$145 million. 
The Group secured three new facilities in the period for a total amount of US$300 million with unrelated parties. Two credit 
facilities were fully drawn down in the period. The credit facilities are repayable in thirteen and six equal quarterly instalments 
respectively starting from ﬁrst quarter 2014. Interest is payable quarterly.
Another credit facility was drawn down in amount of US$7.7 million and is payable in nine quarterly instalments starting from 
second quarter 2018. Interest is payable quarterly.
Included in the US$1,385 million was the repayment of the Otkritie ‘REPO’ facility of US$250 million in February 2012. As at  
31 December 2012, the Group had US$913 million of undrawn funds available under its credit facilities (2011: US$803 million). 
The most signiﬁcant ﬁnancial covenant in place is that the ratio of net debt to EBITDA must not exceed 3.25. 
During the years ended 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Group was in compliance with its debt covenants.

28. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Capital commitments
The Group’s budgeted capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2012 amounted to US$37 million 
(2011: US$42.7 million).
Forward sale commitments
The Group has certain physical gold and silver forward sale commitments which are priced at the prevailing market price, 
calculated with reference to the LBMA or LME gold price.
Operating leases: Group as a lessee
The land in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan on which the Group’s production facilities are located is owned by the state. 
The Group leases this land through operating lease agreements, which expire in various years through 2058.
Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating lease agreements at the end of the period were as follows:
 
31 December 
2012

Thereafter 2,702 1,594 
Total 8,812 6,417 
Contingencies
Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. 
Management’s interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activity of the companies of the Group may  
be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities. Recent events within the Russian Federation suggest that the tax 
authorities may be taking a more assertive position in its interpretation of the legislation and assessments.
As a result, signiﬁcant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to review by the 
authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may 
cover longer periods.
During the year, management has been involved in a number of litigations in Russia and in Kazakhstan. See Note 16 for details  
of these cases and their outcomes. 
In addition to the cases detailed within Note 16, management has identiﬁed a total exposure (covering taxes and related interest 
and penalties) of US$3 million in respect of contingent liabilities (2011: US$46.7 million).
29. Fair value accounting
The following table provides an analysis of ﬁnancial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, 
grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets  
or liabilities;
 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are 
observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that  
are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 the Group held the following ﬁnancial instruments:
 
31 December 2012 US$’000
 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales –  59,508 – 59,508

Contingent consideration liabilities – – (22,290) (22,290)
 – 37,609 (22,290) 15,319
During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing 
mechanisms is determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market  
for the particular metal. As such, these receivables are classiﬁed within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in JSC Omolon 
Gold Mining Company (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model 
which simulates expected production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices to estimate future 
revenues of Omolon. This liability is revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life of mine revenues with the resulting 
gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. The liability recognised at 31 December 2012 was US$25 million 
(2011: US$22.3 million).
The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s Level 3 ﬁnancial liabilities for the year  
ended 31 December 2012:
 
31 December 
2012
US$’000

Translation effect 53 (1,349)
Settlement (1,838) (6,943)
Total 25,276 22,290 
Additions in the year represent the contingent consideration payable by the Group on Semchenskoye Zoloto acquisition  
(see Note 4 for further details).
The directors consider that a change in a reasonably possible valuation assumption used would not have a material effect  
on the Group.
Commodity forward contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the physical delivery of metals which will be priced according to the prevailing 
London Bullion Market Association or London Metal Exchange index. The Group’s policy is not to enter into ﬁxed priced 
contracts. The forward sales contracts qualify for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption for accounting purposes 
and are outside the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Derivatives
The Group closed the open derivative positions at 6 April 2011. The fair value of commodity forward contracts was determined 
by discounting contractual cash ﬂows using a discount rate derived from observed US Treasury yield curve rates. Contractual 
cash ﬂows were calculated using a forward pricing curve derived from market forward prices for each commodity (see Note 30).

30. Risk management activities
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising 
the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains from 
prior years.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 25 offset by cash and bank balances as 
detailed in Note 24) and equity of the Group (comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings as detailed 
in Note 31).
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure of the 
Group on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each 
class of capital.
Major categories of ﬁnancial instruments
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial liabilities comprise borrowings, derivatives, ﬁnance lease liabilities, trade and other payables.  
The Group has various ﬁnancial assets such as accounts receivable, loans advanced and cash and cash equivalents.

Total ﬁnancial liabilities 1,148,488 1,622,720 
Trade and other payables exclude employee beneﬁts and social security.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, share purchase obligation, trade and other receivables, trade and other 
payables and short-term debt recorded at amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of 
these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Group’s long-term debt, calculated using the market interest rate available  
to the Group as at 31 December 2012, is US$816 million, and the carrying value as at 31 December 2012 is US$863 million  
(see Note 25). Carrying values of the other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 31 December 2012 and  
31 December 2011 approximated to their fair values.
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are foreign currency and commodity price risk, interest rate, credit 
and liquidity risks.
At the end of the reporting period, there are no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk for receivables designated at FVTPL.  
The carrying amount reﬂected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for such receivables.

Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in US Dollars. 
In addition, the Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge). 
As a result, the Group is subject to transaction and translation exposure from ﬂuctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative instruments to currently hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies  
of the individual Group entities at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 were as follows:

Provisionally priced sales
Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced at 
the time of shipment. The provisional prices are ﬁnalised in a contractually speciﬁed future period (generally one to three months) 
primarily based on quoted LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to ﬁnal pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month.  
The forward price is a major determinant of recorded revenue.

30. Risk management activities continued
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both ﬁxed and ﬂoating interest rates. 
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between ﬁxed and ﬂoating rate borrowings. The Group 
does not currently hedge its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section  
of this note.
For ﬂoating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting 
period was outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change  
in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s proﬁt for the year 
ended 31 December 2012 would decrease/increase by US$7.7 million (2011: US$6.5 million). This is mainly attributable to the 
Group’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate  
debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to ﬁnancial 
losses to the Group. The Group’s ﬁnancial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist 
primarily of cash and cash equivalents and loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. 
Trade accounts receivable at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 are represented by provisional copper, gold and silver 
concentrate sales transactions. A signiﬁcant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable export 
trading companies. With regard to other loans and receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include checks by 
a security department and responsible on-site management for business reputation, licences and certiﬁcation, creditworthiness 
and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged in connection with its investments in the above 
ﬁnancial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international 
credit-rating agencies. The major ﬁnancial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable presented  
in Note 24 are cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2012 of US$18.6 million (2011: US$659 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle all liabilities as they are due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed 
budgeting, cash forecasting processes and matching the maturity proﬁles of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities to help ensure that 
it has adequate cash available to meet its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its ﬁnancial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. 
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ﬂows of ﬁnancial liabilities based on the earliest date on which 
the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and principal cash ﬂows. To the extent that interest ﬂows are 
ﬂoating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual 
maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

Retained earnings
reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law. The ability 
to distribute cash up to the Company from the Russian and Kazakh operating companies will be based on the statutory historical 
information of each stand-alone entity, which is prepared in accordance with Russian or Kazakh accounting standards and 
which differs slightly from IFRS. Russian legislation identiﬁes the basis of distribution as accumulated proﬁt. However, current 
legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal interpretation; consequently, actual 
distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated proﬁt under Russian statutory accounting rules.
Weighted average number of shares: diluted earnings per share
The Group had potentially dilutive securities, namely the Group’s equity-settled share appreciation plan, which was established 
during 2010 (see Note 32).
Basic/dilutive earnings per share were calculated by dividing proﬁt for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent  
by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares before/after dilution respectively. The calculation of the 
weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended
31 December 
2012
31 December 
2011
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 382,705,692 366,969,369
Dilutive effect of share appreciation plan – 25,875,610
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 382,705,692 392,844,979
There were no adjustments required to earnings for the purposes of calculating dilutive earnings per share in the  
current year (2011: nil).

30. Risk management activities continued
The Group has certain share-based payment awards, issued in 2010, which currently vest in line with the Company’s weighted 
average share price from December 2012 to June 2013 against a ﬁxed target (for further details see Note 32). Based on the 
Company’s share price in the equivalent six month period to 31 December 2012 then these awards are not dilutive for the 
purposes of calculating diluted EPS and accordingly, both basic and diluted EPS are identical for the year ended  
31 December 2012.
These awards were dilutive for the year ended 31 December 2011. The dilutive effect of equity-settled share appreciation rights 
has been calculated using the treasury stock method.
32. Share-based payments
In 2010, the Group established an equity incentive plan (the Plan) for executive directors and senior employees of the Group  
in which the grant of equity-settled share appreciation rights up to 30 million shares in JSC Polymetal (the Bonus Fund) was 
approved. The number of awards to which a qualifying participant is entitled was determined by the board of JSC Polymetal  
on 8 November 2010. Group management believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those  
of its shareholders.
Under the terms of the plan these awards were eligible for immediate vesting on the Group restructuring and listing. However,  
the executive directors and senior managers waived that right and the entitlement to JSC Polymetal shares was exchanged for 
an entitlement to Polymetal International shares on a one to one basis with the same vesting conditions as existed previously.  
As the cancellation and reissuance of the awards was done solely to preserve the existing rights of the award holders, no 
accelerated share-based charge has been recognised.
The aggregate number of shares comprising the Bonus Fund will be determined on 11 June 2013 and will depend on the excess 
of the weighted average price of the Company’s shares during the period between 11 December 2012 and 11 June 2013 over  
a target price of US$16.74. If the average share price is below the target ﬁgure there will be nil vesting. The weighted average 
price of the Company’s shares during the period between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2012 was US$16.45.
Equity-settled stock appreciation rights granted have an exercise price of one penny and vest at the end of a 2.6 year  
service period.
The fair value of the awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2010, was estimated using a two-stage Monte-Carlo 
model. The fair value determined is then recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Use of two-stage Monte-
Carlo option pricing requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The following 
assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value:
 Expected forfeitures. This assumption is estimated using historical trends of executive Director and employee turnover.  
As the Group typically only grants awards to senior employees and the turnover rate for such employees is minimal, the Group 
has estimated expected forfeitures to be 5%. Estimated forfeitures are adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent 
actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognised in the 
period of change and impact the amount of expense to be recognised in future periods.
 Expected volatility. Expected volatility has been estimated based on an analysis of the historical stock price volatility of the  
JSC Polymetal GDRs from February 2007 , when the JSC Polymetal GDRs became publicly traded.
 Expected life. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option of 3.6 years. As the Plan has a  
2.6 years vesting condition and the participant may exercise their right to redeem shares within one year after vesting occurs, 
the Group used the 2.6 years expected term for the ﬁrst stage of the Monte-Carlo simulation (the First date) and 3.6 years for 
the second stage (the Second date).
 Fair value of common stock is equal to the market price of JSC Polymetal’s underlying Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs)  
at the grant date.
 Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free rate is based on US Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the 
expected life assumed at the date of grant.
At the grant date, the Group had not historically declared dividends and management believed the Company would not declare  
a dividend over the life of the option. As such, the expected annual dividend per share was therefore nil. Any subsequent change 
in dividend policy will be taken into account when valuing options granted in the future.
Risk free rate 0.79% for the ﬁrst date, 1.24% for the second date
Expected dividend yield Nil
Expected volatility 40%
Expected life, years 2.6 for the ﬁrst date, 3.6 for the second date
Fair value per share (US Dollars) 16.97

31 December 2012, share-based compensation in the amount of US$54 million, (2011: US$57 million) was recognised in 
general, administrative and selling expenses in the consolidated income statement (see Note 11). 
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group had US$24.7 million and US$75.7 million, respectively of 
unrecognised share-based compensation expense related to non-vested equity-settled stock appreciated rights with a weighted 
average expected amortisation period of 0.45 years and 1.45 years, respectively.

35. Subsequent events
On 24 January 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of Olymp Ltd., a Russian legal entity holding the mining and 
exploration licence for the Olcha gold-silver deposit in exchange for 775,000 new ordinary shares in Polymetal. Following the 
admittance of the newly-issued shares to trading, the total issued share capital of the Company comprised 383,981,204 shares.
Olymp Ltd. does not meet the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it is accounted for as an acquisition  
of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights of US$13.4 million and other current liabilities of $(0.01) million.
On 20 February 2013 the Group has entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with Vitalex Investments Ltd and 
Arrowline Investments Ltd to acquire a 100% interest in ZAO ‘Maminskaya Gornorudnaya kompania’(‘MGK’), which holds an 
exploration and mining licence for the Maminskoye gold mining ﬁeld (‘Maminskoye’). 
On 9 April 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of MGK. The consideration for the equity investment was  
US$3.9 million payable in cash and 5,491,661 of Polymetal’s ordinary shares valued at the acquisition date at US$74.6 million. 
The debt investment in MGK was acquired for a consideration payable in cash and equalling to its carrying value of  
US$8 million.
MGK meets the deﬁnition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it was accounted for at fair value using the  
acquisition method. 
The allocation of the purchase price has not been ﬁnalised as at the date of these ﬁnancial statements and will be ﬁnalised  
in 2013 upon completion of a mineral rights valuation and a deferred taxes assessment. The preliminary allocation of the 
purchase price based on the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired was as follows:
 US$’000
Net assets acquired 
Mineral rights 115, 127 
Property, plant and equipment 2,952 
Non-current liabilities (9,896)
Deferred tax liability (23,025)
Other assets, net 1,400 
Net assets acquired 86,558 
Consideration: 
Fair value of shares issued 74,624 
Cash 3,900 
Debt investment 8,034 
A ﬁnal dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 31 cents per share (2011: 20 cents per share) giving a total expected 
dividend of US$119 million (2011: US$76.5 million). This is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
and has therefore not been included as a liability in these ﬁnancial statements.

Glossary of technical terms
Assay  a chemical test performed on a sample  
of any material to determine the amount  
of valuable metals contained in the sample
Ag silver
AgEq silver equivalent
Au gold
Autoclave a lined stainless-steel vessel in which a 
technological operation of pressure oxidation 
takes place
Carbon-in-leach 
or CIL
 a technological operation in which slurry 
containing gold and silveris leached by  
cyanide in the presence of activated carbon. 
Gold is absorbed onto activated carbon in 
parallel with leaching
Carbon-in-pulp  
or CIP
 means a technological operation in which slurry 
containing gold and silver is leached by cyanide 
initially without and subsequently in the presence 
of activated carbon. Gold absorption onto 
carbon starts only after preliminary leaching
Concentrate a semi-ﬁnished product of mineral processing 
(ﬂotation or gravity separation) containing 
signiﬁcantly more value per unit of weight than 
ore and subject to further processing for the 
production of metals or other substances  
in ﬁnal useful form
Cu copper
Cut-off grade the minimum grade at which mineralised material 
can be economically mined and processed 
(used in the calculation of ore reserves)
Cyanide leaching leaching with cyanide as the leaching agent
Decline a permanent inclined underground tunnel leading 
from the surface to an ore body
Dilution the share (percentage) of material below the 
cut-off grade that is extracted together and 
irretrievably mixed with ore during mining.  
All other things being equal, higher dilution leads 
to lower grade in ore mined
Doré one of the traditional end-products of a gold/
silver mine; an alloy containing 90% in sum of 
gold and silver as well as 10% of impurities
Exploration activity ultimately aimed at discovery of ore 
reserves for exploitation. Consists of sample 
collection and analysis, including 
reconnaissance, geophysical and geochemical 
surveys, trenching, drilling, etc
Flotation a technological operation in which ore-bearing 
minerals are separated from gangue minerals  
in the slurry based on variance in the interaction 
of different minerals with water. Particles of 
valuable concentrate are carried upwards with  
froth and collected for further processing
Grade means the relative amount of metal in ore, 
expressed as grams per tonne for precious 
metals and as a percentage for most  
other metals
Head grade the grade of ore coming into a processing plant
Heap leach a technological operation in which crushed 
material is laid on a sloping, impervious pad 
where it is leached by cyanide solution to 
dissolve gold and/or silver. Metals are 
subsequently recovered from pregnant leach 
solution by CIC or the Merrill-Crowe process
Indicated 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which  
tonnage, grade and content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of conﬁdence. It is based 
on exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are  
too widely or inappropriately spaced to  
conﬁrm geological and/or grade continuity  
but are spaced closely enough forcontinuity  
to be assumed
Inferred resource means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
grade and content can be estimated with a low 
level of conﬁdence. It is inferred from geological 
evidence and assumed but not veriﬁed 
geological and/or grade continuity. It is based  
on information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which 
may be limited or of uncertain quality  
and reliability
In-ﬁll drilling a conventional method of detailed exploration on 
already deﬁned resource of reserve, consisting  
of drilling on a denser grid to allow more precise 
estimation of ore body parameters and location
Leaching the process of dissolving mineral values from 
solid into liquid phase of slurry
Measured 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade 
and mineral content can be estimated with a 
high level of conﬁdence. It is based on detailed 
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  
The locations are spaced closely enough  
to conﬁrm geological and grade continuity
Merrill-Crowe 
process
a technological operation for extraction of gold 
and/or silver after cyanide leaching. In the ﬁrst 
step slurry containing gold and/or silver is 
separated into liquid and solid phases by 
washing the solids off in countercurrent 
decantation thickeners. In the second step 
pregnant leach solution (liquid phase of slurry)  
is ﬁltered to remove impurities and deaerated. 
Finally, gold and silver are deposited onto the 
solid bed of claylike material where they replace 
zinc particles which pass into a solution. 
Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used for  
silver-rich ores
Mill a mineral processing plant
Mineralisation a rock containing valuable components,  
not necessarily in the quantities sufﬁcient  
for economically justiﬁable extraction.  
Consists of ore minerals and gangue
Open-pittable amenable for economically feasible mining  
by open-pit methods
Open-pit mine a mine that is entirely on surface. Also referred  
to as open-cut or open-cast mine
Ore the part of mineralisation that can be mined  
and processed proﬁtably
Ore body a spatially compact and geometrically  
connected location of ore
Ore mined ore extracted from the ground for  
further processing
Ore processed ore subjected to treatment in a mineral 
processing plant
Ore stacked the ore stacked for heap leach operations.
Oxidised ore ore in which both ore minerals and gangue are 
fully or partially oxidised thus impacting its 
physical and chemical properties and inﬂuencing 
the choice of a processing technology
Precipitate the semi-ﬁnished product of mineral processing 
by Merrill-Crowe process, normally containing 
very high concentrations of silver and/or gold
POX or pressure 
oxidation
a technological operation in which slurry is 
subjected to high pressure and high temperature 
in an autoclave with the goal to destroy sulphide 
particles enveloping gold particles and make 
slurry amenable to cyanide leaching
Primary ore unoxidised ore
Probable 
reserves
the economically mineable part of an indicated 
(and in some cases measured) resource, which 
has a lower level of conﬁdence than proved 
reserves but is of sufﬁcient quality to serve  
as the basis for a decision on the development  
of the deposit
Production the amount of pure precious metals, measured 
in thousands of ounces for gold, millions  
of ounces for silver and tonnes for copper, 
produced following processing
Proved reserves the economically mineable part of a measured 
resource, which represents the highest 
conﬁdence category of reserve estimate.  
The style of mineralisation or other factors  
could mean that proved reserves are not 
achievable in some deposits
Reclamation the restoration of a site after mining or 
exploration activity is completed
Recovery or 
recovery rate
the percentage of valuable metal in the ore  
that is recovered by metallurgical treatment  
in the ﬁnal or semi-ﬁnished product
Refractory a characteristic of gold-bearing ore denoting 
impossibility of recovering gold from it by 
conventional cyanide leaching
Reserves the economically mineable part of a measured 
and/or indicated mineral resource. It takes into 
account mining dilution and losses. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, 
and include consideration of and modiﬁcation  
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors. These 
assessments demonstrate at the time of 
reporting that extraction could reasonably be 
justiﬁed. Reserves are subdivided in order of 
increasing conﬁdence into probable reserves 
and proved reserves
Resources a concentration or occurrence of material of 
intrinsic economic interest in or on the earth’s 
crust in such form, quality and quantity that  
there are reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction. The location, quantity, 
grade, geological characteristics and continuity 
of resources are known, estimated or interpreted 
from speciﬁc geological evidence and 
knowledge. Resources are sub-divided in order 
of increasing geological conﬁdence, into inferred, 
indicated and measured categories
Stockwork one of the types of mineralisation, a complex 
system of structurally controlled or randomly 
oeirnted veins. Stockworks are common  
in many ore deposit types
Stope a large underground excavation entirely within  
an ore body, a unit of ore extraction
Strike a horizontal extension of an ore body  
or mineralisation
Stripping the mining of waste in an open pit mine
Tailings part of the original feed of a mineral  
processing plant that is considered devoid  
of value after processing
Underground 
development
excavation which is carried out to access ore 
and prepare it for extraction (mining)
Vein a relatively narrow ore body with signiﬁcant dip 
and strike dimensions and sharply deﬁned 
boundaries
Waste barren rock that must be mined and removed  
to access ore in a mine

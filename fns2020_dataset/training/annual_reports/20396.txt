str Ategic re Port During 2016 Acacia delivered against  
its primary objective of delivering  
free cash flow generation.
Kelvin d ushnis Ky
CHaIRMaN OF THE BOaRD
“2016 was a strong year for acacia  
as we began to reap the benefits  
from the changes that we have  
driven across the business.”
Dear shareholders,
2016 was a pleasing year for acacia as the Company 
delivered against our primary objective of generating 
free cash flow as the benefits of the changes at the 
operations flowed through the business. It was a 
record year in several ways as Group production of 
829,705 ounces was the highest that the business 
has ever achieved. This, in turn, was driven by record 
production at North Mara of 378,443 ounces, aided 
by a full year of operations at the Gokona underground 
operation. This is now the fourth consecutive year  
we have delivered an increase in production, from 
what was seen as a mature asset base, and we  
are guiding for a fifth year of growth in 2017 . 
On the cost front, we saw a downward step change, driven in part by 
increased production, but also by the major restructuring of the workforce 
in Q4 2015. Over the past four years, we have taken over uS$600 per 
ounce out of our all-in sustaining cost through the transformation of each 
of our assets. This has meant that the business has moved from a position 
of considerable cash outflow, to one that doubled its net cash position  
to uS$218 million during 2016.
The turnaround of the business, coupled with supporting tailwinds, meant 
that the share price performed extremely strongly during 2016, rising 
108% over the year, with a peak at 598p in august. Geopolitical events 
through the year, including the result of the referendum on the uK’s 
membership of the Eu, speculation over the timing of interest rate rises  
in the uS, and rising political tensions provided support for the gold price 
over the first ten months of the year and meant that our net realised gold 
price averaged uS$1,240 per ounce for the year, was nearly 5% higher 
than in 2015. However, following the united States Presidential election 
and a uS interest rate rise in December there was a correction in the  
gold price and it ended the year at uS$1,145 per ounce.
board composition
There have been no significant changes to Board composition in 2016. 
This year we revisited Board Committee composition to ensure that the 
membership of each Board Committee is best aligned to acacia’s needs. 
as a result of this review, we have decided to alter the composition of 
our audit and EHS&S Committees, with composition changes applying 
from 2017. Further details of these changes are provided as part of the 
Governance overview on page 60.

f inal dividend
Our dividend policy is based on cash flow in order to ensure that it is closely 
aligned with the focus on cash generation from the business. as a result 
we aim to pay a dividend of between 15-30% of our operational cash flow, 
after sustaining capital and capitalised development, but before expansion 
capital and financing costs.
In line with this policy, in July we declared an interim dividend of 2.0 cents 
per share, which was a 43% increase on 2015. as a result of strong 
performance in the second half of the year, we are pleased to recommend 
a final dividend of 8.4 cents per share. This represents a full year payout  
of 10.4 cents per share, or uS$43 million, which is at the top of the payout 
range and 147% higher than 2015. The decision to recommend a dividend 
at the top of the range reflects the confidence we have in the business, the 
significant free cash flow the Company generated in 2016 and the fact that 
we are able to fund out of free cash flow the organic projects currently in 
our pipeline. We believe the distribution of capital to our shareholders is  
a key differentiator for acacia and continues our track record of providing 
strong total returns to our shareholders across the cycle. 
outlook
The delivery from our business during 2016 is a result of the hard work 
that has been undertaken across the Company. This does not mean that 
we have completed the transformation and we continue to work to optimise 
our asset base and to overcome challenges inherent to this business.
Looking forward to 2017, we expect to see further improvements across 
the asset base, with an increase in production and further reduction in 
costs. This improvement is being led by Buzwagi as a result of the 
optimisation of the final year of mining in order to drive cash flow for the 
business. We will continue to develop the operational stability at Bulyanhulu 
as we look to fully unlock the geological potential of the mine, and at North 
Mara, we believe the extensive drilling programmes currently underway  
will demonstrate the quality and longevity of what is becoming a leading 
asset in africa. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to acknowledge all acacia employees for 
their hard work during the year. I would also like to express my appreciation 
to our shareholders for their continued support for the Company.

acacia vocational Scholarship programme
Empowerment of the youth through provision of relevant skills is  
not only enshrined in the uN Sustainable Development Goals, but  
also in Kenya’s own development plan, Vision 2030. Kenya has an 
acknowledged acute deficit in technical and vocational skills needed  
to meet the increasing demand for large infrastructure projects and  
the expanding extractive sector. In line with this, and with acacia’s 
sustainable communities strategy and the desired outcome of 
delivering inclusive and equitable quality education to host 
communities, we launched the acacia Vocational Scholarship 
Programme in September 2016. 
66 students from disadvantaged backgrounds in our main area of 
operation, including 36 women, have been supported through the 
payment of full tuition and examination fees in a range of vocational 
courses in three neighbouring renowned technical colleges. In the spirit 
of shared commitment, the students are asked to contribute towards 
extra course requirements, and their ability to meet these costs is 
under constant monitoring. 
Courses offered were those which acacia may potentially utilise in the 
long term, whilst at the same time offering students the opportunity  
of a livelihood that isn’t reliant on acacia’s operations. Courses range 
from one to two years in duration and include those in technical skills 
such as welding, plumbing, electrics and mechanics, as well as in a 
range of agricultural and business-related disciplines.
Genuine community involvement was achieved in a fair, open and 
transparent selection process, facilitated greatly by the assistance of 
community representatives on the community consultative committee, 
which serves as the communications conduit between acacia and the 
community. The programme has enjoyed compelling support and praise 
from the community, and we look forward to witnessing the fruits of the 
programme in years to come.

W e continued to deliver against our strategy in 
2016 which resulted in a successful year across 
both our mines and exploration programmes.
brad g ordon
CHIEF ExECuTIVE OFFICER
We also saw a substantial fall in our all-in sustaining costs (‘aISC’)  
to uS$958 per ounce, which was 14% below 2015 levels and at the 
bottom of our guidance range of uS$950 to uS$980 per ounce. This  
was a result of the changes that were made to the business in late 
2015, improved operating efficiencies at the assets and the increased 
production profile. If we were to focus purely on asset performance, and 
remove the impact of the increase in the share price on the valuation of 
share-based payments, our aISC would have been uS$921 per ounce, 
17% below 2015 and well below our guidance range.
I was especially pleased with the return to free cash generation during 
the year, which is our primary focus. Over the past 12 months we 
doubled our net cash on the balance sheet to uS$218 million which 
provides significant flexibility for us going forward. at the same time,  
the success of North Mara meant that a corporate tax charge amounting 
to uS$55 million was incurred, which included a uS$20 million cash 
prepayment agreed with the Tanzanian Revenue authority in Q1 2017. 
year in review
2016 was a very strong operational year as we saw the benefit of  
the first full year of operations at the Gokona underground at North 
Mara. This deposit was previously mined as a high-grade open pit  
and commenced underground mining in mid 2015 after we made the 
strategic decision to go underground in 2014. The mine delivered ahead 
of expectations in 2016, partly due to a 61% increase in mined grade 
compared to the resource model. This drove additional ounces and  
the overall mine achieved a record production year of 378,443 ounces,  
a 32% increase over 2015. at Bulyanhulu, we overcame an extended 
process plant shutdown in the third quarter which led to a loss of 
approximately one month of milling capacity to deliver 289,432 ounces, 
a 6% increase on 2015. This demonstrates the increased operational 
resilience as part of our ongoing programme to unlock the geological and 
operational potential of the asset. at Buzwagi, production was behind 
expectations at 161,830 ounces, 5% below 2015 as a result of lower 
mined grades due to a change in pit sequencing in order to enhance 
operational efficiencies as part of the extension of mining in 2017. 
On the cost side, we demonstrated further improvement in aISC as  
the operational efficiencies and increased production rates took effect. 
North Mara was again the standout performer, with an aISC of uS$733 
per ounce, which was 20% lower than 2015 driven by the increased 
production base. at Bulyanhulu, aISC fell by a further 16% to uS$1,058 
per ounce as a result of the restructuring that took place in Q4 2015.  
at Buzwagi, we saw aISC above expectation at uS$1,095 per ounce  
due to the lower ounce profile, though this was still 8% lower than 2015. 
Together, this led to a 14% fall in the headline aISC to uS$958 per 
ounce, over uS$150 per ounce lower than 2015. On an annual basis  
this now represents a 43% reduction in aISC from its peak in 2012.
The strong performance meant that we ended the year with uS$318 million 
of cash on our balance sheet, an increase of uS$85 million over the previous 
year. This includes the uS$20 million corporate tax cash prepayment, 
uS$28 million on debt repayments, uS$20 million on dividends and uS$36 
million on share-based payments as a result of the vesting of awards during 
the year. as a result, net cash on the balance sheet more doubled from 
uS$106 million, ending the year at uS$218 million.
Introduction
2016 was a landmark year for acacia as we delivered 
record Group production of 829,705 ounces, which 
was almost 100,000 ounces ahead of 2015. It also 
exceeded our initial guidance range for the year  
of 750,000 to 780,000 ounces and revised guidance 
given in October 2016 of approximately 820,000 
ounces. Performance was driven by North Mara, 
where the mine had a record year, and at Bulyanhulu, 
which registered its highest production year for ten 
years, testament to the work we have undertaken  
to turn the asset around.

Our business has been transformed over the 
past few years as we have redesigned each  
of our assets.
a key part of our strategy has 
been to ensure that each of our 
assets is set up to deliver to their 
potential. at Bulyanhulu, this has 
meant changing the mining 
method to a modern mechanised 
way of mining, which is both safer 
and more productive. at North 
Mara, we have converted one of 
our open pits, Gokona, into an 
underground operation, which has 
significantly outperformed in its 
first full year of operations. at 
Buzwagi, we have looked at how to 
optimise a short life and extended 
mining until the end of 2017, with 
stockpile treatment for at least 
two further years. Together, these 
changes have driven a step 
change in production and similar 
reduction in costs.

Acacia Rainbow 
Programme
18 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 Total revenue for the year amounted to uS$1,054 million, which was 21% 
ahead of 2015 as a result of the increased production profile and the 
uS$86 per ounce higher average realised gold price. EBITDa was similarly 
strong at uS$415 million, up from uS$175 million in 2015. We had net 
earnings of uS$95 million, which were primary impacted by a uS$69.9 
million provision as a result of historic tax cases, but were still significantly 
ahead of 2015’s loss of uS$197 million. adjusted net earnings amounted 
to uS$161 million, which was uS$154 million above 2015. 
r eserves and r esources
Notwithstanding the strengthening of the gold price in 2016, we have taken 
the decision to maintain the 2015 gold price assumptions in our Reserve  
and Resource calculations. This not only brings consistency of planning  
on an annual basis but it also helps underpin the financial robustness of our 
long-term planning. Our Reserve pricing is maintained at uS$1,100 per ounce 
and our Resource pricing has been maintained at uS$1,400 per ounce. 
On a Group basis, our overall Reserves and Resources declined by 4% 
from 28.6 million ounces to 27.5 million ounces during the year. at our 
operating mines, total Reserves and Resources declined by 861,000 
ounces, which was primarily a result of depletion. at our exploration 
properties, we had a marginal reduction of 112,000 ounces as a result 
of the inclusion of our share of the South Houndé Resource in Burkina 
Faso, which largely offset the change in the methodology of how we 
account for the Nyanzaga joint venture Resource, which has been 
converted from a large-scale low-grade Resource to a smaller high-grade 
Resource from a combined open pit and underground.
Whilst total Reserves and Resources were largely flat, Reserves fell by  
1.1 million ounces to 7.6 million ounces. In addition to depletion, this is 
largely a result of the reclassification of approximately 583,000 ounces 
of Reef 2 material at Bulyanhulu from Reserves into Inferred Resources 
as a result of the change in the required drill spacing for underlying 
Resource classifications. Prior to recent drilling programmes, the search 
radius for Reef 1 and Reef 2 was the same, with a 100 metre search 
radius around each drill hole used for indicated Resources (which can 
then be converted into a probable Reserve) and a 200 metre search 
radius used for Inferred material. Following the recent drilling, the 
variography has shown that due to the different geometries of the Reef 2 
series, the 100 metre search radius is not appropriate and has been 
reduced to 50 metres. This has meant that some ounces previously 
classified as probable Reserves (based on the underlying indicated 
Resource) have now largely been moved to Inferred Resources. We are 
undertaking drilling programmes during 2017 to reduce drill spacing in 
available areas to bring material back into the indicated category and  
will continue this programme over the coming years. 
This change to the classification of Resources at Bulyanhulu, together  
with depletion, has meant that Reserves in the underground mine declined 
by 1.0 million ounces to 4.9 million ounces. However, the grade of the 
Reserves has increased from 8.85g/t in 2015 to 9.75g/t as a result  
of the change to cut-off grade calculations and the reduction in the mill 
reconciliation factor which had previously been included as a result of  
mill performance in 2015.
at North Mara, we largely replaced Reserves in the Gokona deposit despite 
mining approximately 225,000 ounces from the underground in 2016, at a 
significantly higher grade than included in the prior year Reserves 
declaration. This Reserves replacement was a result of changes to the 
underground grade control model due to our improved understanding of the 
ore body which included additional stope designs. We expect to complete 
the technical work to better estimate the future impact of the positive 
reconciliations received during 2016 in Q2 2017. as such, the results of this 
work have not yet been incorporated into the current Reserves statement.  
In the Nyabirama pit we saw depletion of 170,000 ounces during 2016,  
of which approximately 111,000 ounces were replaced as a result of grade 
control model updates. Together, this led to Reserves at North Mara falling 
by 83,000 ounces to 1.9 million ounces.
We believe that the current Reserves position at North Mara does not 
reflect the potential of either of the ore bodies at the mine and in 2017 
we are commencing extension programmes to identify new Resources 
and upgrade existing Resources at both Gokona and Nyabirama. We are 
targeting significant upgrades to the Reserves and Resources at the 
mine over the next several years as part of our target to produce more 
than 300,000 ounces per annum for at least ten years at North Mara. 
at Buzwagi, the extension of mining by a further six months led to the 
inclusion of 152,000 ounces of Resources into Reserves which meant 
that the mine fully replaced Reserves. Buzwagi now has 6.0 million tonnes 
of in-pit Reserves at 1.7 grams per tonne which will be mined during 2017, 
with lower-grade material stockpiled for processing in 2018 and beyond.
discovery
We had a very positive year in exploration and in February 2017 we were 
able to announce the maiden Inferred Resource at the Liranda Corridor 
on the West Kenya Project. We believe the Resource of 1.31 million 
ounces at 12.1g/t, one of the highest-grade projects in africa, is the first 
step in delineating a multi-million ounce Resource at the project and are 
targeting increasing the Resource to over 2 million ounces during 2017.
We also made progress in West africa and continued to expand our  
land package on the highly prospective Houndé Belt in Burkina Faso.  
We now have a licence area of 2,700 square kilometres through four 
joint ventures which provides access to 125 strike kilometres on the 
belt. as part of this programme we have completed the first stage of  
the earn-in on the South Houndé joint venture with Sarama Resources  
and as a result now own 50% of the joint venture and have taken over 
operatorship of the project. Due to this we have consolidated 50% of  
the 2.1 million ounce Inferred Resource on the project into our Resource 
statement. In Mali, we took our first steps in exploring the licences we 
have acquired with promising initial results and will continue to look to 
expand our land package on the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 
The joint venture with OreCorp Limited to progress our Nyanzaga Project 
in Tanzania continues to move forward. OreCorp took over management 
of the project for a three-year period in late 2015. This structure allows 
the project to be progressed whilst giving acacia the optionality to 
maintain a 75% stake in the project once it reaches a development 
decision. During the year, OreCorp completed a scoping study on the 
project which outlined a combined open pit and underground project  
that produces 2.4 million ounces of gold over a 13-year life at an aISC  
of uS$798/oz and requires pre-production capital of uS$248 million 
(inclusive of contingency). OreCorp are now undertaking a pre-feasibility 
study which is due to be completed in the coming months.

Safety
Safety performance during 2016 was disappointing as regrettably in January 
2016 one of our contractors at North Mara passed away as a result of a 
haul truck accident. We also saw an increase in our total reportable injury 
frequency rate (‘TRIFR’) of 9% to 0.74. This was driven by an increase at 
Bulyanhulu, although we saw an improvement in safety performance in the 
fourth quarter at the mine. Despite these disappointing results we did see 
areas of improvement, with Buzwagi’s TRIFR reducing by 44%, as we fully 
embedded our behavioural safety programme, “Tunajali” or “WeCare”, into 
the business and at North Mara we saw safety performance remaining in 
line with 2015 levels despite the increased level of complexity of operations. 
We also saw a 46% reduction in the number of high potential incidents 
(incidents that could under slightly different circumstances have led to a 
fatality or permanent disability). We continue to target zero injuries and 
having every person going home safely every day.
operating environment
as a major contributor to the Tanzanian economy we were pleased to  
be able to increase our fiscal contribution during 2016 through incurring 
a corporate tax charge amounting to uS$55 million. This was a result  
of the strong performance at North Mara and included our agreement  
to pre-pay uS$20 million of cash corporate taxes. Our increase in tax 
payments, when added to royalties of uS$47 million, payroll taxes of 
uS$40 million and other taxes of approximately uS$20 million, provides 
a significant contribution to the Tanzanian Government’s aim of 
self-funding the national budget. 
During 2016 there have continued to be a number of tax cases that  
are being dealt with in the court system in Tanzania which we are seeking  
to resolve. as communicated earlier in the year, we recorded a tax provision 
of uS$69.9 million in respect of historic capital deductions at Bulyanhulu, 
North Mara and Tulawaka as a result of a Court of appeal ruling. We are also 
dealing with claims to levy taxes in Tanzania on the uK registered acacia 
Mining plc which we believe have no basis in law given this company is tax 
resident and permanently established in the uK. Given the materiality of the 
amounts being claimed, we are also addressing a constructive resolution of 
these issues as part of our ongoing engagement with the Tanzania Revenue 
authority (‘TRa’) as well as at a senior level in the Government.
During the year we also saw a build-up in the total indirect tax receivables 
from uS$110.2 million as at 31 December 2015 to uS$136.4 million as at 
31 December 2016. The increase was mainly due to a significant delay in 
VaT refunds in the second half of 2016 as a result of ongoing audits by the 
TRa on submitted VaT. We continue to engage with the TRa in order that 
they approve the payment of outstanding amounts as well as returning to 
the previously agreed timeline of three months for dealing with ongoing 
claims for refund.
outlook
The Group delivered another year of strong performance in 2016 and  
we expect that we will further improve on this in 2017 with production 
increasing to between 850,000 to 900,000 ounces at a lower aISC of 
between uS$880 to uS$920 per ounce. Cash costs per ounce are also 
expected to decline from uS$640 per ounce to between uS$580 to 
uS$620 per ounce in 2017. We expect production to increase through 
the year and as such we expect a production ratio of 45:55 in terms  
of the first half versus the second half of the year, which will have a 
commensurate impact on our cost profile and our cash generation. 
The further improvement in operating metrics is primarily driven by the 
revision to the mine plan at Buzwagi, where mining has been extended  
by approximately six months. This will lead to the mining of approximately 
2 million tonnes more of higher-grade ore during 2017 than previously 
planned and will drive a step up of approximately 40% in production over 
2016 and a reduction in aISC of up to 30%. 
at Bulyanhulu, we expect production to be in line with the previous year 
and aISC to reduce by up to 5%. We expect to see a reduction in cash 
costs, but will see an increase in sustaining capital as we invest to 
enhance the operation of the process plant and undertake a targeted 
fleet renewal programme to improve operating efficiencies amongst the 
older equipment within the underground fleet. We will continue to invest 
in underground development and in support of this will be upgrading 
ventilation and paste line infrastructure as we focus on creating greater 
flexibility underground. This investment in core infrastructure is a critical 
element in optimising the value delivery from this long life, high-grade 
asset in combination with continuing to drive cost savings and improve 
mining efficiencies.
North Mara performed ahead of expectations during 2016 and as a 
result we expect production to reduce by up to 10% during 2017 as an 
increased proportion of underground ore is sourced from the lower-grade 
West Zone which will offset the impact of the increase in underground 
tonnes mined. The reduction in production, together with an increase in 
capital spend as we invest in the delivery of increased underground 
mining rates, together with a step up in open pit waste stripping will 
mean that aISC will increase by up to 10%.
as a result of the investments into both Bulyanhulu and North Mara 
outlined above we expect to see capital expenditure in 2017 of between 
uS$210 to uS$230 million. This is comprised of approximately uS$75  
to uS$85 million of sustaining capital, uS$120 to uS$130 million of 
capitalised development/stripping and uS$15 million of expansion 
capital, made up predominantly of capitalised drilling at North Mara  
as we look to delineate additional Resources to support a ten-year life  
of mine producing in excess of 300,000 ounces per annum. 
as previously indicated, we plan to increase our greenfield exploration 
spend to approximately uS$25 million, as we look to build on the 
excellent progress made in Kenya during 2016 and we step up our 
exploration activity in Burkina Faso and Mali on our expanded land 
packages there. 
Finally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their commitment, 
enthusiasm and hard work throughout what has been a year of continued 
delivery at acacia. We have made further progress on the journey to 
making acacia a leader in africa and I am looking forward to an even 
better year in 2017. I would also like to thank our Board for their support 
and guidance through the year.

market price 
The market price of gold has a significant 
impact on acacia’s ability to generate  
cash flow. 
Gold price volatility continued to be elevated 
during 2016 with the gold price ranging from  
a high of uS$1,366 per ounce to a low of 
uS$1,077 per ounce and closing the year  
at uS$1,146 per ounce. Market gold prices 
averaged uS$1,251 per ounce in 2016,  
an 8% increase from the prior year average  
of uS$1,160. The price of gold was positively 
influenced during the year by global geopolitical 
uncertainty which led to considerable 
increases in exchange traded fund (‘ETF’) 
inflows which were partially offset by lacklustre 
physical demand in asia, particularly China and 
India. In December 2016, the uS Federal 
Reserve increased its interest rates by 0.25% 
which led to further uS dollar strength and gold 
weakness at the end of 2016.
copper
acacia also produces copper as a co-product 
which is recognised as a part of revenue. 
Copper traded between uS$1.96 and 
uS$2.69 per pound in 2016. The average 
market copper price for 2016 was uS$2.21 
compared to uS$2.49 per pound in 2015. 
The price of copper was negatively influenced 
during the year by weakening demand from 
China, the world’s largest consumer. 
fuel 
at our operations we consume diesel within 
our mobile mining fleet and to self-generate 
power when required. Diesel is refined from 
crude oil and is therefore subject to the same 
price volatility affecting crude oil prices and 
has a significant impact on our production 
costs. We consumed approximately 479,000 
barrels of diesel in 2016 (2015: 455,000). 
During 2016, Brent Crude oil traded between 
uS$28 and uS$57 per barrel and averaged 
uS$45 per barrel (2015: uS$54 per barrel). 
Crude oil has been impacted by increased 
supplies from OPEC and non-OPEC countries 
resulting in an oversupplied market. 
our re Spon Se
In early 2016, acacia undertook gold  
hedging, in order to mitigate the cash flow risk 
associated with the potential fall in the gold 
price on our Buzwagi mine. We have since 
halted gold hedging due to the significant 
improvement in the gold price in 2016 and 
positive market forecasts. acacia entered into 
zero cost collars that cover 75% and 26% of 
production from Buzwagi for 2016 and 2017 
(Q1 only) respectively with average floors of 
uS$1,150 and average ceilings of uS$1,290 
and uS$1,421 per ounce respectively. We are, 
and will remain, unhedged at Bulyanhulu and 
North Mara. 
During 2016, we also utilised an option collar 
strategy for copper production whereby 75% 
of our expected annual 2017 production was 
hedged at an average floor price of uS$2.30 
per pound and an average ceiling price of 
uS$2.78. We continue to monitor prices to 
target prices with floors above the current 
budget rates for 2018 production.
During 2016, we also utilised an option collar 
strategy to hedge 75% of our estimated 
diesel consumption at an average floor price 
of uS$72 per barrel and average ceiling price 
of uS$94 per barrel, resulting in a realised 
loss of uS$7.9 million. In 2016, we have 
continued this strategy and put in place 
protection on approximately 75% and 44%  
of our expected 2017 and 2018 consumption 
respectively, with average floors of uS$44 
and uS$35 and average ceilings of uS$74 
and uS$71 per barrel respectively. We will 
continue with our hedging programme  
during 2017.

Peak Tanzanian shilling:uS dollar exchange rate 
during 2016
currency depreciation
Emerging market currencies, including the 
Tanzanian shilling, remained particularly 
stable throughout 2016 due to their higher 
proportional exposure to the commodity 
markets. In Tanzania this led to a 1% fall in 
the value of the Tanzanian shilling over the 
year. approximately 15% of our cash costs  
are denominated in Tanzanian shillings and 
the impact of the exchange rate differential  
is yet to be removed through inflation. 
However, on the negative side, we also  
have uS$136 million of outstanding  
indirect tax receivables owed to acacia  
by the Government of Tanzania which are 
denominated in Tanzanian shillings. 
as acacia reports in dollars, these are 
re-valued each quarter and result in mark-to-
market gains or losses in proportion to the 
exchange rate changes. 
political developments
Following the October 2015 elections, the 
new Tanzanian Government has focused on 
reducing corruption, wasteful spending and 
reliance on foreign aid in order to be able  
to self-fund the national budget. To this aim, 
the current administration under President 
Magufuli has indicated their intention on 
focusing on domestic resource mobilisation, 
promising to double the monthly revenue 
collection over the next five years, and 
promising to create more jobs through 
engaging with the private sector. In addition, 
the President’s hardline approach to 
corruption has led to the dismissal of  
150 senior government officials, which  
has garnered widespread support of the 
electorate and is expected to improve 
Tanzania’s ranking in the Transparency 
International World Corruption Index, where  
it is currently 117
th
 out of 175 countries.
On 3 March 2017, the Ministry of Energy and 
Minerals imposed a ban on exports of gold/
copper concentrate following a directive made 
by the President of the united Republic of 
Tanzania. In 2016, gold/copper concentrate 
amounted to approximately 30% of Group 
revenues. acacia is currently seeking further 
clarification on this from the relevant 
Ministries and will take all of the necessary 
steps to resolve this as soon as possible.  
We will provide updates to the market 
as appropriate. 
taxation
acacia is a major contributor to the Tanzanian 
economy and during 2016 this contribution 
increased due to the agreement to pre-pay 
uS$20 million of cash corporate taxes which 
together with the strong performance at North 
Mara led to a total corporate tax charge of 
uS$55 million. In addition to this we paid 
royalties of uS$47 million, payroll taxes  
of uS$40 million and other taxes of 
approximately uS$20 million.
During 2016 there have continued to be  
a number of tax cases that are being dealt 
with in the court system in Tanzania which  
we are seeking to resolve. One of these, a 
Court of appeal ruling in respect of historic 
capital deductions at Bulyanhulu, North Mara 
and Tulawaka, led to the business recording  
a tax provision of uS$69.9 million in 2016. 
We are also dealing with claims to levy taxes 
in Tanzania on the uK registered acacia 
Mining plc which we believe have no basis  
in law given this company is tax resident and 
permanently established in the uK. Given the 
materiality of the amounts being claimed, we 
are also addressing a constructive resolution 
of these issues as part of our ongoing 
engagement with the Tanzania Revenue 
authority (‘TRa’) as well as at a senior  
level in the Government.

enhance these in the countries in which  
we operate. In Tanzania, we have started  
a nationwide programme to increase the 
awareness of our significant contribution  
to the country which is beginning to deliver 
results. We also continue to engage the 
relevant Government departments in order  
to achieve the appropriate support for our 
operations and to resolve some of the 
long-standing tax related issues, including  
the build-up of indirect taxes.

Gold production is the aggregate of the 
Group’s equity interest in gold ounces 
produced from our mines and one of the  
key measures used to track progress  
made in increasing our productivity levels.
performance 
Gold production was 829,705 ounces,  
13% higher than 2015, as a result of  
the range of improvements made within  
our operations. 
outlook and expectations 
We expect gold production in 2017 to 
increase to between 850,000 to 900,000 
ounces driven by improved performance  
at Buzwagi.

performance 
aISC for the year was uS$958 per ounce 
sold, 14% lower than 2015 driven by 
production and operating efficiencies.

progress towards our health and safety  
goal of zero harm. It is calculated as  
total reportable injuries multiplied by 
200,000 then divided by total number  
of hours worked.
performance 
Total reportable injury frequency rate 
(‘TRIFR’) was 0.74 for the year, compared  
to 0.68 in 2015. The disappointing increase 
was driven by performance at Bulyanhulu.
outlook and expectations 
We are targeting a reduction in our TRIFR

performance and operational reviews, as follows:
We conduct Group-level risk workshops to consider overall strategic risks 
to the business.
We conduct operational risk workshops focused on specific operational 
risks in the context of each of our operations.
We conduct functional risk workshops to assess key matters which 
could affect underlying support functions, such as treasury, tax, 
technical services and business improvement, required for our long-term 
business plans.
We ensure that principal risks are assessed as material components of 
our monthly operational and financial performance reporting.

Our annual business plan and budgeting process incorporate risks 
identified as a result of these reviews. Residual risks are identified 
based on the effectiveness of existing controls. The principal risks 
identified via this process are then monitored, assessed and reviewed 
throughout the year by the Executive Leadership Team in the first

respective remits of responsibility, and ultimately by the Board, as part

Principal risks and uncertainties
2016 principal risk review
For 2016 our principal risks have continued to 
fall within four broad categories: strategic risks, 
financial risks, external risks and operational 
risks. The makeup of our principal risks has not 
significantly changed throughout the year from 
those identified as principal risks in 2015. 
as a result of the review, at the end of 2016  
we viewed our principal risks as relating to  
the following: 
•	 Security, trespass and vandalism 
•	 Political, legal and regulatory developments 
•	 Safety risks relating to mining operations 
•	 Equipment effectiveness 
•	 Environmental hazards and rehabilitation 
•	 Implementation of enhanced operational 
systems 
•	 Continuity of power supply
•	 Significant changes to commodity prices 
•	 Single country risk 
The principal risk matrix opposite shows how  
we have allocated residual risk ratings across 
these principal risks for 2016. In addition, the 
table entitled principal risks and uncertainties 
overleaf sets out a description of each of our 
principal risks, along with commentary regarding 
management responsibility, Committee and 
Board oversight, relevance to strategy, 
mitigating action and key progress made in 
2016 for further information purposes. We  
also chart year-on-year trends and continuing 
impact assessments. In addition to those risks 
stated, there may be additional risks unknown 
to acacia and other risks, currently believed to 
be immaterial or that relate to the wider gold 
mining industry, that could turn out to be 
material to the Group. In this regard, we are 
currently assessing the impact of the ban 
imposed by the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy 
and Minerals on the export of gold/copper 
concentrate, announced on 3 March 2017, on 
our business over the short, medium and long 
term, as we look to obtain clarity on this from 
the relevant Ministries. For the time being, we 
have increased the potential impact of the 
political, legal and regulatory developments 
principal risk, when assessed against 2015. 
additional discussions of certain trends and 
uncertainties that may affect our operations are 
provided in other parts of this Strategic report.
assessment of viability
In addition to the risk management reviews 
we have also conducted additional reviews 
relating to business viability relevant to our 
assessment of acacia’s ongoing viability and 
the related confirmations required to be 
made in this regard.
accordingly, the Directors confirm that they 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
acacia Group will continue to operate and 
meet its liabilities, as they fall due, for the 
next three years. The Directors’ assessment 
has been made with reference to the acacia 
Group’s current position and prospects, its 
strategy and the acacia Group’s principal 
risks and how these are managed, with 
particular regard to those which are viewed 
as having the most relevance to acacia 
continuing in operation, when assessed in 
terms of financial and operational planning 
and impact over a three-year period, being: 
environmental hazards and rehabilitation; 
implementation of enhanced operational 
systems; significant change to commodity 
prices; political, legal and regulatory 
developments; safety risks relating to mining 
operations; and equipment effectiveness. 
Further details as regards these risks are 
provided in the principal risks and 
uncertainties table overleaf.
 
a three-year assessment period has  
been selected on the basis of the key 
components and criteria underpinning the 
acacia Group’s life of mine planning process. 
This process is built on a mine-by-mine basis 
using a detailed physical and financial model. 
It makes certain assumptions as regards  
the ongoing gold price environment and  
the performance level of each mine. Each 
component of the plan is then stress tested 
for market sensitivities as part of ongoing 
reviews. The key components of the plans, 
associated principal risks and relevant 
scenario testing to this planning process are 
reviewed by the Directors at least annually.  
In addition, the life of mine planning process 
is underpinned by regular Board briefings  
as part of ongoing periodic operational 
performance reviews and the discussion  
of any operational initiatives to be undertaken 
in the ordinary course of business.
The information relating to acacia’s 
performance included on pages 34 to  
59 (inclusive) of this annual Report is

operational risks
security, trespass and vandalism
acacia faces certain risks in dealing with fraud and corruption and wider security-related matters 
relating to trespass, vandalism, illegal mining and incursions and small-scale mining in proximity to 
its operations and on specific areas covered by the Group’s exploration and mining licences, all of 
which may have an adverse effect upon Group operations and financial condition. acacia is also at 
risk of being held legally responsible for violations of human rights as a result of the activities of our 
private security teams or the actions of government police forces in responding to serious security-
related risks in the areas of our operations.
COO/Head of Legal 
and Compliance
EHS&S acacia’s security management system adopts a range 
of measures to protect employees, assets, operations 
and people, including local communities, and is guided 
by the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights 
(‘VPSHR’). These measures include the implementation 
of security checks and procedures; infrastructure such as 
perimeter and asset fencing and surveillance equipment; 
contracts with private security providers and Memoranda 
of understanding with local police forces with clear 
expectations regarding respect for human rights;  
support for human rights training for private security 
personnel and the police; and human rights violation 
grievance processes.
•	 Continuing review of acacia’s 
security model and strategy.

safety risks relating to mining operations
Mining, particularly underground mining, is subject to a number of hazards and risks in the 
workplace, such as fall of ground relating to underlying geotechnical risks, potential fires and mobile 
equipment incidents. Despite mitigating measures implemented, such incidents may occur, which  
in turn may have adverse effects on safety in the workplace.
CEO/COO EHS&S acacia uses a wide range of safety management systems  
in order to safeguard safety in the workplace. We provide 
continuous training and supervision on safety management 
in order to promote and embed the use of safe  
operating practices.
•	 Continued enhancement 
of safety training initiatives.
•	 Continued enhancement of 
safety management systems 
and critical risk control 
standards for key operational 
safety risks.
•	 Continued safety audits  
and inspections.

implementation of enhanced operational systems
The achievement of acacia’s production and cost targets is dependent on the use of optimised 
operational systems that allow for increased productivity at lower cost levels. This includes the use 
of appropriate mine planning techniques with integrated financial modelling. The use of inefficient  
or redundant systems could undermine acacia’s ability to achieve future production and cost  
control objectives.
COO Board as part of ongoing business improvement initiatives, acacia 
is implementing various enhancements to planning and 
operating controls, procedures and frameworks in order to 
align operating systems and techniques with production  
and cost expectations.
•	 Enhancements made to 
mine planning reviews.
•	 Ongoing development of 
integrated mine planning 
systems.
 
 
High Please see  
the Strategic 
report and  
our Operating 
review.
equipment effectiveness
acacia’s mining, processing, development and exploration activities depend on the continuing 
availability and reliability of operational infrastructure and operating equipment. Interruptions  
or inefficiencies in the use of operating equipment, for example through equipment failure or 
disruption or through poor utilisation or maintenance practices, can undermine equipment 
utilisation levels and thereby negatively impact productivity levels.
COO Board Management assesses the critical components of acacia’s 
operational equipment on a continuous basis. In addition, 
management continues to review opportunities to enhance 
maintenance systems and equipment utilisation practices  
in order to enhance equipment productivity levels.
•	 Continuing enhancements to

environmental hazards and rehabilitation
acacia’s operations are subject to environmental hazards as a result of the processes and 
chemicals used in its extraction and production methods. acacia may be liable for losses and costs 
associated with environmental hazards at its operations, have its licences and permits withdrawn or 
suspended as a result of such hazards, or may be forced to undertake extensive clean-up and 
remediation action in respect of environmental hazards and incidents relating to its operations, 
should they occur.
COO EHS&S acacia uses a number of environmental management 
systems and controls across its business and operations to 
provide for appropriate environmental practices, including

operating performance
Gold production of 289,432 ounces was 6% 
above 2015, mainly driven by an 8% increase  
in run-of-mine head grade as underground 
mining grades improved, and a 3% increase in 
recovery, partly offset by 5% lower throughput 
due to the plant shutdown in Q3 2016. This 
was in combination with a 4% increase in 
production from reprocessed tailings as a 
result of increased throughput combined  
with an 8% increase in grade recovered.
Gold sold for the year of 279,286 ounces  
was 5% lower than production as a result of 
logistical delays related to concentrate 
shipments experienced in December 2016.
Copper production of 6.4 million pounds for the 
current year period was in line with 2015, as 
lower throughput was offset by improved 
copper grades. 
Cash costs of uS$722 per ounce sold were 9% 
lower than 2015 (uS$797/oz), mainly due to 
the higher production base (uS$64/oz), lower 
labour costs mainly driven by a reduction in 
headcount (uS$40/oz), partly offset by higher 
sales related costs due to higher volumes 
(uS$12/oz) and increased costs associated 
with self-generation of power given concerns 
around the impact of grid instability on process 
plant performance.
aISC per ounce sold for the year of uS$1,058 
was 16% lower than 2015 (uS$1,253/oz) 
driven by the impact of lower sustaining capital 
(uS$79/oz), lower cash costs (uS$75/oz,  
lower corporate administration expenditure 
(uS$28/oz) and the impact of the higher 
production base (uS$23/oz). This was  
partially offset by higher capitalised 
development costs (uS$12/oz). 
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments amounted to 
uS$84.6 million, 17% lower than 2015 
(uS$101.3 million), mainly driven by lower 
sustaining capital expenditure partly offset  
by higher capitalised development. Capital 
expenditure mainly consisted of capitalised 
underground development costs (uS$63.1 
million), investment in mobile equipment and 
component change-outs (uS$10.6 million), 
investment in tailings and infrastructure 
(uS$8.3 million) and investments in the  
winder upgrade (uS$2.0 million). 
In 2017, we expect to see an increase of 
uS$20 million in the level of sustaining capital 
incurred at the mine, predominantly driven by 
investment into enhancing the operation of the 
process plant and a targeted fleet renewal 
programme to improve operating efficiencies 
amongst the older equipment within the 
underground fleet. We also continue to invest 
in underground development and in support of 
this will be upgrading ventilation and paste line 
infrastructure as we focus on creating greater 
flexibility underground. This investment in core 
infrastructure is a critical element in optimising 
the value delivery from this long life, high-grade 
asset in combination with continuing to drive 
cost savings and improve mining efficiencies.

operating performance
Gold production for the full year of 161,830 
ounces was 5% lower than in 2015 due to a 
14% decrease in grade as a result of the focus 
on waste movement in the first half of the year 
and the mining of ore from lower-grade splay 
areas. This was partly offset by an 8% increase 
in throughput due to improved mill availability 
and improved milling rates. 
Total tonnes mined of 21.6 million tonnes were 
14% lower than 2015, primarily due to lower 
waste tonnes mined at Buzwagi as a result of 
the movement of rill material impacting on 
equipment productivity, in combination with 
general lower equipment availability.
Copper production of 9.8 million pounds for  
the year was 14% higher than the prior year 
period due to increased throughput and  
copper recovery rates, partly offset by  
lower copper grades.
Cash costs for the year of uS$1,031 per  
ounce sold were marginally lower than 2015, 
primarily driven by lower fuel costs due to  
lower global fuel prices and lower consumption 
(uS$51/oz), lower general and administration 
costs as a result of the optimisation of 
warehousing and logistics processes (uS$49/
oz), lower consumables costs primarily as a 
result of process plant improvements (uS$39/
oz) and lower labour costs as a result of a 
reduction in headcount (uS$26/oz). This  
was partially offset by the impact of the  
lower production base (uS$37/oz).
aISC per ounce sold of uS$1,095 was 8% 
lower than the prior year. This was mainly 
driven by lower capital expenditure (uS$54/oz), 
lower corporate administration expenditure 
(uS$26/oz) and lower cash costs (uS$15/oz).
Capital expenditure before reclamation 
adjustments of uS$3.6 million was 71%  
lower than 2015 (uS$12.3 million). Key  
capital expenditure for the year consists of 
investments in the tailings storage facility  
and infrastructure of uS$2.8 million and  
mobile equipment and component change-out 
costs of uS$0.2 million. 
In the first half of the year, we entered into  
zero cost collars in relation to the majority of 
our gold production from Buzwagi in 2016 and 
Q1 2017. In 2016, the agreements covered 
81,000 ounces of production and provided a 
guaranteed floor price of uS$1,150 per ounce 
and exposure to the gold price up to an average 
of uS$1,290 per ounce. In Q1 2017, the 
agreements cover 43,000 ounces, with an 
average floor price of uS$1,150 per ounce  
and a cap of uS$1,421 per ounce. 
During 2016, we assessed the potential to 
extend the mining of the open pit at Buzwagi 
and as a result now expect to continue mining 
until the end of 2017, followed by at least two 
years of processing stockpiles. The design 
changes have led to the deepening of the final 
pit by 35 metres, which adds 2 million tonnes 
of ore into the life of mine, amounting to 
152,000 ounces of additional production at 
negligible additional capital cost. The changes 
to the design of the pit include a narrower ramp 
with increased gradient in the final benches. 
The additional ore tonnes have a strip ratio of 
approximately 2:1 and we therefore expect 
total tonnes moved in the second half of the 
year to be substantially lower than H1. The 
additional mine life will lead to an increase  
of 40% in production from Buzwagi in 2017, 
with a 30% reduction in aISC which will drive 
significant free cash flow.

operating performance
Gold production for the full year of 378,443 
ounces was 32% higher than in 2015, and  
a record for the mine. This was a result of  
25% higher head grade driven by the higher 
contribution from the Gokona underground 
mine and a resultant 4% improvement in 
recoveries. Gold ounces sold for the full year  
of 376,255 ounces were 30% higher than the 
prior year and broadly in line with production.
The impact of the higher-grade underground 
ounces combined with an increase in the open 
pit mine grade at Nyabirama resulted in a  
head grade of 4.5g/t, 25% up from 2015.  
Cash costs of uS$410 per ounce sold were 
31% lower than 2015 (uS$590/oz), mainly 
driven by the higher production base (uS$121/
oz) and higher capitalisation of development 
costs at North Mara due to higher waste 
stripping at Nyabirama Stage 4 (uS$87/oz), 
partly offset by increased sales related costs 
as a result of higher sales volumes (uS$19/oz), 
higher contracted services (uS$14/oz) and 
higher maintenance costs (uS$8/oz). 
aISC of uS$733 per ounce sold was 20%  
lower than 2015 (uS$915/oz) primarily due to 
lower cash costs (uS$180/oz), the impact of 
increased sales volumes (uS$75/oz) and lower 
corporate administration expenditure (uS$16/
oz), partly offset by higher capitalised 
development costs (uS$72/oz) and higher 
sustaining capital expenditure (uS$23/oz).
Capital expenditure for the year before 
reclamation adjustments of uS$106.3 million 
was 54% higher than in 2015 (uS$69.0 
million). Key capital expenditure includes 
capitalised stripping costs (uS$57.1 million), 
investment in mobile equipment and 
component change-outs (uS$20.5 million), 
capitalised underground development costs 
(uS$18.5 million), and investment in tailings 
and infrastructure (uS$5.8 million). In addition, 
uS$4.8 million was spent on land acquisitions 
primarily around the Nyabirama open pit.  
Land acquisition costs are included in capital 
expenditure above as they are included in aISC 
but are treated as long-term prepayments in 
the balance sheet.

Overall, 2016 was a very successful year for 
exploration with the key highlights including 
our discovery of multiple high-grade 
mineralised prospects on the Liranda Corridor  
in Kenya and the delineation of more than  
40 multi-kilometre scale gold anomalies in  
the Houndé Belt in Burkina Faso and on  
the Senegal-Mali Shear Zone in Mali.

an extensive exploration programme was 
completed in 2016 which included the drilling 
of 70 diamond core (‘DD’) holes (40,600 
metres) and 44 reverse circulation holes (‘RC’) 
(4,438 metres). all of the drilling occurred  
on the Liranda Corridor in the north of the  
West Kenya Project focusing on the acacia  
and Bushiangala prospects. 
kakamega d ome camp
In prior years, diamond core drilling within the 
Liranda Corridor identified the Bushiangala  
and acacia prospects as having the highest 
short-term potential to host significant gold 
mineralisation within the 12km Liranda Corridor. 
Drilling confirmed steeply dipping east-
northeast striking mineralised shear zones with 
quartz veinlets, sulphides (pyrite + arsenopyrite 
+/- pyrrhotite +/- sphalerite +/- chalcopyrite, 
molybdenite) and alteration (carbonate +/- 
sericite +/- vanadium mica +/-silica). Significant 
intersections from this drilling included 2.5m @ 
25g/t, 4m @ 55g/t, 12.8m @ 15.3g/t and 
4.3m @ 6.48g/t and also indicated the 
potential for multiple mineralised structures on 
both the acacia and Bushiangala prospects.
In 2016 we commenced an extensive step out 
drilling programme targeting mineralisation 
from 100 metres to 700 metres vertical depth 
on the acacia shoot and from 100 metres to 
400 metres on the Bushiangala shoot. a total 
of 70 diamond holes for 40,600 metres were 
drilled in 2016 targeting extensions of 
mineralisation on the Bushiangala and acacia 
prospects, bringing the drilling on Liranda 
Corridor targets since 2014 to 44 RC holes for 
4,438 metres and 132 DD holes for 64,700 
metres. Better results received during H2 2016 
from the acacia and Bushiangala shoots 
included 6.8m @ 10.4g/t, 3.5m @ 12.3g/t, 
2.2m @ 126g/t, 3m @ 11.2g/t, 5.9m @ 
8.01g/t, 7m @ 17.6g/t, 4m @ 9.99g/t and 
1.1m @ 35.8g/t.
The DD results from the deeper drilling at 
acacia are very encouraging and show the 
potential for significant dip/down plunge 
extensions to mineralised zones. There are 
potential extensions at the Bushiangala 
prospect which remains open both laterally  
and vertically.
In Q3 2016, acacia acquired the remaining 49% 
of the main two tenements from afriOre (Lonmin) 
that form the majority of the West Kenya project 
for a consideration of uS$5 million. 
In Q1 2017, we declared an initial Inferred 
Resource of 1.31Moz at 12.1g/t on the acacia 
prospect within the Liranda Corridor. We are  
also continuing to drill step-out holes in order  
to fully understand the size of the existing 
mineralised zones (lateral and depth extensions) 
and targeting the expansion of the resource to in 
excess of 2 million ounces in 2017. The drilling 
will also seek to identify further high-grade 
structures, improve our understanding of 
high-grade controls and to infill gaps between 
holes in order to increase the confidence of the 
resource as we move through the year. We also 
plan to test further prospects within the Liranda 
Corridor along strike to the east within 3km of 
the acacia prospect. 
w est africa: water boreholes 2016
Insufficient access to water by communities 
living in rural areas of Bukina Faso and Mali  
is a well-known regional challenge, and is 
particularly acute in the remote communities 
where we explore. To provide access to clean 
and safe water for communities, acacia has 
drilled a number of water boreholes and will 
work with the community on initiatives to 
ensure the boreholes are sustainable in  
the long term.

South houndé joint venture: 50% 
In November 2014, acacia entered into an 
earn-in agreement with Sarama Resources Ltd 
(‘Sarama’) whereby acacia can earn an interest 
of up to 70% with the expenditure of uS$14 
million within four years, on the South Houndé 
Project (‘Project’) in Burkina Faso. acacia may 
increase its interest in the Project to 75% on 
satisfaction of certain conditions relating to 
resource delineation. During 2016, we continued 
to explore the Project taking our total spend 
since the inception of the JV to in excess of 
uS$7 million and thereby earned a 50% stake  
in the Project. We are now progressing through 
to Phase 2 of the agreement and have elected 
to exercise our right to act as Manager of the 
Project from the start of 2017.
In February 2016, Sarama declared an 
increase to the Inferred Resource on the 
Tankoro deposit of 600koz, taking the new 
Inferred Resource to 2.1Moz at 1.5g/t au. This 
was largely based on results from the entire 
2015 and early 2016 drill programmes. 
During the year, we completed exploration both 
within the existing Tankoro resource area and 
also on regional targets. a total of 17,229 
metres of aircore, 8,262 metres of RC and 
6,838 metres of DD drilling were completed 
during the year across a number of targets. In 
addition to this, we carried out regional auger 
geochemical drilling, infill soil geochemical 
sampling, and pole-dipole gradient array 
induced polarisation geophysical surveys to 
better define regional targets and gold 
anomalies. Results from drilling completed 
during 2016 continue to encourage with better 
results from the Tankoro resource area and 
prospects along the 15km trend including 8m 
@ 3.31g/t, 8m @ 3.97g/t, 5m @ 5.25g/t, 9m 
@ 3.39g/t, 16m @ 3.04g/t, 14m @ 4.12g/t, 
15m @ 7.44g/t, 14m @ 2.13g/t, 13.7m @ 
5.67g/t, 17.4m @ 5.88g/t, 2m @ 9.53g/t, 
12m @ 5.78g/t and 10m @ 7.15g/t.
a detailed structural study was undertaken by 
the JV during the year to assess the controls 
on higher-grade mineralisation within the 
resource, and resulted in the identification of 
interpreted oblique cross structures associated 
with discrete zones containing grades in excess 
of 5g/t. DD drilling to test one of these oblique 
structures returned high-grade results from 
DDH086 (17m @ 5.67g/t au from 428m), 
although lower-grade intersections were 
returned from two further holes drilled at the 
end of 2016. Drilling is ongoing in order to 
evaluate at least four interpreted high-grade 
gold shoots on the MM and MC Zones at 
Tankoro in order to initially scope out the 
upside potential of these higher-grade shoots. 
In 2017, the exploration budget for the South 
Houndé Project is uS$4 million, comprising  
a programme of 12,000 metres of DD  
drilling, 10,000 metres of reverse circulation 
drilling, and 28,000 metres of aircore drilling. 
additionally mapping, pole-dipole gradient array 
induced polarisation geophysical surveys and 
trenching will look to upgrade regional targets 
into drill targets. The aim of the Tankoro drilling 
programme is to add additional high-grade 
resources on MM and MC Trend resource areas 
in order to identify underground economic 
ounces to significantly impact the Tankoro 
resource, whilst the regional drilling programmes 
are designed to discover a new large-scale gold 
deposit, or at a minimum, several satellite ore 
bodies, capable of positively impacting the 
quality, size and economics of the global 
resources on the Project.

pinarello and konkolikan projects 
In March 2015 acacia increased its exploration 
footprint in the Houndé Belt entering into a joint 
venture with Canyon Resources on six 
exploration licences which are contiguous with 
other acacia joint venture properties and 
comprise the Pinarello and Konkolikan Projects. 
acacia recently earned a 75% interest in both 
projects through exploration expenditure of 
uS$1.5 million over the past two years and is 
advancing these projects to drill ready status. 
During 2016, we continued to undertake  
infill soil geochemical sampling programmes 
designed to better delineate regional gold-in-soil 
anomalies defined by wide spaced (1km) 
sampling programmes. We also acquired and 
completed interpretation of aSTER data and a 
high-resolution radiometric-magnetic survey. This 
data is currently being interpreted and integrated 
with mapping and soil geochemistry to assist 
with target generation, ranking and prioritisation. 
Three targets, namely Tankoro Corridor South 
West Extension, Dopala and Dafala prospects, 
were tested with wide-spaced reconnaissance 
aircore drill traverses (24,844 metres) during 
the year. Drill results from the few traverses 
drilled at Dopala and Dafala were largely 
disappointing and initial indications are that 
gold-in-soil anomalism is at least partly 
associated with a plethora of thin quartz veins 
within meta-sediments. Drilling results from the 
Tankoro Corridor Southern Extension prospect 
were much more encouraging and will require 
follow-up, with highlight results including 2m @ 
1.58g/t, 8m @ 0.51g/t, 8m @ 0.59g/t, 4m @ 
1.19g/t, 1m @ 4.85g/t, 9m @ 0.85g/t, 12m @

13m @ 0.89g/t and 8m @ 1.66g/t.
Work programmes during 2017 will consist of 
further regional aircore drilling across already 
delineated litho-structural corridors associated 
with gold-in-soil/multi-element geochemical 
anomalies and several geophysical targets.  
The 2017 budget includes in excess of 40,000 
metres of aC and 5,000 metres of RC drilling. 
central houndé jv p roject
The Central Houndé JV Project is a joint venture 
with Thor Explorations Ltd, and is a grassroots 
exploration project covering three exploration 
licences over an area of 474 square kilometres. 
acacia has earned 51% in the property and can 
earn up to 80% in the Project through exploration 
spend of uS$2 million in the next two years and 
the delivery of a pre-feasibility study.
The Central Houndé and the Konkolikan 
properties are contiguous with each other and 
cover part of a large north-south trending shear 
zone, the Ouango-Fitiri Shear Zone (‘OFSZ’), 
that extends from Ivory Coast in the south to 
the Houndé township in the north, more than 
200km. Extensive surface gold anomalies up 
to 5g/t have been identified across the 
projects from soil sampling.  
During the year, we completed infill soil sampling 
and followed this up with a gradient array induced 
polarisation geophysical survey and completed 
7,506 metres of RC and 3,156 metres of DD. Soil 
geochemical sampling surveys defined a very 
large gold anomaly, the Legue-Bongui “corridor” 
in the southeast of the Central Houndé JV 
project, extending over 10km north-south and 
3km east-west, with assay results up to 5g/t au. 
Initial RC and DD drilling has only focused on a 
small portion of the central Legue-Bongui Corridor 
with encouraging results including 5m @ 3.94g/t, 
2m @ 84.8g/t, 6m @ 3.74g/t, 12m @ 1.40g/t, 
19m @ 1.02g/t, 11m @ 1.49g/t, 7m @ 1.87g/t, 
2m @ 28.2g/t, 5m @ 1.51g/t, 18m @ 0.60g/t, 
25m @ 1.03g/t and 11m @ 0.40g/t. These 
results can be considered very encouraging  
as we are seeing both broad lower-grade gold 
mineralised zones associated with extensive 
zones of alteration as well as vein-controlled 
high-grade zones up to 84g/t. Gold anomalism 
has now been intersected in each fence of RC 
drilling (multiple holes per fence – 200 metres 
apart) striking in a north-north-west direction  
over a distance of 1.4km. 
Work programmes during 2017 will continue 
testing the plethora of existing surface 
geochemical targets, and the extensions  
of already identified mineralisation, and  
will include at least 10,000 metres of RC  
and DD drilling.
f rontier jv project
In June 2016, acacia entered into an 
agreement with a local Burkinabe company, 
Metalor Sa, the “Frontier Joint Venture”, which 
includes two licences immediately south of, 
and contiguous to, the Pinarello JV Project 
where soil sampling has identified multiple 
kilometre scale gold-in-soil anomalies. This  
JV added a further 500 square kilometres  
to acacia’s land package on the Houndé  
Belt, increasing the overall project area to 
approximately 2,700 square kilometres.  
The JV allows acacia to earn 100% of the 
project through certain staged option payments 
totalling uS$300,000 over 30 months. Metalor 
will hold a 1% NSR on production from the 
project should acacia identify and exploit an 
economic gold deposit, and acacia has the 
right to acquire the NSR from Metalor for  
uS$1 million at any future point in time. 
Historic reconnaissance soil sampling has 
already identified gold anomalism on the 
Frontier JV properties associated with 
interpreted regional shear zones along the 
contacts between granite intrusions and 
volcano-sedimentary lithologies. During 2016 
we have completed the acquisition and 
interpretation of aSTER and high-resolution 
airborne radiometric and magnetic data.

We have also commenced geological and 
regolith mapping and have embarked on a 
reconnaissance surface geochemical sampling 
programme. a total of 1,765 surface samples 
were collected during the period post wet 
season to end of year. 
Work during 2017 will consist of mapping, 
regional and infill geochemical sampling surveys, 
auger drilling, pitting and trenching, as well as 
approximately 10,000 metres of aircore drilling.
mali 
t intinba project
In June 2015, acacia began exploring in  
Mali when it acquired interests in the  
Tintinba Project by entering into an earn-in 
agreement with a local partner. The project 
comprises three exploration licences covering 
approximately 150 square kilometres within  
the Keneiba-Kedougou Window and along the 
world-class Senegal-Mali Shear Zone. 
Initial soil sampling programmes defined eight 
large multi-kilometre scale gold anomalies 
across the three permits. These gold 
anomalies are interpreted to be associated 
with second-order, northwest and northeast 
oriented, splay structures within the highly 
prospective Senegal-Mali Shear Zone (a  
several kilometre wide structural domain).
We have completed infill soil sampling and 
mapping prospective geology, structure, 
alteration and veining, and a number of the 
targets have associated artisanal workings. 
During the year we have completed a total of 
6,994 metres of RC drilling. Drilling comprised 
wide spaced fences on four of the anomalies 
– namely Tribala, Zadi, Bounbou and Baga. 
Results as expected for this type of broad 
reconnaissance work are mixed, however we 
are encouraged by results in particular from  
the Tribala and Zadi prospects. a gradient array 
induced polarisation survey commenced late 
2016 and is expected to be complete by early 
February 2017. Better results from the initial 
RC drilling include 19m @ 0.55g/t, 17m @ 
0.71g/t, 13m @ 0.50g/t, 25m @ 0.45g/t, 7m

28m @ 0.31g/t and 13m @ 1.11g/t.
Work during 2017 will comprise additional 
gradient array induced polarisation surveys, 
mapping and at least 10,000 metres of RC 
drilling to test existing and new targets. Post 
period-end we saw two additional licences 
being assigned which will bring the land 
package to approximately 200km

nyanzaga project
In September 2015, acacia entered into an 
earn-in joint venture with OreCorp Limited  
(aSx: ORR) to progress the Nyanzaga Project, 
whereby OreCorp took over management of the 
project for a three-year period. This structure 
allows the project to be progressed whilst giving 
acacia the option to maintain a 75% stake in the 
project once it gets to a development decision. 
OreCorp have continued to progress the project 
and during the year released the positive results 
of a scoping study which outlined a combined 
open pit and underground project that produces 
2.4 million ounces of gold over a 13-year life at 
an aISC of uS$798/oz and requires pre-
production capital of uS$248 million (inclusive 
of contingency). The full study can be found on 
OreCorp’s website, www.orecorp.com.au. Due 
to the positive results in the scoping study, 
OreCorp are undertaking a pre-feasibility study 
into the project which is expected to be 
complete in H1 2017.
brownfield projects
In 2016, brownfield exploration was focused  
on the Nyabirama ore body at North Mara 
where surface diamond core drilling targeted 
extensions to the high-grade mineralised 
system below the planned final pit. The surface 
drilling demonstrated the potential for further 
resource potential up to 700 metres down-
plunge from the final Stage 4 pit. underground 
drilling also continued on the Reef 2 series  
at Bulyanhulu with mixed results to date.

During late 2016 we completed a drilling 
programme of 14 holes for 9,940 metres of 
surface DD drilling adjacent to the Nyabirama 
pit primarily designed to test the underground 
potential beneath the final Stage 4 pit. The 
drilling was designed to test the interpreted 
down-dip and plunge extensions of high-grade 
quartz-vein lode structures, and the use of core 
drilling was designed to help with an enhanced 
structural understanding of the geological 
model and controls on high-grade structures.

including 1m @ 320 g/t au from 536m
The results of the drilling are considered  
very encouraging and led to the design of  
an additional ten hole programme to further 
extend the identified mineralisation. This 
programme has already commenced and 
consists of approximately 8,000 metres of  
DD drilling and has already confirmed 
mineralisation down to 700m down-plunge  
of the open pit. It will cost approximately  
uS$2 million to drill and should be completed 
in Q1 2017. 
We have also budgeted a further 25,000 
metres of resource definition drilling for 2017 
and 2018 for approximately uS$5 million,  
of which we expect to drill approximately 
15,000 metres in 2017. If the results of  
these programmes are successful, they will  
be incorporated into a desktop study designed 
to assess the best option of providing 
underground drill access points in 2018 to 
further test the system with the goal of 
commencing underground mining operations 
before the completion of the open pit in 2021.
gokona underground 
Exploration activity during 2016 at Gokona 
underground was limited to desktop work 
whilst the mine updated the current geological 
model and installed drilling platforms to 
support the 2017 and 2018 planned 
programmes. These programmes have been 
designed to test the lateral extensions of the 
ore body and to infill the known mineralisation 
at depth. The programme will comprise 
approximately 75,000 metres of drilling over 
the next two years, with approximately 45,000 
metres to be drilled in 2017. The aim of these 
programmes is to be able to increase the 
underground life of mine to at least ten years. 
bulyanhulu
We undertook three drill programmes in Reef 2 
at Bulyanhulu in 2016 for 37,375 metres, 
primarily focused on enhancing our 
understanding of the existing Reef 2 system. 
The first two programmes were designed to 
infill existing resources in the upper east zone 
and the central zone on Reef 2 to test whether 
the current drill spacing across the Reef 2 
series is appropriate. The Reef 2 upper east 
zone was an area removed from the mine plan 
late in 2015 following poor results from infill 
drilling, and negative results from an economic 
re-evaluation during the reserves process.  
The Reef 2 central zone is an area that is near 
existing infrastructure and had the potential  
to be brought into the mine plan earlier than 
previously planned. The 2016 preliminary 
results from central zone have increased 
confidence and early indications are showing 
potential for a modest increase in resource 
ounces, counter balancing the previous losses 
from Reef 2 upper east area. as a result, Reef 
2 central has now been brought forward in the 
new mine plan. 
as a result of the closer spaced drilling, 
variography has shown that the continuity of 
thickness and grade is less than previously 
thought for the Reef 2 series. The previous 100 
metre search radius is no longer considered 
appropriate and has been reduced to 50 
metres for Indicated Resource classification. 
This has meant that some ounces previously 
classified as Probable Reserve (based on the 
underlying Indicated Resource) have now 
largely been moved to Inferred Resource.  
We are undertaking drilling programmes during 
2017, primarily in the central zone on Reef 2,  
to reduce the drill spacing in order to upgrade 
the current resource there. We will continue a 
programme of infilling the Reef 2 series in 
available areas over the coming years. 
The third programme of drilling in the Western 
step out area continued to intersect high-grade 
mineralisation on Reefs 2M and 2I however 
generally widths have been narrower than  
the eastern part of the system. The current 
resource extension drill programme will be 
completed in early 2017 and results, together 
with future access requirements which  
are currently constraining drilling, will be 
incorporated into future planned resource 
extension programmes.

into a 21% increase in revenues  
and a doubling of EBITDa over  
the previous year.”
Introduction
Continued cost discipline in combination with  
strong operational performance and an improved gold 
price in 2016 is reflected in strong cash generation, 
with net cash increasing by uS$112.9 million to 
uS$218.5 million as at 31 December 2016. at the 
same time, reported earnings increased significantly, 
but were impacted by an increase in tax provisions  
of uS$69.9 million recorded in Q1 2016 relating to 
court rulings regarding prior year tax assessments. 
This is reflected in the acacia Group’s financial 
results for the year ended 31 December 2016:
Revenue of uS$1,053.5 million was uS$185.4 million higher than 2015 
driven by the 13% higher sales volumes.
Cash costs decreased to uS$640 per ounce sold from uS$772 per 
ounce sold in 2015, driven by the higher production base, higher 
capitalisation of development costs, lower labour costs and lower energy 
and fuel costs, partly offset by higher sales related costs and increased 
contracted services costs. 
aISC at uS$958 per ounce sold was 14% lower than in 2015 (uS$1,112 
per ounce sold), mainly due to lower cash costs and the higher 
production base.
EBITDa increased by 137% to uS$415.4 million, mainly driven by the 
higher sales volumes, a higher gold price and lower corporate 
administration costs. 
Higher tax expense of uS$147.1 million compared to the prior year 
expense of uS$73.0 million, driven by an increase in current corporate 
tax as a result of North Mara’s increased profitability (uS$54.5 million), 
adjustments in respect of provisions for uncertain tax positions relating 
to prior years for North Mara and Tulawaka (uS$36.7 million) and 
deferred tax of uS$55.9 million driven by provisions for uncertain tax 
positions for Bulyanhulu (uS$35.0 million) and movements in temporary 
differences (uS$20.9 million).
as a result of the above, we achieved a profit of uS$94.9 million, 
compared to a loss of uS$197.1 million in 2015. In addition, 2015 
included impairment charges of uS$146 million.
adjusted net earnings of uS$161.0 million were uS$154.2 million higher 
than 2015. adjusted earnings per share amounted to uS39.2 cents, up 
from uS1.7 cents in 2015.
Operational cash flow of uS$318.0 million doubled from 2015, primarily 
as a result of higher gold sales volumes and prices driving higher 
revenue, partly offset by unfavourable working capital outflows due to 
share-based payments, an increase in accounts receivable, and 
payments of uS$40.9 million relating to prepaid and provisional 
corporate tax relating to North Mara.

The following review provides a detailed analysis of our consolidated results for  
12 months ended 31 December 2016 and the main factors affecting financial 
performance. It should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated  
financial statements and accompanying notes on pages 109 to 156, which have  
been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  
as adopted for use in the European union (‘IFRS’). 
revenue
Revenue for 2016 of uS$1,053.5 million was uS$185.4 million higher than 2015  
due to a 13% increase in gold sales volumes (95,540 ounces) combined with a 7% 
increase in the average net realised gold price from uS$1,154 per ounce sold in 
2015 to uS$1,240 in 2016. 
The net realised gold price for the year of uS$1,240/oz was uS$11/oz lower than the 
average market price of uS$1,251/oz due to the timing of sales. Realised losses on 
Buzwagi related gold hedges were uS$1.8 million for the year, an impact of uS$2 per 
ounce sold.
Included in total revenue is co-product revenue of uS$39.1 million for 2016, 10% 
higher than the prior year period (uS$35.7 million). The 2016 average realised copper 
price of uS$2.21 per pound compared unfavourably to that of 2015 (uS$2.33 per 
pound), and was driven by the lower market price for copper. This was offset by an 
11% increase in copper sales volumes mainly from Buzwagi.
cost of sales
Cost of sales was uS$727.1 million for 2016, representing a decrease of 1% on the 
prior year period (uS$734.1 million). The key aspects impacting the cost of sales  
for the year include an 8% reduction in direct mining costs, partly offset by higher 
depreciation and amortisation costs as a result of the higher production base and 
higher sales related costs as a result of higher sales volumes.
The table below provides a breakdown of cost of sales:

central costs
Total central costs amounted to uS$51.8 
million for 2016, a 30% increase on 2015 
(uS$40.0 million) mainly driven by an increased 
share-based payment expense as a result  
of the stronger share price performance 
compared to 2015, specifically when compared 
to our peers and the global mining index, 
impacting on the valuation of future share-
based payment liabilities to employees. 
acacia’s share price increased by 108% 
compared to 2015. This was partly offset by 
36% lower corporate administration costs as a 
result of the corporate office restructuring and 
cost saving initiatives mainly around personnel 
cost, consulting fees, professional services 
and overall lower general administration costs.

exploration and evaluation costs
Exploration and evaluation costs of uS$24.0 
million were incurred in 2016, 22% higher than 
the uS$19.8 million spent in 2015. The key 
focus areas for the period were greenfield 
exploration programmes in West Kenya 
amounting to uS$10.6 million, greenfield 
exploration programmes in West africa 
amounting to uS$7.5 million and brownfield 
exploration at Bulyanhulu of uS$3.5 million.
corporate social responsibility expenses
Corporate social responsibility costs incurred 
for 2016 amounted to uS$10.7 million 
compared to the prior year of uS$12.9 million. 
Corporate social responsibility overheads and 
central initiatives in 2016 amounted to uS$4.5 
million, compared to uS$5.3 million in 2015. 
General community projects funded from the 
acacia Maendeleo Fund amounted to uS$6.1 
million, which was uS$1.4 million lower than  
in 2015.
a detailed breakdown of direct mining expenses is shown in the table below:

Capitalised mining costs (137,846) (117,961)
total direct mining costs 479,022 520,943
Gross direct mining costs of uS$616.9 million for 2016 were 3% lower than 2015 (uS$638.9 
million). The overall reduction was driven by the following:
•	 a 17% reduction in labour costs, mainly as a result of a 28% reduction in international 
employees and a 21% reduction in national employees across sites, driven by localisation 
efforts and restructuring, combined with savings associated with local labour costs given  
the devaluation of the Tanzanian shilling to the dollar. 
•	 an 11% reduction in energy and fuel expenses across all sites due to lower global fuel prices, 
lower consumption and the impact of a favourable exchange rate on locally purchased power  
as well as increased reliance on the national electricity grid resulting in lower self-generation.
•	 a 3% decrease in consumables costs mainly at Buzwagi due to lower reagents and chemicals 
costs as a result of lower cyanide usage, lower grinding media costs driven by the optimised 
usage of grinding balls, lower explosives costs driven by improved blasting practice and the 
overall impact of lower negotiated prices on key consumables.
•	 a 4% decrease in general administration costs mainly at Buzwagi as a result of lower 
warehousing and logistics expenditure.
This was partially offset by:
•	 an 8% increase in contracted services mainly as a result of increased underground mining 
activity at North Mara as a result of the ramp up in underground production, combined with 
increased maintenance contractor charges at Buzwagi. 
•	 a 4% increase in maintenance costs mainly at Buzwagi and North Mara driven by higher 
maintenance supplies as a result of major component change-outs and increased equipment 
breakdowns.
Capitalised direct mining costs, consisting of capitalised development costs and investment in 
inventory, are made up as follows:

Drawdown of/(investment in) inventory (17,941) (29,743)
total capitalised direct mining costs (137,846) (117,961)
Capitalised development costs were 36% higher than 2015, mainly driven by increased capitalised 
waste stripping costs related to the Nyabirama pit at North Mara. The investment in inventory was 
uS$17.9 million, 40% lower than in 2015 due to an increased proportion of costs allocated to cost 
of sales as a result of an overall lower average cost valuation given lower operating costs, partially 
offset by an increased build-up of ore stockpiles at Buzwagi.
48 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 other income
Other income in 2016 amounted to uS$11.6 
million, compared to an expense of uS$28.1 
million in 2015. The main contributors include 
acacia’s ongoing programme of zero cost collar 
contracts to mitigate the negative impact of 
copper, rand and fuel market volatility. In 
combination with zero cost collars relating  
to Buzwagi gold production, which resulted in  
a combined mark-to-market revaluation gain  
of uS$13.0 million (as these arrangements  
do not qualify for hedge accounting these 
unrealised gains are recorded through profit 
and loss) and a reversal of indirect tax 
discounting provisions of uS$9.7 million as a 
result of increased profitability which positively 
impacted the recoverability of the MOS indirect 
tax receivable. The income was partly offset by 
(i) retrenchment costs of uS$6.9 million, (ii) 
legal costs of uS$2.6 million, (iii) disallowed 
indirect taxes of uS$1.5 million and (iv) other 
costs of uS$4.8 million. 
f inance expense and income
Finance expense of uS$11.0 million for 2016 
was 12% lower than in 2015 (uS$12.6 million). 
The key components were borrowing costs 
relating to the Bulyanhulu CIL facility (uS$4.6 
million) which were lower than the prior year 
due to a lower outstanding facility following  
the repayments, lower accretion expenses of 
uS$2.3 million relating to the discounting of 
the environmental reclamation liability and 
uS$2.1 million relating to the servicing of  
the uS$150 million undrawn revolving credit 
facility. Other costs include bank charges  
and interest on finance leases.
Finance income relates predominantly to 
interest charged on non-current receivables 
and interest received on money market funds. 
Refer to Note 11 of the consolidated financial 
statements, for details.
taxation matters
The total income tax charge was uS$147.1 
million compared to the prior year expense of 
uS$73.0 million. The current tax charge of 
uS$91.2 million (2015: zero) was made up of 
current year income tax for North Mara, driven 
by year-to-date profitability of uS$54.5 million 
and provisions for uncertain tax positions in 
respect of prior years raised for North Mara 
(uS$30.4 million) and Tulawaka (uS$4.4 
million) as a result of adverse tax rulings in Q1 
2016. The deferred tax charge of uS$55.9 
million (2015: uS$73.0 million) reflects 
provisions for uncertain tax positions raised  
in Q1 2016 for Bulyanhulu (uS$35.0 million) 
and movements in temporary differences of 
uS$20.9 million. The effective tax rate in 2016 
amounted to 61% compared to 59% in 2015. 
net earnings and earnings per share
as a result of the factors discussed above,  
net earnings for 2016 were uS$94.9 million, 
against the prior year loss of uS$197.1 million 
which include impairment charges of  
uS$146.2 million. 
Earnings per share for 2016 amounted to 
uS23.2 cents, an increase of uS71.3 cents 
from the prior year loss per share of uS48.1 
cents. The increase was driven by the higher 
earnings, with no change in the underlying 
issued shares. 
adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings 
per share
adjusted net earnings for the year was 
uS$161.0 million compared to uS$6.8 million 
in 2015. Net earnings in the year as described 
above have been adjusted for the impact of 
items such as prior year tax provisions, 
discounting of indirect tax receivables, 
restructuring costs, insurance proceeds  
as well as legal settlements. Refer to  
page 178 for reconciliation between net  
profit and adjusted net earnings.
adjusted earnings per share for 2016 
amounted to uS39.2 cents, an increase of 
uS37.5 cents from the prior year adjusted 
earnings per share of uS1.7 cents.
f inancial position
acacia had cash and cash equivalents on  
hand of uS$317.8 million as at 31 December 
2016 (uS$233.3 million as at 31 December 
2015). The Group’s cash and cash equivalents 
are with counterparties whom the Group 
considers to have an appropriate credit rating. 
Location of credit risk is determined by physical 
location of the bank branch or counterparty. 
Investments are held mainly in united States 
dollars, with cash and cash equivalents in  
other foreign currencies maintained for 
operational requirements. 
During 2013, a uS$142 million facility 
(‘Facility’) was put in place to fund the bulk of 
the costs of the construction of the Bulyanhulu 
tailings retreatment project (‘Project’). The 
Facility is collateralised by the Project, and has 
a term of seven years with a spread over LIBOR 
of 250 basis points. The seven-year Facility is 
repayable in equal instalments (bi-annual)  
over the term of the Facility, after a two-year 
repayment holiday period. The interest rate  
has been fixed at 3.6% through the use of an 
interest rate swap. The full facility of uS$142 
million was drawn in 2013. During 2016, the 
second and third repayments amounting to 
uS$28.4 million in total were made. at 31 
December 2016, the outstanding capital 
balance is uS$99.4 million (31 December 
2015: uS$127.8 million).
The above complements the existing undrawn 
revolving credit facility of uS$150 million, which 
runs until November 2019.
The net book value of property, plant and 
equipment increased from uS$1.39 billion  
as at 31 December 2015 to uS$1.44 billion  
as at 31 December 2016. The main capital 
expenditure drivers have been explained  
above, and have been offset by depreciation 
charges of uS$163.8 million. Refer to Note 19 
of the consolidated financial statements, for 
further details.
Total indirect tax receivables increased from 
uS$110.2 million as at 31 December 2015 to 
uS$136.4 million as at 31 December 2016. 
The increase was mainly due to a significant 
delay in VaT refunds in 2016 as a result of 
ongoing audits by the Tanzanian Revenue 
authority on submitted VaT returns and a 
reduction in the discounting provision for  
MOS indirect tax receivables of uS$9.7 million. 
Our gross increase in receivables, before the 
corporate tax prepayment offset, amounted  
to uS$64.8 million. This was partly offset by 
corporate tax prepayments of uS$20.0 million 
and provisional tax payments of uS$20.9 
million, with the net increase in receivables 
being uS$26.2 million. 
The net deferred tax position increased from a 
liability of uS$84.0 million as at 31 December 
2015 to a liability of uS$140.0 million as at  
31 December 2016. This was mainly as a 
result of the tax provisions raised in Q1 2016 
as discussed above which utilised some of the 
carry forward losses and movements in 
temporary differences.
Net assets increased from uS$1.79 billion as 
at 31 December 2015 to uS$1.85 billion as at 
31 December 2016. The increase reflects the 
current year income of uS$95.0 million, the 
payment of the final 2015 dividend of uS$11.5 
million and the payment of the 2016 interim 
dividend of uS$8.1 million.

Cash flow from operating activities was uS$318.0 million for 2016, an increase of uS$161.5 
million from 2015 (uS$156.5 million). The increase relates to a higher operating profit due to 
higher gold sales volumes and lower operating costs, partly offset by unfavourable working capital 
outflows of uS$17.6 million compared to outflows of uS$4.8 million in 2015 and the impact of 
higher non-cash expenses of uS$23.9 million, which include unrealised gains on derivatives of 
uS$13.0 million and discounting of indirect taxes of uS$9.7 million. This was further offset by 
provisional income tax paid of uS$20.9 million, and a uS$20.0 million prepayment of corporate 
tax as agreed with the Tanzanian Government.
The working capital outflow relates to cash share-based payments of uS$36.0 million offset by 
non-cash revaluation charges of future share-based payments of uS$29.9 million, a net increase 
in indirect tax receivables on a cash basis of uS$17.5 million and a net increase in inventories on 
hand of uS$8.3 million due to the higher production base and timing of sales, which was offset by 
an increase in payables of uS$15.9 million due to the timing of payments. 
Cash flow used in investing activities was uS$185.2 million for 2016, an increase of 2% when 
compared to 2015 (uS$181.4 million), driven by higher capitalised development mainly at North 
Mara, partly offset by lower sustaining capital expenditure at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi.

Sustaining capital
Sustaining capital expenditure includes 
investments in tailings and infrastructure 
(uS$16.8 million), investment in mobile 
equipment and component change-outs 
(uS$31.3 million), investment in the Bulyanhulu 
winder upgrade (uS$2.0 million) and other 
sustaining capital expenditure across sites  
of uS$5.4 million. During the year, capital 
accruals from December 2015 of uS$2.5 
million were paid.
capitalised development
Capitalised development includes North Mara 
capitalised stripping costs (uS$57.1 million) and 
capitalised underground development (uS$18.5 
million) and Bulyanhulu capitalised underground 
development costs (uS$63.1 million).
expansionary capital
Expansionary capital expenditure consisted 
mainly of capitalised expansion drilling at  
North Mara (uS$2.4 million) and Bulyanhulu 
(uS$1.3 million). 
non-cash capital
Non-cash capital was uS$19.5 million  
and consisted mainly of reclamation asset 
adjustments (uS$22.0 million) and a  
decrease in capital accruals (uS$2.5 million). 
The reclamation adjustments were driven  
by changes in uS risk free rates driving  
lower discount rates and increased  
closure costs assumptions.
other investing capital
During 2016 North Mara incurred land 
purchases totalling uS$4.8 million (2015: 
uS$6.4 million). 
Cash flow used in financing activities for 2016 
was uS$48.0 million, an increase of uS$15.7 
million from uS$32.3 million in 2015. The 
outflow relates to payment of the final 2015 
dividend of uS$11.5 million, the 2016 interim 
dividend of uS$8.1 million and the payment  
of the second and third instalments of the 
borrowings related to the Bulyanhulu CIL facility 
totalling uS$28.4 million.
dividend
The final 2015 dividend of uS2.8 cents per 
share was paid to shareholders on 27 May 
2016 and the interim dividend of uS2.0 cents 
per share was paid to shareholders on 25 
September 2016. The Board of Directors have 
recommended a final dividend for 2016 of 
uS8.4 cents per share, payable to 
shareholders in May 2017.

going concern statement
acacia Group’s business activities, together 
with factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, are 
set out in the operational and financial review 
sections of this annual report. The financial 
position of acacia Group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the preceding paragraphs of this 
financial review.
at 31 December 2016, the Group had cash and 
cash equivalents of uS$317.8 million with a 
further uS$150 million available under the 
undrawn revolving credit facility which remains 
in place until November 2019. Total borrowings 
at the end of the period amounted to uS$99.4 
million, of which uS$28.4 million will be paid in 
2017. Included in other current assets are 
amounts due to the Group relating to indirect 
taxes of uS$128 million which are expected to 
be received or recovered within 12 months, but 
these will be offset to an extent by new claims 
submitted for input taxes incurred during 2017. 
The refunds remain dependent on processing 
and payments of refunds by the Government  
of Tanzania.
In assessing acacia Group’s going concern 
status the Directors have taken into account the 
above factors, including the financial position of 
acacia Group and in particular its significant 
cash position, the current gold and copper price 
and market expectations for the same in the 
medium term, and acacia Group’s capital 
expenditure and financing plans. after making 
appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.

W e aim to contribute to socio-economic 
development in the areas in which we 
operate through ongoing stakeholder 
engagement and participation.
acacia’s direct economic contribution is  
made up of the economic value we add by 
paying our employees, governments, suppliers, 
shareholders, contractors and communities. 
However, our true economic contribution is  
far greater once the wider effects of our 
presence are considered. These include  
the indirect effects of people spending their  
wages, governments distributing tax and royalty 
revenues, and neighbouring communities using 
the infrastructure developed for our operations. 
Our direct economic contribution in 2016 was 
uS$911 million compared to uS$889 million  
in 2015.
The distribution of acacia’s taxes includes 
royalties, indirect taxes (withholding taxes and 
non-claimable VaT), payroll taxes (inclusive  
of social security payments and other taxes), 
stamp duties, local service levies and 
environmental levies. Geographically, the 
majority of our taxes are paid in Tanzania, being 
the location of our operating mines. Our net 
taxation contribution was uS$164 million in 
2016, compared to uS$103 million in 2014, 
mainly as a result of the uS$55 million of 
corporate taxes incurred in 2016.

In addition to rolling out the strategy, we 
continued to deliver development projects  
in key sectors such as education, social 
infrastructure, health, water and sanitation  
and sports and culture. During the year we 
implemented 58 community initiatives to  
the value of uS$6.1 million across all our 
operating mine sites in Tanzania through  
the Maendeleo Fund with a total CSR-related 
spend of uS$10.7 million. Some of the key 
initiatives included:
•	 a partnership with the Benjamin Mkapa 
Foundation for a maternal and child health 
programme for communities around 
Bulyanhulu;
•	 construction of a 12.5km compacted 
laterite road to connect Chapulwa, Mwime 
and Mwendakulima in Buzwagi; and
•	 extension of the Kerende health facility  
in North Mara.
We have invested significantly in the education 
sector around our mine sites over the years  
by contributing to the development of school 
infrastructure, student sponsorships, school 
clubs and vocational training. In 2016 alone, 
we invested over uS$2.6 million in education 
projects in our zone of influence. The 
importance of this sector in our communities 
cannot be over emphasised and during 2016, 
we also supported over 2,500 school children 
with school uniforms and learning materials 
through our partnership with CanEducate, a 
Canadian non-profit NGO. 
We also contributed to adding classrooms to 
several schools in communities and donated 
over 11,500 desks around our mine sites in 
line with government priorities of ensuring 
every child has a desk. In order to be more 
effective in our delivery in the education sector, 
we conducted an Education Scoping Study 
which was designed to inform our efforts to 
enhance educational outcomes. The study 
found that there is a substantial increase in 
school enrolment in both primary and 
secondary schools in the districts within our 
zone of influence. However, there was a 
shortage of qualified and motivated teachers 
which impacted the learning outcomes of the 
students. In 2017, we plan to explore ways of 
addressing some of these challenges through 
partnerships as recommended by the study 
team and in alignment with our sustainable 
communities strategy. 
progressive rehabilitation at n orth mara
Land rehabilitation is carried out as part of an integral 
closure process. Progressive rehabilitation is carried out at 
North Mara, a practice globally recognised as industry best 
practice from both environmental and financial perspectives. 
after completion of mining at the Nyabigena East pit, 
backfilling of 45 vertical metres was completed using waste 
rock, a clay layer and topsoil for vegetation growth. Re-
vegetation took place in 2016, using 20,000 tree seedlings of 
14 local tree species. Selection of tree species was done in 
consultation with the local community to ensure they are in 
agreement with the final land use of the area. The overarching 
objective for the area is to achieve a stable ecological state 
while meeting stakeholders’ needs for the land which include 
some commercial produce, beekeeping and timber production. 
Sustainable communities
Our focus for 2016 was to begin to implement 
our new sustainable communities strategy 
which aims to contribute to the development  
of “sustainable communities” that enjoy a 
thriving local economy, have access to social 
infrastructure and live in a safe and inclusive 
environment achieved through transparent 
stakeholder engagements. The strategy seeks 
to align its activities to local development  
plans and work through partnerships to meet 
the needs of the communities. We see our  
role as supporting the local communities  
and government in their efforts to achieve 
sustainable development and thus our  
strategy is aligned to the uN Sustainable 
Development Goals (‘SDGs’). 
Some of the key highlights of rolling out our 
new strategy included:
•	 internal and external consultations  
to seek buy-in for the strategy; 
•	 assessment of all existing projects to 
determine status and identify priorities;
•	 project management and approval 
processes were strengthened; 
•	 emphasis on measuring performance of 
initiatives at outcomes and impacts level; 
and
•	 recruitment of a General Manager,

54 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 as part of our ongoing activities to build 
community cohesion, our annual Mahusiano 
Sports Bonanza was held at all three mine sites 
in Tanzania. apart from the sporting activities, 
the Bonanza offered an opportunity for local 
businesses to market their businesses and 
transact with the participants. Our partnership 
with Sunderland Football Club continued and 140 
coaches were trained and reached approximately 
200 school children who participated in the 
coaching clinics. The training is multi-sport and 
covers other sports such as netball that are 
popular in the communities.
as we transitioned our community development 
activities to suit our sustainable communities 
strategy, we focused our efforts on completing 
some of our legacy projects in 2016. These 
mainly comprised commitments or obligations 
we have made to our communities. We planned 
to deliver all these commitments over a period 
of two years (2016-2017). Significant progress 
has been made to complete these projects – 
North Mara, for example, completed 80% of its 
2016 planned obligated projects. We plan to 
deliver the remaining committed projects at all 
sites in alignment with our strategy in 2017.
In 2016, we continued to work with Search for 
Common Ground (‘SFCG’), an international 
non-profit organisation aimed at transforming 
conflict and adversarial interactions into 
collaborative problem-solving relationships. 
Through its Sustainable Business Practice 
programme, we have been working with SFCG 
since 2011. In 2016 alone, SFCG conducted 
over 2,700 multistakeholder meetings and 
townhalls which reached over 11,500 
stakeholders around all our mining operations. 
In addition, they trained approximately 950 
policemen and women in the Voluntary 
Principles on Security and Human Rights 
(‘VPSHR’). all these interactions have 
significantly improved the relationships between 
our mining operations and the stakeholders as 
measured through the community perception 
surveys carried out periodically by SFCG. 
bulyanhulu support for geita r egion 
School desks while promoting local 
business
In January 2016, the Tanzanian government 
introduced the Free Education for all policy, 
which has led to a surge in school enrolment at 
primary and secondary schools. Despite the 
success of this policy from an access 
perspective, it has put pressure on the existing 
school facilities and resources as these have 
not been sufficiently increased to meet the 
increased demand. Lack of basic school 
materials such as desks and learning material 
impacts negatively on the pupils’ ability to learn 
and compromises the quality of education. In 
addition, the shortage of teachers in the 
schools exerts further pressure on the quality 
of the education students receive.
In recognition of these challenges, 
Bulyanhulu participated in a fundraising 
event for school desks, hosted by the Geita 
Regional Commissioner, as guests of 
Nyang’hwale District. at the fundraising event 
Bulyanhulu committed to providing a total of 
1,500 desks to be handed over to schools  
in our surrounding areas. In line with our 
commitment to developing local business, 
the desks were made by local suppliers. 
The maker and supplier of the desks, Deus 
Noah Mulela, is a local entrepreneur we have 
been providing support to so that he is 
capable of supplying to the mine, mainly for 
community projects. We helped him register 
his company as a vendor on the acacia supply 
chain system which has provided him an 
opportunity to gain some business from the 
mine. In addition to these 1,500 desks which 
were donated as part of the Geita Regional 
Commissioner’s initiative for increasing the 
number of desks in schools, Deus has also 
supplied another 500 desks to Nyang’hwale 
District through our education initiatives. 
Deus is proud of his contribution to his local 
community and said “this opportunity to 
fabricate the desks helped me contribute to 
the local economy in Nyang’hwale. I was able 
to employ 33 community members. Fifteen  
of them were carpenters who dealt with 
fabricating the timber for desks to their 
required sizes ready for fitting; eight 
community members were employed in the 
welding section; six community members 
were employed for polishing and varnishing 
the desks and four women were food vendors 
that helped cook for my workers during the 
project time. In the end we were able to finish 
the project on time and produce strong and 
good quality desks.”
In his comments during the handover event, 
the Nyang’hwale District Executive Director 
noted that as of March 2016 the District had 
12,828 desks in primary schools out of 
17,091 needed. at secondary school level 
they had 3,077 desks out of 4,717 needed. 
upon consultation with the Nyang’hwale 
District authorities we further facilitated the 
fabrication of an additional 1,015 primary 
schools desks and 500 secondary school 
desks and chairs. a handover ceremony  
of desks and chairs to the Geita Regional 
School Desks Fundraising Committee via  
the Nyang’hwale District Commissioner  
was conducted in November 2016. 
In 2016, our Bulyanhulu mine spent over 
uS$223,000 in supporting various school 
desks initiatives, thus adding over 5,000 
desks in the region.

In delivering our interventions, stakeholder 
engagement is at the centre of our work. We 
constantly engage with the local district and 
regional councils, community leaders and 
communities in general in the areas we work  
in. We have hosted communities on our mine 
sites to expose them to our operations to gain 
an understanding of what happens in mining. 
These tours are insightful for our visitors and 
create transparency in the way we operate. 
The approximately 600 visitors included school 
children, community members, government 
officials and the media. 
In recognition of our work with communities, 
North Mara was awarded the CSR award in  
the Mining Industry by the association of 
Tanzania Employers (‘aTE’). In addition, the 
mine received the best Exhibitor for Mara Day 
commemorations in Kenya awarded by the  
East african Community Ministry of Water and 
Natural Resources Tanzania and Kenya. Our 
Bulyanhulu operations were recognised with  
a Certificate of appreciation on Road Safety  
in Shinyanga region.
In 2017, we aim to prioritise initiatives  
that contribute to the development of local 
economies through supporting local businesses 
and the agricultural sector, which is an 
important sector in the areas we operate in. 
environment
acacia is committed to responsible mining  
by undertaking to minimise harm to the 
environment in which we operate. During  
2016, we reviewed our environmental strategy 
and refined environmental priorities for the 
Company in the short to medium term. as part 
of the process, we undertake to proactively 
manage our top environmental risks and 
enhance opportunities.
and in this report has re-calculated historical 
figures based on improved information on 
purchased electricity. Overall, 2016 GHG 
emissions equaled 287,606 tonnes of CO
2
e,  
a marginal increase (+1%) from the equivalent 
2015 levels. However, as a result of increased 
throughput, our energy usage assessed on the 
basis of megajoules of energy used per tonne of 
ore milled, decreased by 3% when compared to 
2015 usage levels. Further information on Group 
GHG emissions is provided on page 97.
understanding that water is a precious 
resource, water conservation and protection  
of the surrounding water resources form part of 
our key principles of water management. We 
are currently working to improve our water 
balances across our sites to better account for 
water uses as well as identifying more areas of 
water savings. Our total water usage in 2016 
decreased by 9% as a result of our ongoing 
water conservation programmes. Reclaimed 
waters from tailing storage facilities as well as 
mine dewatering continued to be the primary 
sources of water for our operational activities. 
at North Mara, no freshwater was drawn from 
Mara River during 2016, making the site fully 
reliant on the water generated from the open 
pits and underground mine. Buzwagi’s usage 
from Lake Victoria was reduced significantly 
utilising water from the mine pit and rain water 
collected through the sites water harvesting 
area. We will look to enhance our water balance 
models and identify areas of additional water 
savings in 2017 as part of overall Group water 
management programmes.
biodiversity 
acacia’s responsibility towards biodiversity  
was maintained during the year by containing 
strict controls on land disturbances. a standard 
applies to all our sites prohibiting unauthorised 
land disturbances unless the Environment 
Department has reviewed the need and 
approved for disturbance to take place. Our 
ultimate goal for biodiversity management is  
to protect and minimise land disturbance as 
much as possible, and eventually rehabilitate 
disturbed land to achieve land productivities  
of higher value than what existed prior to 
disturbance. Progressive rehabilitation is one  
of our key priorities for 2017 for areas that 
become available. after completing backfilling 
and re-vegetation of the Nyabigena East pit, 
North Mara will commence rehabilitation of  
its airstrip PaF dump during 2017. Likewise, 
Our overall performance for 2016 was good, 
with the Group successfully completing the 
majority of key initiatives and priorities for the 
year. Key achievements include the completion 
of new waste management facilities at North 
Mara and Bulyanhulu mines, and posting 
rehabilitation bonds and signing agreements 
with the Ministry of Energy making acacia 
mines the first in the country to have these 
bonds in place. Implementation of the acacia 
EMS in line with ISO14001 was progressed 
further during the year, improving programmes 
to manage our top environmental risks at all 
our sites. Towards the end of the year the 
North Mara and Bulyanhulu mines achieved 
their cyanide code recertification after 
addressing the corrective action plan issued in 
2015. Buzwagi is due for recertification during 
2017 and preparations are underway. 
acacia’s GHG emissions continued to be 
impacted by interruptions to the electricity supply 
in Tanzania and our reliance on self-generation of 
power. In 2015, we reported our emissions in 
CO
2
, amounting 370,092 tonnes. The estimate 
was largely impacted by lack of information on 
fuel mix for purchased electricity, and as such 
conservative assumptions were made. From 
2016 onwards, acacia will report its GHG 
emissions in terms of CO
2
 equivalent (CO

Buzwagi will be commencing rehabilitation on its 
major waste rock dump and embark on a tree 
planting campaign within the mine and also in 
neighbouring communities in Kahama town. The 
area surrounding Buzwagi mine is fairly dry and 
vegetation impacted by urbanisation, thus the 
tree planting campaign will help to restore the 
lost vegetation and achieve a net positive 
impact on biodiversity. Only native tree species 
are used for rehabilitation programmes to 
enhance biodiversity of the areas we operate.
incident r eporting
acacia keeps records of all environmental 
incidents occurring at our sites. Our 
Environmental Incident Management standard 
provides for three classes of incidents, namely: 
High (reportable incidents), Moderate or Low. 
The incidents classified as High require a 
detailed investigation and subsequent 
reporting to the Government while Moderate 
and Low are only recorded internally and get 
reported to the Government through the annual 
environmental report submitted to the 
Government each year.
No reportable incidents were recorded during 
the year at any of our sites. a total of 140 
minor (non-reportable) incidents were reported 
across our three mines, representing a 7% 
decrease from 2015. 
employees
We continued to make noticeable progress 
across a variety of employee initiatives 
throughout 2016, whilst maintaining 
acceptable levels across core employee 
metrics. annual turnover across our operations 
was approximately 27.3%, which is a slight 
decrease on 2015 (27.8%). We continued to 
progress our commitment to the localisation 
of our workforce throughout 2016, with annual 
national employment levels amounting to 
approximately 96.2% of our total workforce, 
an increase on 2015 levels (96%). 
We continued to invest in training and 
development programmes throughout the year, 
notably through the launch of our Future 
Leaders programme to develop current and 
future leaders, and a number of additional 
business improvement and project management 
programmes. We maintained our focus 
on longer-term training programmes, such as 
our Rainbow Leadership Training programme 
for first line leaders which was successfully 
rolled out in 2016; 102 participants have 
completed the training to date with a further 
31 apprentices currently in the Integrated 
Mining Technical Training (‘IMTT’) programme. 
approximately 8% of our overall workforce are 
women, something which is reflective of gender 
diversity generally within the mining industry.  
Of this, female representation across our 
management structures equalled approximately 
10% at Board level and 13% at senior leadership 
level. all levels are broadly consistent with 
female representation levels in 2015.
Safety
Group-wide Total Recordable Injury Frequency 
Rate (‘TRIFR’) was 0.74 compared to 0.68 in 
2015, a 9% regression. Regrettably, in January 
2016 one of our contractors at North Mara 
passed away as a result of a haul truck accident. 
although there was a slight increase in the 
number of Lost Time Injuries, from 27 in 2015 to 
32 in 2016, the injury severity rate decreased by 
17%. The number of high potential incidents 
(these are incidents that could under slightly 
different circumstances have led to a fatality or 
permanent disability) decreased from 101 in 
2015 to 55 in 2016, a 46% reduction. a key driver 
supporting commendable improvement was the 
implementation of the first five of eleven critical 
risk control standards at each of the mine sites. 
The WeCare behavioural safety programme 
(‘Tunajali’) is fully implemented at all the sites 
and is now supported by the safety interactions 
process (visible felt leadership), hazard reporting 
and investigation process, task observations 
and pre-task risk assessments. Focus has 
now shifted to leading indicators to identify, 
investigate and control hazards and at-risk 
behaviours to improve safety performance.
During 2016, the top five critical risk control 
standards were rolled out at each site. Each  
site achieved the 80% compliance target set for 
end 2016. Compliance to these five critical risk 
control standards will be further enhanced during 
2017 and the additional six critical risk control 
standards will be rolled out during 2017 to further 
drive a reduction in high potential incidents. 
We also progressed a number of initiatives 
within an occupational health and safety 
context to increase the effectiveness of 
existing occupational health programmes and 
continued to progress health assessments, 
including malaria control assessments, for 
our employees and wider community base. 
This is incorporated into an updated acacia 
Occupational Health and Safety Management 
System which was rolled out in 2016. The total 
number of malaria cases and the days lost due 
to malaria both decreased by more than 30% 
from the 2015 highs.

rights challenge, particularly in the context of 
ongoing mine intrusion risks at our North Mara 
Gold Mine. It is a multifaceted problem, and we 
must continually work to address immediate 
physical and underlying economic and social root 
causes, the capability and conduct of those who 
provide security services and enforce law and 
order in and around our mine sites, and the 
response to grievances or claims when incidents 
that may involve human rights issues do occur. 
We must do so always mindful that governments 
have the primary responsibility within their 
borders, for law and order and the protection  
of human rights, including the right to life  
and security of person. 
We saw significant improvement across all 
metrics relating to security risks and impacts 
on the right to life and security of person in 
2016. There were far fewer illegal incursions 
into areas of active mining, with numbers of 
intruders at the open pits and run-of-mine ore 
pad at North Mara down by 98% in 2016 
compared to 2014 (monthly average of 126 in 
2016 compared to over 7,000 in 2014), with 
almost none at Bulyanhulu and Buzwagi. 
We saw a reduction in the number of trespasser-
related fatalities during the year, from 9 in 2015 
to 6 in 2016. There were two security-related 
trespasser fatalities, both confrontations 
between police and trespassers at North Mara. 
There were four additional trespasser fatalities 
at North Mara, unrelated to security: three 
people drowned in a flooded former pit outside 
the secured perimeter, and a further person lost 
their life in an accident at the waste dumps. all 
fatalities are reported to the local authorities 
who investigate each incident, with police-
related incidents referred to the Regional Police 
Commander and, if relevant, on to the attorney 
General for investigation. This tragic loss of life 
is unacceptable, and we will continue to review 
our security and safety arrangements and how 
we operate to seek to eliminate such incidents. 
Key to our security strategy is appropriate  
training on security and human rights to our 
private security and to the police deployed near 
our operations (including on international 
standards on the use of force and firearms, 
sexual violence and treatment of vulnerable 
groups). We continued to support SFCG in 
providing training to the Tanzanian police in 2016. 
In 2016, 37 allegations relating to public or 
private security were reported through our 
operations’ community grievance processes 
compared to 74 in 2015. Of these, 30 involved 
allegations of use of excessive force by police 
(2015: 58) and 7 involved allegations of use of 
excessive force by private security (2015: 16). 
all allegations related to North Mara.
In 2016, the grievance office made significant 
progress in clearing the backlog of pending 
cases from previous years with 117 cases 
relating to public or private security being 
concluded through our North Mara’s human 
rights grievance process (2015: 29). Of these, 
109 were found to be unsubstantiated or 
inconclusive (2015: 17). The Mine agreed to 
help provide a remedy for 8 cases that were 
found to be substantiated (2015: 12). One 
employee was terminated for excessive  
use of force. 
One grievance relating to public or private 
security lodged in 2016 at North Mara is still 
being investigated and we aim to resolve this in 
early 2017. We aim to resolve all security and 
human rights grievances as promptly as 
possible, taking into account that police 
investigations sometimes cause delay.

Managing a complex situation  
and overcoming legacy issues
The North Mara Gold Mine commenced 
operations in 2002 in a remote area of Tanzania 
that still lacks significant infrastructure and  
where the mine is the dominant source of wealth.  
a subsequent 10-fold increase in the local 
population due to in-migration has exacerbated 
the mine’s importance to the approximately 
80,000 people living in close proximity. The 
mine’s relationship with the community has 
historically been challenged by violent 
confrontations with trespassers looking to  
steal gold-bearing material from the mine  
site. However, over the past three years, North 
Mara has seen a dramatic improvement in this 
relationship as the collective result of strategic, 
operational, community development and 
security initiatives which together, have been 
instrumental in reducing the number of 
intrusions, and therefore the potential for  
violent confrontations.
The decision to go underground at our Gokona  
pit has significantly reduced the footprint of the 
mine and its impact on our local communities.  
We have enhanced our security infrastructure  
by constructing perimeter walls around each of  
the active mining areas. We have brought in a 
specialist security contractor, while our CSR team 
has taken a more proactive approach to managing 
community relationships. We have also worked 
closely with the Tarime District and the central 
Government, who have stepped up their efforts  
to improve respect for law and order in the local 
community through increased education, 
community policing and active police operations. 
Delivery of our sustainable communities strategy 
should further reduce our local communities’ 
reliance on North Mara and numbers of intruders 
on our mine sites. Over uS$30 million of past 
investments into infrastructure - such as schools, 
health clinics, clean water and upgrading road 
networks - has improved our relationships. Our 
focus is now on fostering thriving local economies 
so that the communities around our mines can 
more readily access gainful employment and 
higher economic returns. We are currently 
supporting programmes designed to encourage 
micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; 
increase the levels of productive employment; 
and increase agricultural productivity and the 
income of small-scale producers.
We are continuing to invest in security 
infrastructure to seek to minimise trespasser 
numbers and resulting security and safety risks.  
In 2017 , we will construct a safety barrier around 
the new waste rock dump for the Nyabirama pit  
to reduce the risk of illegal miners exposing 
themselves to safety risks during mine dumping 
activities or by causing uncontrolled rock falls.  
In tandem, we will enhance our physical and 
remote mine site surveillance systems to 
improve early detection and proactive 
management of intruder occurrences. 
One of our key aims is to ensure that there  
are no fatal incidents on the mine, this applies  
to both our employees, contractors and 
communities members who illegally enter the 
mine premises. We are deeply disappointed that 
there were six intruder fatalities at North Mara. 
There were two security-related trespasser 
fatalities, both a result of confrontations 
between police and trespassers. There were four 
additional trespasser fatalities at North Mara, 
unrelated to security: three people drowned in a 
flooded former pit outside the secured perimeter, 
and a further person lost their life in an accident 
at the waste dumps. all fatalities are reported  
to the local authorities who investigate each 
incident, with police-related incidents referred to 
the Regional Police Commander and if relevant 
the attorney General for investigation. 
Our approach to security at our operations is 
guided by the Voluntary Principles. We include 
human rights requirements in our contracts with 
private security providers and have entered into 
Memoranda of understanding with the police 
that provide law and order in and around our 
mines setting out clearly defined terms of 
reference for police conduct. We expect the 
police to respect human rights and adhere  
to international codes of conduct for law 
enforcement and international principles  
on the use of force and firearms.
acacia provides training to all private security 
personnel and supports the training provided  
by Search for Common Ground to the police  
on security and human rights. We participate  
in remediation through our operational level 
grievance processes when security related 
human rights impacts do occur, as suggested 
by the uN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights. While there is still more to be 
done, we are pleased that North Mara’s 
security and human rights situation improved 
across all indicators in 2016. We continue to 
work to protect the safety and security of our 
employees and intruders onto our mine site 
within a framework that promotes respect for 
human rights in 2017.

PerforMAnce review governance overview
Kelvin d ushnis Ky
CHaIRMaN OF THE BOaRD
Dear shareholders,
as I noted in my Chairman’s statement, 2016 was a 
pleasing year for acacia overall. We delivered against  
our primary objective of generating free cash flow and 
delivered our highest ever levels of Group production. 
The turnaround of the business, helped by external 
tailwinds, meant that the share price performed 
extremely strongly during 2016, rising 108%  
over the year . 
To support these achievements, throughout 2016 the Board 
continued to perform key oversight and monitoring activities 
across the Company’s core business areas (financial, 
operational and exploration) and we continued to conduct 
further strategic and risk reviews focused on longer-term 
growth objectives. 
There have been no significant changes to Board 
composition in 2016. However, this year we revisited Board 
Committee composition to ensure that the composition of 
each Board Committee is best aligned to acacia’s needs.  
as a result of this review, we have decided to alter the 
composition of our audit and EHS&S Committees, with 
membership changes applying from 2017. Firstly, we have 
decided to appoint Peter Tomsett as a member of the 
EHS&S Committee to replace Brad Gordon. This decision 
was taken to reflect our preference to have Board 
Committees comprised of Non-Executive Directors and,  
at the same time, to ensure that the EHS&S Committee 
maintains appropriate mining operational skill sets relevant 
to its remit of responsibilities. Secondly, it was decided that 
Steve Lucas should replace Peter Tomsett as a member of 
the audit Committee. Steve’s financial and audit committee 
experience across the extractive industry will further 
enhance the skill set of acacia’s audit Committee and  
we feel he is a natural addition to the Committee.

board composition
as at 31 December 2016, the Board comprised a Non-Executive 
Chairman, one Executive Director and seven Non-Executive Directors, 
of whom six were independent.
board changes during 2016
There were no new Board appointments during the reporting period. 
Graham Clow retired from the Board at the 2016 aGM.
r etirement and re-election
In line with the requirements for annual re-election under the uK 
Corporate Governance Code, all Directors will offer themselves for 
re-election at the forthcoming aGM. The Board determines all of  
these Directors to be eligible for re-election. 
board leadership
chairman and chief executive officer
In line with best practice, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and 
Chairman, and their related responsibilities, are separated. The  
divisions of responsibility and the specifications of each role are set  
out in writing and reviewed periodically as part of annual corporate 
governance reviews. Responsibilities are divided so as to ensure that  
the Chairman remains principally responsible for the leadership of the 
Board and ensuring that the Board plays a full and constructive part in 
the development and determination of the Company’s strategy and 
overall commercial objectives. The Chief Executive Officer is primarily 
responsible for all executive management matters affecting acacia  
and is principally responsible for running the Company’s business.  
all members of the ELT report directly to him.
Senior independent d irector
Mr Tomsett is acacia’s Senior Independent Director (‘SID’). The 
responsibilities and duties of the SID are determined in accordance with 
the requirements of the uK Corporate Governance Code. In particular, 
the SID is required to:
•	 act as a sounding board for the Chairman;
•	 act as an intermediary for other Directors, when necessary;
•	 ensure that an annual appraisal of the Chairman is conducted by the 
Non-Executive Directors, without the Chairman present; and
•	 be available to shareholders for discussion purposes, in cases where 
contact between such shareholders and the Chairman and/or CEO 
has been ineffective or is otherwise inappropriate.
matters reserved
There is a schedule of matters that the Board has specifically reserved 
for its decision. This schedule was reviewed during the year and includes 
matters such as setting the Group’s strategic aims and objectives, 
approving significant contractual commitments (including merger and 
acquisition activity), approving capital-raising, approving changes to  
the Group’s share capital and corporate structure, approving financial 
reports and ensuring maintenance of a sound system of internal control 
and risk management.
delegation of authority
The Board has delegated responsibility for certain matters to four 
Committees: the audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the 
EHS&S Committee and the Nomination & Governance Committee. The 
membership, chairmanship and activities of each of these Committees 
are set out in each Committee report on pages 72 to 76 and as part of 
the Remuneration Report.
board effectiveness
board meetings and attendance
Board decisions are predominantly made by achieving a consensus at 
Board meetings. In exceptional circumstances, decisions may be taken 
by the majority of Board members. Questions arising at any meeting are 
determined by a majority of votes. In the case of an equality of votes, 
acacia’s articles of association do not provide the Chairman with a 
second or casting vote. all Directors are required to take decisions 
objectively and in the best interests of the Company. as part of their 
duties as Directors, Non-Executive Directors are expected to apply 
independent judgement to contribute to issues of strategy and 
performance and to scrutinise the performance of management.
The Board is scheduled to meet at least four times a year, and at such 
other times as are necessary to discharge its duties. The Board met  
a total of nine times in 2016. Meetings occurred in person and by 
teleconference. Details of individual attendance are provided  
in the table overleaf. 
board briefings and development
The Board receives monthly management reports and quarterly  
reports outlining all material operational, financial and strategic 
developments. These ensure that Board members remain properly 
briefed on the performance and financial position of the Group on a 
continuous basis. Board and Committee papers are circulated prior to  
all meetings to allow Directors to be briefed in advance of discussions. 
Board meetings include quarterly operational, financial and exploration 
project performance reviews to ensure that, in addition to specific 
scheduled matters and any other business, core business performance 
is monitored and assessed on a continuous basis. In addition to 
scheduled Board meetings, all Directors have access to members of the 
Executive Leadership Team and to whatever further information they 
need to perform their duties and to satisfy their responsibilities. acacia’s 
independent Non-Executive Directors and Committee Chairmen meet 
with members of the Executive Leadership Team to receive more 
in-depth briefings on Board and Committee matters whenever required or 
requested. In addition, all Directors continue to have free access to visit 
operations outside scheduled Board arrangements. Board training and 
development needs are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Directors may 
take independent professional advice, as necessary, at the Company’s 
expense in the furtherance of their duties. In addition to this, each Board 
Committee is entitled to seek independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, where necessary, to assist or guide the Committee 
in the performance of its functions.

internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness. In line with this 
responsibility, the Board has established ongoing processes and 
systems for identifying, evaluating and managing principal risks that  
the Group faces, which have been in place throughout the year and  
up to the date of approval of the annual Report. 
The Board principally bases its monitoring and review of the 
effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems on its 
review of management reports and assessments, and on the quarterly 
reports it receives on the status of acacia’s risk management and 
internal control environment. This is supported by the risk profile reviews 
that acacia’s internal audit function carries out to help the Board identify 
and manage the most significant risks and events that could affect the 
Company’s operations, financials and performance on an ongoing basis. 
Where necessary, the Board is assisted by its Committees in reviewing 
internal systems and controls, particularly the audit Committee, which  
is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
control and risk management framework systems, as components of  
the Company’s internal control framework. 
In compliance with its obligations, the Board conducted a review of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk management and internal control 
systems for the reporting period. This review took into account the 
enhanced monitoring, review and assessment requirements introduced 
by the 2014 edition of the uK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC’s 
Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting that has been introduced to replace the Turnbull 
Guidance for financial reporting periods commencing on or after 1 
October 2014.
The review also covered a review of all material controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and considered all 
significant aspects of internal control for the reporting period. During the 
course of the review the Board did not identify or hear of any failings or 
weaknesses that it determined to be material. Therefore a confirmation 
of any necessary actions undertaken is not required.
additional information regarding the internal control and risk 
management process specifically in relation to the financial reporting 
process and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  
is provided as part of the audit Committee report and the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements.
Further detail as regards the governance structure used for acacia’s 
approach to risk management and the processes and procedures used 
in the context of risk management is provided on pages 28 to 29 of this 
annual Report. The Company’s viability statement is also provided in this 
context on page 29.

68 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 majority shareholder
Barrick is the Group majority shareholder, holding approximately 64% of 
acacia’s issued shares as at the date of this report. acacia’s relationship 
with Barrick is governed by the terms of a Relationship agreement, the 
principal purpose of which is to ensure that the acacia Group is capable 
of carrying on its business independently of the Barrick Group and that 
any transactions and relationships with the Barrick Group are conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms. The Relationship 
agreement will continue for so long as acacia is listed on the London 
Stock Exchange and Barrick owns or controls at least 15% of acacia’s 
issued share capital or voting rights.
The Relationship agreement provides Barrick with certain Director 
appointment rights in line with a sliding scale, structured as follows:
barrick percentage shareholding barrick director appointment rights
40% or more 
 
 
The higher of three Non-Executive 
Directors and the maximum that may 
be appointed under the uK Corporate 
Governance Code
25% up to 40% The higher of two Non-Executive 
Directors and one less than the 
maximum number of Non-Executive 
Directors that may be appointed under 
the uK Corporate Governance Code
15% up to 25% The higher of one Non-Executive 
Director and two less than the 
maximum number of Non-Executive 
Directors that may be appointed under 
the uK Corporate Governance Code
In addition to Director appointment rights, and subject to certain 
exceptions, as part of the terms of the Relationship agreement, Barrick 
has undertaken that members of the Barrick Group will not carry on the 
exploration of gold or silver in africa or acquire, whether through an asset 
purchase or the purchase of securities, a gold or silver mining business 
in africa that competes with acacia without giving acacia the option to 
exercise certain rights of first refusal for so long as Barrick holds 30% or 
more of the issued share capital or voting rights of acacia. acacia has 
given a reciprocal non-compete commitment to Barrick in this regard.
acacia entered into the Relationship agreement at the time of its initial 
public offering in 2010. It was amended in 2014 to ensure full 
compliance with the independence requirements introduced to the 
Listing Rules, which took effect in November 2014. Following these 
amendments the Relationship agreement expressly provides that:
(i)  any and all transactions with Barrick (or its associates) shall be 
conducted at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
(ii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will take any action that will 
prevent acacia from complying with its obligations under the Listing 
Rules; and
(iii)  neither Barrick, nor any of its associates, will propose or procure the 
proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended or appears to 
be intended to circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
In addition, the Listing Rules now require premium listed companies with 
controlling shareholders to provide a confirmation in their annual reports 
that all of the independence provisions contained in their relationship 
agreements have been complied with. In line with this requirement, the 
Board has assessed Barrick and acacia’s compliance with the Relationship 
agreement’s independence requirements as amended, and has assessed 
compliance with these requirements in line with practices employed in any 
event since the IPO. as such, the Board can confirm that acacia has 
complied with the independence requirements stated above since their 
adoption and, so far as the Board is aware, Barrick and its associates 
have also complied with these requirements. In this regard, all members  
of the Board support the giving of this statement and no independent 
Non-Executive Director has raised any objections in this regard.
dialogue with the investment community 
acacia has a designated investor relations team which acts as the 
primary point of contact with the investment community and is 
responsible for maintaining acacia’s ongoing relations with investors and 
shareholders. acacia conducts regular investor meetings and telephone 
calls with the investment community to discuss results, and participates 
in mining conferences to meet with current and prospective investors. In 
addition to its annual and half-year reports, acacia publishes quarterly 
reports to the market, which provide further information on production 
and financial results, and updates on its business and operations. 
acacia’s investor relations team also arranges operational site tours  
for members of the analyst community, as and when appropriate.
agm
acacia’s 2017 aGM will be held on 20 april 2017 at 13.00 (uK time).  
The business of the meeting will be conducted in accordance with 
Companies act 2006 requirements and standards promoted by the  
uK Corporate Governance Code. The Chairman of the Board and the 
Chairmen of the audit, Compensation, EHS&S and Nomination & 
Governance Committees will be available to answer questions put to 
them by shareholders at the meeting. The aGM Notice is included in the 
documentation that has been provided with this annual Report and is 
also available on the Company’s website. In accordance with best 
practice, the notice has been sent to shareholders at least 20  
business days prior to the date of the meeting.
conflicts of interest
Mr Dushnisky and Mr Galbraith are nominee Directors appointed by 
Barrick. These individuals hold a number of cross directorships with 
members of the Barrick Group, which give rise to situations in which 
these Directors could have a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or 
possibly may conflict, with those of acacia. In addition, as a result of 
their employment within the Barrick Group, these individuals also hold 
interests under Barrick’s restricted stock unit plan and other employee 
incentive plans.
governance
69 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 corporate governance report CONTINu ED
The Companies act 2006 requires directors to avoid situations where 
they have, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or  
may possibly conflict, with company interests. However, the act does 
allow directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential 
conflicts of interest where a company’s articles of association contain  
a provision to that effect. acacia’s articles of association contain such 
provision and a procedure for this. In accordance with this procedure,  
the conflicts outlined above were declared and authorised by the Board.
The monitoring and, if appropriate, authorisation of any actual or 
potential conflict of interest is an ongoing process. Directors are  
required to notify the Company of any material changes in positions or 
situations that have already been considered and any new situations.  
In addition, Directors are required to declare interests in potential or 
actual transactions and are required to abstain from voting on such 
transactions, subject to permitted exceptions. If a question arises as  
to whether any interest of a Director prevents him or her from voting  
or being counted in a quorum in the context of a potential or actual 
transaction, the matter is referred to the Chairman, whose findings are 
final and conclusive. In the context of questions relating to any such 
conflict of the Chairman, the question may ultimately be decided by a 
resolution of the other Directors. The Board reviews conflicts of interest 
on a periodic basis and maintains a record of all declared conflicts.
Specifically as regards nominee Directors appointed by Barrick, the 
Relationship agreement provides that if any transaction or arrangement 
arises directly between a member of the Barrick Group and a member  
of the acacia Group and does or could, in the opinion of a majority of 
Directors (excluding any Director(s) appointed by Barrick), give rise to a 
conflict of interest between acacia and any Director appointed by Barrick, 
any such matter must be approved and authorised at a duly convened 
Board meeting or in writing by a majority of Directors (excluding any 
Director(s) appointed by Barrick) prior to the Company taking further 
action in relation to such matter. Save for the matters set out above,  
no other conflicts of interest were disclosed to the Board during the 
reporting period.
performance evaluation
The Board believes that annual evaluations are helpful and provide a 
valuable opportunity for continuous improvement. In 2015, we engaged 
Lintstock to undertake our first externally-facilitated performance 
evaluation of the Board, its Committees and individual Directors 
(including the Chairman).
In 2016, again with the assistance of Lintstock, we developed tailored 
surveys that reflected the Company’s specific circumstances and built 
upon the themes and outputs from the 2015 review. all Board members 
were requested to complete online surveys addressing the performance 
of the Board and its Committees, the Chairman and individual Directors. 
The anonymity of all respondents was ensured throughout the process  
in order to promote the open and frank exchange of views.
Lintstock subsequently produced a report which considered the following 
areas of Board performance:
•	 The size and composition of the Board were considered, as were the 
Board members’ views as to the key changes that should be made  
in Board composition over the next three to five years to match the 
Company’s strategic goals.
•	 The Board’s understanding of key stakeholders, acacia’s operations 
and the environment in which the Company operates was reviewed.
•	 The management and focus of the Board meetings was assessed,  
as was the quality of the Board packs and the induction and ongoing 
training provided to Board members.
•	 The Board’s oversight of sustainability performance, the Company’s 
strategy and its capacity to deliver the strategy was considered, and 
the Board members identified the top strategic issues facing acacia.
•	 The Board’s focus on risk was assessed and the Board’s monitoring 
of culture and behaviours throughout the organisation was reviewed.
•	 The oversight of succession and development for management was 
reviewed, as was the structure of the Company at senior levels,  
and the level of interaction between the Board and management.
•	 The review also considered the performance of the Chairman and  
that of the individual Directors.
The findings were collectively considered by all Directors. Overall, the 
Board concluded that it had operated effectively throughout the reporting 
period. Nevertheless, opportunities for improvement and specific priorities 
were identified and these have been taken into account when structuring 
our focus areas for 2017. among other things, the Board agreed that it 
should review the schedule of Board site visits, consider areas in which 
the provision of further training and updates would be beneficial, and 
review the opportunities it has to gain exposure to management.
as noted above, the effectiveness of each Board Committee was also 
assessed through this exercise and an individual Committee report 
produced in each case. The reports and recommendations have been 
reviewed and discussed by each Committee and some minor 
improvement opportunities identified.
It is envisaged that the 2017 Board and Board Committee performance 
evaluation, whether conducted internally or externally, will be designed to 
build upon learnings gained this year to ensure that the recommendations 
agreed are implemented and that year-on-year progress is measured.
70 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 corporate governance compliance
For the year under review, as a uK company with a premium listing on the 
Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, acacia is required to make 
certain statements regarding the way it is governed, as required by the 
2014 edition uK Corporate Governance Code, which is available at  
www.frc.org.uk. accordingly, this report explains how acacia has applied 
the Main Principles of the uK Corporate Governance Code during 2016.
Generally, acacia seeks to comply with all relevant provisions of the uK 
Corporate Governance Code wherever possible and for the reporting year 
it is the Board’s view that acacia has complied with all such provisions, 
save for the following:
•	 Mr Dushnisky was not independent on appointment as Chairman  
and an external search consultancy was not used in connection  
with his appointment. Given Mr Dushnisky’s experience within the 
mining sector, his skill set and his familiarity with the operating and 
geographical environment in which the Company’s assets are located, 
the Board believes his appointment to be in the best interests of the 
Company irrespective of this (Provisions a.3.1 and B.2.4).
•	 acacia has not adopted a formal diversity policy. In this regard 
however, we ensure that all recruitment is conducted on the basis 
that we hire the best candidate for all positions, at all levels, including 
Board and senior management positions, irrespective of gender or 
race (Provision B.2.4).
The uK Corporate Governance Code requires that the Board provides  
a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of acacia’s position 
and prospects in its external reporting. accordingly, the Directors were 
responsible for the preparation and approval of this annual Report and 
consider the annual Report and accounts for 2016, taken as a whole,  
to be fair, balanced and understandable and believe that it provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess acacia’s position and 
performance, business model and strategy.
In addition to compliance with the uK Corporate Governance Code, as 
part of commitments given in connection with acacia’s secondary listing 
on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, the Board has undertaken to 
comply with the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by the 
Tanzanian Capital Markets and Securities authority to the extent  
that these requirements are equivalent to applicable uK corporate 
governance standards. In the case of any conflict between the two,  
the requirements of the uK Corporate Governance Code prevail.
acacia’s external auditors have reviewed those parts of this statement 
which they are required to review under the Listing Rules.

introduction
I am the Chairman of the Committee and a CPa, Ca, CGa (Canada), 
with over 25 years of financial and management experience within the 
mining industry. During the year, Rachel English and Peter Tomsett 
acted as the other members of the Committee. as part of ongoing 
Committee composition reviews, for 2017 Peter Tomsett will step 
down from the Committee and Steve Lucas will join the Committee. 
Details of members’ experience and qualifications are provided on 
pages 62 to 65 as part of the Board of Directors’ biographies.
The 2016 edition of the uK Corporate Governance Code and revised 
FRC audit Committee Guidance published during the year introduced 
various enhancements to audit Committee composition. Requirements 
primarily focus on ensuring that committee composition continues to 
provide for appropriate recent and relevant financial experience and 
competence in the sector in which a company operates. Whilst the 
enhanced requirements do not strictly apply to acacia until 2017,  
given that all Committee members have a wide range of experience, 
with an emphasis on financial and audit committee experience across 
the extractive industry, we note that acacia already meets the 
enhanced standards. 
Our terms of reference require us to meet at least four times a year, 
and in 2016 we met seven times, holding meetings in person and by 
conference call. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, 
the Chief Compliance Officer, the Head of Risk and Internal audit, 
members of the Company’s finance function and the external auditors 
also attend Committee meetings on a regular basis by invitation.
We also hold individual meetings with acacia’s external auditors and 
the Head of Risk and Internal audit without management present to 
discuss matters within our remit of responsibilities.
key responsibilities
Our key responsibilities include oversight of financial reporting and 
internal controls over financial reporting, overseeing the Group’s 
relationship with its external auditors and acacia’s internal audit 
function, overseeing the external and internal audit processes 
generally and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of 
internal control, including its risk management framework. In addition, 
we receive reports from the Chief Compliance Officer as regards 
anti-fraud, anti-bribery and anti-corruption compliance programmes, 
these being directly related to our oversight of whistleblowing 
arrangements and related policy reviews.
activitie S in 2016 and plan S for 2017 
our activities during the year were wide ranging, comprising in particular 
the following:
objective achieved
Reviewing Committee composition based on succession 
planning, skill set and qualification requirements.

regards the principal risks for which the Committee has 
delegated oversight on behalf of the Board.
Participating in the Committee’s annual performance 
assessment.
In 2017, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of the 
above matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities.
72 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 Significant issues considered by the committee in 2016
In addition to carrying out the activities referred to above, we reviewed 
and considered the following in the context of significant issues relating 
to the Group financial statements:
indirect tax recoverability
as part of ongoing monitoring and review of taxation matters, we have 
reviewed the status, recoverability and classification of the Company’s 
indirect tax receivables relating to VaT charged on imports and the 
domestic supply of goods and services. In this regard, we have received 
reports from management on the status of discussions and negotiations 
of such matters between management and the Tanzanian Revenue 
authority (‘TRa’); we have reviewed management’s ongoing calculations 
of amounts so outstanding; the procedure established to recover 
refunds and amounts due under the escrow account established to  
fund refunds due in respect of portions of the receivable; the audit 
process followed to confirm such refunds; and the overall time frame  
for the receipt of such refunds against amounts outstanding under  
the receivable from time to time. The Committee has also taken into 
account the views and contributions of the external auditors regarding 
recoverability and classification of relevant indirect tax receivables. 
Based on the foregoing, the Committee has satisfied itself that the 
Company’s indirect tax receivables remain recoverable and appropriately 
classified in the circumstances and is satisfied with the suitability of the 
related disclosures contained in this annual Report. 
uncertain tax positions and taxation litigation
a number of tax assessments have been raised by the TRa covering 
existing and prior years which have been challenged by members of the 
Group. We have reviewed the basis of these assessments and discussed 
with management their views as to why the assessments are incorrect, 
along with the status of ongoing disputes and appeals procedures. We 
also discussed these matters with the external auditors and legal 
counsel where relevant. 
Based on this review the Committee concluded that the Company had 
sufficiently provided for any uncertain tax positions and that any material 
contingent liabilities had been adequately disclosed. In addition, the 
Committee reviewed the amount of deferred tax recognised with respect 
to losses incurred in previous periods and was comfortable with the 
amounts recognised. 
impairment assessment
as part of ongoing monitoring of impairment assessments, during  
the year the Committee has reviewed and examined key assumptions 
used by management for impairment testing, in particular the long-term 
average gold price used and the factors relevant to this selection, such 
as: the Company’s operating cash cost levels, the basis on which these 
assumptions were made, and related factors underpinning relevant  
mine planning, budgets and forecasts. Views and contributions of the 
external auditors as regards the impairment testing procedures and  
key assumptions used formed part of the Committee’s review of all 
impairment test calculations. Following these reviews, the Committee 
satisfied itself that key assumptions used to ascertain the carrying  
value of the Company’s cash generating units had been appropriately 
reviewed and challenged and were therefore sufficiently robust for use. 
The Committee also reviewed the disclosure contained in this annual 
Report and, in particular, the disclosure contained in the notes to the 
consolidated financial statements as regards impairment in order to 
satisfy itself of the accuracy and suitability of the disclosures so made. 
going concern review
In addition to the matters stated above, all of which are relevant to  
the Board’s assessment of acacia’s position as a going concern, the 
statement relating to which is provided on page 51, the Committee also 
reviewed other matters relevant to acacia’s liquidity, namely the ongoing 
availability of net cash balances, acacia’s hedging strategy and policy, 
material contingent liability exposure and the availability of funds under 
existing credit facilities. Management reported to the Committee on each 
of these matters and was questioned accordingly. In this regard, the 
Committee has also taken into account the views of the external auditors 
in order to satisfy itself of the position taken by the Board as regards to 
the appropriateness of the going concern assumption contained in this 
annual Report. 
r isk reviews
Throughout the year, the Committee has continued to have delegated 
oversight of certain financial-related principal risks and the Company’s 
risk management framework itself, as a component of internal controls 
systems generally. Further information regarding risk management and 
risk governance is provided on pages 28 to 29 and the principal risks for 
which the Committee retains oversight are identified on pages 30 to 33. 
In this regard our risk monitoring activities involve receipt of periodic  
risk reports and the monitoring of trends and development relevant  
to risk environment, as supported by management’s oversight and 
implementation of day to day risk management across our operations. 
f air, balanced and understandable review
at the request of the Board, the Committee has also reviewed  
the narrative content of the annual Report in order to make a 
recommendation that the report satisfies revised narrative reporting 
requirements in that the annual Report, when taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Company’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy. In this regard the Committee has taken 
advice from the Company’s legal function to satisfy itself of the relevant 
legal and regulatory framework underpinning this disclosure standard. 
The Committee, in conjunction with reviews conducted by PwC, performs 
a similar assessment in the context of half-year reports. 
In terms of wider reviews, the FRC Corporate Reporting Review Team 
reviewed the taxation disclosures contained in our 2015 annual Report 
and accounts as part of a wider review conducted of FTSE 350 tax 
disclosures in annual reports and accounts. The objective of the review 
was to encourage more transparent reporting of the relationship between 
tax charges and accounting profit and the factors that could affect that 
relationship in the future, in accordance with existing requirements. 
Following this review, we were informed that certain of our 2015 
disclosures relating to the measurement of uncertainties relating to tax 
liabilities and assets would be used by the FRC as an example of good 
practice in its publication entitled ‘Corporate Reporting Thematic Review: 
Tax Disclosures’, which was published in October 2016 and is available 
on the FRC’s website. We have had no engagement with the FRC’s audit 
Quality Review Team during the year.

internal and external audit reviews
Throughout the year, the Committee received regular reports on  
matters under review by the internal audit function, and has reviewed 
such matters and raised questions with the Head of Risk and Internal 
audit accordingly. We also reviewed the internal audit charter, mandate 
and performance in order to assess ongoing effectiveness, following 
which the Committee concluded that the internal audit function remains 
effective and performs in accordance with requirements of the business. 
We have also assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process 
via responses to surveys received from the Chief Financial Officer, 
members of the finance and treasury function, and in particular 
members of the Company’s financial reporting team and the  
Company secretariat. The survey comprised a range of factors  
including the following:
•	 Progress achieved against the agreed external audit plan 
•	 Competence with which the external auditors handled key accounting 
and audit judgements and communication of the same between 
management, the Committee and the external audit team
•	 Compliance with relevant regulatory, ethical and professional 
guidance on rotation of lead audit partners
•	 Qualifications, expertise, resources and the external auditors’  
own assessment of their quality control procedures
•	 The stability and continuity provided to the business as a result of  
the continued appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) 
as external auditors
Based on this assessment, the Committee concluded that the  
external auditors remain effective and we will be recommending the 
reappointment of the external auditors at the forthcoming aGM in light of 
this assessment. as regards external audit tender considerations, PwC 
have acted as external auditors for the Group since its listing on the 
London Stock Exchange in March 2010. The Committee has reviewed 
the requirements of the Statutory audit Services for Large Companies 
Market Investigation (Mandatory use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (‘Order’), which 
requires mandatory tendering of audit services every ten years by FTSE 
350 companies, and determined that an audit tender will be required  
in respect of the 2019 financial year at the earliest. We are therefore 
compliant with the requirements of the Order.
With respect to non-audit services provided by the external auditors,  
the Committee reviews the status of all non-audit services on a quarterly 
basis and is required to consider, and where appropriate provide prior 
approval for, the provision of all non-audit work by the external auditors 
to ensure that any such work can be conducted without adversely 
affecting auditor independence. The Committee also reviews the 
proposed provision of non-audit services against the backdrop of uK  
and Eu prohibitions regarding the provision of non-audit services to 
ensure the Company complies with all restrictions and requirements 
applicable to it.
The auditors are precluded from engaging in non-audit services that 
would compromise their independence, objectivity or violate any 
professional requirements or regulations affecting their appointment as 
auditors. The auditors may, however, provide non-audit services which  
do not impair their independence, and where their skills and experience 
make them a logical supplier, subject to pre-approval by the Committee. 
For example, this may include the conduct of certain matters relating  
to Tanzanian taxation assessments, given the materiality of taxation 
considerations to the financial assessment and external audit of the 
Company. The Company’s procedures require that any non-audit services 
proposed to be provided by the auditors be supported by a justification 
as to why the appointment of the external auditors to provide the 
services is in the Company’s best interests, and how auditor 
independence would be safeguarded in the specific context of the 
proposed services. In addition to this, the lead audit partner rotates  
at least every five years.
Fees for non-audit services incurred during the year amounted to 
approximately uS0.4 million (2015: approximately uS$0.2 million) 
representing 37% of the 2016 audit fees. audit related and non-audit 
services provided by the external auditors included their review of  
the Company’s half-year report. Further information on audit and 
non-audit fees paid to PwC can be found in Note 10 to the  
consolidated financial statements.
as a Company we also maintain a strict discipline on the recruitment of 
any former employees of the external auditors to ensure independence is 
not undermined. The Committee has adopted a formal written policy 
regarding the recruitment of former employees of the external auditor. 
The policy prohibits the hiring of any former member of the external audit 
team into any financial oversight role or as an officer of the Company  
for a period of two years following their association with the audit,  
save in instances where the appointment has been pre-approved by the 
Committee. Between meetings, the Committee Chairman has delegated 
authority to deal with such appointments at his discretion. any such 
interim approval must be ratified at the next meeting of the Committee. 
In addition, any employee of the external auditor who accepts 
employment with the acacia Group whatever the role must cease all 
audit activity immediately and tender their resignation to the audit firm.

introduction
I am the Chairman of the Committee, a position that I assumed as a 
result of my experience within an african socio-economic and political 
context, having served in a number of public and private sectors in 
Tanzania and within the East african Community over the years. 
During the year, Graham Clow stepped down from the Committee  
at the time of stepping down from the Board at the 2016 aGM, and 
was replaced by Brad Gordon. Rachel English continued to act as a 
member of the Committee throughout the reporting period. as part of 
periodic composition reviews and in consultation with the Nomination 
& Governance Committee, we have decided to appoint Peter Tomsett 
as a Committee member in 2017 to replace Brad Gordon. This 
decision was taken to reflect our preference to have Board 
Committees comprised of Non-Executive Directors and to ensure  
that the Committee comprises appropriate mining operational  
skill sets relevant to our remit of responsibilities. 
Details of members’ experience and qualifications are provided  
on pages 62 to 65 as part of the Board of Directors’ biographies.  
Our terms of reference require us to meet at least twice a year,  
and in 2016 we met four times. Those involved in the Company’s 
environmental, health, safety and security (‘EHS&S’) and sustainable 
communities (‘SC’) functions also attend Committee meetings on  
a regular basis by invitation, in order to report on EHS&S/SC 
developments and performance.
key responsibilities
Our key responsibilities focus on the oversight and review of activities 
that are of core importance to acacia’s social licence to operate. 
These include acacia’s strategy and policy on environmental, 
occupational health and safety, SC and security matters; reviewing 
the effectiveness of Group EHS&S systems and controls; and 
generally overseeing management’s monitoring and evaluation of 
emerging SC issues to assess the potential impact on acacia’s 
business and operations. In addition, we also have delegated 
oversight of human rights from the Board, in line with similar 
oversight responsibilities assumed by EHS&S Committees or  
their equivalent in peers across the mining industry.
activitie S in 2016 and plan S for 2017 
our activities during the year were wide ranging, and comprised the
following in particular:
objective achieved
Reviewing Committee composition, based on succession 
planning, skill set and qualification requirements.
Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of 
responsibilities in light of ongoing developments within the 
Company’s business and operating environment.
Reviewing Group-wide EHS&S and SC strategies and priorities, 
performance, metrics, trends and incident reports.
Overseeing the development of a sustainable communities 
strategy and programme as a driving component of our approach 
to SC and the operation of the acacia Maendeleo Fund.
Reviewing key risks in the Group’s operating environment 
regarding EHS&S and SC.
Reviewing key regulatory and other developments relevant to 
the EHS&S and SC operating environment.
Reviewing and monitoring the status of occupational, health 
and safety targets and systems.
Identifying and reviewing specific focus areas in the context of 
performance and strategic reviews, as relevant to EHS&S and 
SC matters.
Receiving periodic risk management reports and updates 
regarding the principal risks for which the Committee has 
delegated oversight on behalf of the Board.
Participating in the Committee’s annual performance 
assessment.
In 2017, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of the above 
matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities. From a risk 
management and oversight perspective, the specific EHS&S-related 
principal risks for which the Committee has delegated oversight are 
identified as part of the principal risks and uncertainties table on pages 
30 to 33. In this regard our risk monitoring activities involve receipt of 
periodic risk reports and the monitoring of trends and development 
relevant to risk environment, as supported by management’s oversight  
and implementation of day to day risk management across our operations.

other members of the Committee. Details of members’ experience 
and qualifications are provided on pages 62 to 65 as part of the 
Board of Directors’ biographies. Our terms of reference require  
us to meet at least twice a year, and we did so in 2016. The Chief 
Executive Officer and members from the Company secretariat also 
attend Committee meetings by invitation to discuss matters within 
our remit of responsibilities.
key responsibilities
We play a leading role in reviewing the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and in reviewing prospective new Board appointments 
and succession planning requirements. We also have primary 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the 
composition of Board Committees and we manage recommendations 
for the retirement and replacement of Directors. In addition, our remit 
of responsibilities includes delegated authority from the Board to 
oversee and review acacia’s corporate governance policies and 
procedures, including independence reviews and the monitoring  
of Company procedures for the management of actual and/or 
potential conflicts of interest.
activitie S in 2016 and plan S for 2017 
our activities during the year were wide ranging, and comprised the 
following in particular:
objective achieved
Reviewing Committee composition based on succession 
planning, skill set and qualification requirements, leading to 
proposed changes to our EHS&S Committee and audit 
Committee for 2017 onwards. an overview of changes is 
provided on page 60.
Reviewing our terms of reference and our remit of 
responsibilities in light of ongoing developments within the 
Company’s business and operating environment and 
developments within a corporate governance context.
Reviewing the Board’s structure, size and composition in the 
context of the Company’s strategic and business objectives.
Reviewing the Company’s core corporate governance  
policies in line with best practice developments and  
recent trend developments.
Participating in the Committee’s annual performance 
assessment.
Providing oversight and review of the Board’s and Board 
Committees’ annual performance evaluation and overseeing 
the adoption of recommendations for 2017 work plans. In this 
regard an overview of the 2016 performance evaluation is 
provided on page 70.
Reviewing periodic training and development requirements  
for Directors.
In 2017, the Committee will continue to focus on the majority of the 
above matters, these being core to its remit of responsibilities, and will 
continue to assess Board succession requirements, particularly in the 
context of the FRC’s continuing reviews and consultations around 
succession planning as a driver of Board effectiveness. 
In the context of diversity, whilst the Company has not adopted a  
formal policy, we base all recruitment on the premise that we strive to 
attract a broad mix of individuals from both the traditional and non-
traditional mining labour markets in order to create a diverse workgroup 
and maintain a unique company culture. above all, we aim to hire all 
individuals on the basis of the best candidate for all positions, at all 
levels, including Board and senior management positions, irrespective  
of gender.
Save for appointments made by Barrick under nomination rights 
contained in the Relationship agreement, Board appointments are  
made on the basis of pre-determined job descriptions which include,  
as regards independent Non-Executive Directors, estimates of time 
commitment requirements. From a recruitment and candidate search 
perspective, our existing Directors provide access to a wide network  
of potential Board appointment candidates, particularly within the 
extractive industry, as a result of their collective experience and standing 
within the extractive sector. In addition to this, we look to retain external 
search consultants to assist us in identifying potential candidates for 
Board positions, when appropriate to do so. We did not make any  
new appointments to the Board in 2016 and, as such, no external 
recruitment consultants were retained for Board recruitment purposes.

Michael Kenyon
COMPENSaTION COMMITTEE CHaIRMaN
dear shareholders,
as noted elsewhere in the annual Report, 2016 was a record year  
for acacia in several ways: we delivered significant increases in Group 
production (829,705 ounces), exceeding our initial guidance range for 
the year of 750,000 to 780,000 and exceeding the revised guidance  
we gave in October 2016 (approximately 820,000 ounces); we saw a 
substantial fall in aISC to uS$958 per ounce, 14% lower than in 2015 
and at the bottom of our 2016 guidance range; and we doubled net  
cash on the balance sheet to uS$218 million. Regrettably safety 
performance was disappointing, and we saw an increase of 9% on  
TRIFR when compared to 2015. We continue to target zero injuries  
and, as mentioned elsewhere in the annual Report, we have seen  
an improvement in safety performance towards the end of 2016. 
application of policy during 2016
as foreshadowed in last year’s report, the salaries of the Chief Executive 
and other members of the Executive Leadership Team, as well as the 
base fees of Non-Executive Directors, were each temporarily reduced  
by 10% with effect from 1 January 2016 to reflect market conditions at 
the end of 2015. Given the significant progress made during the year, 
original ELT salary levels have been reinstated. Further, mindful of the 
significant gap to the peer group market average for the industry in which 
acacia operates, and of the need to phase salary increases gradually, 
the Committee is proposing a 3% increase in Brad’s salary effective 
1 January 2017. Non-Executive Director fee levels will be reviewed  
in april 2017, as is the Company’s usual practice.
With respect to the 2016 bonus assessment, Company-wide performance 
was assessed as 127.8% overall, a significant improvement on 2015 and 
reflecting the financial and operational achievements detailed above. 
Further details as regards the CEO’s 2016 bonus assessment are 
provided on page 90. We will continue to adopt strenuous performance 
requirements for the vesting of bonus awards in 2017 to ensure that 
vesting levels remain focused on the achievement of target and above 
target performance.
In addition to the third tranche of his 2013 SOP awards which vested in 
full, this year also saw the vesting of PRSu awards made to Brad Gordon 
shortly after his recruitment in august 2013. Vesting of the PRSu awards 
was based on three-year TSR performance relative to 15 global gold peers, 
with acacia’s 369.1% absolute TSR over the period significantly exceeding 
the weighted mean TSR of 37.0%, and with awards therefore vesting as to 
200% of target at a share price of 597.5p (as opposed to 160p when the 
awards were first granted). The Committee recognises that the resulting 
single figure for 2016, at approximately £11.6 million, is substantial; this 
is, however, the true reflection of the significant progress made by the 
Company in the relevant performance period. 
The period from 2013 to 2016 has seen significant financial and 
operational improvements, with overall production up over 29%, aISC 
and cash costs down 29% and 21% respectively, and cash flow from 
operating activities up 70% to uS$318 million. From a wider business 
perspective, Brad has overseen the relaunch of the Company as acacia 
Mining, led the expansion of our land package across africa, and driven  
a number of successful employee development programmes across our 
operations. With these factors in mind, the Committee confirmed the 
vesting of PRSu awards and single figure for 2016, noting also that given 
the progression of acacia’s share price under Brad’s leadership, it is not 
anticipated that future single figures will be of the same magnitude.
r eview of r emuneration policy for 2017
In light of the requirement to seek formal shareholder approval for our 
Remuneration Policy at the 2017 aGM, and mindful of the numerous 
developments in market practice over the period since we last sought 
approval, the Committee has used the last few months to undertake a 
full review of our compensation arrangements with the overall aim of 
ensuring that they continue to be aligned with acacia’s strategy and 
long-term vision, and capable of attracting, motivating and retaining 
talent of the calibre required to achieve our primary goals. 
Overall, the Committee considers that the existing remuneration structure 
has served acacia well. The short-term incentive has focused delivery of 
key financial and operational targets, whilst the long-term incentive has 
proven effective at aligning shareholder and executive interests, and 
driving significant value creation. Since our policy was approved, acacia’s 
returns to shareholders have significantly exceeded those of our LTIP 
comparators and of the broader FTSE 350 Index. The changes proposed 
are therefore evolutionary, relating primarily to the LTIP, and reflecting best 
practice where this is considered appropriate for the Company at this time. 
In addition to seeking shareholder approval for a new Remuneration Policy, 
we will be submitting a revised set of LTIP rules which will permit future 
executive awards to take the form of nil-cost options and make it easier  
for participants to build a personal shareholding in the Company.
ltip
We are proposing to amend the LTIP policy to allow the Committee to  
use performance and vesting periods of longer than three years and to 
provide flexibility around performance targets and leaver provisions as 
necessary to facilitate this. This change reflects the increasing 
prevalence of holding periods for long-term incentives at uK companies 
and further incentivises shareholder value creation over the longer term. 
In terms of implementation, it is intended that the CEO will continue  
to be eligible to receive awards of up to 400% of salary at maximum 
vesting each year, with vesting remaining subject to TSR performance 
against an appropriate comparator group. In respect of 2017 awards, 
performance will be measured over a five-year period, with vesting on  
the fifth anniversary of grant and awards being subject to both malus  
and clawback provisions, the triggers for which will be strengthened  
to cover a broader definition of misconduct. To reflect the longer 
performance period, the full-vesting performance level (at which the 
maximum 400% of salary award would vest) has been increased for the 
2017 cycle to 50% outperformance of the median TSR (previously 35% 
outperformance for the three-year cycle). The Committee believes this 
level of performance is broadly consistent in terms of toughness as the 
previous level under the three-year performance period. This is illustrated 
by the graphs overleaf. Subject to the required changes to LTIP rules, the 
Committee is proposing to structure future executive awards in the form 
of nil-cost options to better align with market practice and provide 
participants with a direct path to build shareholdings in the Company. 
Further details of proposed awards for 2017 are included on page 92.

base salary, pension, benefits and short-term incentives
Our policy in relation to base salary, pension and other benefits will remain 
unchanged. Our policy in relation to the STI has been revised slightly, with 
an increase in the target opportunity for the CEO from 75% to 100% of 
salary for 2017. The Committee considered the appropriateness of 
introducing bonus deferral, but concluded that the proposed change to  
the time horizon of the LTIP will ensure that a significant proportion of  
pay remains at risk over the longer term and that executives remain 
sufficiently aligned with shareholders, without further introducing 
mandatory bonus deferral.
Shareholding guidelines
The Committee strongly encourages executives to build and hold a 
sizeable shareholding to ensure they are aligned with our investors.  
To this end, for 2017 onwards we are proposing that the shareholding 
guidelines for Executive Directors be increased from 200% to 400% of 
salary, and that there be a requirement to retain 50% of vested awards 
(net of tax) until the relevant guideline has been met. 
michael kenyon
Chairman of the Compensation Committee
as required under the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (accounts and Reports) (amendment) Regulations 2013, the 
remaining content of this Remuneration Report is divided into the 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy (pages 79 to 86) and the annual 
Report on Remuneration for 2016 (pages 87 to 96). The Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy will be put to shareholders for approval in a 
binding vote at the forthcoming aGM and will come into effect 
immediately following such approval. Save for the minor changes 
listed below, the proposed Policy remains largely consistent with  
that operated over the last three years and approved at the 2014 
aGM. The substantive changes to the Policy are focused on the  
LTIP and include:
•	 Extending the LTIP performance period from three to five years
•	 Introducing the flexibility to deliver future LTIP awards through 
nil-cost options rather than as PRSus
•	 Replacing the five-year time limit for achieving the share ownership 
guideline with a retention requirement of 50% of any net vested 
LTIP award until the guideline is met 
Shareholders should also note that the wording in the Policy table 
around the LTIP opportunity has been revised to be consistent with 
the policy of granting nil-cost options going forward. The new Policy 
now states a maximum award of 400% of salary rather than a target 
award of 200% of salary under the previous Policy; these are 
equivalent as the vesting schedule has also been revised such that, 
going forward, the achievement of the maximum performance level 
will deliver 1x the maximum award, rather than 2x the target award 
under the prior Policy. In summary, the quantum of the LTIP 
opportunity remains the same.

78 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 directors’ r emuneration policy
our approach to directors’ remuneration
acacia’s approach to Directors’ remuneration aims to attract, motivate 
and retain individuals of the calibre and with the talent necessary to 
manage our strategic and business objectives, to lead our workforce and 
operations and drive our Company and business forward in a challenging 
and complex operating environment and industry, in order to deliver 
sustainable shareholder returns. We aim to achieve this by offering 
competitive packages benchmarked against general market practice 
within the global mining industry, based on an ethos of pay for 
performance and without rewarding for failure.
To achieve this, our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, which has been 
operated for a number of years, is designed around the following  
key objectives:
•	 Remaining competitive with international gold mining, general mining 
and FTSE listed companies of a similar size and complexity.
•	 aligning the interests of Directors, and in particular Executive 
Directors, with the short and long-term interests of shareholders.
•	 Linking executive remuneration to the performance of the Company 
and, where appropriate, the individual.
•	 achieving an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-
related pay.
•	 Incorporating performance metrics that support and promote the 
progression of the key performance indicators used to monitor 
performance across the wider business.
•	 Setting challenging performance targets that reward delivery  
and success.
•	 Reinforcing key business imperatives and strategy.
•	 Reflecting developments affecting our wider workforce.
In defining our Remuneration Policy we have taken into account advice 
received from external consultants and external legal counsel, best 
practice guidelines on executive remuneration issued by institutional 
bodies, such as the Investment association and ISS, and have also 
taken into account feedback from our shareholders, notably in the 
context of their historical voting at aGMs. In addition, whilst we do not 
consult employees on the formulation of the Remuneration Policy, we  
do take into account wider developments as regards our compensation 
practices for our wider employee base. This is particularly the case when 
determining salary increases for the CEO and the Executive Leadership 
Team (‘ELT’) as part of overall annual salary reviews. 
implementing our r emuneration policy
We structure remuneration packages using a mixture of fixed and 
performance-related components, and have adopted shareholding 
guidelines to ensure alignment between Executive Directors, Non- 
Executive Directors and shareholders.
Fixed components of remuneration packages for Executive Directors 
comprise base salary, pension and taxable benefits, whilst performance-
related components continue to be delivered primarily via the following 
performance-incentive plans:
•	 Short-Term Incentive (‘STI’): a cash-based annual bonus incentive 
designed to focus executives on the delivery of key short-term 
operational objectives in order to reinforce business priorities for 
each financial year. This incentive scheme is measured on the  
basis of Company-wide performance and individual performance. 
Performance metrics are set on an annual basis, reflecting wider  
key performance indicators used across our business and strategic 
objectives set for the Company. The targets for the performance 
metrics vary from year to year and take into account ongoing business 
needs and priorities when setting appropriate base, target and 
stretch thresholds. In confirming outcomes under the STI, and in 
particular under the individual performance element, the Committee 
takes a holistic view of performance to ensure that pay reflects the 
underlying performance of the Company.
•	 Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’): a long-term incentive plan that 
provides for the award of conditional shares, nil-cost options and 
restricted stock units. awards made to Executive Directors vest  
on the basis of TSR performance condition(s) (share price and 
dividends), assessed over a performance period of not less than 
three years and against a suitable comparator index. The LTIP  
aims to reward long-term decision making and performance that 
delivers long-term shareholder value and returns. The Compensation 
Committee considers that relative TSR is an appropriate performance 
measure for the LTIP because it captures objectively the shareholder 
return delivered over the long term and is less sensitive to short-term 
changes in the gold price than many alternative measures commonly 
used in LTIPs. 
although the LTIP is intended to be the primary long-term incentive for 
Executive Directors, and has been the only scheme used over the last 
three years, the Company retains flexibility to operate a Stock Option 
Plan (‘SOP’) primarily for retention and recruitment purposes. Further 
details are included in the policy table overleaf.
The proportion of Executive Director total remuneration that is 
performance-related is significant for target performance in order to  
drive a culture of pay for performance. The performance targets set for 
any given year are set at such a level as to be stretching but achievable, 
with regard to the particular strategic priorities and economic and 
industry developments for the year in question. Further details of fixed 
and performance-related components of our Remuneration Policy are 
provided in the Summary Table of Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Policy. The Compensation Committee also retains various discretions  
in order to assess Executive Director exit and severance arrangements 
when necessary, in order to ensure that any such arrangements are fair 
and reasonable in the circumstances. Further information regarding our 
approach to Executive Director recruitment is provided on page 83 and 
further information as regards our approach to determining Executive 
Director exit arrangements is provided on page 84.

Our Remuneration Policy as regards Non-Executive Directors is based  
on the payment of appointment fees, comprised of a base fee and 
additional fees for the role of Senior Independent Director, Board 
committee chair and committee membership fees. Independent 
Non-Executive Directors may also make elections to receive deferred 
share units (‘DSus’) under the Company’s Deferred Share unit Plan 
(‘DSu Plan’) in lieu of all or part of the annual fees, details of which  
are provided on page 85. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in the STI, LTIP or SOP.
use of r emuneration policy across our workforce
In general, we apply our Remuneration Policy to Executive Directors and  
all members of the Executive Leadership Team alike to ensure that all key 
individuals involved in the day to day management and oversight of the 
Company are appropriately rewarded and motivated to drive the Company 
forward. all members of the ELT are eligible for awards under the STI, LTIP 
and SOP and their performance targets are the same as, or cascaded 
from, the targets set for the Executive Directors. The Compensation 
Committee reviews and approves the individual remuneration packages  
for all members of the ELT to ensure they are appropriate in the 
circumstances. The Committee also reviews and approves all annual base 
salary increases and annual incentive awards made for these individuals 
for the same purpose. as for Executive Directors, the reward framework  
at other senior executive levels focuses heavily on performance-related 
remuneration. In addition to the ELT, key senior employees participate  
in the LTIP, including mine General Managers and members of their 
respective mine management teams, departmental and functional heads, 
and individuals who are otherwise identified as high potential/performing 
employees for business performance and succession planning purposes. 
By adopting this approach, the Company seeks to promote the alignment 
of individual interests with those of shareholders in order to drive the 
business forward.
Within the wider workforce, there is alignment on overall acacia Group 
targets under the annual bonus plan; this is then supported by relevant 
team and individual targets to focus colleagues on key deliverables in 
their area of the business. The specific bonus framework varies by job 
level and scope, as appropriate.
Summary table for executive directors’ r emuneration policy
f ixed remuneration
base salary pension benefits
Purpose To provide an appropriately competitive level of base 
salary with due regard to the size and nature of the 
responsibilities of each role, as well as an individual 
executive’s experience.
To help provide 
for an appropriate 
retirement benefit.
To provide benefits which are competitive in the 
market in which the individual is employed.
Operation Reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective  
1 January and made at the discretion of the 
Compensation Committee.
Salaries are benchmarked against international gold 
mining, general mining and FTSE listed companies  
of similar size and complexity.
The Compensation Committee also takes into 
account corporate and individual performance and 
experience; general market conditions; and salary 
increases applied within the Company as a whole.
Executive 
Directors receive 
contributions into 
a personal pension 
scheme of their 
choice, or a cash 
supplement of 
commensurate 
value.
The Group does not 
operate any defined 
benefit schemes.
Executive Directors receive benefits, which usually 
include the provision of a company car or cash 
alternative, health and life insurance, liability 
insurance, fitness club membership and 
professional membership; however, the 
Compensation Committee retains discretion to 
approve any other form of benefit that it deems 
appropriate to award depending on individual 
circumstances. For example, relocation allowances 
and international transfer-related benefits are 
often provided for, when required, in line with 
general industry practices for the recruitment  
of international employees.
Opportunity To avoid setting expectations of Executive Directors 
and other employees, no maximum salary is set 
under the Remuneration Policy. It is not anticipated 
that salary increases for Executive Directors will 
exceed those of the wider workforce over the period 
during which this Remuneration Policy is effective. 
Where increases are awarded in excess of the wider 
employee population, the Committee will provide  
the rationale in the relevant year’s annual Report  
on Remuneration.
Executive Directors 
receive pension 
contributions or  
an equivalent cash 
supplement equal  
to a percentage of 
gross base salary  
in line with market 
norms at the relevant 
point in time.
The value of benefits will generally be assessed  
on the basis of market norms at the relevant point 
in time.
The Compensation Committee retains the 
discretion to approve a higher total cost  
of benefits in exceptional circumstances  
(e.g. relocation) or in circumstances where factors 
outside the Company’s control have changed 
materially (e.g. increases in medical coverage 
inflation).
80 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 Short-term incentive (‘Sti ’)
Purpose To reinforce the delivery of key short-term operational objectives on an annual basis in order to promote performance as 
regards business priorities for each financial year in the context of individual and Company performance.
Operation Performance measure weightings and targets are set at the start of the year and weighted to reflect business priorities. at the 
end of the year, the Compensation Committee determines the extent to which targets have been achieved, taking into account 
Company-wide performance and the individual performance of each Executive Director.
STI payments are delivered in cash and are subject to appropriate clawback provisions, further details of which are included  
as a note to the policy table.
Opportunity The STI provides Executive Directors with an annual bonus opportunity in the range of 0% to 150% of base salary, with target 
bonus opportunity of up to 100% of base salary, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee.
Performance 
measures
Bonus outcomes are assessed by the Compensation Committee on a scorecard assessment, based on the achievement  
of the targets set for each performance measure and the Committee’s broad assessment of Company performance.
Performance measures are based on challenging budget and stretch targets for Company-wide financial and operational 
performance and, where appropriate, individual performance. Performance measures may include financial, operational, growth, 
production, cost and capital expenditure control and sustainability metrics. Performance measures are selected annually to 
reflect key strategic initiatives and matters underpinning the key financial and non-financial performance indicators used to 
manage performance across the acacia Group. Performance measures will be weighted appropriately each year according to  
the business plan. Weightings of performance measures may vary, typically up to 10% and 50%, with the range of performance 
required under each measure calibrated to reflect the Company’s annual published guidance range, particularly as regards 
production, cash costs and capital expenditure.
Whilst performance measures, weightings and targets for any given year will not be disclosed on a prospective basis due to 
commercial sensitivities, the Compensation Committee aims to provide such details retrospectively as part of the annual 
Report on Remuneration, unless ongoing commercial sensitivities discourage such disclosures.
l ong-term incentive plan (‘ltip ’); subject to approval of revised ltip rules
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the  
long term.
Operation awards of conditional shares, nil-cost options or restricted stock units (‘RSus’) may be granted annually, with the maximum 
value that may be awarded to each Executive Director defined as a percentage of base salary at the date of grant. Vesting is 
based on acacia’s corporate performance over a period of not less than three years. If no entitlement has been earned at the 
end of the relevant performance period, awards will lapse. 
awards under the LTIP are subject to malus and clawback provisions, further details of which are included as a note to the 
policy table. 
Opportunity The LTIP permits a maximum award with a value equal to 400% of base salary at the time of grant to be made each year under 
normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only. Such circumstances would 
include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion would be assessed in each 
case on the circumstances in question.
The level of LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors each year is determined by the Committee, within the limits set out 
above, with reference to a range of factors including individual performance ratings.
Dividends accrue on unvested LTIP awards over the vesting period and are released, to the extent the LTIP award vests, on the 
date of release.
Performance 
measures
Subject to continued employment and acacia’s relative TSR performance over the performance period when compared to a 
relevant listed index (currently comprising the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold Index). TSR performance must be at 
least equal to that of the TSR comparator group in order to receive any payment under LTIP awards, at which level 25% of the 
maximum award will vest. If no entitlement has been earned at the end of the performance period, awards will lapse.
The Compensation Committee reviews the comparator group of international gold miners against which TSR performance is 
measured from time to time to ensure it remains appropriate. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine 
the treatment of comparators in the event of their delisting or otherwise in any event which, in the opinion of the Committee, 
compromises the suitability of a company as a comparator for acacia. additionally, the Committee may, at its discretion, 
reduce the number of awards vesting in the event that the achievement against the performance condition is not a genuine 
reflection of the underlying performance of the Company. More generally, the performance measures applied to LTIP awards 
are reviewed periodically to ensure they remain aligned with shareholder interests and, in this regard, the Committee retains 
discretion to employ performance measures other than TSR to the LTIP in order to allow for performance assessments to 
evolve over time.

Share option plan (‘Sop ’)
Purpose To reinforce an enterprise culture that promotes and protects shareholders’ long-term interests, so as to reward long-term 
decision making and performance that support the delivery of shareholder returns and drive shareholder value over the  
long term.
Operation Whilst the LTIP is expected to be used as the main long-term incentive for Executive Directors going forward, the Committee 
retains the ability to grant stock options under the SOP where appropriate, such as in recruitment or retention scenarios.
The Compensation Committee will set a vesting period for SOP awards appropriate to the circumstances at the time of grant. 
Historically, this has included vesting in equal parts over four years or vesting after three years. all awards expire seven years 
from the date of grant. There are no clawback provisions included under the SOP.
Opportunity The SOP permits a maximum share option award with a value equal to 200% of base salary at the time of grant to be made 
each year under normal circumstances. The Committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances only. Such 
circumstances would include, for example, specific recruitment or retention scenarios. The exercise of this discretion would  
be assessed in each case on the circumstances in question.
In the event that a stock option award was used for annual incentive purposes, such awards would ordinarily be granted at a 
target level equal to 150% of base salary at the time of grant. In this regard, the Committee would look to use an appropriate 
valuation model, for example, the Black-Scholes model, for purposes of ascertaining the fair value of any award made.
Performance 
measures
The Compensation Committee determines the performance metrics applying to share option awards as appropriate to the 
circumstances at the time of grant, based on the purpose of making such award, i.e. whether for recruitment, retention or  
as a matter of annual performance incentive. Generally, in the event that the Committee were to grant an SOP award as an 
incentive, it would look to apply an appropriate performance condition.
Shareholding guidelines
Purpose To align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders through the building up of a significant shareholding in  
the Company.
Operation Executive Directors are required to establish a shareholding equivalent to four times base salary by retaining 50% of vested 
awards (net of tax) until the guideline has been met.
pay-for-performance: scenario analysis
The chart below provides an estimate of the potential future reward 
opportunity for the CEO, and the potential split between the different 
elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: 
Minimum, On-target and Maximum.
Potential reward opportunities are based on the Remuneration Policy.  
In each scenario, the STI and LTIP are based on the level of maximum 
opportunities in 2017 applied to the CEO’s 2017 salary. From 2017 
onwards, the LTIP awards granted in a year will not normally vest until at 
least the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, and the projected value 
excludes the impact of share price movement. 
The minimum scenario reflects the 2017 base salary, pension and prior 
year benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration) which are the only elements of the 
Chief Executive Officer’s remuneration package not linked to performance.
The on-target scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target 
STI (100% of salary) and half of the LTIP vesting (200% of salary).
The maximum scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus maximum 
payout under all incentives (150% of salary under the STI and full vesting 
of an LTIP award (400% of salary)). 
use of compensation committee discretions
Generally, it is not possible for any remuneration policy to pre-empt  
every possible scenario and for this reason the Compensation 
Committee has been provided with the ability to apply various discretions 
and judgements in order to ensure the achievement of fair outcomes and 
to maintain the flexibility required to balance the interests of individuals 
and those of the Company. For example, the Compensation Committee 
may be required to exercise discretion when determining whether or  
not the outcomes of performance measures and targets applicable to 
incentive plans are fair in context, or if realities encourage the use of 
upward or downward adjustments. By means of illustration, this may be 
the case as a result of the impact of wider socio-economic or political 
factors or market-wide developments that were generally unforeseeable 
or remote at the time of setting performance measures, but nonetheless 
occur during a performance period. It is for such reasons that the 
Compensation Committee retains a number of discretions for the 
operation of all incentive schemes (STI, LTIP and SOP) including,  
but not limited to, the ability to determine the following:
•	 Scheme participants.
•	 The timing of grant and size of awards.
•	 appropriate treatment of vesting of awards in the context of 
restructurings and/or takeovers.
•	 appropriate adjustments to awards in the event of variations to the 
Company’s share capital.
•	 absent specific bad leaver scenarios, the ability to determine and 
designate leavers as good leavers in order to determine appropriate 
treatment of awards in exit scenarios.
•	 Treatment, size and grant of awards in a recruitment context.
•	 The application, scope, weighting and targets for applicable 
performance measures and performance conditions from time  
to time, including any amendments to existing performance 
measures/conditions and related targets.

Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data,

1  award can be higher in circumstances deemed by the Committee to be exceptional, i.e. where it is necessary to buy out incentive arrangements or make offers equivalent to sign-on bonuses.
The Compensation Committee may also make an award under the terms 
of one of the Company’s incentive plans outlined above in respect of a 
new appointment to buy out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving 
a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will consider relevant 
factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, 
the likelihood of those conditions being met and the term remaining to 
their vesting. In addition, where candidates are recruited from overseas, 
the Committee may be required to consider additional benefits received 
in the home jurisdiction or arrange for a form of substitution of such 
benefits in addition to the payment of suitable relocation allowances. 
The Compensation Committee may also consider it appropriate to grant 
an award under a structure not included in the Remuneration Policy, 
exercising the discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R where 
necessary. Such an award would include, for example, a sign-on 
payment. The Compensation Committee confirms that any arrangement 
specifically established to recruit an individual would take the form of 
performance-related variable remuneration. On recruitment, the value  
of this remuneration would be capped at the limits contained in the LTIP 
and SOP or the value of awards which the individual had to surrender  
in order to be recruited, whichever is the greater. The policy that exists  
for current Executive Directors would then apply to the balance of the 
individual’s remuneration package. In addition, the Compensation 
Committee does not envisage that a cash payment such as a “golden 
hello” would be offered.
Whilst it may not be possible to give an exhaustive list of Compensation 
Committee discretions, the exercise of discretions and the rationale 
underpinning their use, if any, will generally be provided in context,  
as part of the annual Report on Remuneration. 
malus and clawback
awards under the STI and the LTIP are subject to clawback and, in 
respect of the LTIP from 2017, malus provisions which can be applied  
to both vested and unvested awards. Clawback provisions will apply  
for a period of up to one year from the end of the performance period. 
Circumstances in which malus and clawback may be applied include 
misconduct and misstatement. 
approach to recruitment of executive directors
When determining the remuneration package for a new Executive 
Director the Compensation Committee aims to offer a package that is 
sufficiently competitive, to attract, motivate and retain candidates of the 
calibre and experience required to run our business. This will generally 
be determined in each case not only in the context of the skills required 
for a position and those of each candidate, but also on the basis of 
recruitment trends within the global mining industry and any additional 
considerations relevant to the recruitment of executives. In addition, our 
approach to recruitment will also depend on whether we use external 
recruitment or internal promotion routes.
external recruitment
In determining appropriate remuneration for an external candidate, the 
Compensation Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including quantum, the nature of remuneration and the jurisdiction the 
candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. For such purposes, 
the Compensation Committee may make use of all of the existing 
components of the Remuneration Policy as follows:
83 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016
govern Ance re Muneration report CONTINu ED
internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal 
promotion, the Committee will be consistent with the policy used for 
external appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual 
commitments made prior to his or her promotion to Executive Director 
level, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements even  
in instances where they would not otherwise be consistent with the 
prevailing Remuneration Policy at the time of appointment.
approach to executive director exit arrangements
Executive Director service contracts, including arrangements for early 
termination, are carefully considered by the Compensation Committee 
and are designed to recruit, retain and motivate directors of the  
quality required to manage the Company. The Committee considers 
appointments of an indefinite term and with a notice period of one  
year to be appropriate. The service contract used for the Company’s 
current CEO, being the sole Executive Director at present, provides for 
compensation of 12 months’ salary in the event of early termination.  
The Company has the discretion to pay such compensation in 
instalments, requiring the Executive Director to mitigate loss (i.e. by 
gaining new employment) over the relevant period, or in a lump sum.  
If notice to terminate is served by either the Executive Director or the 
Company, the Executive Director can continue to receive basic salary, 
benefits and pension for the duration of his/her notice period during 
which the Company may require the individual to continue to fulfil his/her 
current duties or may assign a period of garden leave, depending on the 
circumstances in question. The service contract used for any new  
hire would be based on similar terms. The CEO’s service contract is 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
Generally, in an exit scenario the Company will honour all contractual 
entitlements, this being a matter required by the operation of law, and 
for individuals who relocated from overseas, reasonable relocation  
costs will be considered as appropriate in the circumstances.
The treatment of incentive arrangements in exit scenarios are 
considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant 
contractual terms of the individual, the circumstances of the exit and any 
applicable duty to mitigate. Generally, the payment of incentives as part 
of exit arrangements is determined on the basis of good leaver/bad 
leaver and change of control scenarios, subject to Committee 
discretions, as follows:
Sti
There is no automatic eligibility for payment under the STI. The 
Committee may exercise discretion to award a bonus for the 
performance year. Such discretion would generally only be used in good 
leaver scenarios. If an award is made, the award will be made on a 
pro-rata basis for the period of time served to the agreed termination 
date. any STI payment would be subject to applicable STI performance 
measure and target assessments for the year in question.
ltip (pre-2017) and S op
In the event of a Director’s resignation, all outstanding awards will lapse. 
For good leavers, vesting of LTIP awards is typically calculated based on 
performance to the end of the relevant performance period with awards 
pro-rated to reflect time employed, although the Committee may exercise 
discretion to waive time pro-rating of award in certain circumstances. 
Stock options for good leavers vest in full subject to the vesting schedule 
determined at grant. any stock options which remain unexercised six 
months following the vesting date will lapse.
ltip (2017 onwards)
as executive LTIP awards made from 2017 onwards have five-year 
performance and vesting periods, the treatment of awards held by 
leavers will depend on the period elapsed from the date of grant. These 
leaver conditions are drafted to ensure broad consistency of leavers with 
market norms for a more traditional LTIP with a three-year performance 
period, and two-year holding period.
If a Director leaves the Group during the first 36 months from the date  
of grant and is a bad leaver, awards will lapse. For good leavers within 
the first 36 months from the date of grant, vesting of LTIP awards will 
typically be calculated based on performance to the end of the relevant 
performance period with awards pro-rated to reflect the proportion of the 
first 36 months from grant elapsed at the time of leaving and released  
at the normal date, unless otherwise determined by the Committee.
awards for which more than 36 months have elapsed will lapse only  
in the event of misconduct on the part of the Director. In all other 
scenarios, awards will continue in the plan with no time-based reduction, 
but with vesting based on performance to the end of the relevant 
performance period and released at the normal date, unless otherwise 
determined by the Committee.
On a change of control, outstanding LTIP awards will vest according to 
performance up to the date of the event and be subject to a time-based 
reduction if such awards are less than 36 months from the grant date, 
unless the Committee determines otherwise. alternatively, acacia 
awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer 
where agreed. 
Summary termination, termination for misconduct or gross negligence  
or termination in circumstances which would justify summary termination 
are all examples of bad leaver scenarios. Good leavers include individuals 
who have left the Company as a result of retirement, injury, disability or 
death. In addition, the Compensation Committee retains the discretion  
to determine any leaver that is not a bad leaver as a good leaver. This 
discretion is viewed as necessary by the Company given the vast range of 
scenarios in which an individual may leave the Company where conduct is 
not at issue. The availability of this discretion is particularly relevant in exit 
scenarios in which an individual’s performance per se is not at issue. 
Whilst it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list of such scenarios, 
examples would include circumstances in which the Board determines a 
need to change the Company’s strategic direction or focus, or is required 
to review Board and management composition generally, as a result of 
operational or market developments, or other developments in the 
business, such as entry into new markets or a restructuring of the 
business. In any event, when exercising such discretion the Compensation 
Committee would always recognise and take into account the balance of 
shareholder interests and those of the departing individual.
84 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 executive director external appointments
It is the Board’s policy to allow Executive Directors to accept non-
executive directorships of other quoted companies for which they would 
normally be allowed to retain fees. any such directorships must be 
formally approved by the Chairman of the Board. Currently, no such 
positions are held by the Company’s sole Executive Director.
approach to non-executive director remuneration
The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre with 
broad commercial, international and other experience relevant to mining 
operations. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the 
recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee. 
Their appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to  
annual re-election by shareholders at each aGM in accordance with  
the requirements of the uK Corporate Governance Code. upon the 
recommendation of the Nomination & Governance Committee, they  
may be re-appointed for two additional terms of three years, subject  
to their continuing to satisfy requirements for continuing appointment  
and, again, subject to annual re-election by shareholders. The terms  
of engagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter  
of appointment. These letters do not contain any provision for 
compensation for early termination of office. Requirements for notice 
periods are reviewed on a case by case basis. all letters of appointment 
for Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Non-Executive Director remuneration primarily focuses on the payment of 
fees. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate in any of the 
incentive plans available to Executive Directors. However, Non-Executive 
Directors may participate in the Company’s DSu Plan. This plan provides 
Non-Executive Directors with the option to receive some or all of their 
annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment, payable only 
after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. Broadly, cash 
payments under this plan are calculated by reference to the fair market 
value of the Company’s shares at the time of payment and remain 
subject to market fluctuations in the context of the Company’s share 
price until the time of payment. This plan was adopted by the Company 
in 2012 to address certain equivalent practices and trends of North 
american mining companies to ensure that our practices for Non-
Executive Director compensation structures remain flexible and 
competitive against our global peers. DSus are granted annually, usually 
in april of each year. In addition, to align Non-Executive Director interests 
with shareholders, the Company has adopted Non-Executive Director 
shareholding guidelines for its independent Non-Executive Directors, 
which require relevant individuals to acquire a minimum shareholding 
equivalent to their annual base fee within five years from election to the 
Board, which may be satisfied through the purchase of acacia Ordinary 
Shares or by DSus holdings.
Details as regards current outstanding awards under the DSu Plan and 
acacia Ordinary Shares currently held by Non-Executive Directors are 
provided on page 95.
Summary table for non-executive director r emuneration policy
fees
Purpose To attract and retain candidates with the required skill and experience to form part of the Board and to ensure fees paid to the 
Non-Executive Directors are competitive and comparable with other companies of equivalent size and complexity operating within 
the global mining industry.
Operation The base fee for Non-Executive Directors is reviewed annually, with any adjustments effective 1 april each year. Fees payable to 
the Chairman are determined by the Compensation Committee, while the base fee and any other fee payable to the other 
Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of the Board. 
In addition to the base fee, additional fees are payable for acting as Senior Independent Director and as chair of any of the 
Board’s Committees (audit, Compensation, EHS&S, Nomination & Governance) and for individual membership of such 
Committees. These additional fees are also reviewed annually, with any adjustment effective 1 april each year. In the event that 
the Board requires the formation of an additional Board Committee, fees for the chair and membership of such Committee will be 
determined by the Board at the time.
No base fee or fee for membership of Board Committees is payable to Non-Executive Directors appointed by Barrick pursuant to 
the nomination rights contained in the Relationship agreement.
Non-Executive Director fee levels are benchmarked against international gold mining, general mining and FTSE listed companies 
of similar size and complexity. Time commitment, responsibility, and technical skills required to make a valuable contribution to 
an effective Board are taken into account when reviewing fee levels.
Opportunity Non-Executive Director fee increases are set in response to the outcome of the annual fee review. Fees for the year ending 31 
December 2016 are set out in the annual Report on Remuneration. The maximum aggregate annual fee for all Directors provided 
in the Company’s articles of association is £3,000,000.

the DSu Plan. The value of additional DSus is credited to reflect dividends paid on acacia Ordinary Shares over the period  
of participation.
Cash payments become payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. 
Cash payments are calculated by reference to the fair market value of acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and 
remain subject to market fluctuations in acacia’s share price until payment.
awards lapse in the event that an individual is summarily terminated for: (i) breach of contract; (ii) breach of Director’s duties; or 
(iii) misconduct, or if an individual resigns in circumstances justifying summary termination.
Opportunity Non-Executive Directors can waive up to 100% of their annual fee.
approach to recruitment of non-executive directors
In the case of hiring or appointing a new Non-Executive Director, the 
Board will utilise the Remuneration Policy summarised in the table 
entitled Summary Table for Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy, 
above. a base fee which is aligned with the prevailing fee schedule would 
be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting 
as Senior Independent Director or as Chair of any of the Board’s 
Committees and for individual membership of such Committees. 
Non-Executive Directors would also be eligible to waive some or all of 
their annual fees in return for a deferred right to a cash payment under 
the DSu Plan.
approach to non-executive director exit arrangements
as regards Non-Executive Director resignation, retirement or termination, 
base fee and any additional fees would be payable to the resignation/
retirement/termination date. In respect of DSu awards, save in the case 
of summary termination, termination for gross misconduct or termination 
in circumstances which would justify summary termination, DSu awards 
vest in full on leaving office, whereby the relevant cash payment made in 
respect of awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of 
an acacia Ordinary Share at the time of payment.
86 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 compensation committee membership in 2016
as of 31 December 2016, the Compensation Committee comprised  
three Non-Executive Directors, all of whom were and remain independent:
•	 Michael Kenyon (Chairman)
•	 Peter Tomsett
•	 Steve Lucas
Graham Clow served on the Committee until his retirement from the 
Board in april 2016.
The following individuals also attended meetings by invitation during the 
year and provided information to the Committee to enable it to make 
informed decisions:
•	 Brad Gordon, Chief Executive Officer
•	 Peter Geleta, Head of People
No Director is present when his or her own remuneration is being 
determined. The Compensation Committee met four times during the 
year and details of members’ attendance at meetings are provided on 
page 68. an overview of Committee activities during the year is provided 
as part of the Committee Chairman’s introduction to this report.
advisers
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
executive compensation matters from Kepler, a brand of Mercer which 
forms part of the MMC group of companies (‘Kepler’). Kepler was first 
appointed by the Compensation Committee in 2010 and retained during 
the year. The Compensation Committee evaluates the support provided 
by its advisers annually and is comfortable that the Kepler team provides 
independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have 
any connections with the Company that may impair its independence. 
Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct  
for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be found at  
www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com
In 2016, Kepler provided independent advice on trends and 
developments, reporting regulations, the LTIP TSR performance  
condition and benchmarking data for the Executive Leadership  
Team. Kepler does not advise the Company on any issues outside 
compensation and governance thereof. Kepler’s total fees for the 
provision of remuneration services in 2016 were £136,000 on the basis  
of time and materials. Other than advice on remuneration, no other 
services were provided by Kepler (or any other part of the MMC group  
of companies). The Committee also received legal advice from Travers 
Smith LLP as regards certain remuneration practices during the year,  
the total fees for which equalled £23,149.

executive director salaries
as explained in the 2015 annual remuneration report, Mr Gordon made a voluntary election to waive a proportion of base salary (10%) for 2016  
in light of prevailing market conditions in 2015. as such, his adjusted base salary for 2016 was £427,500. at the time the election was made  
the Committee noted that it would review the appropriateness of reinstating prior base salary levels at a suitable time in the future. Mr Gordon’s  
prior base salary was re-instated to £475,000 at year end for purposes of assessing 2017 salary increases. using the re-instated salary amount  
as the basis of assessment, for 2017 purposes, Mr Gordon’s salary shall be £489,250, being an increase of 3% on his reinstated 2016 salary.  
This adjustment took effect as of 1 January 2017.
non-executive director fees
For the year ending 31 December 2016, no fees were paid to Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, appointed by Barrick pursuant to  
its nomination rights under the Relationship agreement. Non-Executive Director fees are assessed in april each year. The table below reflects fees 
payable in respect of 2016, effective as of 1 april 2016. 
Fee component amount 
Base fee £76,500
Senior Independent Director fee £25,000
Chair of audit Committee fee £20,000
Chair of Compensation Committee, EHS&S Committee,  
and Nomination & Governance Committee fee
 
£15,000
Board Committee membership fee £5,000
as explained in the 2015 annual remuneration report, all independent Non-Executive Directors made a voluntary election to waive 10% of their base fee 
for 2016, with such adjustment applying as of 1 april 2016. In line with Company practice, the Board will review the independent Non-Executive Director 
fees in april 2017, with any adjustment applying as of 1 april 2017. 
executive directors’ Short-term incentive awards
For the year ending 31 December 2016, Executive Director STI awards were earned on the basis of Company-wide performance (80%), this being 
representative of the overall leadership, management and performance of an individual holding this position and also include a component to assess 
individual performance (20%). Company-wide performance measures continue to focus on the core metrics which we use to assess performance as 
regards safety, production, cost control and profit generation. These performance metrics were assessed on the basis of individual weightings and  
in line with a range of performance targets to provide for threshold, target and maximum performance, as outlined in the table opposite. The 
Committee has given careful consideration to the retrospective disclosure of 2016 and 2015 annual bonus targets and considers that these  
remain commercially sensitive at this time. It is intended that targets will be disclosed at the earliest opportunity in the next three years, provided 
they are no longer commercially sensitive at that time.
as noted in the Committee Chairman’s letter, 2016 was a record year for acacia in several ways: we delivered Group production of 829,705 ounces, 
exceeding our initial guidance range for the year of 750,000 to 780,000 and exceeding the revised guidance we gave in October 2016 (approximately 
820,000 ounces); we saw a substantial fall in aISC to uS$958 per ounce, 14% lower than in 2015 and at the bottom of our 2016 guidance range; 
and we doubled net cash on the balance sheet to uS$218 million. Regrettably safety performance was disappointing, and we saw an increase  
of 9% on TRIFR when compared to 2015. We continue to target zero injuries and, as mentioned elsewhere in the annual Report, we have seen an 
improvement in safety performance through the end of 2016. as regards the 2016 bonus assessment, Company-wide performance was assessed  
as 127.8% overall, an impressive outcome (equivalent to 77% of the CEO’s salary following the application of the Company STI weighting). 
as regards the CEO’s individual performance, Brad Gordon’s commitment to the business has been unwavering and he has continued to show strong 
leadership of the Company to drive core initiatives and programmes. Taking into account his personal achievements and commitment this year, the 
Board has assessed his personal performance levels as equivalent to 18% of base salary overall. When combined with the assessment of Company-
wide performance, this equates to a bonus rating of 95% of base salary, compared to a target of 75%. again, and as noted in the 2015 annual  
report on remuneration, the CEO 2016 STI target was to be assessed against the CEO’s re-instated base salary level, accounting for the fact that  
Mr Gordon’s initial 2016 adjusted salary was entirely voluntary. as such, the 2016 CEO STI has been assessed against a base salary of £475,000,  
and equates to a payment of £449,730 for the year.
For 2017, we have increased the CEO’s STI target opportunity to 100% to reflect our continuing commitment to pay for performance. The 2017 STI will 
be assessed against the 2017 base salary level with a maximum opportunity of 150% for maximum performance. Broadly, performance measures for 
2017 will continue to focus on production, costs, safety and profitability and will be assessed on the same basis as 2016: Company performance 
(80%) with an element of individual performance (20%).

executive director ltip awards vesting in 2016 (audited)
as noted in the Committee Chairman’s letter, Mr Gordon’s 2013 LTIP award, made at the time of his recruitment, reached the end of its three-year 
performance period. Vesting was dependent on acacia’s TSR performance against the weighted average TSR of a comparator group of international 
gold mining companies selected at the time of award grant, as follows:
Comparators
agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. IaMGOLD Corp.
angloGold ashanti Ltd Kinross Gold Corporation
Buenaventura Mining Company Petropavlovsk PLC
Centamin plc New Gold Inc

Over the relevant three-year period, acacia’s TSR of 369.1% significantly exceeded the weighted average TSR of the comparator group (37.0%),

Brad Gordon 1,631,842 20 august 2016 £5.975 £9,750,256
The Committee recognised the resulting payout from the 2013 LTIP recruitment award made to Mr Gordon was significant; it is however a true 
reflection of the performance of the Company under his tenure over the performance period. acacia has advanced significantly and the TSR 
performance assessment is reflective of the significant share price growth over the three-year period performance period, serving to illustrate the 
strong shareholder alignment that the LTIP TSR condition provides.

executive director ltip awards to be granted in respect of 2016 long-term incentive award (audited)
Subject to shareholder approval of revised LTIP rules at the 2017 aGM, Brad Gordon will receive an LTIP award in the form of nil cost options, 
representing an award with a value 400% of base salary. The market value of an acacia Ordinary Share will be determined by reference to the 
following formula after the 2017 aGM: 
Mv = s / 5 
Where:
•	 Mv is the market value of a share; and
•	 s is the sum of the middle market quotation of a share over the five days prior to the date of grant (being the five dealing days commencing on the 
date of the 2017 aGM).
The award is subject to a five-year performance period and the vesting date is the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, which is expected to be on or 
around 26 april. The award is subject to the assessment of the Company’s TSR performance against the constituents of the Euromoney Global Gold

To reflect the longer performance period, the full-vesting performance level (at which the maximum 400% of salary award would vest) has been 
increased for the 2017 cycle to 50% outperformance of the median TSR (previously 35% outperformance for the three-year cycle). as noted in the

under the three-year performance period. This is illustrated by the graphs below.

21 august 2013 841,308 – £1.60 – N/a 20 august 2020 20 august 2014 20 august 2017 841,308
as part of his recruitment package Brad Gordon received a stock option award equal to 841,308 acacia Ordinary Shares on 21 august 2013, 
representing an award with a fair market value (at the time of grant) equal to one year of base salary (£425,000). The fair market value of the award 
was ascertained using the Monte Carlo Simulation valuation (31.5% of the market value of an acacia Ordinary Share). The market price of acacia 
Ordinary Shares at the time of this award was £1.60, assessed on the basis of the average of middle market quotations from the Daily Official List of 
the LSE for the day of grant and the following two dealing days. The award vests in equal parts over four years and expires seven years from the date 
of grant. Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of a TSR performance condition similar to that outlined above for the RSu award made to Mr Gordon  
in 2013. No SOP awards were granted in respect of 2016.
as disclosed in the previous year’s report, the first and second tranches of Mr Gordon’s 2013 SOP award vested in full as at 20 august 2014 and  
20 august 2015 respectively, with 210,327 options having become exercisable to Mr Gordon on each of these dates. During the year, the third 
tranche of Mr Gordon’s 2013 SOP award was tested for performance as at 20 august 2016. Over the relevant period acacia’s TSR of 369.1% 
exceeded the weighted mean of comparators by 332.1%, and consequently a further 210,327 options became exercisable to Mr Gordon on 20 
august 2016. as at 31 December 2016, Mr Gordon had not exercised any of these vested awards. 
percentage change in ceo remuneration
The table overleaf shows the percentage change in CEO remuneration from the prior year compared to the average percentage change in 
remuneration for ELT members. Given that the Company operates across a number of diverse economies with pay levels and structures reflecting 
local market conditions, the Compensation Committee believes that using the ELT as a subset for the purposes of comparing CEO remuneration 
provides a more meaningful comparison than using pay data for all employees.

directors’ interests in acacia ordinary Shares and shareholding requirements (audited)
For 2016 purposes, Executive Directors are required to acquire a minimum holding in acacia Ordinary Shares equivalent to two times base salary  
over a period of five years. For these purposes, LTIP awards are taken into account but stock option awards made under the SOP are not taken into 
account when assessing whether or not shareholding requirements have been satisfied. Independent Non-Executive Directors are required to acquire 
a minimum holding equivalent to their annual base fee within five years of election to the Board, which may be satisfied via the acquisition of acacia 
Ordinary Shares or by the receipt of DSu awards under the acacia DSu Plan. The table below shows the shareholding of each Director against their 
respective shareholding requirement as at 31 December 2016 along with the form of their interests in acacia Ordinary Shares.

(b)  The Company’s DSu Plan for Non-Executive Directors provides Non-Executive Directors with the option to receive some or all of their annual fees in return for a deferred right  
to a cash payment, payable only after a participant ceases to hold office with the Company. Broadly, cash payments under this plan are calculated by reference to the fair  
market value of acacia’s Ordinary Shares at the time of payment and remain subject to market fluctuations in the context of acacia’s share price until the time of payment.
(c)  as regards Executive Directors this is calculated by reference to annual base salary at the time of the relevant individual’s appointment against the value of relevant awards at  
the time of grant. as regards existing Independent Non-Executive Directors, this is calculated by reference to either: (i) the annual Non-Executive Director base fee at the time  
of adopting the guidelines, if appointed to the Board at that time; or (ii) the annual Non-Executive Director base fee at the time of appointment, assessed against the higher of:  
(i) the number of shares multiplied by the mid market price on the last trading day before the valuation date; or (ii) the number of shares multiplied by the share price on the  
date of acquisition of each relevant interests during the applicable five-year acquisition period.

global ghg emissions data for period 1 j anuary 2016  
to 31 december 2016 (unaudited)
according to the GHG Protocol developed by the World Business Council 
for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, GHG 
emissions are classified as either direct or indirect, and from there are 
divided further into Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. Direct 
GHG emissions are emissions from sources that are owned or controlled 
by the reporting entity. Indirect GHG emissions are emissions that are a 
consequence of the activities of the reporting entity but that occur at 
sources owned or controlled by another entity. Each scope is classified 
as follows:
•	 Scope 1 emissions: direct emissions from sources owned or operated 
by our Company.
•	 Scope 2 emissions: indirect emissions attributable to our Company 
due to its consumption of purchased electricity, notably our 
consumption of electricity from TaNESCO.
•	 Scope 3 emissions: all other indirect emissions associated with 
activities that support or supply our Company’s operations.
unlike previous years, for 2016, we have calculated acacia’s Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions footprint on the basis of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (CO
2
e) emissions. Going forward, we will also look at 
opportunities to monitor and calculate Scope 3 emissions.

Total CO
2
e emissions for 2016 amounted to 287,606 tonnes, a marginal 
increase on 2015 (285,473 CO
2
e). The increase is due to a slightly lower 
consumption of purchased electricity from hydropower sources due to 
low availability. 
CO
2
e emission intensity for the year was 0.0293 per tonne of ore milled, 
this being an 5% decrease on 2015 (0.0308). Further information as 
regards our GHG emissions reporting for 2016 is provided on page 27.

provisions/significant agreements with directors/ 
controlling Shareholders 
The Directors consider the following as material agreements/
arrangements for acacia’s business and operations, which alter or 
terminate on a change of control of acacia and/or significant agreements 
with Directors/Barrick:
•	 r elationship agreement: see page 69 of this report for an overview of 
the Relationship agreement. In addition to the Relationship agreement, 
acacia entered into a Services agreement with Barrick in February 
2010 as part of arrangements for the IPO, under which Barrick 
provides certain services to the acacia Group for the ongoing 
operation of the business. These services include support for 
information technology, technical services and other administrative 
and corporate functions. The agreement’s termination events include 
a basis for either party to terminate the agreement with immediate 
effect in the event of specified breaches of the agreement, insolvency, 
analogous events or a change of control. Whilst this agreement 
remains in force, limited services are provided under it and no 
services provided are deemed to be material or significant.
•	 credit agreement: an overview of the Credit agreement between, 
among others, the Company and Citibank International plc as 
administrative agent, is provided in Note 9 to the consolidated 
financial statements on page 136. a change of control is a mandatory 
prepayment event under the Credit agreement and, subject to certain 
exceptions, a termination event.
acacia’s mining concessions are held by its operating companies in 
Tanzania. under applicable law, a change of control of the operating 
companies requires the consent of the Minister of Energy and Minerals 
in Tanzania. In addition, each acacia Group operating mine has a Mineral 
Development agreement (‘MDa’) with the Tanzanian Government. The 
material terms and conditions of each MDa are substantially similar and 
include provisions governing royalty payments, taxes and other charges, 
banking arrangements, local procurement obligations, and import rights. 
The MDas also provide for no expropriation or nationalisation rights. 
Broadly, these rights provide that the Tanzanian Government will not 
nationalise or compulsorily acquire the whole or any part of acacia’s 
interest in the applicable special mining licences or any of its property  
or its contractors’ or subcontractors’ property used for the purpose of 
mining operations or in relation to the applicable special mining licences, 
without adequate compensation. Each MDa is governed by Tanzanian 
law. adherence to the terms and conditions of the MDas is of significant 
importance to acacia’s business, given the agreements’ overall 
importance to our operations.
Certain employment contracts for members of the Company’s Executive 
Leadership Team, excluding the current CEO, contain change of control 
provisions, which provide entitlements to severance payments in the 
event of being dismissed without cause or resigning for good reason in 
the 12 months following a change of control. any payment made under 
these arrangements would replace the entitlement to receive payment 
under applicable contractual notice periods in each case. Special 
provisions also allow the early exercise of awards made under the 
Company’s Stock Option Plan (‘SOP’) and early vesting of awards made 
under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’), in the event of a takeover, 
reconstruction or winding up. In such circumstances, the Compensation 
Committee determines whether and to what extent options or awards 
become exercisable, by taking into account all relevant facts and 
circumstances including, but not limited to, satisfaction of any applicable 
performance condition. When determining the vesting of LTIP awards or 
options, the Compensation Committee may proportionately reduce the 
award depending on the time which has elapsed between the first day of 
the performance period and the date of change of control. alternatively, 
awards may be exchanged for new equivalent awards where appropriate.

voting rights
Subject to any special rights or voting restrictions contained in the 
articles of association for any class of share, at any general meeting 
every member who is present in person or by proxy shall, on a show of 
hands, have one vote and every member present in person or by proxy 
shall, on a poll, have one vote for each share of which he or she is the 
holder. a resolution put to a vote of the meeting shall be decided on a 
show of hands, unless a poll is duly demanded. Subject to the provisions 
of the Companies act 2006, a poll may be demanded by the Chairman; 
by at least five members who have the right to vote at the meeting; by  
a member or members representing not less than one-tenth of the total 
voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; 
or by a member or members holding shares conferring a right to vote  
at the meeting, being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid 
up equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the 
shares conferring that right. unless the Directors otherwise determine,  
a shareholder is not entitled to vote at a shareholders’ meeting, either  
in person or by proxy, or to exercise any other right conferred by 
membership in relation to a shareholders’ meeting, unless and until all 
calls or other sums presently payable by him or her in respect of that 
share with interest and expenses (if any) have been paid to the Company 
or if he/she or any other person appearing to be interested in shares has 
been issued with a notice pursuant to Section 793 of the Companies act 
2006 (requiring disclosure of interest in shares) and has failed to provide 
the required information within 14 days from the service of the notice.

govern Ance dividend rights
The Board may declare and pay dividends on any class of shares carrying 
a fixed dividend expressed to be payable on fixed dates and may from  
time to time pay interim dividends as it thinks fit. Final dividends shall  
be declared by Ordinary Shareholder resolution, in accordance with Board 
recommendations. No dividend declared by shareholders shall exceed  
the amount recommended by the Board. Provided that the Board acts in 
good faith, it shall not incur any liability to shareholders for any loss that 
they may suffer by the lawful payment of any fixed or interim dividend  
on any shares ranking after or pari passu with those shares. Except as 
otherwise provided by the rights attached to shares, all dividends shall  
be apportioned and paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the 
shares during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the 
dividend is paid, but if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall 
rank for dividend as from a particular date, it shall rank for dividend 
accordingly. No amount paid up on a share in advance of the date  
on which a call is payable shall be treated as paid up on the share.
Payment of any dividend declared may be satisfied wholly or partly by  
the distribution of specific assets, and in particular of paid up shares or 
debentures of the Company, with shareholder approval. The Directors may 
retain any dividend or other money payable on or in respect of a share on 
which the Company has a lien and may apply the same towards satisfaction 
of the monies payable to the Company in respect of that share.
unless the Directors otherwise determine, the payment of any dividend 
or other money that would otherwise be payable in respect of shares  
will be withheld, and the Company shall have no obligation to pay  
interest on it, if such shares represent at least 0.25% of the nominal 
value of the issued share capital of their class and the holder, or any 
other person appearing to be interested in those shares, has been 
issued with a Section 793 notice and has failed to supply the information 
required by such notice within 14 days. Furthermore, such a holder  
shall not be entitled to elect to receive shares instead of a dividend.  
The payment by the Board of any unclaimed dividend or other monies  
on or in respect of a share into a separate account shall not constitute 
acacia a trustee in respect thereof. all dividends unclaimed for a period 
of 12 years after having been declared or become due for payment  
shall be forfeited and shall revert to acacia.
transfer of shares
Subject to any applicable restrictions, each member may transfer all  
or any of his or her shares, which are in certificated form, by instrument 
of transfer in writing in any usual form or in any other form acceptable  
to the Board and may be under hand only. Such instrument shall be 
executed by or on behalf of the transferor and (in the case of a transfer 
of a share which is not fully paid up) by or on behalf of the transferee. 
The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of such share until 
the name of the transferee is entered in the register in respect of it.
all transfers of shares which are in uncertificated form shall, unless the 
CREST regulations otherwise provide, be effected on a relevant system.
The Directors may, in their absolute discretion and without giving any 
reason, refuse to register any transfer of a share in certificated form  
(or renunciation of a renounceable letter of allotment) unless:
(i) it is in respect of a share which is fully paid up;
(ii) it is in respect of only one class of shares;
(iii) it is in favour of not more than four joint transferees;
(iv) it is lodged duly stamped (if so required) at the transfer office;
(v) it is accompanied by the relevant certificate for the shares to which  
it relates and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably 
require to prove the title of the transferor and the due execution  
of the transfer or, if the transfer is executed by some other person  
on his behalf, the authority of that person to do so; and
(vi) in the case of partly paid shares listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, such refusal would prevent dealings in such shares from 
taking place on an open and proper basis.
unless the Board otherwise determines, a transfer of shares will not  
be registered if the transferor or any other person appearing to be 
interested in the transferor’s shares has been issued with Section 793 
shares in respect of shares representing at least 0.25% of their class 
and the relevant information has not been supplied within 14 days. This 
restriction on transfer will not automatically apply if the member is not 
personally in default as regards supplying the information required and 
the proposed transfer is only part of the member’s holding, provided that 
certain requirements are satisfied at the time of presenting the transfer

If the Company is wound up the liquidator may, with the sanction of  
a shareholder special resolution, divide the whole or any part of the 
Company’s assets between shareholders. In such circumstances  
the liquidator may value any assets and determine how the division  
shall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes  
of shareholder. Subject to certain requirements, the liquidator may also 
vest any part of the assets in trustees on such trusts for the benefit  
of the shareholders, but no shareholder shall be compelled to accept  
any assets on which there is a liability.
variation of rights
If at any time the share capital of the Company is divided into shares  
of different classes, rights attached to a class may only be varied in  
such manner (if any) as may be provided by prescribed rights or, in the 
absence of any such provision, either with the consent in writing of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued 
shares of the class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed  
at a separate general meeting of the holders of shares of the class duly 
convened and held.

100 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 powers of directors 
managing the business
acacia’s business is managed by the Board, and the articles of 
association permit the Board to exercise all of the Company’s powers  
in this regard. These powers may be exercised by any meeting of the 
Board at which a quorum of two Directors is present. The power of the 
Board to manage the business is subject to any limitations imposed  
by the Companies act, the articles of association or any directions  
given by special resolution of the shareholders applicable at a relevant 
time. The articles contain an express authority for the appointment  
of Executive Directors and provide the Directors with the authority to 
delegate or confer upon such Directors any of the powers exercisable  
by them upon such terms and conditions and with such restrictions  
as they see fit. The articles contain additional authorities to delegate 
powers and discretions to Board committees and subcommittees.
borrowing powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and any other applicable law, the Directors may exercise  
all the powers of the Company to borrow money, guarantee, indemnify, 
mortgage or charge its undertaking, property (present and future) and 
uncalled capital or any part or parts thereof and issue debentures and 
other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for any debt, 
liability or obligation of acacia or of any third party up to a maximum 
amount of two times the aggregate of the Group’s adjusted total equity, 
calculated in accordance with the procedure contained in the articles  
of association. Borrowings in excess of this amount require prior 
shareholder approval.
new issues of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies act 2006, the CREST 
regulations and every other enactment for the time being in force relating 
to the Directors’ authority to allot shares and/or the disapplication  
of pre-emption rights and to any resolution of the Company in general 
meeting regarding the same, the Directors may allot (with or without 
conferring a right of renunciation), grant options over or otherwise 
dispose of them to such persons, at such times and on such terms  
as they think appropriate.
acacia’s shareholders passed the following resolutions relating to  
the allotment and pre-emption right disapplications at the 2016 aGM:
•	 The Directors were granted authority to allot new shares (or grant 
rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares) up to a 
nominal value of £13,532,821, equivalent to approximately 33% of 
the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company, exclusive of 
treasury shares, at the time of passing the resolution. In addition to 
this, the Directors were also granted authority to allot additional new 
shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into 
shares) up to a further nominal amount of £13,532,821, but only in 
connection with a rights issue.
•	 Pre-emption rights were disapplied over new shares allotted  
for cash pursuant to the authority granted at (i) above, but only:  
(a) in connection with a pre-emptive offer or rights issue; or  
(b) otherwise up to a nominal value of £4,100,854 (equivalent  
to approximately 10% of the Company’s total issued Ordinary Share 
capital at the time of passing the resolution).
These authorities have not been exercised during the reporting  
period and will expire on the date of the forthcoming aGM. Equivalent 
resolutions for a renewal of these authorities will be put to the 
shareholders at the forthcoming aGM. The resolution sought as  
regards pre-emption right disapplication reflects the requirements of  
the Pre-Emption Group’s revised Statement of Principles that provide  
for certain non-pre-emptive allocations in the context of acquisitions  
and specified capital investments.
appointment and replacement of directors
Shareholders may appoint any person who is willing to act as a Director 
by ordinary resolution and may remove any Director by ordinary resolution. 
The Board may appoint any person to fill any vacancy or as an additional 
Director, provided that they are submitted for re-election by the 
shareholders at the aGM following their appointment.
Specific conditions apply to the vacation of office, including cases where 
a Director becomes prohibited by law or regulation from holding office,  
or is persistently absent from Directors’ meetings, or if three-quarters  
of appointed Directors request his or her resignation or in the case of 
mental incapacity or bankruptcy. Barrick’s rights to appoint Directors  
are summarised on page 69. additional information regarding Director 
re-election requirements is provided on page 67 as part of the corporate

for preparing the annual Report, the consolidated financial 
statements and parent company financial statements  
in accordance with applicable law and regulation.
r esponsibility for financial statements
The Companies act 2006 requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. under that law the Directors have 
prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)  
as adopted by the European union. under company law, the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied  
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group  
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to: 
•	 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
•	 Make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
•	 State whether applicable IFRS as adopted by the European union 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and

102 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 reserves and resources
Mineral reserves and mineral resources estimates contained in this 
annual Report have been calculated as at 31 December 2016 in 
accordance with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian 
securities regulatory authorities, unless otherwise stated. Canadian 
Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (‘CIM’) definitions were 
followed for mineral reserves and resources. Calculations have been 
reviewed, verified (including estimation methodology, sampling, analytical 
and test data) and compiled by acacia personnel under the supervision 
of acacia Qualified Persons: John Haywood, Chief Geologist – 
Operations, and Samuel Pobee, Chief advisor Planning and Mine 
Optimisation. However, the figures stated are estimates and no 
assurances can be given that the indicated quantities of metal will be 
produced. In addition, totals stated may not add up due to rounding.
Mineral reserves have been calculated using an assumed long-term 
average gold price of uS$1,100.00 per ounce, a silver price of uS$15.00 
per ounce and a copper price of uS$2.50 per pound. Reserve 
calculations incorporate current and/or expected mine plans and  
cost levels at each property.
Mineral resources at acacia mines have been calculated using an 
assumed long-term average gold price of uS$1,400.00 per ounce,  
a silver price of uS$15.00 per ounce and a copper price of uS$2.50  
per pound.
Mineral resources at acacia exploration properties have been calculated 
using an assumed long-term average gold price of uS$1,500.00 per 
ounce for Tankoro (50% JV holding with Sarama Resources) and Golden 
Ridge; whilst Nyanzaga (90% JV holding with OreCorp) is a foreign 
estimate compiled to JORC Code 2012 and reported above a lower 
cut-off grade of 1.5g/t.
Resources have been estimated using varying cut-off grades, depending 
on the type of mine or project, its maturity and ore types at each 
property. Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing 
economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and 
any other relevant new information and therefore these can vary from 
year to year. Resource estimates can also change and tend to be 
influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding  
of the deposit and secondly the conversion to ore reserves. In addition, 
estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an 
economic analysis and it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an 
inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. 
Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of 
an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally 
mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, 
investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured  
or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves.
definitions 
a mineral r esource
a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or 
on the Earth’s crust in such form, grade or quality and quantity that there 
are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, 
quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other geological characteristics 
of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific 
geological evidence and knowledge, including sampling. Material of 
economic interest refers to diamonds, natural solid inorganic material,  
or natural solid fossilised organic material including base and precious 
metals, coal, and industrial minerals. Mineral Resources are sub-divided, 
in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and 
Measured categories. an Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level  
of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource.  
an Indicated Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than  
an Inferred Mineral Resource but has a lower level of confidence than  
a Measured Mineral Resource.
an inferred mineral r esource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality 
are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling 
gathered through appropriate sampling techniques from locations such 
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. Geological evidence 
is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality 
continuity. an Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 
than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be 
converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the 
majority of Inferred Mineral Resources could be upgraded to Indicated 
Mineral Resources with continued exploration. 
an indicated mineral r esource
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics are estimated with 
sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying Factors in 
sufficient detail to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from adequately 
detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient 
to assume geological and grade or quality continuity between points  
of observation. an Indicated Mineral Resource has a lower level of 
confidence than that applying to a Measured Mineral Resource and  
may only be converted to a Probable Mineral Reserve. 
a measured mineral r esource 
The part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying Factors to 
support detailed mine planning and final evaluation of the economic 
viability of the deposit. Geological evidence is derived from detailed  
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to confirm 
geological and grade or quality continuity between points of observation. 
a Measured Mineral Resource has a higher level of confidence than that 
applying to either an Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral 
Resource. It may be converted to a Proven Mineral Reserve or to a 
Probable Mineral Reserve.
a mineral r eserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral 
Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which 
may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by 
studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include 
application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the 
time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified. Mineral 
Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable 
Mineral Reserves and Proven Mineral Reserves. a Probable Mineral 
Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proven Mineral Reserve.
modifying f actors
These are considerations used to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral 
Reserves. These include, but are not restricted to, mining, processing, 
metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, 
social and governmental factors.
a probable mineral r eserve
The economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some 
circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the 
Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral Reserve is lower than 
that applying to a Proven Mineral Reserve. Probable Mineral Reserve 
estimates must be demonstrated to be economic, at the time of 
reporting, by at least a Pre-Feasibility Study.
a proven mineral r eserve
The economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.  
a Proven Mineral Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in  
the Modifying Factors. Proven Mineral Reserve estimates must be 
demonstrated to be economic, at the time of reporting, by at least  
a Pre-Feasibility Study.

our opinion
In our opinion, acacia Mining plc’s Group financial statements (the 
‘financial statements’):
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at  
31 December 2016 and of its profit and cash flows for the year  
then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European 
union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of  
the Companies act 2006 and article 4 of the IaS Regulation.
w hat we have audited
The financial statements, included within the annual Report and 
accounts (the ‘annual Report’), comprise:
•	 the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2016;
•	 the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement  
of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
•	 the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
•	 the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and
•	 the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
annual Report, rather than in the notes to the financial statements. 
These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are 
identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the financial statements is IFRSs as adopted by  
the European union, and applicable law.
our audit approach
overview
materiality •	 Overall Group materiality: uS$7.4 million which 
represents approximately 5% of three-year 
average profit before tax adjusted for items 
included within “Other Income” (as presented 
on the face of the consolidated income 
statement and detailed within note 9).
audit scope •	 We identified three mine sites located in 
Tanzania which, in our view, required an audit  
of their complete financial information.
•	 We conducted audit procedures in London, 
South africa and Tanzania.
•	 Taken together, the territories and functions 
where we performed our audit work accounted 
for 100% of revenue and approximately 93% of 
absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the 
numerical values without regard to whether 
they were profits or losses for the relevant 
territories and functions).
areas of focus •	 Impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment.
•	 Taxation including provisions for uncertain 
deferred tax positions and the recoverability  
of indirect taxes.
t he scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards  
on auditing (uK and Ireland) (‘ISas (uK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks 
of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example 
in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. 
as in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was 
evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our 
audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table overleaf. We have also set out how we 
tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we 
make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

impairment assessments of goodwill, intangible assets  
and property, plant & equipment
Refer to page 72 (audit Committee report), page 51 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), page 120 (principal accounting policies) and 
Note 6.
acacia Mining has goodwill of uS$127.9 million, indefinite-lived intangible 
assets of uS$88.3 million and property, plant and equipment of 
uS$1,443.2 million as at 31 December 2016, primarily contained within  
the following cash generating units (‘CGus’): Bulyanhulu, North Mara,  
and Buzwagi.
The Bulyanhulu CGu, which has a carrying value of uS$1,231.8 million, 
includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and therefore must 
be tested for impairment on an annual basis. Management determined that 
the recoverable amount of the CGu including the goodwill exceeded the 
carrying value. 
Management must also determine the recoverable amount for other assets 
including property, plant and equipment when indicators of impairment or 
impairment reversal are identified.
at the end of 2016, the Buzwagi and North Mara CGus had a carrying value 
of $97.2 million and $246.2 million respectively. 
Impairments were historically recognised at the North Mara CGu in 2013 
(uS$307.3 million), and at the Buzwagi CGu in 2013 and 2015 (uS$690.5 
million and uS$188.7 million respectively). Having considered the original 
factors that led to the impairments, the performance in the current year and 
the latest life of mine plans for these CGus, management has not reversed 
any of the historic impairment charges.
The determination of recoverable amount was based on the higher of 
value-in-use and fair value less costs to dispose, which requires judgement 
on the part of management in valuing the relevant CGus.
Recoverable amounts are based on management’s views of variables such 
as future commodity prices, the most appropriate discount rate and timing 
and approval of future capital and operating expenditure.
Based on management’s assessment of carrying value, the headroom  
at the Bulyanhulu CGu decreased compared to the prior year as a result  
of a reduction in reserves from the life of mine plan, whereas the headroom 
at North Mara and Buzwagi has increased primarily as a result of  
increased grade. 
In assessing the valuation of the CGus, we evaluated management’s 
future cash flow forecasts for each CGu, and the process by which they 
were drawn up, including verifying the mathematical accuracy of the  
cash flow models and agreeing future capital and operating expenditure 
to the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved life of  
mine plans.
For each CGu we used our valuation specialists to assist us in  
evaluating the appropriateness of key market related assumptions in 
management’s valuation models, including both short-term and long-term 
gold prices, and discount rates. We satisfied ourselves that the gold 
price assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount are 
within a reasonable observable range, however noted that the discount 
rates used are at the low end of the observable range. 
We assessed management’s future forecasts of capital and operating 
expenses included in the cash flow forecasts in light of the historical 
accuracy of such forecasts and the current operational results and found 
these to be reasonable.
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions within the 
cash flow models using a range of higher discount rates and different 
long-term gold prices based on what, in our view, a market participant 
may apply.
Our sensitivity analysis highlighted that the Bulyanhulu model is sensitive 
to changes in discount rate, however a reasonable possible change in 
assumptions did not remove headroom or result in impairment. We 
satisfied ourselves that this was appropriately highlighted within the 
disclosures in Note 6.
With regards to reversal of previously recognised impairments, we 
considered the factors that led to the initial impairments; namely 
fundamental changes in the mine plans and a significant decrease in  
the long-term gold prices. We satisfied ourselves that the increase in 
recoverable amount in the current year at North Mara and Buzwagi did 
not arise from a reversal of these factors. We consider management’s 
decision not to reverse the impairments as appropriate.

taxation including provisions for uncertain deferred tax positions and the 
recoverability of indirect taxes
Refer to page 72 (audit Committee report), page 51 (critical accounting 
estimates and judgements), page 120 (principal accounting policies) and 
Note 33.
The Group has material deferred tax balances which include prior year  
tax loss assessments some of which are in dispute with the Tanzanian 
Revenue authority.
In addition, the Group has recorded significant indirect tax receivables,  
of which a material amount has not been refunded in a timely manner. 
These receivables have been classified as current in 2017 due to the offset 
process agreed with the Tanzanian Revenue authority under a Memorandum 
of Settlement.
We have read correspondence between Management and the Tanzanian 
Revenue authority, including the results of the tax assessments 
completed during the year, and assessed management’s position in 
relation to the specific matters under review. 
In relation to deferred tax, we also assessed the availability of estimated 
future taxable income to utilise recognised carry forward losses and the 
reversal of temporary deferred tax differences, by comparing the 
estimates to the latest Board approved budgets and the latest approved 
life of mine plans. We satisfied ourselves that support for the recognition 
of the deferred tax balances was consistent with the forecasts used 
elsewhere in the business, and was reasonable.
We also assessed the recoverability of the indirect tax receivable based 
on payments received to date and confirmation that the Memorandum  
of Settlement with the Tanzanian Revenue authority exists and is 
operating effectively. 
We considered the classification of the indirect tax receivable as a 
current asset and satisfied ourselves that it was appropriate based  
on the forecasted usage in 2017.
We examined the annual Report disclosures and confirmed the risk 
associated with recovery was appropriately highlighted
how we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the 
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the  
Group operates. 
The Group’s assets and operations are primarily located at three mine 
sites in Tanzania, representing the Group’s three CGus noted above. 
Financial reporting processes related to the activities of these mine sites 
are undertaken at shared business centres (‘SBCs’) located in Dar es 
Salaam and Johannesburg.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined 
the type of work that is needed to be performed at each of the three 
mine sites and the SBCs by us, as the Group engagement team, and  
by component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under 
our instruction. We requested that full scope audits were performed at 
each of the three main mine sites which included the relevant SBC. In 
addition, we conducted other audit procedures in London, South africa 
and Tanzania, including specified procedures performed by a component 
audit team in South africa over exploration expenses incurred within 
acacia Exploration Kenya. Where the work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in 
the audit work at those sites and SBCs to be able to conclude whether 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Involvement of the Group engagement team included attendance at 
acacia’s South african offices, conference calls and meetings with the 
Tanzanian audit team, review of the Tanzanian auditor work papers, 
attendance at local audit clearance meetings, and other forms of 
communication as considered necessary depending on the significance 
of the accounting and audit issues arising. Mine sites are visited on a 
rotational basis.
Taken together, the territories and functions where we performed our 
audit work accounted for 100% of revenue and approximately 93% of 
absolute profit before tax (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without 
regard to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant territories 
and functions).
materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of  
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on 
the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in 
evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the 
financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole as follows:
overall group 
materiality
uS$7.4 million (2015: uS$5.7 million).
how we  
determined it
approximately 5% of three-year average profit before tax 
adjusted for items included within “Other Income” (as 
presented on the face of the consolidated income 
statement and detailed within note 9).
r ationale for 
benchmark  
applied
This year, there continues to be volatility resulting from 
movements in the gold market. To eliminate this volatility, 
our materiality benchmark is calculated on average 
adjusted profit over the last three years. We continued  
to determine materiality based on 5% of our chosen 
benchmark.
We agreed with the audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above uS$1 million (2015: 
uS$1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in  
our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

statement, set out on page 51, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
under ISas (uK & Ireland) we are required to report to you if we have 
anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to the 
Directors’ statement about whether they considered it appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to. 
as noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it 
is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has 
adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it 
to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. as part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of 
the going concern basis is appropriate. However, because not all future 
events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a 
guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

the Directors’ explanation on page 29 of the annual 
Report, in accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
Code, as to how they have assessed the prospects 
of the Group, over what period they have done so

under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group and the Directors’ statement in relation 
to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially 
less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and 
considering the Directors’ process supporting their statements; checking 
that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the 
Code; and considering whether the statements are consistent with the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing our audit. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
adequacy of information and explanations received 
under the Companies act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in  
our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from 
this responsibility. 
directors’ remuneration
under the Companies act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.

under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to ten further provisions of the

112 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 r eSpon Sibilitie S for the financial S tatement S  
and the audit
our responsibilities and those of the directors
as explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set 
out on page 102, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and  
fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISas (uK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for 
the parent company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our  
prior consent in writing.
w hat an audit of financial statements involves
an audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by  
the Directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information  
in the annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the  
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent  
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the  
audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect 
to the Strategic report and Directors’ Report, we consider whether those 
reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.
other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial 
statements of acacia Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2016 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited.

notes to the consolidated financial state Ments
119 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016
fin AnciA l st Ate Ments 2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies  
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
a) basis of preparation
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European union (‘IFRS’), IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(‘IFRIC’) interpretations and those parts of the Companies act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements 
are prepared on a going concern basis.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under  
the historical cost convention basis, as modified by the revaluation of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) 
at fair value through profit or loss.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in united States 
dollars (‘uS$’) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand  
uS dollars except when otherwise indicated.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year  
and current year financial statements has been made during the period, 
comparative figures have been restated accordingly. No presentational 
changes were made in the current year.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS  
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the 
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates  
are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed  
in Note 2d.
b) new and amended standards adopted by the group
The following amendments to standards are applicable and were 
adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2016:
•	 amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IaS 
28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on applying the 
consolidation exemption. The amendments clarify the application of 
the consolidation exception for investment entities and their 
subsidiaries. The amendment did not have a significant impact on the 
Group financial statements.
•	 amendment to IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ on acquisition of an 
interest in a joint operation. This amendment adds new guidance on 
how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 
that constitutes a business. The amendment did not have a 
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendments to IaS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ 
disclosure initiative. In December 2014 the IaSB issued amendments 
to clarify guidance in IaS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the 
presentation of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and 
the disclosure of accounting policies. The amendment did not have a 
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendment to IaS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IaS 38, 
‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation. In this 
amendment the IaSB has clarified that the use of revenue based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an 
asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IaSB has also clarified 
that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for 
measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in an 
intangible asset. The amendment did not have a significant impact on 
the Group financial statements.
•	 amendments to IaS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ on equity 
accounting. In this amendment the IaSB has restored the option to 
use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates in an entity’s separate financial 
statements. The amendment did not have a significant impact on the 
Group financial statements.
•	 IFRS 5, ‘Non-current assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’. This is an amendment to the changes in methods of 
disposal – assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of 
either through sale or through distribution to owners. The amendment 
to IFRS 5 clarifies that changing from one of these disposal methods 
to the other should not be considered to be a new plan of disposal, 
rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is therefore no 
interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. The 
amendment also clarifies that changing the disposal method does  
not change the date of classification. The amendment did not have a 
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. applicability of the 
offsetting disclosures to condensed interim financial statements. The 
amendment removes the phrase ‘and interim periods within those 
annual periods’ from paragraph 44R, clarifying that these IFRS 7 
disclosures are not required in the condensed interim financial report. 
However, the Board noted that IaS 34 requires an entity to disclose 
an explanation of events and transactions that are significant to an 
understanding of the changes in financial position and performance 
of the entity since the end of the last annual reporting period. 
Therefore, if the IFRS 7 disclosures provide a significant update to the 
information reported in the most recent annual report, the Board 
would expect the disclosures to be included in the entity’s condensed 
interim financial report. The amendment did not have a significant 
impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 IaS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’. Discount rate: regional market issue –
The amendment to IaS 19 clarifies that market depth of high-quality 
corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the 
obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the 
obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high-quality 
corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be 
used. The amendment did not have a significant impact on the Group 
financial statements.
c) new and amended standards and interpretations  
not yet adopted 
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2017:
•	 amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IaS 
28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on sale or 
contribution of assets. The IaSB has issued this amendment to 
eliminate the inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IaS 28. The IaSB 
decided to defer the application date of this amendment, until such 
time this is not applicable. The amendment is however not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendments to IaS 12, ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax assets for 
unrealised Losses’. amendments made to IaS 12 will aim to clarify 
the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair 
value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Effective 1 
January 2017. The amendment is however not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendments to IaS 7, ‘Disclosure Initiative’. Going forward, entities 
will be required to explain changes in their liabilities arising from 
financing activities. This includes changes arising from cash flows 
(e.g. drawdowns and repayments of borrowings) and non-cash 
changes such as acquisitions, disposals, accretion of interest and 
unrealised exchange differences. Changes in financial assets must 
be included in this disclosure if the cash flows were, or will be, 
notes to the consolidated financial state Ments CONTINu ED
120 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 included in cash flows from financing activities. Effective 1 January 
2017. The amendment is however not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group.
•	 IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. This standard is a 
single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts 
with customers to achieve greater consistency in the recognition and 
presentation of revenue. Revenue is recognised based on the 
satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control of 
good or service transfers to a customer. Effective 1 January 2018. 
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on  
the Group.
•	 IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009 & 2010). The IaSB has updated 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ to include guidance on financial 
liabilities and de-recognition of financial instruments. The accounting 
and presentation for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial 
instruments has been relocated from IaS 39, ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement’, without change, except for financial 
liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The standard is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendment to IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, on general hedge 
accounting. The IaSB has amended IFRS 9 to align hedge accounting 
more closely with an entity’s risk management. The revised standard 
also establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge 
accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the 
current model in IaS 39. The transitional provisions described above 
are likely to change once the IaSB completes all phases of IFRS 9. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The amendment is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group.
•	 IFRS 16, ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 supersedes IaS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, 
‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, 
‘Operating Leases – Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the 
Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. 
Effective 1 January 2019. The standard is not expected to have a 
significant impact on the Group.
d) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Many of the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
require management to make judgements and/or estimates. These 
judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are based  
on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant facts 
and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the consolidated financial statements. The life of mine  
plans are central to a number of key estimates. Information about  
such judgements and estimations is included in the accounting policies  
and/or notes to the consolidated financial statements, and the key  
areas are summarised below. areas of judgement and key sources  
of estimation uncertainty that have the most significant effect on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements include:
•	 Estimates of the quantities of proven and probable gold and copper 
reserves – Note 2h.
•	 Estimates included within the life of mine planning such as the  
timing and viability of processing of long-term stockpiles – Note 2n.
•	 The capitalisation of production stripping costs – Note 2i.
•	 The capitalisation of exploration and evaluation expenditures  
– Notes 2l and 8.
•	 Review of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets’ carrying value,  
the determination of whether a trigger for an impairment review  
exists, whether these assets are impaired and the measurement of 
impairment charges or reversals – Notes 2o, 2p, 2q, 2r, 19 and 20.
•	 The estimated fair values of cash generating units for impairment 
tests, including estimates of future costs to produce proven and 
probable reserves, future commodity prices, foreign exchange rates 
and discount rates – Notes 2r and 6.

e) basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements set out the Group’s financial 
position as at 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, and 
operating results and cash flows for the years then ended. The 
consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial 
statements of the Company and companies controlled by the Company 
(its subsidiaries). Subsidiaries are entities to which the Company is 
exposed or has the rights to variable returns from its involvement and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power. Control exists 
when the Company has existing rights that give the ability to direct 
relevant activities, exposure or rights to variable returns from its 
involvement and the ability to use its power to affect the amount of 
returns. The consolidated financial statements include all of the assets, 
liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its 
subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany transactions as noted above.
accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary 
to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements  
from the date on which control passed to the Group, and have  
been excluded from the date on which control transferred out of  
the Group. For partly-owned subsidiaries, the net assets and net 
earnings attributable to non-controlling interests are presented as 
“Equity attributable to non-controlling interests” in the consolidated 
balance sheet and “Net profit attributable to non-controlling interests”  
in the consolidated income statement, respectively.

f) business combinations
On acquiring a business, the acquisition method of accounting is used, 
whereby the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable net 
assets on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition. Provisional 
fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months  
of the acquisition date. acquisition costs are expensed.
When purchase consideration is contingent on future events, the initial 
cost of the acquisition recorded includes an estimate of the fair value  
of the contingent amounts expected to be payable in the future.  
The cost of the acquisition is adjusted when revised estimates are 
made, with corresponding adjustments made to the income statement.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill, which  
is reviewed for impairment annually or when there is an indication  
of impairment. If the fair value attributable to the Group’s share of the 
identifiable net assets exceeds the cost of acquisition, the difference  
is recognised in the income statement.
g) f oreign currency translation
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily uS dollars, Tanzanian shillings (‘shillings’), South 
african rands (‘rands’), uK pounds sterling (‘pounds’) and australian 
dollars. The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in  
uS dollars. The uS dollar is the Company’s (and its main subsidiaries’) 
functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency.
Transactions in currencies other than the uS dollar are translated  
at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. Monetary assets  
and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the uS dollar are 
translated to uS dollars at year-end exchange rates. all differences  
that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary assets 
measured at historical cost in a currency other than uS dollars are 
translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transactions.
Where non-monetary assets are measured at fair value in a currency 
other than uS dollars they are translated into uS dollars using the 
exchange rates on the date when the fair value was determined.
The following exchange rates to the uS dollar have been applied:

uK pound (uS$:GBP) 0.68 0.65
h) determination of ore reserves
The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based  
on information compiled by Qualified Persons as defined in accordance  
with the Canadian Securities administrators’ National Instrument  
43-101 “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” requirements. 
Reports to support these estimates are prepared each year. Proven and 
probable (‘2P’) reserves, and for certain mines other mineral resources, 
determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, 
amortisation and impairment charges, the assessment of life of mine 
stripping ratios and for forecasting the timing of the payments related  
to the environmental rehabilitation provision.
In assessing the life of a mine for accounting purposes, mineral 
resources are only taken into account where there is a high degree  
of confidence of economic extraction.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating ore reserves, 
and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change 
significantly when new information becomes available. Changes in the 
forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or 
recovery rates may change the economic status of reserves and may, 
ultimately, result in the reserves being revised.
i) Stripping costs
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden  
and other waste materials to access ore from which minerals can be 
extracted economically. The process of mining overburden and waste 
materials is referred to as stripping. Stripping costs incurred in order  
to provide initial access to the ore body (referred to as pre-production 
stripping) are capitalised as mine development costs.
Stripping costs incurred during the production stage of a pit are 
accounted for as the costs of the inventory produced during the period 
that the stripping costs were incurred, unless these costs provide a 
future economic benefit to an identifiable component of the ore body. 
Production phase stripping costs generate a future economic benefit 
when the related stripping activity: (i) improves access to a component  
of the ore body to be mined in the future; (ii) increases the fair value  
of the mine (or pit) as access to future mineral reserves becomes less 
costly; (iii) increases the productive capacity or extends the productive 
life of the mine (or pit). For production phase stripping costs that 
generate a future economic benefit, the current period stripping costs 
are capitalised as open pit mine development costs.
Capitalised open pit mine development costs are depreciated on a units  
of production basis whereby the denominator is the estimated ounces  
of recoverable gold in proven and probable reserves and the portion  
of resources considered probable of economic extraction based on the 
current life of mine plan in the components of the ore body that have 
been made more accessible through the stripping activity. Capitalised 
open pit mine development costs are depreciated once the open pit has 
entered production and the future economic benefit is being derived.

122 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 j) revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised when persuasive evidence exists that all of the 
following criteria are met:
•	 the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product have 
been transferred to the buyer;
•	 neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually 
associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold 
has been retained;
•	 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
•	 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the sale  
will flow to the Group; and
•	 the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the sale can be 
measured reliably.
gold doré sales
Gold doré is unrefined gold bullion bars usually consisting of 90%  
gold that is refined to pure gold bullion prior to sale to our customers. 
Revenue from gold doré sales is recognised at the time of sale  
to a third party. The sales price is based on the gold spot price  
at the time of sale.
concentrate sales
Concentrate is a processing product containing the valuable ore mineral 
gold, copper and silver from which most of the waste mineral has been 
eliminated, that undergoes a smelting process to convert it into gold 
bullion, copper and silver concentrate. under the terms of concentrate 
sales contracts with independent smelting companies, gold, copper and 
silver in concentrate is sold at trailing monthly average spot prices based 
on contract quotational periods.
Revenue is recorded at the shipped on board date, which is also when 
risks and rewards pass to the smelting companies, using market prices 
on the expected date that final sales prices will be fixed. Variations 
between the price recorded at the shipment date and the actual final 
price set under the smelting contracts are caused by changes in market 
prices, and result in an embedded derivative in accounts receivable.  
The embedded derivative is recorded at fair value each period until final 
settlement occurs, with changes in fair value classified as provisional 
price adjustments and included as a component of revenue. 
co-products
Revenue from the sale of co-products, such as copper and silver, 
contained in doré or concentrates are recognised in revenue.
k) cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of direct mining costs (which include personnel 
costs, general and administrative costs, energy costs (principally diesel 
fuel and electricity), maintenance and repair costs, operating supplies, 
external services, third-party smelting, refining and transport fees),  
and depreciation related to sales as well as production taxes and royalty 
expenses for the period. Cost of sales is based on average costing for 
contained or recoverable ounces sold as well as production taxes and 
royalty expense for the period. all costs are net of any impairment to 
reduce inventory to its net realisable value.
l) exploration and evaluation
exploration expenditures
Exploration expenditures relate to the initial search for mineral  
deposits with economic potential as well as expenditures incurred  
for the purposes of obtaining more information about existing mineral 
deposits. Exploration expenditures typically comprise costs that are 
directly attributable to:
•	 researching and analysing existing exploration data;
•	 conducting geological studies;
•	 exploratory drilling and sampling for the purposes of obtaining core 
samples and the related metallurgical assay of these cores; and
•	 drilling to determine the volume and grade of deposits in an area 
known to contain mineral resources or for the purposes of converting 
mineral resources into proven and probable reserves.
Exploration expenditures incurred at greenfield sites (sites where  
the Group does not have any mineral deposits that are already being 
mined or developed) are typically expensed as incurred, unless it can  
be demonstrated that the related evaluation expenditures will generate  
a future economic benefit. Exploration expenditures incurred at 
brownfield sites (sites that are adjacent to a mineral deposit that is 
classified within proven and probable reserves and are already being 
mined or developed) are capitalised if the following criteria are met:
•	 the drilling is being done in an inferred or measured and indicated 
resource; and
•	 there is an existing proven and probable reserve that is contiguous  
or adjacent to where the drilling is being done; and
•	 it is probable that the resource will be converted to a proven and 
probable reserve.
The assessment of probability is based on the following factors:  
results from previous drill programmes; results from a geological study; 
results from a mine scoping study confirming economic viability of the 
resource; and preliminary estimates of the volume and grade of the 
deposit, and the net cash flows expected to be generated from its 
development. Costs incurred at brownfield sites that meet the above 
criteria are capitalised as a component of property, plant and equipment  
(‘mine development costs’) pursuant to IaS 16, ‘Property, Plant and 
Equipment’. all other drilling and related exploration costs incurred  
at these sites are expensed as mine site exploration. Exploration 
expenditures incurred for the purposes of determining additional 
information on a mineral deposit that is classified within proven and 
probable reserves or for the purposes of extending an existing mineral 
deposit that is classified within proven and probable reserves and is 
already being mined or developed are also capitalised as mine 
development costs.
evaluation expenditures
Evaluation expenditures arise from a detailed assessment of deposits  
or other projects that have been identified as having economic potential 
in order to determine their technical feasibility and commercial viability. 
They typically include costs directly attributable to:
•	 detailed engineering studies;
•	 examination and testing of extraction methods and metallurgical/
treatment processes;
•	 surveying transportation and infrastructure requirements;
•	 permitting activities; and
•	 detailed economic evaluations to determine whether development  
of the reserves is commercially justified, including the preparation  
of scoping, pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies.
123 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016
fin AnciA l st Ate Ments 2. Significant accounting policies continued
Evaluation expenditures incurred at greenfield and brownfield sites are 
expensed as incurred, unless it can be demonstrated that the related 
evaluation expenditures will generate a future economic benefit.
Evaluation expenditures incurred at operating mines/development 
projects are capitalised as a component of property, plant and 
equipment, “Mining properties and development costs”, respectively.
acquired exploration and evaluation properties
Exploration and evaluation stage properties acquired either as an 
acquisition of individual assets or as part of a business combination are 
capitalised as an intangible asset, “acquired exploration and evaluation 
properties”. Exploration and evaluation stage properties represent 
interests in properties that do not have mineralised material classified 
within proven and probable reserves. The value of such properties  
is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralised material 
contained in such properties, including value attributable to the rights  
to explore or develop: i) a property containing mineralised material 
classified as a measured, indicated or inferred resource; or ii) a 
prospective greenfield property with significant exploration potential. 
Exploration and evaluation expenditures incurred on such properties 
subsequent to their acquisition are expensed as incurred until the 
technical and commercial viability of developing the property has been 
demonstrated under the same criteria described above for exploration 
and evaluation expenditures.
m) earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net profit for the period 
attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings 
per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if additional 
Ordinary Shares are assumed to be issued under securities that entitle 
their holders to obtain Ordinary Shares in the future. For share options, 
the number of additional shares for inclusion in diluted earnings per 
share calculations is determined using the treasury share method.  
under this method, share options, whose exercise price is less than  
the average market price of our Ordinary Shares, are assumed to be 
exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase Ordinary Shares  
at the average market price for the period. The incremental number  
of Ordinary Shares issued under share options and repurchased from 
proceeds is included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.
n) inventories
Material extracted from the Group’s mines is classified as either  
ore or waste. Ore represents material that, at the time of extraction,  
is expected to be processed into a saleable form and sold at a profit. 
Waste represents material that is required to be removed to access  
ore bodies. Ore stockpiles are classified within inventory as material  
is extracted from the open pit or underground mine. Ore is accumulated  
in stockpiles that are subsequently processed into gold in a saleable 
form under a mine plan that takes into consideration optimal scheduling 
of production of our reserves, present plant capacity, and the market 
price of gold and copper. Work in process inventory represents gold, 
copper and silver in the processing circuit that has not completed the 
production process, and is not yet in a saleable form. Finished goods 
inventory represents gold in saleable form that has not yet been shipped. 
Mine operating supplies represent commodities and other raw materials 
consumed in the production process, as well as spare parts and other 
maintenance supplies that are not classified as capital items. 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with 
cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis. average costs  
are calculated by reference to the cost of inventory at the beginning  
of the period together with the cost of inventory produced in a period.
Gold, copper and silver ore contained in stockpiles is measured by 
estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, 
and the associated estimate of gold contained therein (based on assay 
data) and applying estimated metallurgical recovery rates (based on  
the expected processing method). Stockpile ore tonnages are verified  
by periodic surveys. Costs are allocated to ore stockpiles based on 
quantities of material stockpiled using current mining costs incurred  
up to the point of stockpiling the ore and include: direct labour costs; 
materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the 
extraction of ore, including an allocation of stripping costs attributable  
to current period production; an allocation of mine site overhead costs; 
and depreciation of mining properties and property, plant and equipment 
used in the extraction of ore, reduced by an allocation of capitalised 
stripping costs. as ore is processed, costs are removed based on 
recoverable quantities of gold and the stockpile’s average cost per unit. 
Ore that is not expected to be processed in the 12 months following  
the balance sheet date is classified as non-current.
Costs capitalised in process and finished goods inventory include:  
the cost of stockpiles processed; the cost of commodities and raw 
materials consumed in the production process; direct labour; repair  
and maintenance costs; energy costs; depreciation of property, plant  
and equipment used in the production process; and an allocation  
of mine site overhead costs. Costs are removed from finished goods 
inventory and recorded in cost of sales based on the average cost  
per ounce of gold, copper and silver sold in the period.
Cost of mine operating supplies is the purchase cost, including allocated 
freight costs where applicable.
Provisions are recorded to reduce ore stockpiles, work in process and 
finished goods inventory to net realisable value where the net realisable 
value of the inventory is lower than its cost at each balance sheet date. 
Net realisable value is determined with reference to relevant market 
prices less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions recorded 
also reflect an estimate of the remaining costs of completion to bring the 
inventory into its saleable form. Provisions are recorded to reduce mine 
operating supplies to net realisable value, which is generally calculated 
by reference to its salvage or scrap value, when it is determined that the 
supplies are slow moving and/or obsolete. Provisions are reversed to 
reflect subsequent recoveries in net realisable value where the inventory 
is still on hand at the balance sheet date.
o) property, plant and equipment
mineral properties and mine development costs
Mineral properties and mine development costs are stated at cost,  
less accumulated depreciation and applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. The acquisition cost of a mineral property is the estimated  
fair value of proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated  
and inferred resources acquired as a result of a business combination  
or asset acquisition. Where the asset is acquired separately, the  
cost is given the fair value of the consideration given. Capitalised mine 
development costs include: pre-production stripping costs; production 
stripping costs that result in a future economic benefit (refer to Note 2i 
for capitalisation criteria for stripping costs); costs incurred to access 
reserves at underground mining operations; and exploration and 
evaluation expenditures that result in a probable future economic  
benefit (refer to Note 2i for capitalisation criteria for exploration and 
evaluation expenditures).
Development costs incurred at underground mines to build new shafts, 
drifts and ramps that provide physical access to the underground ore  
are capitalised as incurred. These costs can be incurred throughout  
the life of the underground mine.
notes to the consolidated financial state Ments CONTINu ED
124 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and applicable impairment losses. Cost includes all expenditures 
incurred to prepare an asset for its intended use including: the  
purchase price; brokers’ commissions; and installation costs including 
architectural, design and engineering fees, legal fees, survey costs,  
site preparation costs, freight charges, transportation insurance costs, 
duties and borrowing cost.
Costs that extend the productive capacity or useful economic life of an 
asset are capitalised. Costs incurred that do not extend the productive 
capacity or useful economic life of an asset are considered repairs and 
maintenance and expensed as incurred.
The Group enters into leasing arrangements and arrangements that  
are in substance leasing arrangements. The determination of whether  
an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance  
of the arrangement at inception date, including whether the fulfilment  
of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or  
assets or whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.  
a reassessment after inception is only made in specific circumstances. 
Leasing arrangements that transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group are classified as 
finance leases.
Finance leases are recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability  
at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value of the leased property 
and the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum 
lease payments over the term of the lease. Each lease payment is 
allocated between the liability and finance costs using the effective 
interest method, whereby a constant rate of interest expense is 
recognised on the balance of the liability outstanding. The interest 
element of the lease is charged to the income statement as a finance 
expense. The property, plant and equipment assets acquired under 
finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the 
asset and the lease term. all other leases are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in  
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
assets under construction
assets in the course of construction at both our development projects 
and operating mines are capitalised in the “assets under construction” 
account. The cost of assets under construction comprises its purchase 
price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working 
condition for its intended use, at which point it is transferred to property, 
plant and equipment and depreciation commences. Development 
projects are recorded at cost, less applicable accumulated impairment 
losses. Development projects represent interests in properties that 
contain proven and probable reserves and where development activities 
are ongoing. The cost of development projects is composed of: the 
estimated fair value of development stage assets acquired as a result  
of a business combination or an asset acquisition; and costs associated 
with the construction of tangible assets, such as processing plants, 
permanent housing facilities and other tangible infrastructure associated 
with the project. assets under construction also contain deposits  
on long lead items. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation 
activities is initially included in assets under construction and 
subsequently transferred to Mineral Properties. assets under 
construction are not depreciated. 
depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment is depreciated, net of residual value,  
over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine if shorter, on a 
straight-line basis. For mineral properties and mine development costs, 
the economic benefits of the assets are consumed in a pattern which  
is linked to the production level. Such assets are depreciated on a unit  
of production basis. Depreciation commences when assets are available 
for their intended use. In applying the units of production method, 
depreciation is normally calculated using the quantity of gold, copper  
and silver extracted from the mine (or pit) in the period as a percentage 
of the total quantity of material expected to be extracted in current  
and future periods based on estimates of recoverable proven and 
probable reserves and, for some mines, mineral resources. Such 
non-reserve material may be included in the depreciation calculations 
where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction  
and the production of the non-reserve material is reflected in the life  
of mine plan.
Development costs that relate to a discrete section of an ore body and 
which only provide benefit over the life of those reserves are depreciated 
over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of that discrete 
section. Discrete sections include capitalised underground development 
costs or production stripping costs incurred for the purposes of providing 
access to specific ore blocks or areas of the mine and which only provide 
an economic benefit over the period of mining that ore block or area. 
Development costs incurred which benefit the entire ore body are 
depreciated over the recoverable proven and probable reserves of the 
entire ore body.
The expected depreciation rates of the major categories of assets are 
as follows:
Mineral properties and development costs uOP
1
Plant and equipment 4% – 25%
underground mobile equipment 14.3% – 20%
Light vehicles and other mobile equipment 33.3% – 50%
Furniture, computer and office equipment 33.3% – 50%
1  uOP indicates assets which are depreciated on the basis of units of production 
(‘uOP’), in this case ounces of gold, copper and silver produced in a period divided  
by the total recoverable reserves and resources of gold, copper and silver expected  
to be mined based on the current life of mine plans.
Each asset’s estimated residual value and useful life is reviewed,  
and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis. The estimate of  
residual value and useful life is based on the physical condition and  
life limitations of buildings, plant and equipment and the present 
assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine for the 
mining property and development cost asset. Changes to the estimated 
residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
p) goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
acquired at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially determined based 
on provisional fair values. Fair values are finalised within 12 months of 
the acquisition date. For non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, non-controlling 
interests are initially recorded based on the minorities’ proportion of the 
fair values for the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition.
Goodwill that is acquired through business combinations is allocated  
to cash generating units (‘CGus’), or groups of CGus, that are expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each of the 
Group’s CGus that has an allocation of goodwill is also an operating 
segment as defined by IFRS 8. Consequently, goodwill is tested for 
impairment at the individual CGu level.
Goodwill is not amortised; rather it is tested annually for impairment  
in accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r). Goodwill impairments  
are not reversible.
125 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016
fin AnciA l st Ate Ments 2. Significant accounting policies continued
q) intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired by way of an asset acquisition or business 
combination are recognised if the asset is separable or arises from 
contractual or legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on 
initial recognition. On acquisition of a mineral property in the exploration 
stage, we prepare an estimate of the fair value attributable to the 
exploration potential, including mineral resources, if any, of that property. 
The fair value of the exploration potential is recorded as an intangible 
asset (acquired exploration potential) as at the date of acquisition.  
When an exploration stage property moves into development, any 
acquired exploration intangible asset balance attributable to that 
property is transferred to non-depreciable mining interests within 
property, plant and equipment.
Impairment testing and the reversal of impairments are conducted  
in accordance with accounting policy (Note 2r).
r) impairment of non-current assets
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or at any time during the 
year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. We review  
and test the carrying amounts of intangible assets when events or 
changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may  
not be recoverable.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if there is  
any indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
an impairment loss shall be recognised for a CGu if, and only if, the 
recoverable amount of the unit is less than the carrying amount of the 
unit. The impairment loss shall first be allocated to goodwill and then to 
the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount 
of each asset in the unit.
an impairment loss recognised in prior years for non-financial assets 
other than goodwill shall be reversed if, and only if, there has been 
change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable 
amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. This reversal  
is recognised in the consolidated statement of income and is limited  
to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of any 
depreciation, had no impairment been recognised in prior years. after 
such a reversal, any depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively.
The recoverable amount of an asset is assessed by reference to the 
higher of value in use (‘VIu’) being the net present value (‘NPV’)  
of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, and fair 
value less costs to dispose (‘FVLCD’). Impairment assessments are 
conducted at the level of CGus, which is the lowest level for which 
identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other 
assets. Each operating mine and development project represents a CGu 
for impairment testing purposes. an impairment loss is recognised for 
any excess of carrying amount of a CGu over its recoverable amount.
The FVLCD of a CGu is based on an estimate of the amount that  
the Group may obtain in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis.  
There is no active market for the Group’s CGus. Consequently, FVLCD  
is derived using discounted cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future 
cash flows of a CGu), which incorporate market participant assumptions. 
Cost to sell is based on management’s best estimates of future selling 
costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable to the sale  
of a CGu are not considered significant.
The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived 
from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of 
production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (‘LOM’) 
plan for each CGu, which are updated on an annual basis. The Group’s 
LOM plans reflect proven and probable reserves and convertible 
resources and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling  
to optimise the internal rate of return for each CGu. as such, these plans 
consider the optimal level of investment, overall production levels and 
sequence of extraction taking into account all relevant characteristics  
of the ore body, including waste-to-ore tonnes ratios, ore grades,  
haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties impacting process 
recoveries and capacities of available extraction, haulage and processing 
equipment. Projected future revenues reflect the forecasted future 
production levels at each CGu as detailed in the LOM plans. Included  
in these forecasts is the production of some mineral resources that  
do not currently qualify for inclusion in proven and probable ore reserves 
where there is a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction. 
This is consistent with the approach that a market participant would 
utilise in preparing a forecast of expected production levels. Projected 
future revenues also reflect the Group’s estimate of long-term gold 
prices, which is determined based on current prices, an analysis of  
the expected total production costs of producers and forward pricing 
curves and forecasts of expected long-term prices prepared by research 
analysts. These estimates often differ from current price levels, but  
this methodology is consistent with how a market participant would 
assess long-term gold prices.
The estimates of future cash costs of production and capital 
expenditures are derived from the LOM plans for each CGu. Costs 
incurred in currencies other than the uS dollar are translated to uS 
dollars using expected long-term exchange rates based on the relevant 
forward pricing curve for that currency. Oil prices are a significant 
component, both directly and indirectly, of the expected cash costs  
of production. Estimates for long-term oil prices used in the LOM plans 
are based on the spot price at the time, the forward pricing curve and 
long-term oil price forecasts prepared by analysts.
The discount rate applied to present value is based upon the real 
weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGu. The discount  
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact  
of the remaining economic life of the CGu and the risks associated  
with the relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGu  
is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk 
premiums, historical country risk premiums and average credit default 
swap spreads for the period.
In determining FVLCD, a market multiple is applied to the NPV of each 
CGu. Gold companies typically trade at a market capitalisation that  
is based on a multiple of their underlying NPV. Consequently, a market 
participant would generally apply an NPV multiple when estimating  
the fair value of a gold property. The NPV multiple utilised in the 
determination of the FVLCD of a CGu considers the NPV multiples 
observed on comparable companies. These observed multiples  
are primarily derived from research analyst reports and take into 
consideration the following: i) estimate of underlying NPV prepared by  
the analyst; ii) estimate of target market capitalisation prepared by the 
analyst; iii) market capitalisation on the date of the analyst report; and 
iv) market capitalisation on the date of the impairment test. The NPV 
multiple applied also takes into consideration the remaining economic 
life of the CGu. For CGus with a remaining economic life of five years or 
less, an NPV multiple on the lower end of the observed multiple range is 
utilised. For other CGus, the median observed NPV multiple is utilised.
The VIu of a CGu is generally lower than its FVLCD, due primarily to  
the inclusion of future, as yet unapproved, capital expenditure when 
determining its FVLCD. Consequently, the recoverable amount of a CGu 
for impairment testing purposes is determined based on its FVLCD.
s) other reserves
The Company did not exist until 12 January 2010, and did not become  
the parent company for the Group until 22 February 2010 when  
the transfer of the members of the Group pursuant to the Pre-IPO 
Reorganisation was completed. as part of the IPO Reorganisation in 
2010 a distributable reserve was created following a capital reduction.
t) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.
notes to the consolidated financial state Ments CONTINu ED
126 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 u) provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation  
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that  
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and  
a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the 
effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting  
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is 
recognised as a finance cost.
r ehabilitation costs
The mining, extraction and processing activities of the Group  
normally give rise to obligations for environmental rehabilitation. 
Rehabilitation works can include facility decommissioning and 
dismantling, removal or treatment of waste materials and site and  
land rehabilitation. The extent of work required and the associated  
costs are based on legal and constructive requirements and dependent 
on the requirements of relevant authorities and the Group’s 
environmental policies.
Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation programme are recognised 
at the time that environmental disturbance occurs. When the extent  
of disturbance increases over the life of an operation, the provision  
is increased accordingly. The major parts of the carrying amount of 
provisions relate to tailings pond closure/rehabilitation; demolition  
of buildings/mine facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care  
and maintenance of closed mines. Costs included in the provision 
encompass all closure and rehabilitation activity expected to occur 
progressively over the life of the operation and at the time of closure  
in connection with disturbances at the reporting date. Estimated costs 
included in the determination of the provision reflect the risks and 
probabilities of alternative estimates of cash flows required to settle  
the obligation at each particular operation. Routine operating costs that 
may impact the ultimate closure and rehabilitation activities, such as 
waste material handling conducted as an integral part of a mining or 
production process, are not included in the provision. Costs arising  
from unforeseen circumstances, such as the contamination caused by 
unplanned discharges, are recognised as an expense and liability when 
the event occurs that gives rise to an obligation and reliable estimates  
of the required rehabilitation costs can be made.
The timing of the actual rehabilitation expenditure is dependent upon a 
number of factors such as the life and nature of the asset, the operating 
licence conditions and the environment in which the mine operates. 
Expenditure may occur before and after closure and can continue for  
an extended period of time depending on rehabilitation requirements. 
The majority of the expenditure is expected to be paid over periods  
of up to 30 years with some payments into perpetuity. Rehabilitation 
provisions are measured at the expected value of future cash flows, 
discounted to their present value using a current, market-based estimate 
of the real risk-free pre-tax discount rates. The unwinding of the discount 
is included in finance expense and results in an increase in the amount 
of the provision. Provisions are updated each reporting period for the 
effect of a change in the discount rate and the change in estimate is 
added or deducted from the related asset and depreciated prospectively 
over the asset’s useful life.
Significant judgements and estimates are involved in forming 
expectations of future activities and the amount and timing of the 
associated cash flows. Those expectations are formed based on existing 
environmental and regulatory requirements or, if more stringent, Group 
environmental policies which give rise to a constructive obligation.
When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially recognised,  
the corresponding cost is capitalised as an asset, representing part  
of the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the operation. 
The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised 
in property, plant and equipment and depreciated accordingly.
It is possible that management’s estimates of provisions could change 
as a result of changes in regulations, the extent of rehabilitation 
required, and the means of reclamation or cost estimates. Rehabilitation 
provisions are adjusted as a result of changes in estimates. Those 
adjustments are accounted for as a change in the corresponding value  
of the related asset, except where a reduction in the provision is greater 
than the remaining net book value of the related assets, in which case 
the value is reduced to nil and the remaining adjustment is recognised in 
the income statement. In the case of closed sites, changes to estimated 
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Changes  
to the capitalised cost result in an adjustment to future depreciation  
and finance expense. On an annual basis, the Group reviews for changes 
in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
v) employee benefits
The Group operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation  
plan (the ‘Share Option Plan’), a long-term incentive plan (the ‘LTIP’),  
a legacy restricted share unit plan (the ‘Legacy RSu Plan’) and  
a deferred share unit plan (the ‘DSu’ Plan).
Share-based payments
Share options
Share options can be granted under either the Company LTIP or the 
Share Option Plan. The Company receives services from employees  
as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the Group. The fair 
value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the 
options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed  
is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted:
•	 including any market performance conditions;
•	 excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales growth targets and 
remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period); and
•	 excluding the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about  
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense is 
recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of 
the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. at the end of each 
reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates,  
if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares  
or procure the transfer of existing shares to satisfy the exercise. Where 
shares are issued, the proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options are exercised. The grant by the Company  
of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair 
value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant 
date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase  
to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit 
to equity.

l ong-term incentive plans
The Company has a cash-settled, Restricted Share unit (‘RSu’) plan for 
select employees. under the terms of the RSu plan, selected employees 
are granted RSus where each RSu has a value equal to one Ordinary 
Share of the Company. RSus granted to Executive Directors and the 
other members of the Executive Leadership Team vest based on the 
Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) performance against the 
market cap-weighted TSR of a comparator group of companies over  
the vesting period (referred to as Performance RSus). RSus vest over  
a two-and-a-half or three-year period and are settled in cash. additional 
RSus are credited to reflect dividends paid on Ordinary Shares of the 
Company during the vesting period with a corresponding charge to the 
compensation expense. a liability for RSus is measured at fair value on 
the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.  
at the grant date the fair value of the awards is determined from the 
market value of the shares at the date of award and adjusted for any 
market based vesting conditions attached to the award e.g. relative  
TSR performance. Changes in the fair value of the RSu liability, due to 
changes in the price of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded 
each period, with a corresponding charge to the compensation expense.
Compensation expenses recognised for RSus incorporate an estimate 
for expected forfeiture rates. The expected forfeiture is estimated based 
on historical forfeiture rates of the Group and expectations of future 
forfeiture rates. adjustments to compensation expense are recognised  
in periods where the actual forfeiture rate differs from the expected rate.
legacy r Su plan
Historically, the Barrick Group has maintained a Restricted Share unit 
(‘RSu’) plan for selected employees who now work for the Group. This 
plan operates in an incidental manner to the Company RSu plan. These 
existing legacy restricted share units will continue to be administered 
and accounted for based on the movement of the fair value of the Barrick 
Ordinary Share for recording of liabilities and compensation expense.
ltip deferred share units
under the Deferred Share unit (‘DSu’) plan, the Non-Executive Directors 
can elect to receive all or part of their annual director fees in DSus. Each 
DSu has the same value as one acacia Ordinary Share. DSus must be 
retained until the Director leaves the Board, at which time the cash value 
of the DSu is paid out. additional DSus are credited to reflect dividends 
paid on acacia Ordinary Shares. a liability for DSus is measured at  
fair value on the grant date and is recognised on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period, with a corresponding charge to the Directors’ 
compensation expense. at the grant date the fair value of the awards  
is determined from the market value of the shares at the date of award. 
Changes in the fair value of the DSu liability, due to changes in the price 
of Ordinary Shares of the Company, are recorded each period, with  
a corresponding charge to the Directors’ compensation expense.
defined contribution plan
The Group’s Tanzanian employees are members of either the National 
Social Security Fund (‘NSSF’) or the Parastatal Pension Fund (‘PPF’), 
which are defined contribution plans. a defined contribution plan is  
a plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate 
entity. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contribution if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all 
employees the benefits relating to the employee service in the current 
and prior periods. The Group and employees both contribute 10% of  
the employees’ gross salaries to the schemes. The contributions are 
charged to the income statement when they are due.
termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by  
the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group 
recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed  
to either: terminating the employment of current employees according  
to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing 
termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary 
redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the balance 
sheet date are discounted to their present value.
bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses where it is 
contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created  
a constructive obligation.
other entitlements
The estimated monetary liability for employees’ accrued annual  
leave entitlement at the balance sheet date is recognised as an 
expense accrual.
w) f inancial instruments
cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair  
value. For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
l oans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date. These are classified as non-current assets, where the receivables 
are discounted and held at their net present value.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, other 
assets and cash and cash equivalents at the balance sheet date.
a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when  
there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount 
of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and  
the expected cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate. The 
carrying amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance 
account. The amount of the provision is recognised in the 
income statement.
derivatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative 
contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair 
value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on 
whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, 
the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain 
derivatives as:
a)   hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm 
commitment (fair value hedge); or
b)  hedges of the income/cost of a highly probable forecast transaction  
or commitment (cash flow hedge); or
c)  hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net 
investment hedge).
notes to the consolidated financial state Ments CONTINu ED
128 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 The Group documents at inception of the transaction the relationship 
between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk 
management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging 
transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are 
used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative instruments used for hedging 
purposes are disclosed in Note 30. Movements in the hedging reserve 
are shown in other comprehensive income. The full fair value of a 
hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when 
the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months,  
and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the 
hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives are classified  
as a current asset or liability.
(a) f air value hedge
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify 
as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together  
with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are 
attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective 
portion is recognised in the income statement within “finance costs”. 
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement within other charges. Changes in the fair value of  
the hedge attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income 
statement within “finance costs”.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the 
adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over  
the period to maturity.
(b) cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that  
are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other 
comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement within  
“other charges”.
amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example, when 
the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or loss relating  
to the effective portion is recognised in the income statement. However, 
when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition  
of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or fixed assets), the gains 
and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and 
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of 
inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and equipment.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no  
longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain  
or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the 
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement within “other charges”.
(c) net investment hedge
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for 
similarly to cash flow hedges.
any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective 
portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income.  
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income 
statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.
embedded derivatives
Contracts are assessed for the existence of embedded derivatives  
at the date that the Group first becomes party to the contract, with 
reassessment only if there is a change to the contract that significantly 
modifies the cash flows. Embedded derivatives which are not clearly  
and closely related to the underlying asset, liability or transaction are 
separated and accounted for as stand-alone derivatives.
f inancial liabilities
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs 
incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; any 
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the 
establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs  
of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility 
will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a 
prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the 
facility to which it relates. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities 
unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of  
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest  
rate method.
x) f inance income and finance expense
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the 
estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as 
interest income.
Interest is recognised as a borrowing cost on a time proportion basis 
using the effective interest method. Borrowing costs that relate directly 
to the construction of property, plant and equipment during the time that 
it is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use are 
capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
y) other income/charges
Other income/charges comprises of one-off credits or costs relating to 
non-routine transactions included in profit and loss. It includes other 
credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate, if of a similar type, 
are of a nature or size that requires explanation in order to provide 
additional insight into the underlying business performance.
z) taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.  
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods 
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid  
to the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax 
regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax 
authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount  
are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date.

deferred income tax
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of  
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates enacted  
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to 
apply when the related deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred 
income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences, except:
•	 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction  
that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, 
affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit/loss; and
•	 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the 
temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, 
to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available 
against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward 
of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
•	 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary 
differences arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability  
in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time  
of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable 
profit or loss; and
•	 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries deferred income tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary 
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit 
will be available against which the temporary differences can be 
utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at  
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all  
or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each 
balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become 
probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to 
be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries 
raised and additional tax assessments issued, have been measured 
using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach.
Deferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are 
offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax 
assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income 
taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
indirect tax
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to  
the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions or 
receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be 
paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws 
used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable is expected  
to be received in more than 12 months from year end, the receivable  
is discounted and held at its present value. amounts expected to  
be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
aa) r oyalties
Royalty arrangements based on mineral production are in place at  
each operating mine. The primary type of royalty is a net smelter return 
(‘NSR’) royalty. under this type of royalty the Group pays the holder an 
amount calculated as the royalty percentage multiplied by the value of 
gold production at market gold prices less third-party smelting, refining 
and transportation costs.
The North Mara mine is also subject to a land royalty (land tenements 
(‘LT’)) based on the net revenue derived from the open pit mines.
Royalty expense is recorded when revenue from the sale of gold, copper 
and silver production is recognised.
The following percentages apply:
Bulyanhulu 4% NSR
1
North Mara – Nyabirama and Nyabigena pits 4% NSR
1
, 1% LT
North Mara – Gokona pit and underground 4% NSR
1
, 1.1% LT
Buzwagi 4% NSR
1
, 30% NPI
2
1 The Group agreed to a voluntary 1% increase in the NSR royalty rate in 2012.
2  The NPI is calculated as a percentage of profits realised from the Buzwagi mine after 
all capital, exploration and development costs and interest incurred in relation to the 
Buzwagi mine have been recouped and all operating costs relating to the Buzwagi 
mine have been paid. No amount is currently payable.
bb) l eases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received 
from the lessor) are charged to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment. Leases of 
property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the 
risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance 
leases are capitalised at the lease’s commencement at the lower of the 
fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments.
Each finance lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance 
charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, 
are included in other liabilities. The interest element of the finance  
cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to 
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance  
of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment 
acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the 
useful life of the asset and the lease term.
cc) dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

130 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 3. Segment reporting
The Group has only one primary product produced in a single geographic location, being gold produced in Tanzania. In addition, the Group produces 
copper and silver as a co-product. Reportable operating segments are based on the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker 
(‘CODM’) to evaluate segment performance, decide how to allocate resources and make other operating decisions. after applying the aggregation 
criteria and quantitative thresholds contained in IFRS 8, the Group’s reportable operating segments were determined to be: North Mara gold mine; 
Bulyanhulu gold mine; Buzwagi gold mine; and a separate Corporate and Exploration segment, which primarily consists of costs related to other 
charges and corporate social responsibility expenses. Segment results and carrying values include items directly attributable to the segment as well 
as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment carrying values are disclosed and calculated as shareholders’ equity after adding 
back debt and inter-company liabilities, and subtracting cash and inter-company assets. Segment liabilities are not reported since they are not 
considered by the CODM as material to segment performance. Capital expenditures comprise additions to property, plant and equipment. The Group 
has also included segment cash costs per ounce sold and all-in sustaining cost per ounce sold (non-IFRS financial performance measures). Segment 
information for the reportable operating segments of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015 is set out below.

In accordance with IaS 36 “Impairment of assets” and IaS 38 “Intangible assets” a review for impairment of goodwill is undertaken annually, or at 
any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist, and in accordance with IaS 16 “Property, plant and equipment” a review for impairment  
of long-lived assets is undertaken at any time an indicator of impairment is considered to exist. 
During 2015, the prevailing gold price fell significantly which forced a review of the gold price outlook used for long-term planning and reserve 
estimation. as reported in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, on a gross basis, and before taking into 
account the impact of deferred tax, the total impairment charge booked in 2015 amounted to uS$146.2 million at Buzwagi. at Bulyanhulu and  
North Mara, the impairment review did not indicate a need for impairment because the recoverable amount was calculated as higher than the  
carrying values.
at the end of 2016, the annual review for impairment of goodwill and indefinite life assets was performed. The review compared the recoverable 
amount of assets for the cash generating units (‘CGu’) to the carrying value of the CGus including goodwill. The recoverable amount of an asset  
is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (‘VIu’), being the net present value (‘NPV’) of future cash flows expected to be generated by  
the asset, and fair value less costs to dispose (‘FVLCD’). The FVLCD of a CGu is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain  
in a sale transaction on an arm’s length basis. There is no active market for the Group’s CGus. Consequently, FVLCD is derived using discounted  
cash flow techniques (NPV of expected future cash flows of a CGu), which incorporate market participant assumptions. Cost to dispose is based on 
management’s best estimates of future selling costs at the time of calculating FVLCD. Costs attributable to the disposal of a CGu are not considered 
significant. The expected future cash flows utilised in the NPV model are derived from estimates of projected future revenues, future cash costs of 
production and capital expenditures contained in the life of mine (‘LOM’) plan for each CGu. The Group’s LOM plans reflect proven and probable 
reserves, assume limited resource conversion, and are based on detailed research, analysis and modelling to optimise the internal rate of return  
for each CGu. 
The discount rate applied to calculate the present value is based upon the real weighted average cost of capital applicable to the CGu. The discount 
rate reflects equity risk premiums over the risk-free rate, the impact of the remaining economic life of the CGu and the risks associated with the 
relevant cash flows based on the country in which the CGu is located. These risk adjustments are based on observed equity risk premiums, historical 
country risk premiums and average credit default swap spreads for the period. 
The key economic assumptions used in the reviews during 2016 and 2015 were:

Discount rate 5% 5%
NPV multiples 1.00 1.00
as a result of the annual impairment assessment performed, no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended 31 December 2016.
For purposes of testing for impairment of long-lived assets, we have assessed whether a reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions 
used to estimate the recoverable value for CGus would result in an impairment charge. 
Management’s view is that the recoverable values are most sensitive to changes in the assumptions around gold prices and discount rates. as a 
result, sensitivity calculations were performed for these for each of the CGus. The sensitivity analysis is based on a decrease in the long-term gold 
price of uS$100 per ounce, an increase in the discount rate of 1%. 
Neither of the reasonably possible changes set out above would result in an impairment. This sensitivity analysis also does not take into account any 
of Management’s mitigation factors should these changes occur.

3   The 2015 reconciliation includes an amount of uS$12.7 million relating to an increase in the amount of unrecognised tax benefits carried forward. The adjustment reflects 
uncertainty regarding recoverability of certain tax losses, and gives rise to an increased deferred tax charge.
4  Included in 2015 is the tax impact of uS$42.5 million of deferred tax assets derecognised at Buzwagi following the impairment review. 
Tax periods remain open to review by the Tanzanian Revenue authority (‘TRa’) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the  
filing of the corporate tax return, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. 
under certain circumstances the reviews may cover longer periods. Because a number of tax periods remain open to review by tax authorities, there 
is a risk that transactions that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities may be challenged by them in the future, and this may result  
in the raising of additional tax assessments plus penalties and interest.

Basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the year attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding to assume conversion of all 
dilutive potential Ordinary Shares. The Company has dilutive potential Ordinary Shares in the form of share options. The weighted average number  
of shares is adjusted for the number of shares granted assuming the exercise of share options.

through an offset against current indirect taxes that was due for refund. In addition, we have paid provisional corporate taxes in relation to North Mara of uS$20.9 million,  
which was paid through offset against indirect tax receivables agreed under the MOS entered into in 2012. VaT refunds received in 2016 amounted to uS$54 million  
(2015: uS$86 million).
2   The inventory adjustment includes the movement in current as well as the non-current portion of inventory and has been adjusted for the non-cash impairment impact of 2015.
3  The other liabilities adjustment mainly relates to the revaluation of future share-based payments. During the year, share-based payments of uS$36.0 million were made.

1 Other receivables relates to employee and supplier backcharge-related receivables and refundable deposits.
Trade receivables other than concentrate receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30-90-day terms. Concentrate receivables are 
generally on 60-120-day terms depending on the terms per contract. Trade receivables are amounts due from customers in the ordinary course  
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.  
The carrying value of trade receivables recorded in the financial statements represents the maximum exposure to credit risk. The Group does not 
hold any collateral as security. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
provisions for impairment. a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.

uncertainties regarding availability of tax losses, in respect of enquiries raised and additional tax assessments issued by the TRa, have been 
measured using the single best estimate of likely outcome approach resulting in the recognition of substantially all the related deferred tax assets 
and liabilities. alternative acceptable measurement policies (e.g. on a weighted average expected outcome basis) could result in a change to deferred 
tax assets and liabilities being recognised, and the deferred tax charge in the income statement.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the Group is in a 
position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable 
future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries is represented by the contribution of those 
investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to uS$411 million (2015: uS$391 million).

Share options are granted to Executive Directors and to selected employees. The exercise price of the granted options is determined by the 
Compensation Committee before the grant of an option provided that this price cannot be less than the average of the middle-market quotation  
of such shares (as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List) for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant.  
all options outstanding at the end of the year expire between april 2017 and august 2020. 1,118,662 of the options granted were exercisable  
at 31 December 2016. The vesting period of the options is four years, with an exercise period of seven years from the date of grant.

1  Included in the amount for 2016 are accruals raised for uncertain tax positions in order to address the direct impact of the ruling on historic tax assessments and the potential 
impact this may have on the applicability of certain deductions for prior years at North Mara and Tulawaka (uS$36.7 million).
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables 
are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Terms and conditions of the above payables liabilities:
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are normally settled on 30-day of statement terms
accruals and other payables are non-interest bearing and have an average term of 30–60 days
26. borrowings
During 2013, a uS$142 million facility (the ‘Facility’) was put in place to fund the bulk of the costs of the construction of one of acacia’s key growth 
projects, the Bulyanhulu CIL Expansion project (the ‘Project’). The Facility is collateralised by the Project, and has a term of seven years with a spread 
over LIBOR of 250 basis points. The interest rate has been fixed at 3.6% through the use of an interest rate swap. The seven-year Facility is repayable  
in equal instalments over the term of the Facility, after a two-year repayment holiday period. The full facility of uS$142 million was drawn at the end of 
2013. The first principal payment of uS$14.2 million was paid in H2, 2015 and at the end of 2016 the balance owing was uS$99.4 million (2015: uS$ 
127.8 million). Interest accrued to the value of uS$0.6 million (2015: uS$0.7 million) was included in accounts payable at year end. Interest incurred on 
the borrowings as well as hedging losses on the interest rate swap for the year ended 31 December 2016 was uS$4.0 million (2015: uS$5.1 million).

non-current portion 145,722 127,354 – – 145,722 127,354
1   Rehabilitation provisions relate to the decommissioning costs expected to be incurred for the operating mines. This expenditure arises at different times over the LOM for the 
different mine sites and is expected to be utilised in terms of cash outflows between years 2017 and 2054 and beyond, varying from mine site to mine site. The change in 
estimate in the current year relates mainly to an update in estimate around closure related retrenchment costs, and a reduction in the uS risk free rates driven by a change in 
discount rate.
2  Other provisions relate to provisions for legal and tax-related liabilities where the outcome is not yet certain but it is expected that it will lead to a probable outflow of economic 
benefits in future.
3  Towards the end of 2015 reclamation guarantees for the mine sites were discussed with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals including the required rehabilitation activity. These 
discussions, in conjunction with the annual review of closure estimates and closure planning, have resulted in a re-estimation of the basis and assumptions for cost estimates and 
periods of closure needed. The change in estimate recorded in 2016 mainly relates to a reduction in cost estimated around post-closure activities, combined with changes in the 
mine plans, mining approach and scheduling which had a positive impact on rehabilitation in future.
Rehabilitation obligations arise from the acquisition, development, construction and normal operation of mining property, plant and equipment, 
due to Government controls and regulations that protect the environment on the closure and reclamation of mining properties. The major parts of  
the carrying amount of the obligation relate to tailings and waste rock dump closure/rehabilitation; surface contouring; demolition of buildings/mine 
facilities; ongoing water treatment; and ongoing care and maintenance of closed mines. The fair values of rehabilitation provisions are measured  
by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit-adjusted risk-free rate of interest. acacia prepares estimates  
of the timing and amount of expected cash flows when an obligation is incurred and updates expected cash flows to reflect changes in facts and 
circumstances. The principal factors that can cause expected cash flows to change are: the construction of new processing facilities; changes  
in the quantities of material in reserves and a corresponding change in the life of mine plan; changing ore characteristics that impact required 
environmental protection measures and related costs; changes in water quality that impact the extent of water treatment required; and changes  
in laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment.
Each year acacia assesses cost estimates and other assumptions used in the valuation of the rehabilitation provision at each mineral property  
to reflect events, changes in circumstances and new information available. Changes in these cost estimates and assumptions are recorded as 
an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding asset. Rehabilitation provisions are adjusted to reflect the passage of time (accretion) 
calculated by applying the discount factor implicit in the initial fair-value measurement to the beginning-of-period carrying amount of the provision. 
Settlement gains/losses will be recorded in other (income) expense.
Other environmental remediation costs that are not rehabilitation provisions are expensed as incurred.

r evolving credit facility
The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of uS$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 
with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to  
fund potential acquisitions. all provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary 
terms for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2016, the term of the facility was 
successfully extended to 2019 at a maximum aggregate amount of uS$150 million. at 31 December 2016, none of the funds were drawn under  
the facility. The shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan. Costs associated with the revolving credit facility 
have been included in finance expenses.

31. f inancial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations:
a) market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks;
b) credit risk; and
c) liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, 
and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Board of Directors has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and 
procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The audit Committee is assisted 
in its oversight role by internal audit which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of 
which are reported to the audit Committee.
a) market risk, including commodity price, foreign currency and interest rate risks
Market risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates, will affect the Group’s 
income or the value of its financial instruments.
gold price
The market price of gold is one of the most significant factors in determining the profitability of the Group’s operations. The price of gold is subject  
to volatile price movements over short periods of time, especially in the current market environment, and is affected by numerous industry and 
macro-economic factors that are beyond the Group’s control. In 2016 the price ranged from uS$1,077 to uS$1,366 per ounce, with an average 
market price of uS$1,251 per ounce (2015: uS$1,160 per ounce). The Group’s policy is to sell gold at prevailing market prices.
During 2016, the Group hedged 75% of Buzwagi production for 2016 and 26% for 2017 to mitigate the cash flow risk associated with gold price 
volatility due to the marginal nature of their operations. This accounted for approximately 17% and 5% of the Group’s overall production in 2016 and 
2017 respectively. 
The Group added 135,000 ounces of gold collar contracts with an average bought put option of uS$1,150 per ounce and average sold call option of 
uS$1,290 per ounce respectively that matured in 2016. at 31 December 2016, the Group had 43,000 ounces of gold collar contracts outstanding 
that will mature in 2017 with average bought put options of uS$1,150 per ounce and average sold call options of uS$1,421 per ounce. These 
transactions are economic hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded  
as a component of other income/expense in the income statement.

In 2016, the copper price ranged from uS$1.96 to uS$2.69 per pound, with an average market price of uS$2.21 per pound (2015: uS$2.49 per 
pound) and closing at uS$2.50 per pound.
In 2016, the silver price ranged from uS$14 to uS$21 per ounce, with an average market price of uS$17 per ounce (2015: uS$16 per ounce). 
The Group had no copper collar contracts maturing in 2016. During the year, the Group added 12.9 million pounds collar contracts with an average 
floor price of uS$2.30 per pound and ceiling of uS$2.78 per pound respectively maturing in 2017. These transactions are economic hedges and do 
not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these options are recorded as a component of other income/expense in the 
income statement.
oil price
Diesel fuel is refined from crude oil and is therefore subject to the same price volatility affecting crude oil prices. The Group enters into Brent oil 
option contracts to manage the impact of oil price fluctuations. In 2016, oil prices traded between uS$28 and uS$57 per barrel with an average 
market price of uS$45 (2015: uS$54 per barrel).
The table below summarises the impact of changes in the market prices of crude oil. The impact is expressed in terms of the resulting change  
in the Group’s profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2016. The sensitivities are based on the assumption that the market price changes  
by uS$10 per barrel with all other variables held constant. The effect on profit after tax (before hedging) is calculated based on actual consumption 
for the year and does not address the indirect impact of a change in the oil price on other costs.

The Group did not add any further Brent oil collar contracts for calendar year 2016. at 31 December 2016, the Group had a total 421,000 barrels of 
Brent crude oil net purchase options outstanding. These contracts mature in 2017 and 2018 consisting of sold put options with average strike prices 
of uS$44 per barrel and uS$35 per barrel respectively and bought call options with average strike prices of uS$74 per barrel and uS$71 per barrel 
respectively. During the year, the Group added 248,000 barrels of Brent oil collar contracts for calendar years 2017 and 2018.
These contracts are treated as accounting hedges in accordance with IaS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of forecasted 
consumption purchased in a future month. Hedge effectiveness is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical 
derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value of the commodity contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until  
the forecasted expenditure impacts earnings. These hedges did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as a result of not meeting the hedge 
effectiveness criteria. Changes in the fair value of these options were therefore recorded as a component of other income/expense in the income 
statement.
r isks relating to the use of derivatives
By using derivatives, in addition to credit risk, we are affected by market risk. Market risk is the risk that the fair value of a derivative might be 
adversely affected by a change in commodity prices, interest rates, or currency exchange rates, and that this in turn affects our financial condition. 
We manage market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
f oreign currency risk
The Group’s transactions are denominated in a number of different currencies (primarily uS dollars, Tanzanian shillings (‘shillings’), South african 
rands (‘rands’), uK pounds sterling (‘pounds’) and australian dollars. The Group has liabilities that are primarily denominated in uS dollars.  
The uS dollar is the Company’s (and its subsidiaries’) functional currency, as well as the Group’s presentation currency. Therefore, transactions  
in currencies other than the uS dollar give rise to foreign currency translation risk. The Group’s primary exposure to this risk arises from direct  
mine operating costs and corporate administration costs that are transacted in shillings and rands, respectively. Consequently, fluctuations in  
the uS dollar/shilling/rand exchange rates increase the volatility of cost of sales, corporate administration costs and overall net earnings, which  
are reported in uS dollars. The vast majority of all direct mining costs and corporate administration costs are denominated and settled in uS dollars. 
Consequently, the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Group’s reported direct mining and corporate administration costs is not significant.
The exchange rates at the end of each financial year are detailed in Note 2g.
Historically, the relationship between the gold price and the value of the shilling and rand provide a natural hedge against fluctuations in the exchange 
rate of these currencies against the uS dollar. Generally, a strengthening of the shilling/rand, which would cause an increase in reported uS dollar 
operating costs, corresponds with an increase in the uS dollar gold price, which results in an increase in reported uS dollar revenues.

interest rate risk
Interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instruments will fluctuate due to changes 
in market interest rates. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on its cash and cash equivalents.
at present, available funds are held with financial institutions at variable rates and primarily denominated in uS dollars; interest income is not 
materially affected by changes in short-term interest rates. During 2013, the Group entered into an Export Credit Insurance Company (‘ECIC’) backed 
seven-year term loan facility of uS$142 million to fund the construction of the CIL Process plant at Bulyanhulu. as at 31 December 2016 the loan  
was fully drawn with the first capital instalment totalling uS$14.2 million having been repaid during 2015. The balance owing as at 31 December 
2016 was uS$99.4 million. Interest is payable on the loan at LIBOR plus 250 basis points. The revolving credit facility’s spread over LIBOR will be 
350 basis points. Group debt levels are impacted by the amount of operating cash flow generated by its operating mines, as well as capital 
expenditure requirements related to existing operations and development projects.
In 2013, the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the interest on the ECIC backed loan for the Bulyanhulu CIL Process plant. The 
terms of the interest rate swap contracts fix this at 3.59% versus the floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.50%. These contracts are treated as accounting 
hedges in accordance with IaS 39. Hedged items are identified as the first stated quantity of rand spent during the month. Hedge effectiveness  
is assessed using linear regression utilising the concept of the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in intrinsic value  
of the currency contracts is recorded in other comprehensive income until the forecasted expenditure occurs. These gains or losses have been 
included as part of interest expense in the income statement.
b) credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet, net of any overdraft positions. 
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks, as well as trade and other receivables. The Group’s financial assets  
are held with counterparties who the Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term to maturity for any individual security is three months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least “Baa1” or better by Moody’s Investor Services or “BBB+” by Standard and Poor’s. No more than 
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the united States of america or 
the united Kingdom, or in any one industry group. Investments are primarily held in united States dollars. Cash and cash equivalents in other foreign 
currencies are maintained for operational requirements. as at 31 December 2016 the Group has money market and short-term investments of 
uS$194.7 million (2015: uS$111.4 million). all of the funds have at least a “BBB+” rating from Standard and Poor’s. The Group also has 
uS$122.9 million (2015: uS$121.6 million) of cash on hand with banks with credit ratings ranging from “a-1” to “a-2”. 
With respect to other receivables, the most significant debtor is the Tanzanian Revenue authority (‘TRa’). Following the abolishment of Government 
Notices regarding VaT relief and fuel duty exemption for mining companies in 2009, acacia signed a Memorandum of Settlement during 2011 with  
the TRa to address the treatment of certain outstanding indirect tax refunds in respect of fuel levies and VaT that allows acacia to offset income  
tax payable against outstanding VaT and fuel levy refunds as it becomes payable. also, the Minister of Finance reinstated VaT relief and the fuel 
exemption followed by an agreement to allow for an escrow facility in respect of fuel and road levies. again through the Finance act, 2012 issued  
on 19 October 2012, VaT relief was abolished. Throughout the past three years, acacia has been actively involved in discussions with the Tanzanian 
Government and the TRa to resolve the issue. The amendments conflict with certain provisions contained in the Group’s existing Mine Development 
agreements (‘MDas’) which guarantee the fiscal stability of its operations. as part of a short-term solution, the Government during the third quarter  
of 2013, agreed to an escrow arrangement on VaT in relation to imported goods and services, whereby funds are restricted to the repayment of VaT 
refunds. as at 31 December 2016, the discounted amounts due to the Group were approximately uS$136.4 million (2015: uS$110.2 million). We

fin AnciA l st Ate Ments 31. f inancial risk management continued
Group policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. Individual exposures are monitored  
with trade customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group’s exposure to credit risk  
is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of the counterparties. The Group’s financial assets are with counterparties who the 
Group considers have an appropriate credit rating. During the year, receivables to the value of approximately uS$135 million (2015: uS$116 million) 
were advanced by a financial institution under two factoring agreements for two concentrate counterparties. Three agreements reduce the risk of 
default of receivables. 
Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets described in Note 29. The Group does 
not hold collateral as security for any trade receivables. The Group does not grade the credit quality of receivables.
c) l iquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of loss from not having access to sufficient funds to meet both expected and unexpected cash demands. The Group  
manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels are well above minimum internal requirements. 
Prudent liquidity risk management includes maintaining sufficient cash balances, and the availability of funding from an adequate amount of 
committed credit facilities. at the end of both 2016 and 2015 the Group was in a positive net cash position, as disclosed in Note 18. Details  
of the undrawn revolving credit facility are given in Note 29.
In the ordinary course of business, the Group receives cash proceeds from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements. The cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that capital is safeguarded 
to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating. Insignificant uncommitted overdraft facilities 
are maintained with several banking counterparties to meet the Group’s normal funding requirements. The Group’s primary source of liquidity is 
operating cash flow, and over the past two years the Group has generated an average of about uS$237 million per year. The principal risk factor 
affecting operating cash flow is market gold prices. 
The principal uses of liquidity are sustaining capital expenditures at existing operating mines, construction activities at development projects, and 
interest payments. Sustaining capital expenditures, including capitalised development costs, have averaged about uS$182 million per year over the 
past two years. The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Group’s significant financial assets into relevant maturity groupings based  
on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. as the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual

The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. as at 31 December 2016, the Group has the 
following commitments and/or contingencies:
a) l egal contingencies
as at 31 December 2016, the Group was a defendant in approximately 185 lawsuits. The plaintiffs are claiming damages and interest thereon from 
various members of the Group in connection with one or more of the following: land compensation and resettlement, alleged breaches of contract for 
various goods and services, employment and labour related matters and historical exploration agreements with third parties.
The Group’s Legal Counsel is defending the Group’s current position, and the outcome of the lawsuits cannot presently be determined. Included  
in the total amounts claimed are the following:
an adjudication claim for uS$115 million by Bismark Hotel Limited relating to an alleged breach of contract under an Optional agreement signed  
in 1995. The claim relates to an application for a prospecting licence with no attributable reserves, resources or value. We are waiting for the 
adjudicators to fix a hearing date. Management are of the opinion that the claim is without merit and that it will be successfully defended.
an arbitration award of uS$4 million, relating to a historical arbitration between North Mara Gold Mine Limited (‘NMGML’) and Diamond Motors 
Limited (‘DML’) in respect of an alleged breach of contract claim in relation to the interpretation of periodic rate review requirements and other 
provisions of drilling services contracts. NMGML counterclaimed against the amount and raised a provision of uS$6.2 million reflecting the view of 
NMGML as to the proper interpretation and application of the rate review clauses of the contracts. an arbitral tribunal decided in favour of NMGML  
on the material grounds of the claim on 10 august 2015, with an award of uS$4 million for unpaid rates to DML for the period up to September 2013. 
The Tribunal found that the subsequent period fell to be determined by negotiation of the parties pursuant to the contractual terms and should be 
calculated based on the tribunal’s judgment. after the award was issued, DML: (i) sought to challenge the award in the Commercial Court; and (ii) 
filed a winding up application against NMGML based on unpaid rates for 2014 and 2015. NMGML petitioned the High Court to stay the winding up 
petition, given that the underlying debt and alleged indebtedness for 2014/2015 must be determined by arbitration. The stay was rejected on the 
basis that winding up procedures cannot be determined by arbitration. This decision is on appeal. DML recently applied to strike out the appeal on 
the basis that the record on appeal was not timely filed. We will be opposing this application, which may not be heard by the Court of appeal for some 
months. We are currently assessing options available to determine the amount payable to DML for 2014/2015 in order to reach an agreement on 
this and to have all Court proceedings set aside. The hearing for the application to wind up North Mara has yet to be scheduled. Payment has been 
made for the arbitration award (uS$4.0 million) and we continue to carry a provision of uS$2.2 million as provisioned for the first arbitration.

Contractor claims relating to alleged compensation events under the Bulyanhulu CIL plant construction contract, purporting to relate to matters which 
provide grounds for additional amounts payable for scope of work variations and/or extensions of time to the agreed project execution timetable. The 
alleged contractor claims relate to a wide range of subject matters including logistics delays, procurement delays, additional works, rainfall delays, 
price escalation, certain matters relating to taxation, entitlement to contingency amounts and other retained monies. The aggregate value of MDM 
claims is uS$50.4 million and ZaR 33.1 million. Bulyanhulu is of the opinion that the majority of MDM’s claims are defendable. In turn, Bulyanhulu 
has counterclaimed for payment of delay damages due to continuing delays in execution of the project amounting to uS$20.0 million in aggregate, 
multiple defects claims (as remedied and as to be remedied) relating to the design and build of the CIL plant, amounting to uS$14.6 million in 
aggregate, an overall fit for purpose claim as a result of various grounds of negligence in the design and construction of the CIL plant amounting to 
uS$31.4 million in aggregate and additional transportation costs of uS$1.5 million. No provision has been made however, we carry an accrual of 
unpaid project amounts of approximately uS$6.0 million.
a contractual dispute between various acacia operating companies and Petrolube/ISa to the value of uS$35.1 million. The acacia entities terminated 
contractual supply relationships for: (i) the provision of hoses, fittings and assembly services to operating entities by ISa on Notice of 5 July 2016; 
and (ii) the provision of lubricants and associated services by Petrolube to operating entities on 5 July 2016, in each case pursuant to the termination 
without cause provisions in the agreement, and following retendering of relevant services and as a result of various breaches of contract relating to 
the provisions of Petrolube/ISa services (including issues relating to reliability of prior supplies and quality of products) and various other breaches  
of contract by Petrolube/ISa. Subsequent to the commencement of contractual dispute proceedings Petrolube/ISa commenced court proceedings  
to have the termination of the agreements set aside and to recover various damages limbs, including loss of profits, and other general damages 
(uS$56.1 million – Petrolube Claim and uS$24.9 million ISa Claim). We have challenged all elements of the Court proceedings and have also 
challenged jurisdiction of the Court, given that the contracts require all disputes to be referred to arbitration following principal to principal dispute 
discussions. We have commenced arbitration proceedings in connection with all elements of the disputes, as required by the applicable contractual 
dispute processes.
a claim for compensation against NMGML in relation to the destruction of an office building and stone crusher machine. The damage to the property 
was caused by the Tanzanian Police Force. The claim has been refiled in the High Court and awaits scheduling. Management expects to be able to 
defend the claim successfully as the damage of the property was caused by the Tanzanian Police Force; therefore no provision has been made.
a claim for breach of contract against Bulyanhulu Gold Mine Limited in relation to a new office building which Bulyanhulu had contracted to rent. 
However, Bulyanhulu had withdrawn from the contract as the owner was unable to honour the terms; and the construction of the building in question 
was not completed. Management expects to be able to defend the claim successfully as the construction of the office building was never completed; 
therefore no provision has been made.
b) tax-related contingencies
The TRa has issued a number of tax assessments to the Group related to past taxation years from 2002-onwards. The Group believes that the 
majority of these assessments are incorrect and has filed objections and appeals accordingly in an attempt to resolve these matters by means  
of discussions with the TRa or through the Tanzanian appeals process. These include the following:
a TRa assessment of uS$21.3 million in respect of Tusker Gold Limited. The tax assessment is based on the sales price of the Nyanzaga property  
of uS$71 million multiplied by the tax rate of 30%. Management is of the view that the assessment is invalid due to the fact that the acquisition is  
for Tusker Gold Limited, a company incorporated in australia. The shareholding of the Tanzanian related entities did not change and the Tusker Gold 
Limited group structure remains the same as prior to the acquisition. The case was decided in favour of acacia however the TRa appealed that 
decision. The tax tribunal upheld the decision in favour of acacia however the TRa has appealed to the Court of appeal. We are awaiting a hearing 
date to be set.
a TRa assessment to the value of uS$41.3 million for withholding tax on certain historic offshore dividend payments paid by acacia Mining plc  
to its shareholders. acacia is appealing this assessment on the substantive grounds that, as an English incorporated company, it is not resident in 
Tanzania for taxation purposes. The appeal is currently pending at the Court of appeal and the substantive grounds of appeal will be filed on receipt 
of the record of appeal required from the lower tribunals.
Further TRa assessments issued to acacia Mining plc to the value of uS$500.7 million, based on an allegation that acacia is resident in Tanzania  
for corporate and dividend withholding tax purposes. The corporate tax assessments have been levied on certain Group net profits before tax. We  
are in the process of appealing these assessments at the TRa Board level. acacia’s substantive grounds of appeal are, again, based on the correct 
interpretation of Tanzanian permanent establishment principles and law, relevant to a non-resident English incorporated company.
In addition, in Q1 2016 we received a judgment from the Court of appeal regarding a long standing dispute over tax calculations at Bulyanhulu from 
2000-2006. The Court of appeal was reviewing seven issues initially raised by the TRa in 2012 regarding certain historic tax loss carry forwards  
and ruled in favour of Bulyanhulu by the Tax appeals Board in 2013. The TRa appealed against this ruling and in 2014 the Tax Tribunal reversed the 
decision for all seven issues. acacia appealed against this judgment and in March 2016 the Court of appeal found in favour of the TRa in five of the 
seven issues. The legal route in Tanzania has now been exhausted; however we are considering our options for the next steps. The Court of appeal 
ruling does not have a short-term-cash flow impact but means that Bulyanhulu will be in a tax payable situation approximately one year earlier than 
previously expected. acacia is yet to receive a revised tax assessment following the judgment, but has raised further tax provisions of uS$69.9 
million in order to address the direct impact of the ruling on Bulyanhulu’s tax loss carry forwards and the potential impact this may have on the 
applicability of certain capital deductions for other years and our other mines. The additional tax provisions raised are uS$35.0 million relating to 
Bulyanhulu, uS$30.4 million relating to North Mara and uS$4.4 million relating to Tulawaka. Total provisions for uncertain tax positions now amount 
to uS$128 million.
c) purchase commitments
at 31 December 2016, the Group had purchase obligations for supplies and consumables of approximately uS$47 million (2015: uS$43 million).

fin AnciA l st Ate Ments w hat an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISas (uK & Ireland). an audit 
involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and 
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic 
report and Directors’ Report, we consider whether those reports include 
the disclosures required by applicable legal requirements.

162 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 1. corporate information
acacia Mining plc, formerly african Barrick Gold plc, (the ‘Company’) was 
incorporated on 12 January 2010 and re-registered as a public limited 
company on 12 March 2010 under the Companies act 2006. It is 
registered in England and Wales with registered number 7123187.
On 24 March 2010 the Company’s shares were admitted to the Official 
List of the united Kingdom Listing authority (‘uKLa’) and to trading on 
the main market of the London Stock Exchange, hereafter referred to  
as the Initial Public Offering (‘IPO’). The address of its registered office  
is 5th Floor, 1 Cavendish Place, London, W1G 0QF, united Kingdom.
Barrick Gold Corporation (‘BGC’) currently owns approximately 63.9%  
of the shares of the Company and is the ultimate controlling party  
of the Group. The financial statements of BGC can be obtained from  
www.barrick.com
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016 were 
approved for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company on 6 March 
2017. The primary activity of the Company is as holding company for  
the acacia Mining Group of companies.
2. Significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these 
financial statements are set out below. 
a) basis of preparation 
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European union (‘IFRS’), IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the 
Companies act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared on  
a historical cost basis.
The Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Company should 
be able to operate within the level of its current financing.
after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. The Company therefore adopts  
the going concern basis in preparing its financial statements.
The financial statements are presented in uS dollars (uS$) and all values 
are rounded to the nearest thousand (uS$’000) except when otherwise 
indicated. Where a change in the presentational format between the  
prior year and current year financial statements has been made during 
the period, comparative figures are restated accordingly. No changes 
were made to presentational format in the current year.
The basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the 
financial statements are set out below.
b) new and amended standards adopted by the company
The following amendments to standards are applicable and were 
adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 January 2016:
•	 amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IaS 
28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on applying the 
consolidation exemption. The amendments clarify the application  
of the consolidation exception for investment entities and their 
subsidiaries. The amendment did not have a significant impact  
on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendment to IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ on acquisition of an 
interest in a joint operation. This amendment adds new guidance on 
how to account for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation 
that constitutes a business. The amendment did not have a 
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendments to IaS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’ 
disclosure initiative. In December 2014 the IaSB issued amendments 
to clarify guidance in IaS 1 on materiality and aggregation, the 
presentation of subtotals, the structure of financial statements and 
the disclosure of accounting policies. The amendment did not have  
a significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendment to IaS 16, ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IaS  
38, ‘Intangible assets’, on depreciation and amortisation. In this 
amendment the IaSB has clarified that the use of revenue based 
methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate 
because revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an 
asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the 
economic benefits embodied in the asset. The IaSB has also clarified 
that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for 
measuring the consumption of the economic benefits embodied in  
an intangible asset. The amendment did not have a significant impact 
on the Group financial statements.
•	 amendments to IaS 27, ‘Separate financial statements’ on equity 
accounting. In this amendment the IaSB has restored the option to 
use the equity method to account for investments in subsidiaries, 
joint ventures and associates in an entity’s separate financial 
statements. The amendment did not have a significant impact  
on the Group financial statements.
•	 IFRS 5, ‘Non-current assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations’. This is an amendment to the changes in methods of 
disposal – assets (or disposal groups) are generally disposed of 
either through sale or through distribution to owners. The amendment 
to IFRS 5 clarifies that changing from one of these disposal methods 
to the other should not be considered to be a new plan of disposal, 
rather it is a continuation of the original plan. There is therefore no 
interruption of the application of the requirements in IFRS 5. The 
amendment also clarifies that changing the disposal method does  
not change the date of classification. The amendment did not have a 
significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 IFRS 7, ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’. applicability of the 
offsetting disclosures to condensed interim financial statements.  
The amendment removes the phrase ‘and interim periods within 
those annual periods’ from paragraph 44R, clarifying that these IFRS 
7 disclosures are not required in the condensed interim financial 
report. However, the Board noted that IaS 34 requires an entity to 
disclose an explanation of events and transactions that are 
significant to an understanding of the changes in financial position 
and performance of the entity since the end of the last annual 
reporting period. Therefore, if the IFRS 7 disclosures provide a 
significant update to the information reported in the most recent 
annual report, the Board would expect the disclosures to be included 
in the entity’s condensed interim financial report. The amendment did 
not have a significant impact on the Group financial statements.
•	 IaS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’. Discount rate: regional market issue –
The amendment to IaS 19 clarifies that market depth of high-quality 
corporate bonds is assessed based on the currency in which the 
obligation is denominated, rather than the country where the 
obligation is located. When there is no deep market for high-quality 
corporate bonds in that currency, government bond rates must be 
used. The amendment did not have a significant impact on the Group 
financial statements.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
c) new and amended standards and interpretations  
not yet adopted 
The following standards and amendments to existing standards have 
been published and are mandatory for the Company’s accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017:
•	 amendments to IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and  
IaS 28, ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ on sale or 
contribution of assets. The IaSB has issued this amendment to 
eliminate the inconsistency between IFRS 10 and IaS 28. The IaSB 
decided to defer the application date of this amendment, until such 
time this is not applicable. The amendment is however not expected 
to have a significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendments to IaS 12, ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax assets for 
unrealised Losses’. amendments made to IaS 12 will aim to clarify 
the accounting for deferred tax where an asset is measured at fair 
value and that fair value is below the asset’s tax base. Effective  
1 January 2017. The amendment is however not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendments to IaS 7, ‘Disclosure Initiative’. Going forward, entities 
will be required to explain changes in their liabilities arising from 
financing activities. This includes changes arising from cash flows 
(e.g. drawdowns and repayments of borrowings) and non-cash 
changes such as acquisitions, disposals, accretion of interest  
and unrealised exchange differences. Changes in financial assets 
must be included in this disclosure if the cash flows were, or will be, 
included in cash flows from financing activities. Effective 1 January 
2017. The amendment is however not expected to have a significant 
impact on the Group.
•	 IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’. This standard is  
a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts 
with customers to achieve greater consistency in the recognition  
and presentation of revenue. Revenue is recognised based on the 
satisfaction of performance obligations, which occurs when control  
of good or service transfers to a customer. Effective 1 January 2018. 
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on  
the Group.
•	 IFRS 9, ‘Financial Instruments’ (2009 & 2010). The IaSB has updated 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’ to include guidance on financial 
liabilities and de-recognition of financial instruments. The accounting 
and presentation for financial liabilities and for derecognising financial 
instruments has been relocated from IaS 39, ‘Financial instruments: 
Recognition and measurement’, without change, except for financial 
liabilities that are designated at fair value through profit or loss. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
•	 amendment to IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, on general hedge 
accounting. The IaSB has amended IFRS 9 to align hedge accounting 
more closely with an entity’s risk management. The revised standard 
also establishes a more principles-based approach to hedge 
accounting and addresses inconsistencies and weaknesses in the 
current model in IaS 39. The transitional provisions described above 
are likely to change once the IaSB completes all phases of IFRS 9. 
Effective 1 January 2018. The amendment is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
•	 IFRS 16, ‘Leases’. IFRS 16 supersedes IaS 17, ‘Leases’, IFRIC 4, 
‘Determining whether an arrangement contains a Lease’, SIC 15, 
‘Operating Leases – Incentives’ and SIC 27, ‘Evaluating the 
Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease’. 
Effective 1 January 2019. The standard is not expected to have  
a significant impact on the Group.
d) Significant judgements in applying accounting policies 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Many of the amounts included in the parent company financial 
statements require management to make judgements and/or estimates. 
These judgements and estimates are continuously evaluated and are 
based on management’s experience and best knowledge of the relevant 
facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ from the amounts 
included in the parent company financial statements. Information about 
such judgements and estimation is included in the accounting policies 
and/or notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are 
summarised below.
areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the parent 
company financial statements include: 
•	 Whether to recognise a provision for accounts receivable – Notes 2h 
and 10;
•	 Recognition of deferred income tax assets, amounts recorded for 
uncertain tax positions, the measurement of income tax expense and 
indirect taxes – Notes 2k and 6; and
•	 Review of property, plant and equipment and investments in 
subsidiaries, the determination of whether these assets are impaired 
and the measurement of impairment charges or reversals – Notes 2f, 
8 and 9.
e) f oreign currency translation
The Company’s transactions are denominated in a number of different 
currencies (primarily uS dollars and uK pounds sterling). The Company 
has liabilities that are primarily denominated in uS dollars. The uS  
dollar is the Company’s functional currency, as well as the Company’s 
presentation currency. Transactions in currencies other than the uS 
dollar are translated at the exchange rates as at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than  
the uS dollar are translated to uS dollars at year-end exchange rates.  
all differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets measured at historical cost in a currency other 
than uS dollars are translated using the exchange rates at the date  
of the initial transactions. Where non-monetary assets are measured  
at fair value in a currency other than uS dollars they are translated into 
uS dollars using the exchange rates on the date when the fair value  
was determined. 
The following exchange rates to the uS dollar have been applied:

164 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 f) investment in subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities to which the Company is exposed, or has the 
rights to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power. Control exists when the Company 
has existing rights and the ability to direct relevant activities, exposure  
or rights to variable returns from its involvement and the ability to use  
its power to affect the amount of returns.
at each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether 
there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment  
in a subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair 
value less costs to dispose and the value in use. Fair value is 
determined as the amount that would be obtained from the sale of the 
investment in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable and 
willing parties. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the 
recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to 
reflect the investment at the recoverable amount. Where an impairment 
charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the 
end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the 
impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such 
indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. an 
impairment loss is reversed to the income statement to the extent that 
the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not 
exceed the original carrying value.
g) Share capital
Ordinary Shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity  
as a deduction from the proceeds.
h) f inancial instruments
cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
For the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents 
include cash, and money market funds. For the purposes of the cash 
flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash 
equivalents as defined above.
l oans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not 
qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair 
value through profit and loss or available for sale. These are initially 
recognised at fair value, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost 
using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet 
date, which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables comprise other receivables and cash and cash 
equivalents at the balance sheet date.
a provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there 
is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The carrying 
amount of the asset is reduced through use of an allowance account. 
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
f inancial liabilities
Other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) f inance income and finance expense 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the 
effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Company 
reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the 
estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest 
rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as  
interest income.
j) other income/charges
Other income/charges comprises of one-off credits or costs relating to 
non-routine transactions included in profit and loss. It includes other 
credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate, if of a similar type, 
are of a nature or size that requires explanation in order to provide 
additional insight into the underlying business performance.
k) taxes
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax.  
Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that  
it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly  
in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive 
income or directly in equity, respectively.
current income tax
Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current period are 
measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the 
taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions taken 
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation 
is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. The 
tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
deferred income tax
unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance 
sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable 
that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. 
indirect tax 
Indirect tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods  
are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to  
the taxation authorities. Management periodically evaluates positions 
taken in indirect tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable 
tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions  
or receivables where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected  
to be paid to or received from the tax authorities. The tax rates and  
tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted  
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. If the receivable  
is expected to be received in more than 12 months from year-end, the 
receivable is discounted and held at its present value. amounts expected 
to be payable or receivable in more than 12 months are classified as 
non-current assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, as appropriate.
l) dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

The Group has a revolving credit facility in place for a maximum aggregate amount of uS$150 million, which was negotiated on 24 November 2010 
with a syndicate of commercial banks, led by Citibank. The facility has been provided to service the general corporate needs of the Group and to fund 
potential acquisitions. all provisions contained in the credit facility documentation have been negotiated on normal commercial and customary terms 
for such finance arrangements and when drawn the spread over LIBOR will be 350 basis points. During 2016, the term of the facility was successfully 
extended to 2019 at a maximum aggregate amount of uS$150 million. at 31 December 2016, none of the funds were drawn under the facility. The 
shares of all significant subsidiaries have been pledged as security for the loan. Costs associated with the revolving credit facility have been included 
in finance expenses.
17. f inancial risk management
The Company has exposure to the following risks through its commercial and financial operations:
a) credit risk; and
b) liquidity risk.
This note presents information about the Company’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Company’s objectives, policies and processes  
for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company’s risk management framework. 
The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits  
and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in  
market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain  
a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
notes to the parent coM pany financial state Ments CONTINu ED
170 Ac Aci A Mining Plc Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2016 a) credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a third party might fail to fulfil its performance obligations under the terms of a financial instrument. For cash and cash 
equivalents and other receivables, credit risk represents the carrying amount on the balance sheet.
Credit risk arises from loans to two subsidiaries, receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and deposits with banks. The Company’s financial assets 
are with counterparties whom the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Location of credit risk is determined by physical location  
of the bank branch, customer or counterparty. The maximum allowable term of maturity for any individual security is 12 months. Investment 
counterparties must have a credit rating of at least Baa2 or better by Moody’s Investor Services or BBB by Standard and Poor’s. No more than  
25% of the aggregate market value of the investment portfolio is maintained in any one country, with the exception of the united States of america, 
united Kingdom and Barbados, or in any one industry group. Investments are held mainly in united States dollars and cash and cash equivalents  
in other foreign currencies are maintained for operational requirements.
Company policies are aimed at minimising losses as a result of a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations. The Company’s exposure to  
credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Company’s financial assets are with counterparties whom 
the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. Maximum exposure to credit risk at each reporting date is the carrying value of each 
class of financial assets in Note 16. The Company does not hold collateral as security for any receivables. The Company does not grade the credit 
quality of receivables.
b) l iquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of  
a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.
The following table outlines the expected maturity of the Company’s significant financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on  
the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. as the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows, these balances may not agree with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.

Management considers that the Company has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage liquidity risks arising from 
settlement of current liabilities and non-current liabilities.
capital risk management
The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio to support  
its business and provide financial flexibility in order to maximise shareholder value. In order to ensure a strong balance sheet and low gearing ratio, 
management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive committee before submission 
to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.

acacia has identified certain measures in this report that are not 
measures defined under IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures disclosed by 
management are provided as additional information to investors in order 
to provide them with an alternative method for assessing acacia’s 
financial condition and operating results, and reflects more relevant 
measures for the industry in which acacia operates. These measures are 
not in accordance with, or a substitute for, IFRS, and may be different 
from or inconsistent with non-IFRS financial measures used by other 
companies. These measures are explained further below.
net average realised gold price per ounce sold
a non-IFRS financial measure which excludes from gold revenue: 
•	 unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative contracts; and 
•	 export duties 
It also includes realised gains and losses on gold hedge contracts 
reported as part of cost of sales. 
Net average realised gold price per ounce sold has been calculated  
as follows:

Gold sold (ounces) 816,743 721,203
net average realised gold price (uS$/ounce) 1,240 1,154
cash cost per ounce sold 
a non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs include all costs absorbed into 
inventory, as well as royalties, and production taxes, and exclude 
capitalised production stripping costs, inventory purchase accounting 
adjustments, unrealised gains/losses from non-hedge currency and 
commodity contracts, depreciation and amortisation and corporate 
social responsibility charges. Cash cost is calculated net of co-product 
revenue. Cash cost per ounce sold is calculated by dividing the 
aggregate of these costs by total ounces sold.
The presentation of these statistics in this manner allows acacia to 
monitor and manage those factors that impact production costs on a 
monthly basis. Cash costs and cash cost per ounce sold are calculated 
on a consistent basis for the periods presented. 
The table below provides a reconciliation between cost of sales and total 
cash cost to calculate the cash cost per ounce sold.

all-in sustaining cost (‘aiSc’) 
a non-IFRS financial measure. The measure is in accordance with the 
World Gold Council’s guidance issued in June 2013. It is calculated by 
taking cash cost per ounce sold and adding corporate administration 
costs, share-based payments, reclamation and remediation costs for 
operating mines, corporate social responsibility expenses, mine 
exploration and study costs, realised gains and/or losses on operating 
hedges, capitalised stripping and underground development costs and 
sustaining capital expenditure. This is then divided by the total ounces 
sold. a reconciliation between cash cost per ounce sold and aISC for the 
key business segments is presented below:

cost for each ounce sold, taking into account expenditure incurred in 
addition to direct mining costs and selling costs. 
Cash cost per tonne milled is a non-IFRS financial measure. Cash costs 
include all costs absorbed into inventory, as well as royalties, co-product 
credits, and production taxes, and exclude capitalised production 
stripping costs, inventory purchase accounting adjustments, unrealised 
gains/losses from non-hedge currency and commodity contracts, 
depreciation and amortisation and corporate social responsibility 
charges. Cash cost is calculated net of co-product revenue. Cash cost 
per tonne milled is calculated by dividing the aggregate of these costs by 
total tonnes milled.

shA reholder infor MAtion ebitda 
a non-IFRS financial measure. acacia calculates EBITDa as net profit or 
loss for the period excluding:
•	 income tax expense;
•	 finance expense;
•	 finance income;
•	 depreciation and amortisation; and
•	 impairment charges of goodwill and other long-lived assets.
EBITDa is intended to provide additional information to investors and 
analysts. It does not have any standardised meaning prescribed by IFRS 
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for 
measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. EBITDa 
excludes the impact of cash costs of financing activities and taxes, and 
the effects of changes in operating working capital balances, and 
therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow 
from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may 
calculate EBITDa differently.
a reconciliation between net profit for the period and EBITDa is 
presented below:

a non-IFRS financial measure. It is calculated by excluding one-off costs 
or credits relating to non-routine transactions from EBITDa. It excludes 
other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate, if of a similar 
type, are of a nature or size that requires explanation in order to provide 
additional insight into the underlying business performance. EBITDa is 
adjusted for items (a) to (e) as contained in the reconciliation to adjusted 
net earnings below.
ebit 
a non-IFRS financial measure and reflects EBITDa adjusted for

a non-IFRS financial measure. It is calculated by excluding certain costs 
or credits relating to non-routine transactions from net profit attributed  
to owners of the parent. It includes other credit and charges that,

for the implied impact of an adverse tax ruling made by the Tanzanian Court of appeal 
with respect to historical tax assessments of Bulyanhulu. as reported in Q1 2016, the 
impact of the ruling was calculated for Bulyanhulu and extrapolated to North Mara and 
Tulawaka as well and covers results up to the end of 2015. On a site basis, uS$35.1 
million was raised for Bulyanhulu, uS$30.4 million for North Mara and uS$4.4 million 
for Tulawaka.

of goods and services and are paid to third parties, to be refunded  
by Governments. Typically, these taxes would form part of a sales tax  
return made to Governments. Refunds received are included in the  
taxes refunded category.

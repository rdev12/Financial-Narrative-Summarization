Financial and operational highlights
Accelerating 
our growth
• In 2014, we again delivered a strong financial 
performance – increasing sales and profits, 
controlling costs and reducing debt.
• Our main market listing on the London Stock 
Exchange in February 2014 has provided the 
capital resources to accelerate our growth 
and success.
• We acquired a further 60 convenience stores 
and converted a further 45 of our newsagents 
to food and wine stores – bringing the period 
end number of convenience stores to 799. 
We are the second largest multiple 
convenience store business in the UK 
and the leading neighbourhood retailer. 
• We converted a further 102 convenience 
stores to our premium format, offering a 
broader range of products. We now have  
489 such stores.
• We modernised 277 of the 451 post offices 
in our stores, enabling these post offices 
to stay open for much longer, mirroring the 
hours that our stores are open. This is just one 
great example of how we are extending and 
improving the way we serve our customers 
in local neighbourhoods across the UK.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Proud to  
be the UK’s 
neighbourhood store 
I am delighted in my first annual 
statement as chairman to report on a 
successful period with strong growth, 
good progress against our strategic 
objectives and a successful IPO. 
Continuing to grow and succeed
Continued growth and strong financial performance  
were key parts of the story in 2014. So too was our ongoing 
commitment to extend the range of products and services 
we offer our customers in order to meet our aim to cater 
for their everyday needs with a fantastic friendly store on 
their doorstep. 
Listing on the main market
On 28 February 2014 we successfully listed on the 
London Stock Exchange’s main market. We were the first 
retail float of the year. Executing the full listing so quickly 
and effectively involved a great deal of intense work, 
particularly from our chief financial officer Jonathan Miller 
and his team.
The IPO was a key step forward for us as we continue 
to focus on growing our business of neighbourhood 
convenience stores across the UK. It enabled us to pay 
off relatively expensive debt, freeing up funds to fuel and 
accelerate our continued growth. It also enabled us to 
raise our profile and build our brand.
Making board changes
We made some significant changes to the board in 
2014. I was appointed as an independent non-executive 
director in February and took on the non-executive 
chairmanship in July, enabling James Lancaster to 
focus on running the business as chief executive. Having 
established and led the business for over 40 years, it was 
John Coleman
Chairman and  
non-executive director
02 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 the right time following the successful IPO for James to 
make this change and we look forward to his continued 
exceptional leadership. 
In July, Martyn Aguss resigned as chief operating 
officer and was replaced by Dave Thomas, a seamless 
promotion from within as Dave stepped up from his role 
as operations director. We look forward to Dave 
continuing to drive and improve our operations.
We also appointed two new independent non-executive 
directors in February, Sharon Brown and Georgina Harvey.
Corporate governance
We are committed to operating to high standards of 
corporate governance, as we believe that doing so will 
contribute to the delivery of long term shareholder value. 
In readiness for listing, we established audit, remuneration 
and nomination committees. 
Outstanding contributions
As we have grown we have continued to recruit and  
develop increasing numbers of people, many of them 
from the local neighbourhoods we serve. We now have over 
18,000 colleagues across the group and their tremendous 
commitment makes all the difference to our success. I’d like  
to thank all of them for their outstanding contributions.
Dividend
The business continues to generate strong cash returns with 
which we intend to fund capital investment and dividend 
payments to shareholders. The board recommends a final 
dividend of 6.8 pence per share, making a total dividend 
of 8.5 pence for the 9 month period post IPO. 
Living up to our responsibilities
We know that our leading role in the UK’s neighbourhoods 
comes with a great deal of responsibility and we focus on 
playing our part in ways that generate long term positive 
impact. As highlighted on pages 20-21 of this report, our 
responsible approach ranges from recruiting and 
developing thousands of local people to increasing our 
energy efficiency, and raising considerable funds for local 
good causes and charities.
Prospects
Although economic activity across the UK is showing 
some signs of improvement, we are planning for continued 
pressure on consumer spending and an increasingly 
competitive convenience sector. Following the IPO, we have 
been able to accelerate our strategy. As we continue to 
grow and consolidate our role as the UK’s neighbourhood 
store, I look forward to more years of great progress.

A strong  
and growing 
business
Through our network of 1,315 neighbourhood stores, our 18,685 dedicated 
colleagues serve some 4.75m customers every week. We aim to continue 
to strengthen and grow our business by building on the key part our 
neighbourhood stores play in many people’s daily lives.
Convenience 
Our 799 convenience stores provide a 
great range of essential everyday products 
and services to local people living in 
neighbourhoods across the UK.
From a pint of milk in the morning to an 
evening meal, from an open-all-hours 
post office to a great selection of fresh 
fruit and vegetables and food-to-go, from 
the newspapers delivered to your door to 
internet collection and returns around 
the corner – our convenience stores are 
at the heart of the UK’s neighbourhoods.
Newsagents 
With 516 newsagents across the country,  
we are the UK’s No1 specialist confectioner, 
tobacconist and newsagent. 
Our newsagents are not only a strong and 
established part of the business but also 
provide a valuable foundation for our 
continued growth in convenience through 
our ongoing programme of conversions to 
convenience stores.

Our 800th 
convenience  
store opened in 
December 2014
Shortly after the end of the 
2014 financial period we 
acquired an independent 
convenience store with post 
office in Shiney Row, Tyne 
and Wear, achieving the 
milestone of our 800th 
convenience store.
We continue to offer 
our customers more
We are always looking 
to offer our customers an 
ever greater range of the 
products they want and 
this year was no exception 
– we again extended our 
range, notably of fruit and 
vegetables, sandwiches 
and chilled food.
Growing off

Delivering on 
our promises 
For us, 2014 was a year of 
strong results, accelerated growth 
and above all, delivering on our 
promises as we continue to focus 
on excelling as the UK’s leading 
neighbourhood retailer.
Executing our strategy
We delivered everything we set out to do in 2014. 
We continued to grow our network of neighbourhood 
convenience stores, from 707 to 799 at the period end. 
We converted a further 45 of our newsagents to food 
and wine convenience stores. We acquired 60 new stores. 
We converted a further 102 of our convenience stores to 
our premium format, offering a broader range of products 
and services. This brings the total number to 489, well over 
half of our convenience stores.
Hitting our financial targets
Our results were broadly in line with our targets and 
expectations, and represented a significant improvement 
on 2013. We had good growth in sales – total revenue 
increased by 6.1% and like-for-like sales increased by 
0.7%
1
. We increased profits, too. Operating profit before 
exceptional items increased by 13.2% to £25.5m 
(2013: £22.5m). Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation increased to £37.3m 
(2013: £34.2m). We also controlled our costs – our 
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
came down to 24.2% (2013: 24.5%).
Furthermore we reduced net debt by £48.8m while at the 
same time increasing net capital expenditure to £19.3m 
compared to £10.6m in 2013.
The results are covered in more detail in the financial 
review on pages 17 to 19.
Accelerating our growth in convenience post-IPO
Our full listing on the London Stock Exchange in February 
2014 helped to free us from the constraints of high 
leverage and focus more resource on accelerating our 
growth. We can now reinvest more in the business, notably 
to acquire new convenience stores and convert existing 
newsagents into convenience stores, increasing revenue 
and profit and driving shareholder returns. Following our 
IPO we doubled our level of acquisitions while maintaining 
the same level of quality. This was a key aspect of our 
commitment to higher, faster growth.

06 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Giving our customers greater choice
We continue to extend the range of products we offer 
to our customers. In 2014 for example, we introduced 
our premium convenience range of products into a 
further 102 of our convenience stores, enabling us to 
give customers a wider choice of chilled foods, groceries  
and fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as a stronger value 
proposition. Many of the new products are permanently 
priced and promoted, so our customers know where they 
stand. Extending the range and adapting it to local 
neighbourhoods, in turn, helps us drive increased sales.  
In 2014, our average basket spend increased from £4.73  
to £4.97. 
Consolidating our leadership in post offices
Our 451 post offices make us the biggest operator across 
the UK. Through the year we played a key role in the Post 
Office’s modernisation programme. We signed a deal to 
convert 191 of our smaller post offices to their local format 
and actually succeeded in converting 192 by the end of 
the period. We also converted 85 of our larger post offices 
to their main format, and acquired 26 new local post 
offices. As a result of this huge programme, many of our 
customers now have a modernised neighbourhood post 
office that stays open longer for them – in fact for all of the 
hours that their local store is open. In some instances this 
has doubled the post office opening hours. What’s more, 
we are able to reap the benefits of integrating post offices 
more closely into our stores.
Launching our loyalty scheme
We also successfully launched a dedicated Plus card 
loyalty scheme for our customers – a great way to thank 
them for shopping with us and strengthen our bond with 
them. We are encouraged by the number of customers 
who have already registered with the scheme and who 
now regularly use their card in store to access the great 
offers available to them.

Chief executive’s review continued
Offering a great range of neighbourhood services
We are committed to offering our customers an ever-
greater range of neighbourhood services. We deliver 
newspapers to around 130,000 homes, for example. 
We believe no other business makes as many paper 
deliveries, or creates as many opportunities for young 
people to earn some well-deserved pocket money. 
Moreover, with our commitment to offering local people 
great career opportunities, that first job delivering papers 
can turn into a part-time or permanent position in store 
and onwards and upwards to management. 
Alongside paper deliveries, we provide many other 
neighbourhood services such as lottery tickets, bill 
payment, cash machines and internet collection and 
return points – all just a short walk from where our 
customers live. 
Leveraging our strong newsagent base
Our market leading network of Martin’s and RS McColl’s 
newsagents continues to perform well. They’re not only 
an established profitable and cash generative part of 
our business, they also provide an excellent springboard 
for our growth in neighbourhood convenience through 
our programme of converting existing newsagents into 
convenience stores. If you want to create a great 
neighbourhood convenience store, there are few 
better starts than already owning a great newsagent.
Maximising the potential of our network of stores
We focus on motivating colleagues and maximising 
the potential of our fully managed network of stores. 
One of the ways we do this is through close control and 
regular communication. A great example is the weekly 
Dave’s Diaries sent by our chief operating officer Dave 
Thomas to all the store managers, giving updates on 
progress and targets, highlighting key achievements, 
name checking outstanding contributors – helping 
to keep all our managers informed and encouraged. 
We also enhance control and efficiency through our 
investment in information technology.
Strong central control is balanced by an equally 
strong sense of local ownership among our store 
colleagues. They’re committed to their store, to their 
local customers and to their neighbourhood. It’s a 
commitment that comes from being genuinely focused 
on neighbourhood convenience and dedicated to 
giving customers a great friendly service. Moreover, 
area managers have a say in taking local decisions 
on price and range, further reinforcing our ability not 
only to react and adapt quickly to local demand but 
also to take the lead in local markets.
In the neighbourhood 
for over 20 years
We’ve been focusing 
on providing the UK’s 
neighbourhoods with a 
great local store for over 
twenty years. In that time, 
we have gained a wealth 
of experience, growing not 
only the number of stores 
in our network but also the 
range and quality of what 
we offer through these 
stores. Along the way 
we have built up a loyal 
customer base and strong 
roots in local communities 
up and down the country.
From evening meals 
to morning coffees
We continue to look for 
more ways to give our 
customers the products 
and services they want 
from their favourite 
neighbourhood store. 
One great example is our 
ongoing development of 
our fresh and food-to-go 
offers – from a great 
evening meal to pick up on 
your way home to a coffee 
and croissant to set you up 
for the morning. 
08 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Making a positive difference to our neighbourhoods
I wanted to highlight in particular the great work across 
the group that we do for the charity Cardiac Risk in the 
Young (CRY). This is a cause close to my heart as I lost my 
21-year old son Robert to sudden cardiac death in 2007, 
and I am extremely pleased and proud of the outstanding 
contributions of our colleagues and customers.
For the second year running, colleagues and customers 
across the group took part in fundraising events and 
made in-store donations over Halloween – raising over 
£170,000 for the TreatCRY initiative this year, and over 
£340,000 since we launched the campaign in 2013.
Looking ahead
The market continues to be challenging and competitive, 
but full of opportunities too. We will continue to grow 
our convenience store business as we head towards 
achieving our target of 1,000 stores by the end of 2016. 
At the same time we will continue to look for ways to 
expand and extend the range of products and services 
we provide to our customers in neighbourhoods up and 
down the country.
We’ve come a long way from our newsagent roots. 
We’re a world away from just being the place to go in 
the neighbourhood for your papers and milk. Increasingly 
we believe we are becoming the neighbourhood’s 
favourite store for just about every daily essential – from an 
evening meal to a morning coffee, from picking up your 
online purchases to posting a letter or paying a bill. 
I am extremely proud of the business I have led for 
over 40 years. We are a strong player in the world of 
convenience and I am determined to ensure that we 
continue to fulfil our strategy to grow and our desire to 
excel at the heart of the UK’s neighbourhoods.

The year in review
A year of  
great progress
For us, 2014 was a key year characterised by 
major developments such as our IPO and a step 
up in growth and performance as we continued 
to pursue our ambition to run great local stores at 
the heart of the UK’s neighbourhoods.
February
Listing on the  
main market
We quickly and successfully executed a full 
listing on the London Stock Exchange’s main 
market. This enabled us to pay off relatively 
expensive debt and free up more capital to 
invest in accelerating our growth and success.
June
Continuing to 
grow and develop 
our network of 
convenience 
stores
We opened our 750th convenience store 
in June and our 800th shortly after the 
period end. We also extended ranges into 
a further 102 of our largest convenience 
stores by April. Through the period, we 
more than doubled our rate of acquisitions 
while maintaining the same high level 
of quality.

Modernising  
our post offices
We completed a major programme to 
modernise 277 of the 451 post offices in 
our stores. As a result we can provide our 
customers with post offices that stay open 
as long as our stores do, and reap the 
benefits of integrating post offices more 
fully into our stores.
July
Launching our Plus 
card loyalty scheme
We launched a dedicated Plus card loyalty 
scheme for our customers. It has proved to be 
a highly successful way to say thank you to our 
customers for shopping with us – offering them a 
range of savings, opportunities to win competitions 
and to gain various rewards.

“TreatCRY was a really exciting venture for us when 
we first launched it with McColl’s last year and we 
were delighted when the retail group decided to 
repeat the campaign for a second year running. 
Yet again, thanks to the commitment of their staff, 
managers and extremely loyal, local customer base 
they were able to generate huge awareness for CRY 
in neighbourhoods and high streets across the UK 
– as well as a staggering fundraising total,” said CRY

Market overview 
Capturing 
growth in 
convenience
We continue to focus on the 
UK’s growing convenience 
sector while capitalising on 
our established position as the 
country’s leading newsagent.
The newsagent sector
The newsagent sector is highly fragmented, with a 
few large players such as ourselves and many smaller, 
independent operators. In 2014, there were 3,104 
newsagents in the UK
1
. We are the largest specialist 
confectioner, tobacconist and newsagent, with 516 
Martin’s and RS McColl newsagents, a 16.6% market 
share. The next biggest player has 105 newsagents.
A valuable foundation
We capitalise on our strength in newsagents to 
generate revenue for the group, meet the needs of 
neighbourhoods across the UK and provide a great 
foundation for our focus on growth in convenience. 
Since 2011, we have been converting a number of 
our newsagents to food and wine convenience stores, 
enabling us to offer a wider range of products and 
services to neighbourhoods and, in turn, boost our 
revenue and profit. In 2014, we converted a further 
45 newsagents in this way, bringing the total number 
of conversions to 135. In addition we can also convert 
a newsagent to a full convenience store, usually 
by acquiring a neighbouring store on the same 
shopping parade.
With our network of 
neighbourhood stores,  
we are well placed to  
make the most of the  
growth opportunities in  
UK convenience

Independents = 18,630 (39.3%)

Forecourts = 5,133 (10.9%)
Multiples = 3,771 (8.0%)
Co-ops = 2,680 (5.7%) 
The convenience sector
The convenience sector accounts for an increasingly 
significant proportion of the UK grocery market, with sales 
of £37.4bn in 2014, compared to £29.1bn in 2009
2
. This 
represents an annualised growth rate of 5.1%, compared 
to a 3.6% increase for the grocery market as a whole. In 
2014 the convenience channel was almost 5 times the 
size of on-line in the grocery market.
The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) forecasts that 
the UK convenience sector will grow at 5.5% per annum 
over the next five years, generating sales of £49.0bn and 
accounting for 24.1% of the grocery market by 2019. 
We believe this ongoing and increasing growth is driven 
by a number of factors, including:
• 
people opting for less frequent big shops
• 
households as a whole wanting to shop for value and 
waste less food
• 
the increasing number of single households in the UK
• 
the ageing population
• 
the growth in the female working population
• 
increasing working hours resulting in less time to shop
• 
an improvement in convenience stores in terms of 
quality and new products and services
At the same time, the market remains challenging, with 
continued pressure on consumers’ disposable income 
and price-driven competition.
Focusing on convenience
There are a number of different players in the 
convenience sector: multiples (owned and managed 
networks of convenience stores such as ours and those 
of the supermarket groups), symbols (networks of self-
employed operators that share the same name above 
the door, such as Nisa or Spar), independents, forecourts 
and co-operatives. 
We are the second largest multiple convenience store 
operator in the UK, owning and managing a network 
of 799 stores.
Greater competition and consolidation
As the popularity of convenience stores increases so does 
the competition. As a result, the market is consolidating, 
with the number of symbols, multiples and co-operative 
stores increasing by 18% since 2009. In 2014 these groups 
accounted for 72% of convenience sector sales. 
Multiples account for 19.4% of sector sales. According to 
IGD, the number of multiples increased from 2,812 to 3,771 
between 2009 and 2014, the largest percentage increase 
of all the players over this period.
Well placed to grow further
With our long-held focus on convenience and our 
experience in running and developing a strong network 
of neighbourhood stores, we are well placed to make 
the most of the growth opportunities in UK convenience. 
We have a distinctive view of our own particular network 
of convenience stores – they’re neighbourhood stores at 
the heart of where people live, rather than on the high 
streets near where people work or with high passing trade. 
Our stores offer local people excellent everyday products 
and services at great value provided by friendly staff who 
are always happy to help.
Building on this distinctive offer, we aim to continue 
increasing our convenience stores from 799 at the 
financial year end to 1,000 by the end of 2016 through 
acquisitions of new stores, mainly independents and 
symbols, and ongoing conversions of our newsagents. 
At the same time we will progressively expand the 
range and quality of products and services we offer 
neighbourhoods across the UK through our network 
of stores on their doorstep.

Strategy and business model 
Our strategy and 
business model
Our strategy is to focus on growing our convenience 
store business to strengthen and extend our position 
as the UK’s leading neighbourhood retailer. 
To implement our strategy we 
have a simple business model 
that puts the neighbourhood at 
the heart of everything we do. 
This model guides the way we 
grow and succeed:
Understand 
customers’ 
neighbourhood 
needs
Focus on 
neighbourhoods
De v elop and  
directly manage 
a network of  
stores to meet  
those needs
Build  
customer 
loyalty
In v est in the  
business, our 
people and the 
neighbourhoods  
we serve
14 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Our progress  
against our strategy
We have five key strategic priorities:
Priority Description Progress in 2014
 1
Extend our 
network of 
convenience 
stores
We acquire new stores and 
convert our newsagents to 
convenience stores by adding 
a range of groceries and alcohol 
and extending opening hours. 
• 
We acquired 60 stores in 2014.
• 
We converted 45 newsagents 
into food and wine stores.
• 
6 of the acquisitions were in 
existing trading locations enabling 
the conversion of a newsagent to 
a full convenience store.
 2
Focus on our 
customers 
and brand
We get close to our customers and do 
everything we can to understand and 
meet their everyday needs. We give 
our customers great, friendly service. 
We seek to build loyalty and the 
strength of our brands and reputation 
in the neighbourhoods we serve. 
• 
 In July we launched a dedicated 
Plus card loyalty scheme for 
our customers.
• 
We upgraded 40 convenience 
stores to our bright, modern 
format as well as applying it to 
all acquisitions and food and 
wine conversions.
 3
Expand our 
range of products 
and services
We offer an ever greater range of 
products and services to meet the 
everyday needs of neighbourhoods 
across the UK. Our products and 
services range from the morning’s milk 
to the evening’s meal, from post office 
services to internet collections.
• 
 We converted a further 102 
of our convenience stores to 
our premium format offering 
wider ranges of fresh and 
chilled products.
• 
We completed 192 post 
office local conversions and 
85 main conversions.
4
Ensure 
operational 
efficiency
We focus on maximising operational 
efficiency across our network of 
directly owned and managed stores. 
We achieve this in a number of ways, 
including highly effective EPoS 
systems, close communication 
between head office, the stores and 
area and regional managers, strong 
relationships with suppliers and the 
dedication of our outstanding 
colleagues across the group.
• 
 We completed the supply chain 
changes initiated in 2013 to 
optimise distribution arrangements.
• 
We introduced a number 
of operational efficiencies 
through information 
technology developments.
 5
Make the most 
of being at the 
heart of the 
neighbourhood
We seek to play an ever bigger 
and more positive role in the 
neighbourhoods we serve. From 
raising funds to support local good 
causes to employing local people 
and giving them rewarding career 
paths – we make the most of every 
opportunity to play a great long term 
role in the UK’s neighbourhoods.
• 
 We ran the TreatCRY at Halloween 
charity fundraising initiative for a 
second successful year.
• 
We continued to expand the 
range of services we offer through 
the addition of extra internet 
collection points and modernising 
our post office network.

Key performance indicators 
Our key  
performance 
indicators
We use six key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the  
performance of the group. We will keep KPIs under review to ensure 
they remain appropriate and are linked to remuneration policy.  
We show how we performed against our current KPIs below:
Revenue
1
 2014 922.4 
 2013 869.4 
 2012 844.7 
Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week 
in 2014, total sales grew by 4.1%, primarily 
reflecting additional sales from new stores.
Adjusted EBITDA
3
 2014 37.3 
 2013 34.2 
 2012 33.3 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9.0% in 2014 
and 2.7% in 2013. This significant improvement 
reflects the growth the group has achieved 
in its convenience store estate.
Like-for-like sales
2
 2014 0.7% 
 2013 2.2% 
 2012 2.6% 
We had strong like-for-like sales of 2.1% in the 
first half of 2014. The second half of the year 
includes comparisons against a strong summer in 
2013 and a slight weakening of trading conditions.
Operating profit before exceptional items
 2014 25.5 
 2013 22.5 
 2012 21.3 
Operating profit for the year increased by 13.2%, 
reflecting additional profits from new stores combined 
with strong cost controls.
Convenience stores
4
 2014 799 
 2013 707 
 2012 655 
The number of our convenience stores increased 
by 92 in 2014 (2013: 52) through a combination 
of acquiring new stores, converting newsagents 
and closing poor performing stores.
Earnings per share
5
 2014 15.6 
 2013 12.6 
 2012 9.9 
Earnings per share before exceptional items increased

Financial review 
A record  
financial 
performance
We delivered our best ever set 
of results in 2014. 
Revenue exceeded £900m for the first time and operating 
profit before exceptional items increased by 13.2%. We 
listed on the London Stock Exchange, which enabled us 
to substantially improve our capital structure.
Revenue
I am pleased to report another period of sales growth. 
Revenue increased to £922.4m (2013: £869.4m), an increase 
of 4.1% adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week in the 
current period, and like-for-like sales were ahead 0.7%. 
Total sales were boosted by the acceleration of our store 
development activity, with 45 newsagents converted to 
the food and wine model, and 60 new store acquisitions 
completed, more than double the 23 acquired last year.
Gross profit
Gross profit margins were close to those achieved last 
year at 24.2% (2013: 24.3%), with the fall reflecting a slight 
change in mix. Total gross profit increased to £222.8m 
(2013: £211.0m), an increase of 3.6% adjusting for the 
impact of the 53rd week.
Operating profit
Operating profit, before exceptional items, increased 
by 13.2% to £25.5m (2013: £22.5m), reflecting the increase 
in revenue and our continued control of costs, pro rata for 
52 weeks £25.0m, an increase of 11.1%. After exceptional 
items, operating profit decreased to £22.0m (2013: £22.5m).
Administrative expenses, before exceptional costs, 
improved to 24.2% of revenue (2013: 24.5%) as we 
continued to control store operational costs and 
leverage our central support structure.
Other operating income before exceptional income,  
as shown in note 7 on page 74, increased to £25.7m  
(2013: £24.5m), reflecting a strong post office performance.
We have adopted the amendments to IAS19 ‘Employee 
Benefits’ during the period and have restated 2013 figures 
accordingly, resulting in an additional £0.8m charge for 
that period.
We have identified a number of exceptional items in 
the current financial period. These items are explained 
more fully in note 6 to the financial statements on  
page 73.

Financial review continued
Net finance costs
We were able to substantially reduce our finance costs 
following the IPO. Net finance costs before exceptional 
items reduced to £6.2m (2013: £12.5m). 
Both the current and the prior period included 
exceptional restructuring costs associated with 
refinancing of the group’s debt facilities. These items 
are explained more fully in note 6 on page 73.
Profit before tax
Profit on ordinary activities before taxation increased to 
£12.6m (2013: £4.4m) reflecting stronger operating profit 
and a reduction in finance costs.
Taxation
The tax charge for the period increased to £2.7m (2013: tax 
credit of £0.8m), representing an effective tax rate of 21.6% 
compared to the statutory rate for the period of 21.7%. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share increased to 10.2 pence  
(2013: 6.9 pence). Adjusted earnings per share, stated 
before exceptional items, increased to 15.6 pence  
(2013: 12.6 pence).
Dividends
The board has recommended a final dividend of 6.8 pence 
per share (2013: nil), which will be paid on 29 May 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
1 May 2015, subject to approval by shareholders at the 
annual general meeting. The total dividend for the 9 month 
period post IPO will therefore be 8.5 pence per share.
Balance sheet
Shareholders’ funds at the end of the period were £117.2m 
(2013: £55.9m), an increase of £61.3m. This is principally due 
to the restructuring of the balance sheet at IPO, and the 
profitable growth of the business for the period. 
The book value of goodwill and other intangibles, property, 
plant and equipment increased by £8.3m to £202.2m (2013: 
£193.9m), following an increase in capital expenditure.
Striking the right 
balance
As a neighbourhood 
business, we know how 
important it is to make the 
most of local knowledge 
and commitment, and we 
encourage this across our 
stores and regions – giving 
our people freedom to 
anticipate and respond to 
their neighbourhood needs. 
At the same time we make 
sure we maintain strong 
central control and 
management, for example 
through our modern 
EPoS systems.
18 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Current assets at the end of the period decreased 
to £87.3m (2013: £100.5m), due to a reduction in cash 
balances. As a result of the more flexible banking facilities 
introduced at IPO we have been able to minimise drawings 
under our working capital facility at the period end.
Our current liabilities decreased to £116.9m (2013: £128.7m), 
reflecting lower trade and other payables as a result of the 
impact of the 53rd week and a reduction in short term 
borrowings following the IPO. 
Non current liabilities reduced to £61.9m (2013: £114.4m), 
principally reflecting a reduction in borrowings post IPO.
Pensions
We operate two defined benefit pension schemes, both 
of which are closed to future accrual. The combined 
surplus in the two schemes improved by £1.6m to £1.3m 
(2013: £0.3m combined deficit). 
Cash flow and net debt
We continued to generate strong operational cash flow. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the period 
was £34.6m (2013: £28.4m). 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by £3.1m to £37 .3m (2013: £34.2m).
Working capital outflow of £2.3m (2013: £2.2m outflow) 
was impacted by the 53rd week, which meant that the 
period included additional cash outflows. The impact  
on working capital was an outflow of £11.7m, and the 
underlying position was therefore an inflow of £9.4m.
Net capital expenditure increased by £8.7m to £19.3m 
(2013: £10.6m). This primarily reflected an increase in 
expenditure on acquisitions and store developments.
Finance expense of £4.2m was £6.7m lower than the prior 
year due to the lower cost capital structure post IPO.
The interim dividend paid in the period was £1.8m.
Net debt at the end of the period improved to £37.4m 
(2013: £86.2m). Adjusting for the impact of the 53rd week 
in the current period, underlying net debt was £25.7m, 
representing 0.7 times Adjusted EBITDA.
Initial Public Offering (IPO)
On 28 February 2014 the company’s shares opened 
for trading on the main market of the London Stock 
Exchange. The company received £49.8m proceeds 
from the issue of new shares and incurred issue costs of 
£2.7m. At the same time the group entered into a new 
£85.0m working capital facility of which £60.9m was 
initially drawn, incurring refinancing costs of £1.4m. The 
net proceeds of the share issue and drawings under the 
new facility were used to repay existing loans of £109.4m. 
At the end of the current period drawings against the 
working capital facility had reduced to £46.0m.
This represents a significant improvement in our 
capital structure and as a result we have been able 
to successfully accelerate our growth strategy and 
are well placed to continue to do so.

Corporate responsibility
Making a  
positive difference
We want to be at the heart of the 
UK’s neighbourhoods – over 80% 
of our stores are in such locations, 
serving the everyday needs of 
people living close by. Being 
responsible is part and parcel of 
this neighbourhood commitment. 
Communities
One of the key ways we live up to our community 
commitment is through our group-wide support of 
the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY).
Every week in the UK, 12 apparently fit and healthy young 
people die suddenly from undiagnosed heart conditions. 
In 80% of cases, there are no signs or symptoms. CRY is 
dedicated to helping reduce these deaths through 
greater awareness, research and its pioneering screening 
programme – which now tests around 15,000 young 
people every year.
For the second year running, colleagues and customers 
across the group took part in fundraising events and 
made in-store donations over Halloween – raising over 
£170,000 for the TreatCRY initiative.
Environment
Recycling packaging
Through our arrangements with our two key distributors 
we recycle plastic and cardboard used in our business. 
The same lorries that arrive with products leave with 
plastic and cardboard – it’s a neat, energy-efficient 
way to recycle packaging. So far, we have recycled 
well over 1,500 tonnes of waste.
Improving energy efficiency
Since 2012, with the introduction of our energy 
management initiative, we have made great progress 
in improving our energy efficiency. This has included 
removing surplus or particularly inefficient kit from our 
stores; undertaking measures such as last man out 
switches; photocells that switch lighting on and off 
when areas aren’t used; and doors and timers on chillers. 
As a result, in 2013 we reduced our like-for-like energy 
consumption by 5.6% and in 2014 by a further 1.6%.

20 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Our responsible approach has five pillars:
 1
We are a UK business
From our roots in the business 
established by our chief 
executive James Lancaster  
in 1973, we have grown to 
become the UK’s largest 
neighbourhood retailer  
across the country. 
 2
We support good causes
We support a variety of local, 
regional and national good 
causes and charities – from 
raising money across the 
group for Cardiac Risk in the 
Young (CRY) to donating to 
local football teams.
 3
We are a sustainable retailer
We are committed to 
achieving good environmental 
practice and strive to make a 
positive impact. 
4
We offer local services
We offer a variety of essential 
everyday services to local 
communities – from post 
offices to internet collections 
and returns, from delivering 
newspapers to food-to-go.
 5
We employ local people
We employ and seek to 
develop the skills and 
potential of local people.
Colleagues
Our colleagues make our brands. Their commitment, 
friendliness and professionalism make all the difference 
to our business. To reinforce this contribution, we invest in 
recruiting, retaining and developing great people, many 
of them from the local communities we serve.
Developing people
We are committed to equal opportunities for colleagues 
at all levels. 
In 2014, we relaunched our induction programme 
for our store-based colleagues, including additional 
modules on, for example, security and fresh foods in 
response to the ongoing growth and developments 
in our convenience business. 
We also relaunched our area managers’ academy and 
strengthened our apprenticeship programme, offering a 
broader range of NVQ qualifications. Currently we have 
251 apprentices across the group and offer a range of 
retail-based qualifications to other colleagues.
We run a very successful onwards and upwards development 
programme for our colleagues, focusing on some of the key 
roles within the business. Many of today’s store managers 
started out with us on a paper round or as sales assistants, 
underlining the career opportunities we provide and the 
role we play for local people. 
Rewarding people
We offer a range of benefits for colleagues as well as flexible 
working opportunities. We are keen to make sure everyone 
understands what’s available to them as well as what is 
expected of them and to this end we launched a new 
colleague handbook in 2014 for everyone in the group.
Human rights
Whilst the group does not have a specific human 
rights policy at present, people are treated in line with 
internationally proclaimed human rights principles. There 
are a range of policies in place demonstrating effective 
management of human rights issues in the business.
Health and safety
We are committed to a strong health and safety culture. 
In 2014, we established two health and safety forums –  
a management-level forum which looks at the strategic 
direction for health and safety and risk as a business, 
and a broader forum which enables our store-based 
colleagues to provide their input.
We developed a three-year health and safety 
strategy designed to enable us to take a consistent and 
collaborative approach to creating a safe place for our 
employees and customers.

Principal risks 
How we identify , 
assess and  
manage risk
We are committed to good corporate governance. To this end, we  
follow a sound risk management process closely aligned to our strategy. 
Principal risks Risk Mitigation
Business strategy
 If the board either adopts the wrong 
strategy or fails to communicate or 
implement its strategies effectively, 
our aims may not be met and the 
business may suffer.
• 
 Strategic development is led by 
the chief executive and senior 
management and considered 
by the board.
• 
Strategy is communicated via 
numerous channels.
• 
Implementation plans are aligned 
to our strategic targets and 
monitored closely by the board.
Competition
We operate in a competitive market 
and compete with a wide variety of 
retailers locally and nationally. Failure 
to maintain market share could affect 
our performance and profitability.
• 
 Competition is monitored and our 
flexible model enables the business 
to be adapted accordingly.
• 
Customer trends are 
continually reviewed 
(see customer proposition).
Customer proposition
Our customers’ shopping habits are 
influenced by broader economic 
factors and if we fail to keep our 
proposition aligned with their 
expectations they may choose to 
shop elsewhere and our revenues 
could suffer.
• 
 Regular product reviews ensure 
customer needs and wants are met.
• 
We regularly review our positioning 
against competitors.
• 
We introduced a customer focused 
loyalty scheme during 2014.
Economy
All our revenue is derived from the UK. 
The continued challenging economic 
environment could reduce our 
customers’ income and therefore 
affect our revenues.
• 
 We offer both value products and 
premium brands, which lowers our 
exposure to a reduction in 
discretionary spend.
• 
Our wide range of locations means 
we do not rely on any one site or 
geographical area.
Risk change in year
Increased M ai n t ai n e d Decreased
22 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Principal risks Risk Mitigation
Financial and treasury
The main financial risks are the 
availability of short and long term 
funding to meet business needs and 
fluctuations in interest rates.
• 
 We have a committed £85m 
working capital facility available 
until 31 August 2018.
• 
Our treasury department 
forecasts and manages 
funding requirements.
• 
The board approves budgets 
and business plans.
• 
Our risks associated with financial 
instruments are disclosed in note 
26 on pages 86 to 89. 
Information technology
We depend on the reliability and 
capability of key information systems 
and technology. A major incident or 
prolonged performance issues with 
store or head office systems could 
adversely affect our business.
• 
All business critical systems are well 
established and are supported by 
an appropriate disaster recovery 
strategy designed to ensure the 
continuity of the business.
Operational cost base
We have a relatively high cost 
base, consisting primarily of 
employee, property rental and 
energy costs. Increases in these 
costs without a corresponding 
increase in revenues could 
adversely impact our profitability.
• 
 We operate a flexible staff model 
aligned to revenue levels.
• 
Property management is a key 
function with regular review 
processes in place.
• 
We minimise energy costs by 
combining energy efficiency 
initiatives and forward purchasing.
Regulation
We operate in an environment 
governed by strict regulations to 
ensure the safety and protection 
of customers, colleagues, 
shareholders and other stakeholders. 
These regulations include alcohol 
licensing, employment, health and 
safety, data protection and the rules 
of the Stock Exchange. 
• 
 We have clear accountability 
for compliance with all areas 
of regulation.
• 
Our policies and procedures are 
designed to meet all relevant laws 
and regulations.
• 
We have a health and safety 
compliance steering group.
Supply chain
We rely on a small number of key 
distributors and may be adversely 
affected by changes in supplier 
dynamics and interruptions in supply. 
• 
 Our distribution partners are 
carefully selected and maintain 
their own contingency planning.
• 
We monitor supplier performance 
including service level agreements.

which 2 were female board members. As at 30 November

was listed the following changes were made to the board:

in respect of each of the directors since listing on the 
London Stock Exchange on 28 February 2014. 
Appointment of directors
At the first annual general meeting since the company  
was incorporated, and in accordance with the company’s 
articles of association, all the directors are required to  
stand for election by the shareholders. Going forward  
and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code 2012 (“Code”) all directors will be considered for 
re-election annually. Details of the non-executive directors’ 
letters of appointment are given in on page 33 under Role

Employee engagement
The group employs 18,685 employees and had 6,690 
full time equivalents at the period end.
The group actively involves employees in the business 
and ensures that they are engaged in matters impacting 
them. This includes consulting with employees or their 
representatives on a regular basis so that the views of 
employees are understood by management and can 
be taken into account in making decisions which are likely 
to affect their interests. This is primarily achieved via senior 
management meetings and briefings. 
Employees are also made aware of the financial and 
economic factors affecting the performance of the group 
via newsletters and briefings by management. The group 
encourages the involvement of employees in the group’s 
performance through operation of a bonus scheme 
which applies to approximately 85 employees and 
provides an incentive to the employees.

Directors’ report continued
The group provides its employees with a variety of 
opportunities to learn new skills that will help them to 
develop and be successful in their careers. This includes 
using a combination of video learning, on the job 
coaching and some classroom based workshops where 
applicable. In addition, all employees receive induction 
training when they commence employment with the 
group. The group is intending to grant awards under 
its CSOP in 2015 to further encourage the involvement 
of its senior managers in the group’s performance.
For those employees wishing to progress, the group 
operates a development programme focusing on some 
of the key roles within the business. Each individual is 
provided with a tailored training plan based on their 
current job knowledge and skill sets to help them 
achieve their career goals. 
The group also works in partnership with Skillnet, a 
national provider of vocational qualifications, offering 
opportunities to all eligible colleagues to gain retail 
based qualifications whilst working in their current role.
The directors recognise the importance of ensuring the 
highest standards of health and safety are maintained 
for employees, customers and others who may be 
affected by the activities of the business.
The group is committed to being an equal 
opportunities employer: 
• 
It provides full and fair consideration to all applications 
for employment with the group including disabled 
persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes 
and abilities;
• 
It also endeavours to continue the employment of, and 
for arranging appropriate training for, employees of the 
group who become disabled whilst employed by the 
group; and
• 
It provides disabled employees with the training, 
career development and promotion whilst employed 
by the group.
Annual general meeting 
The board welcome the opportunity to meet with 
shareholders at the annual general meeting which 
will be held on 17 April 2015 at 2 pm at the registered 
office McColl’s House, Ashwells Road, Brentwood,  
Essex CM15 9ST.
Dividend
The directors have proposed a final dividend of 6.8 pence 
per share, amounting to £7.1m, which is subject to 
shareholder approval at the annual general meeting. 
Provided shareholder approval is received the final 
dividend will be paid on 29 May 2015 to those 
shareholders on the register at the close of business 
on 1 May 2015.
External auditors
Deloitte LLP have given their independent report on the 
financial statements to the shareholders of the company 
on pages 56 to 61.
Directors’ statement of disclosure of information to auditors
Having made the requisite enquiries, the directors in office 
at the date of this annual report and financial statements 
have each confirmed that, so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 
of the Companies Act 2006) of which the group’s auditors 
are unaware, and each of the directors has taken all the 
steps he/she ought to have taken as a director to make 
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the group’s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
Auditor reappointment
The auditor Deloitte LLP has indicated its willingness to 
continue as the company’s auditor, and accordingly 
a resolution to appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors of the 
company and the group will be proposed at the 2015 
annual general meeting. 
Financial risk management
Financial risk management objectives and policies, 
including information on financial risks that materially 
impact the group can be found in note 26 of the financial 
statements on pages 86 to 89. 
Going concern 
In making their going concern assessment the directors 
have considered the group’s business activities, its 
financial position, the market in which it operates and 
the factors likely to affect its future development.
The directors have reviewed the group’s forecasts, taking 
into account a range of sensitivities, and how they impact 
headroom against its bank facilities, and its ability to meet 
its capital investment and operational needs. 
The group has net current liabilities of £29.6m at the period 
end. The directors have additionally considered this 
position to determine if it presents any going concern 
issues. The group is profitable and cash generative and 
has in place a committed £85.0m working capital facility 
available to be drawn until 31 August 2018. As at 30 
November 2014 £46.0m was drawn against the facility, 
and therefore there is sufficient headroom to meet the 
group’s debts as they fall due.
The directors believe there is reasonable basis on which 
they can satisfy themselves that the business is a going 
concern and that it is appropriate for the financial 
statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Post period end events 
Between 30 November 2014 and the date of this 
report there have been no material events that 
require disclosure.
Political donations
The group did not make any political donations during 
the period (2013: £nil).

Greenhouse gas emissions
The group is required to measure and report direct and 
indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pursuant to the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013. As this is the first GHG emissions report in line 
with UK mandatory reporting requirements set out by the 
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), 
there is no comparative year. The mandatory requirement is 
for the disclosure of the scope 1 and 2 emissions only. These 
are direct emissions such as heating, vehicle fuel and indirect 
emissions such as purchased electricity.
The group’s total GHG footprint in line with section 7 at the 
companies act (strategic report and directors) regulations 
2013 is shown in the table below. 
Emissions data for period 25 November 2013  
to 30 November 2014
Scope 1
Fuel combustion (natural gas, vehicle fuels  
and other fuels) 1,888
Refrigerants 2,122
4,010
Scope 2
Purchased electricity 52,121
Total 56,131
Greenhouse gas emissions intensity ratio:
2014
CO
2
e tonnes per £100,000 of revenue 6.1
Note that:
• 
The group has reported on all the measured 
emissions sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Director’s Reports) 
Regulations 2013;
• 
The group has used the guidance as set out in DEFRA’s 
Environmental Reporting Guidelines: including 
mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting 
guidance, dated June 2013;
• 
The group has engaged a consultancy firm, BDO LLP, 
to oversee the collection of data and provide guidance 
on complying with appropriate regulations. The figures 
disclosed above for 2014 and the methodology used to 
collate the information has been reviewed and 
approved by BDO LLP;
• 
For electricity, gas and other fuels, consumption data 
has been extracted from billing information from 25 
November 2013 to the date of the last bill received for 
each type of supply. Therefore some extrapolation has 
been required in order to calculate the full 53 week 
consumption figure;
• 
Petrol and fuel data has been collated from 
information received from the group’s fleet 
management consultant;
• 
Refrigerant data has been calculated by reference to 
individual items of equipment and then extrapolating 
this based on an estimated level of equipment within 
each property used by the group; 
• 
Data collected is in respect of the 53 weeks ended 
30 November 2014. The carbon conversion factors 
used are those published by Defra for 2014; and
• 
This is the group’s first year of MER reporting since the 
group achieved listing, therefore 2014 represents the 
base reporting year.
The strategic report, the directors’ report and the 
directors’ remuneration report were approved by 
the board.
Approved by the board and signed on its behalf:

Corporate  
governance report 
Chairman’s letter 
Dear shareholder
Since the company’s admission to the 
London Stock Exchange, the board has 
adopted compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the ‘code’) published 
by the Financial Reporting Council in 
September 2012*.
It is the opinion of the board that the company has 
been compliant with the provisions of the code since 
the company listed on the 28 February 2014 with the 
following exceptions:
• 
The code recommends that the roles of chairman and 
chief executive should not be exercised by the same 
individual (code A.2.1). Prior to 22 July 2014 the role of 
the chief executive and chairman was combined but 
as at that date, I succeeded James Lancaster as the 
company’s non-executive chairman. The board, 
however, does not consider such non-compliance 
to be detrimental to the interests of the group or the 
shareholders as a whole on the basis of the current 
directors’ experience, judgement and character. 
Details are given in the nomination committee report.
• 
The code recommends that the board should appoint 
one of the independent non-executive directors to be 
the senior independent director (the SID) (code A.4.1). 
Until 22 July 2014 I acted as the company’s SID. However, 
when I was appointed as chairman the position of SID 
became vacant and after further consideration it was 
decided that the appointment of a SID to the company 
was unnecessary at the current time. The board will keep 
the need for a SID under review.
• 
The code recommends that the chairman should hold 
meetings with the non-executive directors without the 
executives present and the non-executive directors 
should meet without the chairman present at least 
annually to appraise the chairman’s performance 
(A.4.2.). The chairman has met with non-executive 
directors without the executive directors present and 
the non-executive will meet without the chairman 
when assessing the chairman’s performance.
• 
The code recommends that there should be a 
nomination committee which should lead the process 
for board appointments and make recommendations 
to the board. (B.2.1.). The membership of the company’s 
nomination committee is the chairman, 2 non-executive 
directors and the chief executive, therefore only half of 
the committee is independent. However, the board 
believe it is appropriate to include both the chairman 
and chief executive to ensure the business needs are 
met and potential directors are of suitable calibre for  
the group.
• 
The code recommends the board should undertake 
a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its committees and individual 
directors (code B.6). As this report relates to the 
company’s first year as a listed company and the 
chairman and non-executive directors are new to 
the company, the board has not, as yet, carried out a 
board, committee or directors performance evaluation 
as their focus has been on developing the company’s 
business model and creating processes and procedures 
within which the company should operate. The board 
felt it more appropriate to wait until such time as the 
board and its committees were fully established before 
carrying out a full evaluation. The board have scheduled 
a board evaluation by way of an internal assessment 
to be undertaken during 2015. Furthermore, a full 
assessment of each director’s suitability was undertaken 
prior to the company’s listing and it was felt that this was 
sufficient to discharge its duties under the code. 
* https://www.frc.org.uk/Our-Work/Publications/Corporate-Governance/
UK-Corporate-Governance-Code-September-2012.aspx
30 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 • 
The code recommends that the board should establish 
a remuneration committee of at least 3, or in the case 
of smaller companies 2, independent non-executive 
directors. In addition the company chairman may also 
be a member of, but not chair, the committee if he or 
she was considered independent on appointment as 
chairman (code D.2.1). On 22 July 2014, I was appointed 
as chairman to the board although I continued to act 
as chairman of the remuneration committee, in 
contravention of this provision of the code. The board 
recognised my experience enabled me to make a 
valuable contribution during the consultation process 
with the remuneration consultants whilst being both 
the  board and remuneration committee chairman. 
Subsequently on the 24 November 2014, I stepped 
down as remuneration committee chairman and 
Georgina Harvey was appointed and thus the company 
is now in compliance with this provision of the code.
• 
The code also recommends that at least half the 
board, excluding the chairman, should comprise 
independent non-executive directors and that 
a smaller company should have at least two 
independent non-executive directors (code B1.2). 
The board recognises that the company’s current 
composition meets the smaller company regulation, 
however, the board does not consider this to be 
detrimental to the interests of the group or the 
shareholders as a whole on the basis of the current 
directors’ experience, judgement and character.
In readiness for the company being listed on the London 
Stock Exchange, new non-executive directors were 
appointed in February 2014 and I believe that we have 
a board that will support and challenge the executive 
management when appropriate or necessary to drive 
forward its objectives.
As chairman, I would like to state my full commitment 
to preserving high corporate governance principals. 
Yours sincerely
John Coleman

32 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Division of responsibilities
Role of the chairman
The chairman is responsible for leading and managing 
the business of the board and ensuring its effectiveness. 
He sets the agenda for board discussions and ensures 
that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information from the company’s senior managers. There 
is a clear division of responsibilities between the chairman 
and chief executive, which is set out in writing and agreed 
by the board.
Role of chief executive 
The role of the chief executive is to provide a link between 
the board and the management of the group and to 
ensure that the company’s strategic decisions are 
effectively implemented. 
Role of the non-executive directors 
The non–executive directors provide valuable 
experience, judgement and independent support to 
the board. They assist in the development of strategy 
and exercise constructive challenge and support to 
management. The non-executive directors’ letters of 
appointment set out their duties and the level of 
commitment expected. Non-executive directors are 
appointed for an initial 3 year term with typical tenure 
expected to be 2 x 3 year terms but may be invited by the 
board to serve an additional term, subject to re-election 
by shareholders. They are expected to commit at least 
15 - 20 days per annum to their role. In the board’s opinion 
the non-executive directors have exercised independent 
judgement by providing constructive challenge to the 
executive directors.
Key elements of the non-executive directors’ roles are:
• 
Strategy – constructively challenge and develop 
proposals on strategy;
• 
Performance – scrutinise the performance of 
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives 
and monitor reporting performance;
• 
Risk – to satisfy themselves in relation to the integrity of 
financial information and that financial controls and 
systems of risk management are robust and defensible; 
• 
People – determine appropriate levels of remuneration 
of executive directors and have a prime role in the 
appointment and where necessary the removal of 
executive directors and succession planning;
• 
Time – devote time to develop and refresh their 
knowledge and skill;
• 
Standards – uphold high standards of integrity and 
probity and support to the board developing the 
appropriate culture, values and behaviours in the 
board room and beyond;
• 
Information – insist upon receiving high quality 
information sufficiently in advance of board meetings 
to make informed decisions; and
• 
Shareholders – consider the views of shareholders and 
other stakeholders. 
Directors’ training 
Each new director this year has received a tailored 
induction and familiarisation programme implemented by 
the chief executive so that they learn about the business. 
The directors and senior managers have received training 
on their statutory duties, Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules. 
Conflicts of interest 
The articles of association provide that the directors 
may authorise any actual or potential conflict of interest 
that a director may have, with or without imposing any 
conditions that they consider appropriate on the director. 
Directors are not able to vote in respect of any contract, 
arrangement or transaction in which they have a 
material interest and in such circumstances they 
are not counted in the quorum. A process has been 
developed to identify any of the directors’ potential 
or actual conflicts of interest. This includes declaring any 
potential new conflicts before the start of each board 
and committee meeting. There were no actual or 
potential conflicts of interest which were required to 
be authorised by the board during the period under 
review or to the date of this report.
Internal control and risk management
The board recognise that it is their responsibility to 
present a balanced and understandable assessment 
of the group’s position and long term prospects and has 
responsibility for ensuring that management maintain an 
effective system of risk management and internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The purpose of risk 
management is to manage rather than eliminate risk 
entirely and to achieve the business objectives. 
Effectiveness of internal controls 
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s 
internal control system and for reviewing their 
effectiveness. This has been designed to assist the 
board in making better, more risk-informed, strategic 
decisions with a view to creating and protecting 
shareholder value. The group’s internal control procedures 
provide an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing significant risks. The board recognises that 
such a system has its limitations in that risk management 
requires independent judgement on the part of directors 
and executive management. Internal controls are 
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives, and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The control environment includes high level group-wide 
controls, as well as controls over business processes both 
centrally and at store level. Process controls include those 
over sales and pricing, stock, payroll, property, central 
expenditure, cash, payment processing, information 
technology and risk management.

Corporate governance report continued
Risk governance
Effective risk management is essential to the long term 
success of the business and it requires an appropriate risk 
governance structure. 
Management have established a risk register for 
identifying, evaluating and managing risk faced by the 
group on an ongoing basis, both at an operational and 
strategic level. The risk identification and mitigation 
processes have been designed to be responsive to 
likelihood of occurrence. Appropriate action is taken 
to manage and mitigate risks identified. 
Key features of the risk management and internal  
control systems
The key areas which the framework details, are:
• 
risk governance environment (as described above); and
• 
maintenance of a key risk register, incorporating risk 
management procedures to gather and document 
risk information relating to new risks, progress on any 
mitigations requiring action, changes to current risks 
or mitigations and changes to the overall risk profile.
A risk register is an important instrument of the group’s 
risk framework arrangements, as it documents the 
identification and assessment of risks, any mitigation 
requiring action and accountability within the senior 
management team. The directors have identified the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing the group, 
many of which are considered key to the successful 
implementation of strategy and long term growth. 
The key risks, and how they are mitigated, are 
described on pages 22 and 23.
Financial and business reporting
The board seeks to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the group’s position 
and prospects in all half year, full year and any other 
price-sensitive reports and other information 
published externally.
The board receives a number of reports, including those 
from the audit committee, to enable it to monitor and 
clearly understand the group’s financial position. A new 
disclosure policy was put in place during the period 
following IPO to enhance the process for ensuring that 
price-sensitive information is identified effectively and all 
communications with the market are released at the 
appropriate times.
Anti-fraud, bribery and corruption 
The group aims to promote honest and ethical conduct. 
To support this, it has in place an anti-bribery policy, which 
aims to ensure compliance with the Bribery Act 2010.
Whistleblowing
The group has a policy and formal procedures to ensure 
that colleagues can confidentially raise concerns about 
possible improprieties. This policy takes into account the 
Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which protects 
employees making disclosures about certain matters of 
concern, where those disclosures are made 
in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This year 
one issue was reported which related to an employee 
grievance and was investigated accordingly. If any 
significant incident occurs, the directors will be informed 
and the incident investigated immediately.
Relations with shareholders
The board is committed to maintaining an open and 
honest relationship with its shareholders. Directors 
encourage all shareholders to participate at the 
annual general meeting.
The chief executive, the chief financial officer and 
the chief operating officer have had meetings with 
institutional investors to explain the group strategy 
and performance and to learn what is important to them. 
The non-executive directors would be willing to meet with 
shareholders if they requested a meeting. In addition the 
group’s broker, Numis, informs them of analyst and investor 
views. 
The group’s website (http://www.mccolls.co.uk/investor.
aspx) contains all the latest announcements, press 
releases and published financial information including the 
annual report. The notice of the annual general meeting 
will be distributed to shareholders at least 20 working days 
before the meeting and is also available from the website. 
Each resolution will be proposed separately at the 
meeting and those shareholders attending will be asked 
to cast their vote. Proxy votes already received will be 
countered and after the vote has been taken on a show 
of hands the proxy vote will be displayed.
34 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Composition of the committee 
The members of the committee during the period 
were John Coleman as chairman, James Lancaster, 
Sharon Brown and Georgina Harvey. Half of the members 
of the committee are independent non-executive 
directors of the board. There have been no changes in 
the membership of the committee since the period end. 
The committee will normally meet not less than twice 
a year when appropriate. After each committee  
meeting, the chairman reports to the board on the 
main items discussed. 
The role and duties of the nomination committee
The nomination committee’s responsibilities are to:
• 
regularly review the structure, size and composition 
(including the skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity) required of the board and make 
recommendations to the board;
• 
give full consideration to succession planning for 
directors, the chairman and committee members and 
other senior executives in the course of its work, taking 
into account the challenges and opportunities facing 
the company;
• 
keep under review the leadership needs of the 
organisation, both executive and non-executive, with a 
view to ensuring the continued ability of the organisation 
to compete effectively in the marketplace;
• 
be responsible for identifying and nominating for the 
approval of the board, candidates to fill board 
vacancies as and when they arise; 
• 
propose the re-election by shareholders of any director 
having due regard to their performance and ability to 
continue to contribute to the board in the light of the 
knowledge, skills and experience required and the need 
for progressive refreshing of the board (particularly in 
relation to directors being re-elected for a term beyond 
6 years);
• 
evaluate the balance of skills, knowledge, experience 
and diversity on the board and, in the light of this 
evaluation, prepare a description of the role and 
capabilities required for a particular appointment, 
before any appointment is made by the board; 
• 
prior to the appointment of a director, require the 
proposed appointee to disclose any other business 
interests that may result in a conflict of interest and to 
report any future business interests that could result in 
a conflict of interest;
• 
review annually the time required from non-executive 
directors; and 
• 
review the results of the board for performance 
evaluation process that relates to the composition 
of the board.

McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 35

Corporate governance report continued
Main activities during 2014
Prior to the company’s IPO, the board appointed an 
executive search consultant, the Inzito Partnership, with 
whom the company has no other connection, to identify 
candidates to fill 3 non-executive board vacancies. 
Following a rigorous selection process, John Coleman, 
Sharon Brown and Georgina Harvey were appointed 
non-executive directors. 
During 2014, the nomination committee played an 
important part in ensuring that the leadership of the 
business was suitable for a newly premium listed 
company. In particular it has:
• 
given consideration to separating the roles of chairman 
and chief executive held by James Lancaster and of 
John Coleman’s appointment as chairman and 
accordingly this separation of roles took effect from 
22 July 2014. The board recognised the rationale given 
in the code to splitting these roles and the benefit to 
the company of having different individuals;
• 
following Martyn Aguss tendering his resignation as 
chief operating officer on 22 July 2014 and as a director 
of the company with effect from 30 July 2014, the 
nomination committee recommended David Thomas 
as his successor;
• 
subsequent to John Coleman’s appointment as 
chairman the position of SID became vacant and 
after further consideration it was decided that the 
appointment of a SID to the company was unnecessary 
at the current time given the size and scale of the 
business, but that this would be kept under review. 
The shareholders are free to raise any concerns 
they have with any board member including the 
independent non-executive directors;
• 
considered if John Coleman should remain as 
remuneration committee chairman in breach of 
code provision D 2.1. The nomination committee felt 
that initially it was in the best interests of the company 
to allow John to continue to lead the remuneration 
committee; however, it has subsequently recommended 
to the board that Georgina Harvey be appointed 
remuneration committee chairman (from 24 November 
2014) although John Coleman has remained a member; 
• 
discussed the succession planning at board and senior 
executive level; and 
• 
reviewed the committees rolling agendas and overview 
of duties which enables it to fulfil its responsibilities. 
In addition the committee can confirm that all 
directors are required to disclose all significant outside 
commitments prior to appointment and the board has 
approved a policy requiring disclosure and approval by 
the board of all additional appointments for executive 
or non-executive directors. There have been no material 
changes in the outside commitments of a director during 
the period which impacted on the time required to 
commit to the company.
Board diversity
The board supports diversity, recognising the benefits 
that diverse viewpoints can contribute in decision-
making. It is the intention of the board always to keep 
the benefits that derive from a diverse board in mind 
when making appointments. The board does not believe 
that setting a quota is the most appropriate method for 
achieving a balanced board and all appointments are 
made on merit. Currently 33% of the board is comprised 
of female directors.
Diversity, including gender diversity, is pursued throughout 
the business and the board continues to follow a policy of 
appointing talented people at every level to deliver high 
performance. This will ensure development in this area is 
consistent with the group’s own strategic objectives and is 
enhancing in terms of board effectiveness. 
36 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Chairman’s introduction
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the first 
formal report of the audit committee to shareholders.
The audit committee was established as part of the 
governance processes adopted by the company, 
following admission to the premium list of the London 
Stock Exchange on 28 February 2014, and this report 
relates to the period since this date. Best practice is for 
audit committee members to be non-executive directors, 
independent in character and judgement. Consequently, 
the committee has been comprised of the 3 non-
executive directors of the board. 
The primary responsibilities of the committee are to ensure 
the integrity of the company’s financial reporting and the 
appropriateness of the risk management processes and 
internal controls. The following report details how we carry 
out this role. 
One of the key considerations for the committee 
in the period was to ensure that the company had 
effective and resilient policies and controls in place, 
to the standard expected of a public listed company. 
This has resulted in the formalisation and strengthening 
of a number of the company’s policies and processes. 
In addition, we reviewed the reporting changes required 
for a listed company to ensure that the 2014 annual report 
was prepared in line with best practice. 
 
The committee considered and is satisfied that, taken 
as a whole, the 2014 annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the company’s performance 
and strategy. If any shareholder has comments or 
suggestions relating to the report, please do get in touch.
Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to 
acknowledge the significant amount of work that is 
involved with becoming a public listed company and 
thank my colleagues at the group who have worked 
tirelessly to achieve this.
Yours sincerely
Sharon Brown

Committee composition and meetings
The members of the committee during the period were 
Sharon Brown as chairman, John Coleman and Georgina 
Harvey. The majority of the committee are independent 
non-executive directors of the board. The committee 
considers that collectively the members have appropriate 
recent and relevant financial experience to fully 
discharge their responsibilities. There have been no 
changes in the membership of the committee since 
the period end. 
Capita Company Secretarial Services Limited serves 
as secretary to the committee. The chief executive, 
chief financial officer and audit partner from the external 
auditor attend committee meetings by invitation. 
The committee will normally meet not less than 3 times 
a year at the appropriate times in the financial reporting 
and audit cycle. During the period the committee 
chairman also meets privately with the external auditor 
to give them an opportunity to discuss any issues 
without management present. After each committee 
meeting, the chairman reports to the board on the 
main items discussed.
Role and responsibilities of the audit committee
The committee’s authority and duties are defined in 
its terms of reference. The first audit committee meeting 
was held on 9 July 2014, at which the committee’s terms 
of reference, membership and annual programme of 
work were approved. 
The principal activities carried out during subsequent 
meetings were:
• 
Financial reporting – the committee considered the 
company’s financial reports, including the implications 
of new accounting standards and regulatory changes, 
significant accounting issues and the appropriateness 
of the accounting policies adopted. This included 
consideration of the changes in reporting required 
as a new listed company;
• 
Internal and external audits – the committee considered 
the scope of the external audit plan and the subsequent 
findings of this work. The committee also considered 
whether an internal audit function was necessary. 
The internal control framework to be followed by 
employees is communicated by line management, 
training and manuals and the routine internal control 
activities are performed by the finance team. The retail 
support centre includes a team of stock compliance 
auditors, who conduct visits at least twice a year to 
each store to analyse the stock and review the 
compliance with company policies and practices. 
The committee concluded that an internal audit 
function was not currently appropriate but would 
be kept under review; 
• 
Risk and internal control – the committee considered 
the key risks facing the company and the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the internal controls and risk 
management processes. This resulted in the formalisation 
and strengthening of a number of policies and 
procedures; and
• 
External auditor – the committee considered the 
independence, effectiveness and fees of the external 
auditor, as detailed later in this report.
Significant issues considered by the committee  
during the period
The annual report and financial statements are the 
responsibility of the board and the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities is on page 54. The audit committee 
advises the board on the form and content of the 
annual report and financial statements, any issues that 
may arise in relation to these and any specific areas 
that require judgement.
Summarised below are the most significant issues 
considered by the committee in respect of these financial 
statements and how these issues were addressed.
• 
First time plc reporting – this is the group’s first annual 
report since listing on 28 February 2014, resulting in an 
increase in reporting requirements and new reporting 
deadlines. The committee reviewed management’s 
plan and monitored progress and the use of third party 
advisors where appropriate;
• 
Property provisions – the committee considered the 
reasonableness of the provisions for closed branches, 
onerous leases and future dilapidations expenses, in 
particular management’s judgement of future costs 
at the group’s former head office;
38 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 • 
Supplier income – the committee considered the policy 
for the recognition of income receivable from suppliers 
and the controls in place over contract negotiation. 
The committee reviewed the independent verification 
procedures employed by management throughout the 
year and at the period end;
• 
Goodwill impairment – the committee considered the 
process for testing goodwill impairment including the 
determination of the appropriate CGUs, the 
reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and 
the results of the review;
• 
Inventory valuation and provisions – the committee 
reviewed internal controls over physical stock 
records, the valuation methodology and the basis 
for provisioning;
• 
Revenue recognition – the committee reviewed  
the internal controls over revenue recognition;
• 
Exceptional items – the committee reviewed the 
treatment and disclosure of non-recurring items; and
• 
Materiality – the committee considered what would 
be an appropriate level of materiality and agreed the 
amount over which the auditors should report matters 
to the committee.
Management have reported to the committee that they 
were not aware of any material misstatements within the 
annual report and the external auditors reported that 
they found no material misstatements in the course of 
their work.
Relationship with the independent auditor
There are no contractual obligations which restrict the 
committee’s choice of auditor. Deloitte LLP has been 
the group’s auditor since 2006 and Sukie Kooner is the 
new audit partner for the company’s 2014 audit. In line 
with professional guidelines, each partner can serve for 
up to 5 years. The continued appointment of Deloitte is 
considered by the audit committee each year, taking 
into account relevant guidance and best practice and 
considering the independence and effectiveness of the 
external audit process.
As part of the review of auditor independence and 
effectiveness, Deloitte has confirmed that they are 
independent of the company and have complied with 
relevant accounting standards. The audit committee 
has established a policy to ensure that any provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor does not impair 
their independence and objectivity. This policy prohibits 
certain services and limits the level of non-audit services 
payable to the auditors to an aggregate of 100% of the 
previous year’s audit fee. Any services in excess of this 
would require prior approval from the audit committee. 
The breakdown of fees between audit and non-audit 
services for the period ending November 2014 is provided 
on page 74. The non-audit fees relate to advisory work 
for the IPO, debt refinancing and audit of the financial 
statements for the half year and initial accounts. The 
audit committee is satisfied that it was appropriate for 
the auditors to carry out this work, and that it did not 
impair their independence or objectivity.
With regard to Deloitte’s performance and the 
effectiveness of the audit process, the committee 
considered their fulfilment of the agreed audit plan 
and the audit findings report subsequently issued by 
them. The committee also took into account the 
competitiveness of their fees and obtained feedback 
from management regarding the performance of 
the audit team.
The committee is satisfied with the independence and 
performance of the auditor and has recommended their 
reappointment for a further year.
Whistleblowing
The committee is responsible for ensuring that employees 
are able to raise any concerns, in confidence, regarding 
any possible improprieties in financial reporting or other 
matters. During the period the committee reviewed the 
company’s formal whistleblowing process and how this 
operated in practice. Whistleblowing reports will be 
reviewed at least annually by the committee or more 
frequently should it be considered necessary.

Remuneration report 
Remuneration  
report
The information provided in this part 
of the directors’ remuneration report 
is not subject to audit.
Dear shareholder
Following my appointment as chair of the 
remuneration committee in November 2014, 
I am pleased to present the first directors’ 
remuneration report since the company’s 
incorporation and listing on the London Stock 
Exchange, for the financial period ended 
30 November 2014. 
2014 has been a period of significant change for the 
group – we undertook our IPO and progressed with 
implementing our ambitious growth strategies. We have 
seen good growth, with total sales increasing 6.1% and 
like-for-like sales ahead 0.7%. Results for the 2014 financial 
period have been broadly in line with expectations in a 
challenging market. We have identified attractive growth 
opportunities especially in the convenience part of our 
business, whilst recognising the challenges we face in the 
market place. Despite strong results in 2014, operating 
profit did not exceed the stretching targets set by the 
committee for the annual bonus. Therefore no annual 
bonus awards have been made to the executive 
directors in respect of the period under review.
The remuneration committee has undertaken 
a comprehensive review of the remuneration 
arrangements in place for our senior executives, 
with support and advice provided by Kepler Associates, 
who are independent. This covered all aspects 
of remuneration and how best to use remuneration to 
support the future development of the group. The review 
highlighted that incentive opportunities for executive 
directors at the group were behind market levels. The 
full activities of the committee during the period are 
summarised on page 49.
In line with our commitment to maintain an open 
dialogue with shareholders on remuneration, and to 
explain the rationale for key remuneration decisions, 
the company chairman and I consulted with our major 
shareholders to discuss and help develop our key 
remuneration proposals for 2015. These proposals have 
been guided by the committee’s view of what would best 
promote the success of the group whilst taking account  
of expectations among our investors on remuneration 
best practice and feedback received from shareholders 
during the consultation process. 
40 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The key aspects of our proposed policy are 
outlined below: 
• 
A proposal to introduce a new annual bonus scheme, 
the majority of which (80% in the 2015 financial period) 
will be based on profit performance, with the balance 
(20% in the 2015 financial period) linked to strategic 
performance measures selected annually by the 
remuneration committee to reflect other key 
performance indicators for the period ahead. 
Bonuses will be paid in cash following the period 
end, based on performance over the previous 
financial period. The maximum bonus opportunity 
for executive directors is 100% of salary, as approved 
by shareholders at listing, but will be 75% of salary for 
the 2015 financial year.
• 
A proposal to introduce a new long term incentive plan, 
in the form of performance shares. These awards will vest 
based on three years’ financial performance, to include 
earnings per share (EPS) and total shareholder return 
(TSR). EPS will be weighted at least 50% (70% in the 2015 
financial period) and TSR will be measured on a relative 
basis against a relevant benchmark (the combined 
constituents of the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index 
and the FTSE All Share Food & Drug Retailers Index for 
the 2015 financial period). The committee believes 
that this combination of measures will create the best 
alignment for the delivery of the company’s growth 
plans. Executive directors’ vested shares will be subject 
to an additional two-year holding period before being 
released to participants. 
Full details of the executive directors’ remuneration 
policy can be found in the directors’ remuneration 
policy on pages 42 to 49. The rules underlying our new 
incentive plans have been designed to reflect best 
practice, in particular, the introduction of clawback 
and malus provisions.
During the year, executive directors’ salaries were 
reviewed and a salary increase for one of our three 
executive directors was awarded. This was to reflect the 
additional responsibilities assumed by our chief financial 
officer during the year and the impact of inflation since 
his last review on 1 December 2012. David Thomas was 
appointed as chief operating officer during the year 
and his salary was set at £276,000 to reflect his new role.
During the year, James Lancaster stepped away from 
the chairman role to focus solely on the role of chief 
executive. John Coleman was appointed as non-
executive chairman and I took on John Coleman’s 
former role as remuneration committee chairman. 
The fee for the new role of non-executive chairman 
was set at £115,000 from 1 December 2014, to be 
competitive for a group of our size. 
The committee has presented the remuneration report 
in line with recent regulations governing the disclosure 
and approval of directors’ remuneration. At our annual 
general meeting, which will be held on 17 April 2015, the 
first section of this report, the Policy Report, will be put 
to shareholders for binding vote, and the second, the 
annual report on remuneration, which outlines the 
implementation of our policy for the forthcoming 
financial year, will be subject to an advisory vote.
Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on the 
committee for their hard work during 2014 and for 
the support we have received from the group’s 
executive team.
Yours sincerely
Georgina Harvey

Directors’ remuneration policy 
This section describes the group’s proposed remuneration 
policy for directors which, if approved, will apply for up to 
3 years from the date of the annual general meeting. 
The policy for executive director remuneration will be to 
provide a competitive package of fixed and variable pay 
that will enable the group to attract, motivate and retain 
executives with the right skills and experience, and will link 
executive pay to shareholder interests and the company’s 
long term success. 
The fixed component of each executive’s remuneration 
package will comprise salary, pension and benefits. The 
variable component may comprise an annual bonus and 
eligibility to participate in a long term incentive plan (LTIP). 
The majority of the bonus will be linked to annual profit 
performance, although an element may be linked to 
strategic performance measures that will help drive the 
group’s growth. The group adopted an LTIP when the 
company listed on 28 February 2014 that provides the 
opportunity to earn shares based on three-year 
performance. Each element of remuneration is designed 
to target a specific aim of the remuneration policy and 
to help further align the interests of executives with those 
of shareholders.
Future policy table
The key components of executive directors’ remuneration 
are as follows:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Fixed pay
Base salary
To attract and retain talent 
of the right calibre and with 
the ability to contribute to 
strategy, by ensuring base 
salaries are competitive in 
the relevant talent market.
Base salaries are reviewed 
annually, with reference 
to individual performance, 
experience, market 
competitiveness, salary 
increases across the group 
and the position holder’s 
experience, competence 
and criticality to the 
performance of  
the business.
Any increases are 
generally effective 
from 1 December.
Executive directors’ 
salary increases will 
normally be in line with 
those for the wider 
employee population. 
However, larger changes

Variable pay
Annual bonus
Aims to focus executives on 
achieving stretching profit 
targets and delivering the 
strategic business priorities for 
the financial period.
Performance measures 
and targets are set prior 
to or shortly after the start 
of the financial period.
At the end of the 
financial period, the 
remuneration committee 
will determine the extent 
to which the targets have 
been achieved.
Awards are delivered 
in cash.
The committee has 
discretion to reduce 
the bonus in the event 
of serious financial 
misstatement or gross 
misconduct. In extreme 
cases of gross misconduct, 
the committee may 
claw back annual 
bonus payments 
previously made.
The maximum bonus 
opportunity for executive 
directors will be up to 
100% of salary.
For the 2015 financial 
period the maximum 
bonus opportunity will be 
set at 75% of salary. 
Up to 40% of maximum 
will vest for target 
performance. The 
committee may award 
up to 10% of maximum for 
threshold performance. 
80% of the award for 
2015 will be based on 
achievement of group 
operating profit of which 
none will vest below target.
20% of the award for 
2015 will be based on 
achievement of strategic 
performance measures of 
which none will vest until 
the operating profit target 
is achieved.
The majority of the annual 
bonus will be based on 
achievement of a stretching 
profit target. The remainder 
will be based on strategic 
performance measures, 
selected annually by the 
remuneration committee 
to reflect other key 
performance indicators 
for the year ahead.
Details on the measures 
used during the period 
under review are set out 
on page 51.
The committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic bonus 
outcome downwards (or 
upwards with shareholder 
consultation) within the 
limits of the plan, to ensure 
alignment of pay with the 
underlying performance 
of the business.

Long term incentive 
plan (LTIP)
Aligns the interests of 
executives with shareholders 
in growing the value of the 
business over the long term.
The plan provides 
for annual awards of 
performance shares 
to eligible participants. 
Vesting is based on 
three-year performance. 
Executive directors’ 
vested shares will be 
subject to an additional 
two-year holding period 
before being released 
to participants.
The committee has 
discretion to reduce 
any unvested long 
term incentive awards 
(including those in a 
holding period), or to 
vary the opportunities 
for future awards, in 
case of serious financial 
misstatement or gross 
misconduct. In extreme 
cases of gross misconduct, 
the committee may claw 
back vested long term 
incentive awards.
Participants are eligible 
to receive cash or shares 
equal to the value of 
dividends that would have 
been paid over the vesting 
period on shares that vest.
Awards may be made 
up to a maximum of 
150% of salary in normal 
circumstances and up 
to 250% in exceptional 
circumstances.
For the 2015 financial 
period executive directors’ 
awards will be up to 50% 
of salary. The award size 
is reviewed in advance 
of grant.
Awards will vest on 
achievement of financial 
performance measures, 
measured over a three-year 
performance period, to 
include both EPS and TSR. 
EPS will receive a weighting 
in the LTIP of at least 50%.
For the 2015 financial period 
the weightings on EPS and 
TSR will be 70% and 30% 
respectively. 
TSR will be measured on 
a relative basis against a 
relevant peer group. 
Other measures may be 
considered in future years to 
help capture the strategic 
goals of the business and 
may be used in conjunction 
with these metrics.
Nothing will vest below 
threshold. 25% of each 
element will vest for 
achievement of threshold 
performance under each 
metric, then increase on 
a straight-line basis to 
full vesting for achieving 
stretch performance.
The committee has discretion 
to adjust the formulaic 
LTIP award downwards (or 
upwards with shareholder 
consultation), within the 
limits of the plan, to ensure 
alignment of pay with the 
underlying performance of 
the business.
Further details of awards 
to be made during the 
upcoming financial period 
are set out on page 51.

Shareholding guidelines
To align directors’ interests 
with the long term interests 
of shareholders.
Executive directors are 
required to retain a 
minimum shareholding 
in the company at least 
equal to base salary, and 
are required to retain at 
least 50% of shares vesting 
(after tax) under the LTIP

Notes to the policy table
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
Profit is considered to be the best measure of the group’s annual performance and will continue to determine the 
majority of the annual bonus. This will be supplemented by an element based on strategic performance measures, 
selected annually to reflect the group’s key strategic priorities for the financial period ahead. 
EPS is considered to be the best measure of the group’s bottom line financial performance over the longer term  
and will determine the vesting for at least 50% of the overall LTIP award. TSR will also be captured to further align  
the interests of LTIP participants with those of shareholders. 
Annual bonus targets will be selected prior to or shortly after the start of the financial period. Profit targets will be 
calibrated with reference to the group’s budget for the upcoming financial period and the group’s profit for the prior 
financial period. No element of the strategic performance measures will begin to pay out until the profit element starts 
to vest. Strategic performance measures will be selected to reflect the most important strategic goals for the 
upcoming financial period. No strategic performance measures were selected for the period under review. 
Threshold and stretch performance levels under the EPS element of the LTIP will be set prior to the start of the three-
year performance period. The remuneration committee aims to set stretching but achievable targets, taking account 
of a range of reference points, including broker forecasts and the group’s strategic plan. Performance targets for initial 
awards are detailed on page 51. The element linked to TSR will vest based on three-year TSR compared to a peer 
group comprising the constituents of the FTSE All Share General Retailers Index and the FTSE All Share Food & Drug 
Retailers Index. Threshold vesting for the TSR element will be set at median ranking and stretch will be set at upper 
quartile. This range is in line with market practice for other listed companies and is expected to capture the range 
of good to excellent performance for the group.

Differences in remuneration policy operated for other employees 
Senior management’s remuneration has the same components as set out in the policy, being base salary, annual 
bonus, pension, life assurance and benefit provision. They may also be invited to participate in the LTIP or alternatively 
the company’s share option plan. Annual bonus arrangements have the same structure and pay-out arrangements 
but are based on specific key performance indicators relevant to each job function. The maximum award varies 
according to seniority.
All employees receive a basic salary and all eligible employees are automatically enrolled into a pension scheme. 
Store managers participate in a bonus scheme that targets specific key performance indicators for their store.
Other 
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, any commitment made prior to, but due to be fulfilled after, 
the approval and implementation of the policy detailed in this report will be honoured.
Performance scenarios
The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for executive directors, and the 
potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios; 
‘Minimum’, ‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’. 
The potential reward opportunities illustrated are based on the policy which will apply from the annual general 
meeting on 17 April 2015, applied to the base salary in force at 1 December 2014 for James Lancaster and 
David Thomas and the proposed salary to be implemented in 2015 for Jonathan Miller. The projected value  
of LTIP amounts excludes the impact of share price movement or dividend accrual. The assumptions made

46 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Approach to remuneration for new director appointments
In the cases of hiring or appointing a new executive director, the remuneration committee may make use of all the 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
Component Approach Maximum opportunity
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined 
based on the experience and skills of the individual, 
relevant market data and their current basic salary.
Pension New appointees will be entitled to participate in the 
group’s defined contribution scheme (or any replacement 
scheme) or to receive a salary supplement in lieu of 
pension contributions. 
20% of base salary.
Benefits New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits in line 
with the policy which may include (but are not limited to) 
the provision of a company car or car allowance, fuel, 
private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus The structure described in the policy table will apply to new 
appointees with the relevant maximum being pro-rated to 
reflect the proportion of employment over the year.
100% of base salary.
LTIP New appointees will be granted awards under the LTIP 
on similar terms as other executives, as described in the 
policy table.
150% of base salary (250% in 
exceptional circumstances).
In determining appropriate remuneration for a new 
director, the committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the 
best interests of the group and its shareholders. The 
committee may make an award in respect of a new 
appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer, using Listing 
Rule 9.4.2 R if necessary. In doing so, the committee 
will take account of relevant factors including any 
performance conditions attached to these awards, 
the likelihood of those conditions being met and the 
proportion of the vesting period remaining. The fair 
value of any buyout will not exceed that of the award 
being foregone.
In cases of appointing a new executive director by way 
of internal promotion, the approach will be consistent with 
the policy for external appointees detailed above. Where 
an individual has contractual commitments made prior 
to their promotion to executive director level, the group 
will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive 
opportunities for below board employees are no higher 
than for executive directors, but measures may vary.
In recruiting a new non-executive director, the 
remuneration committee will use the policy as set 
out in the table on page 45.
Service contracts and exit payment policy
Non-executive directors
The current chairman and non-executive directors were 
appointed as directors on 7 February 2014. Their letters 
of appointment set out the terms of their appointment 
and are available for inspection at the company’s 
registered office and at the annual general meeting. 
They are not eligible to participate in the annual bonus 
or any equity schemes, nor do they receive any 
additional  pension or benefits (other than nominal 
travel expenses) on top of the fees disclosed on page 52. 
Non-executive directors have a notice period of one 
month and receive no compensation on termination.
Executive directors
On 24 February 2014, each of the executive directors, 
James Lancaster, Jonathan Miller, David Thomas and 
Martyn Aguss, entered into a service agreement with 
the company. Martyn Aguss resigned from the company 
on 22 July 2014 and ceased to be an executive director 
effective 30 July 2014. Each of the agreements are 
terminable by the relevant executive directors or the 
company on not less than 12 months’ prior written notice. 
The executive directors may be put on garden leave 
during their notice period, and the company can elect to 
terminate their employment by making a payment in lieu 
of notice equivalent to up to 12 months’ basic salary and 
benefits (although it should be noted that each of the 
executive directors can terminate their respective service 
agreements by giving 12 months’ prior written notice to 
the company). Executive director service contracts are 
available for inspection at the registered office and at 
the annual general meeting.

Awards may vest pro-rata. The annual bonus plan for the period under review

employed by the company, with performance 
measured to the end of the financial period. In

Unvested LTIP shares are normally pro-rated for 
performance to the end of the performance period. In 
exceptional circumstances, the committee may bring 
forward the vesting date to the termination date and 
vest on performance over the period to termination. 
Awards will normally be pro-rated for time unless the 
committee determines otherwise.
1. Under the current chief executive and chief financial officer contracts, they are eligible to receive a pro-rata bonus payment upon termination of employment for any reason excluding 
summary dismissal. The current chief operating officer’s contract and any future executive director contracts will be operated in line with the above policy.
2. Under the 2014 LTIP , ‘good leaver’ is defined as a participant ceasing to be employed by the group by reason of death, injury, ill health, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the 
group, the company of employment ceasing to be a member of the group or any other reason that the committee determines in its absolute discretion (excluding summary dismissal or 
resignation to join a competitor).
James Lancaster and Jonathan Miller’s pension 
arrangements were reviewed in 2008 upon closure of 
the group’s defined benefit pension schemes to future 
accrual. They now receive a salary supplement in lieu of 
their previous defined benefit arrangements representing 
the actuarial valuation of the defined benefit foregone. 
This is kept under review by the committee. Pension 
arrangements for other executives are in line with the 
remuneration policy set out on page 42.
The committee acknowledges that executive directors 
may be invited to become independent non-executive 
directors of other quoted companies which have no 
business relationship with the company and that these 
duties can broaden their experience and knowledge 
to the benefit of the company.
Executive directors are permitted to accept such 
appointments with the prior approval of the chairman. 
Approval will only be given where the appointment does 
not present a conflict of interest with the group’s activities 
and the wider exposure gained will be beneficial to the 
development of the individual. Where fees are payable 
in respect of such appointments, these would be retained 
by the executive director.
The employment of each executive director is terminable 
with immediate effect without notice in certain 
circumstances, including where such executive director 
commits any act of serious misconduct, commits any 
material or persistent breach of any of the terms or 
conditions of his service agreement, has a bankruptcy 
order made against him, is convicted of any criminal 
offence, commits any act which constitutes an offence 
under the Bribery Act 2010, is disqualified from acting as 
a director, acts in any way which may bring the company 
or any member of the group into disrepute or discredit, 
fails to comply with any policy of the company or any 
member of the group which has been communicated 
to him, enters into any transaction which constitutes an 
offence for the purposes of Part V of the Criminal Justice 
Act 1993 or which constitutes market abuse for the 
purposes of Part VIII of the Financial Services and 
Markets Act, or commits any material breach of his 
duties as a director.
The company’s policy on termination payments is to 
consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, 
taking into account the executive’s contractual terms, 
the circumstances of termination and any duty to 
mitigate. The table below summarises how incentives 
are typically treated in different circumstances:
48 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere  
in group
The committee takes into account the general basic 
salary increase being offered to employees elsewhere in 
the group when annually reviewing the salary increases 
and remuneration for the executive directors. Employees 
have not been consulted in respect of the design of the 
group’s senior executive remuneration policy.
Consideration of shareholder views
The company listed on the London Stock Exchange 
on 28 February 2014. The policy report herein contained 
will be the first for which a shareholder vote will be sought. 
After the listing, but prior to publication of this first 
directors’ remuneration report, the committee 
consulted with shareholders regarding the proposed 
remuneration policy for executive directors, with the 
majority of shareholders consulted broadly supportive  
of the proposals.
Annual report on remuneration
Remuneration committee membership and advisers
The remuneration committee was established as part 
of the governance processes adopted by the company, 
following admission to the London Stock Exchange on 
28 February 2014. The remuneration committee consists 
of two independent non-executive directors, Georgina 
Harvey (committee chair from 24 November 2014) and 
Sharon Brown, and the company chairman John 
Coleman (committee chair until 24 November 2014). 
During the period since its formation, the remuneration 
committee has held 3 scheduled meetings. The 
remuneration committee meets not less than twice  
a year and at such other times as required. The chief 
executive and chief financial officer, and the committee’s 
independent advisers, Kepler Associates, attend 
committee meetings by invitation. After committee 
meetings, the chairman reports to the board.
The remuneration committee has responsibility 
for the determination of the terms and conditions of 
employment, remuneration and benefits of the chairman 
and members of the board, including pension rights and 
any compensation payments, and recommending and 
monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for 
senior managers and the implementation of share 
option or other performance-related schemes.
The committee’s principal external advisers are Kepler 
Associates, who were appointed by the committee and 
attend committee meetings from time to time, and who 
also provide remuneration advice to the group. Kepler 
Associates provided initial support to management 
concerning remuneration arrangements at IPO. They 
were then appointed independent advisers to the 
remuneration committee through a competitive tender 
process and fees for advice provided to the remuneration 
committee were £49,550 for the financial period under 
review. Fees covered support in conducting a 
comprehensive review of senior executive remuneration 
at the group, including relevant developments in 
corporate governance and market trends, benchmarking 
of senior executives, a review of non-executive chairman 
fees and ongoing support and advice for the committee. 
Kepler Associates do not provide any other services to the 
group and the committee is satisfied that they provide 
independent and objective remuneration advice to the 
company. Kepler is a signatory to the Code of Conduct 
for Remuneration Consultants in the UK, details of which 
can be found on the Remuneration Consultants Group’s 
website at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. 
Committee activities 
During 2014, the committee met to consider the following

2. Annual bonus paid for performance over the relevant financial period, based on operating profit only. Annual bonus payable in cash. 
3. No long term incentives were in operation during the reported periods. A share-based payment arose in 2014 relating to shares allocated prior to the IPO for nil consideration, in which 
unallocated employee shares held in an employee benefit trust were allocated to employee shareholders pro rata to their existing holdings. Awards of 1,132,299, 1,132,299, 117,584 and 
283,123 shares were made to James Lancaster, Jonathan Miller, David Thomas and Martyn Aguss respectively at the share price of £1.91 upon IPO. A further 104,050 and 5,339 shares were 
allocated to James Lancaster and Jonathan Miller prior to the IPO at nil cost in connection with the conversion of preference shares held by them into ordinary shares. The company met 
employer’s national insurance contributions on the value of such shares at the IPO offer price.
4. David Thomas changed role on 22 July 2014.
5. Martyn Aguss resigned from the company on 22 July 2014 and ceased to be an executive director on 30 July 2014. Martyn Aguss received compensation for loss of office of £129k, 
comprising salary of £92k, pension of £28k and taxable benefits of £9k, due in respect of the period of his garden leave from 30 July 2014, in accordance with his contractual

Basic annual salary 
Base salaries are reviewed annually, with any changes normally effective from 1 December, with reference to 
individual performance, experience, market competitiveness and salary increases across the group. 
Salaries paid to the executive directors and senior executives were reviewed by the committee, taking into account 
the competitiveness of total remuneration in comparison to comparable roles at listed retail companies of a broadly 
similar size and other listed organisations of a similar size. 
Following the review, the committee determined that the chief executive’s salary would be unchanged at £594,224. 
The chief financial officer’s salary will be increased by 5% to £331,207 being broadly in line with inflation over the two 
years since his previous increase, and to reflect increased responsibility following the reduction in the executive board 
from 4 members to 3 members. The increase will become effective during 2015 at the same time as the general pay 
review at the group’s head office is implemented. The chief operating officer’s salary was set at £276,000 to reflect his 
appointment as chief operating officer. The average salary increase awarded across the wider employee population 
was c.2% for the 2015 financial period.

50 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Annual bonus
The group operates an annual performance related 
bonus scheme for a number of senior executives including 
executive directors.
For the 2014 financial period, annual bonuses for the 
executive directors were capped at 62.5% of salary and 
based 100% on exceeding an operating profit target of 
£25.5m. No bonus would vest for operating profit at or 
below target. Actual operating profit before exceptional 
items for the year ending 30 November 2014 was £25.5m, 
therefore none of the awards vested and no bonuses 
were paid to the executive directors.
For the 2015 financial period, annual bonuses for the 
executive directors will be based 80% on operating profit 
and 20% on three key strategic performance measures 
being: like-for-like sales, the number of convenience stores, 
and expanding the range of products and services. The 
target for convenience store numbers will be to have 900 in 
operation by 31 December 2015 (799 as at 30 November 
2014). The targets for the other performance metrics are not 
being disclosed at present for reasons of commercial 
sensitivity, but will be disclosed retrospectively in the next 
annual report on remuneration, subject to the information 
no longer being commercially sensitive.
For the operating profit element of the 2015 annual 
bonus no vesting will occur below target. At target 
40% of the profit element of the bonus will be awarded. 
Annual bonus payments will then increase on a straight-
line basis between 40% of maximum and full vesting 
for achievement of 110% of target. For the strategic 
performance element of the bonus, no awards will 
vest prior to the attainment of target operating profit.
The committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic 
bonus outcome downwards, or upwards with shareholder 
consultation, within the plan limits, to ensure alignment 
of pay with the underlying performance of the business. 
The committee may also reduce future annual bonus 
opportunities in light of material misstatement or gross 
misconduct. In extreme cases of gross misconduct, the 
committee may claw back annual bonus payments 
previously made.
Long term incentive plan (LTIP)
Prior to approval of the LTIP outlined in the director’s 
remuneration policy above, no long term incentive 
plan had been in operation. In 2015, it is expected that 
executive directors will be granted shares equivalent to 
50% of salary under the LTIP. These shares will vest on EPS 
and TSR performance over a three-year period,  
as follows:
70% based on cumulative earnings per share, measured 
over 3 financial years:
Cumulative EPS for financial 
periods 2015/2016/2017
% of the EPS element 
of the award which 
can be exercised
61.5p or above 100%
Between 55.9p 
and 61.5p 
Straight-line vesting 
between 25% and 100%
Below 55.9p 0%
30% based on relative total shareholder return relative to 
the constituents of the FTSE All Share General Retailers 
Index and the FTSE All Share Food & Drugs Retailers Index, 
measured over 3 financial years.
Relative TSR ranking 
% of the TSR element 
of the award which 
can be exercised
Upper quartile or above 100%
Between median  
and upper quartile
Straight-line vesting 
between 25% and 100%
Below median 0%
In addition, for LTIP awards to become exercisable the 
committee must be satisfied that the formulaic LTIP 
outcome is a genuine reflection of the underlying 
performance of the business. The committee has 
discretion to adjust the formulaic LTIP outcome 
downwards, or upwards with shareholder consultation, 
within the plan limits.
An additional holding period of two years will apply 
to vested shares from the end of the performance period.
The committee has discretion to claw back any unvested 
long term incentive awards, or to vary the opportunities 
for future awards, in case of serious financial misstatement 
or gross misconduct. In extreme cases of gross 
misconduct, the committee may claw back vested 
long term incentive awards.
Awards made under the LTIP and any other share-based 
schemes (the CSOP) will not exceed the Investment 
Association’s guideline on dilution of 10% in aggregate 
over a 10-year rolling period.
Executive directors’ pension arrangements
The current chief executive, the chief financial officer 
and the former chief operating officer receive a salary 
supplement in lieu of pension. For the period ending 30 
November 2014, pension contributions were equal to 31.6% 
of salary for James Lancaster, 31% for Jonathan Miller and 
31% for Martyn Aguss. The current chief operating officer 
participates in the group’s defined contribution scheme 
for which the company contributes 15% of salary. For the 
period ending 29 November 2015, executive directors’ 
pensions will be unchanged.

Non-executive director fees
For the 2015 financial period, the base fee for non-
executive directors will remain at £45,000 p.a., with an 
additional fee of £5,000 p.a. paid to the chairmen of 
the remuneration and audit committees. Following the 
appointment of John Coleman as non-executive chairman 
on 22 July 2014, the committee set his fee at £115,000 p.a. 
from 1 December 2014.
Payments for loss of office
Martyn Aguss resigned from the company on 22 July 2014 
and ceased to be an executive director effective 30 July 
2014. In light of this, he is contractually entitled to receive 
salary and benefits for the period of 12 months’ notice, 
for which he has been on garden leave. 
Payments to previous directors
Except for the above payments for loss of office, no 
further payments were made to previous directors 
during the financial period under review.

Statement  
of directors’ 
responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors are required to prepare the group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
chosen to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and 
of the profit or loss of the company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• 
make judgements and accounting estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
• 
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• 
properly select and apply accounting policies;
• 
present information including accounting policies, in 
a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• 
provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and
• 
make an assessment of the company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the company’s transactions and disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial information 
included on the company’s website. Legislation in 
the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
• 
the strategic report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face; and
• 
the annual report and financial statements, taken as 
a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements of 
McColl’s Retail Group plc
In our opinion:
• 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 November 2014 and of the 
group’s and the parent company’s profit for the 53 week period then ended;
• 
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
• 
the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; 
and
• 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement,  
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
company balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the parent company 
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the related notes  
1 to 32 for the consolidated financial statements and the related notes  
1c to 10c in the parent company financial statements. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial 
statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in relation to 
IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the group financial statements, in addition to 
complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, the group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement 
contained within the directors’ report on page 28 that the group is a going 
concern. We confirm that:
• 
we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• 
we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described on page 57 are those 
that had the greatest effect on our group audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
56 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Supplier income
Supplier income is generated 
from a number of commercial 
agreements with suppliers including 
incentives, rebates and discounts. 
In the current period, this represents 
a deduction to cost of sales which 
is material to the group financial 
statements. There are a large 
number of individual arrangements 
which can be complex in nature. 
The process involves significant 
manual adjustments as well as 
determining whether the amounts 
are recorded in the correct period. 
Contracts span the end of the 
reporting period, meaning that 
estimates and judgements are 
necessary to calculate the amounts 
receivable under the terms of 
the contracts.
See cost of sales accounting policy 
in note 2 to the financial statements.
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to:
Testing the design and implementation of controls in place over supplier 
income and understanding of the commercial process and interaction with 
financial accountants via meetings with the trading team.
For a statistical sample of supplier income agreements, we understood the 
contract terms and recalculated the expected supplier income by comparing 
the amounts used in the calculations to actual purchases in the year taken 
from system generated reports for which we gained assurance over the 
validity and completeness.
Performing analytical work on supplier income trends across suppliers and 
product categories, challenging management’s estimates based on this 
work by investigating any unexpected variances and corroborating with 
supporting evidence.
Assessing the recoverability of a sample of accrued supplier income was 
evaluated by agreement to subsequent invoicing and cash receipts, or 
in the cases where these have yet to be settled, performing alternative 
procedures such as tracing to third party documentation or contracts to 
corroborate the accrual.
Inspecting a sample of post year end credit notes for evidence of refunds  
or of invoiced amounts not being valid.
Property provisions
The group has an extensive and 
diverse property portfolio, including 
both leasehold and freehold 
property across the UK. As a result, 
there are several technically 
complex areas and judgemental 
aspects to consider when 
accounting for property and 
leases across the group, including:
• 
provisions for closed branches 
and onerous leases on vacant 
or part vacant properties which 
represent future expenditure 
comprising the rental payable 
under the lease agreement which 
is not recoverable from sub-letting 
the property and an estimate of 
ongoing service costs.
• 
future dilapidations expenses
These provisions are material and 
include judgements around the 
future cash flows and the 
discounting of these.
See provisions accounting policy in 
note 2 to the financial statements.
For each of the property provisions:
We obtained management’s calculations and selected statistical samples 
of individual properties where we recalculated the provision by testing and 
challenging the inputs, assumptions and discount rate used and corroborated 
to supporting external evidence including, but not limited to, lease contracts 
and dilapidation schedules issued by landlords.
We performed sensitivity analysis on the key inputs applied to assess 
whether a reasonable fluctuation in these would change the provision 
by a material level. 
We reviewed the list of branches that had been closed during the period 
to assess the completeness of the provision.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Goodwill impairment
The goodwill value of £137.1m is 
supported by forecasts of future 
cash flows of the businesses. 
There are inherent risks within these 
forecasts due to the uncertainties 
as a result of changing industry 
and economic conditions and 
the resulting judgements required. 
The group holds a significant value 
of goodwill which has been 
generated through acquisitions of 
businesses, individual and groups 
of stores. In the current period, the 
CGUs to which this goodwill has 
been applied for impairment testing 
has been changed as a result of a 
reassessment by management.
See goodwill impairment 
accounting policy in note 2 and 
note 13 to the financial statements.
We evaluated management’s goodwill impairment calculations and have 
challenged their calculations by:
Recalculating the discount rates applied to future cash flows, working with our 
internal valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the underlying 
calculations and assumptions; we have benchmarked the resulting discount 
rates against other companies operating in the retail sector.
Performing sensitivity analysis on the inputs applied (including discount rates 
and growth rates) to determine whether any reasonable fluctuations in these 
would impact the headroom to a material extent. 
Comparing the assumed growth rates and forecasted cash flows against 
recent trading activity, historic trends and our understanding of the future 
prospects of the business to identify whether these scenarios could give rise to 
further impairment.
We have assessed the change in the way that management group CGUs for 
the purpose of goodwill impairment against IAS36 to determine whether it 
complies with the standard. 
We assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements.
Stock provisioning
Judgement is necessary to assess 
the carrying value of stock due to 
the fast-moving and in some cases, 
perishable nature of stock. There is 
an obsolescence risk where stock 
is valued incorrectly due to 
inadequate stock provisions.
Stock counts are performed on a 
rotational basis throughout the year, 
rather than at the year end. Stock 
provisions are based on estimates 
and stock values are based on a 
perpetual system as at the reporting 
date presenting a risk of existence.
See inventories accounting policy 
in note 2 to the financial statements.
We critically assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used to 
calculate the stock provisions at the period end date. 
We challenged management’s assumptions and tested the mathematical 
accuracy and the logic of the calculations which supported the provisions.
We attended stock counts at a sample of stores and compared the results 
to the stock system. In addition to this, we tested the controls around the 
perpetual stock system to gain assurance over this process which is used  
as the basis for year end stock provisions which are based on estimates.
Revenue recognition
Over 99% of revenue is generated 
through transactions via the EPOS 
system, these are settled in cash 
or credit card. 
There are manual adjustments 
between this system and the 
financial statements which could 
be vulnerable to manipulation.
See revenue accounting policy in 
note 2 to the financial statements.
We have performed tests of operating effectiveness of controls around the 
revenue cycle including using our IT specialist team to test the automated 
controls over the EPOS system.
We understood the nature of the manual adjustments, we investigated and 
challenged a sample of these. We agreed these back to appropriate 
supporting evidence. 
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the audit 
committee discussed on pages 38 and 39.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial 
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the 
financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an 
opinion on these individual matters.
58 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £994,870, which is 
approximately 5.2% of adjusted pre-tax profit, and 0.9% of equity. Pre-tax 
profit has been normalised by adjusting for exceptional items (the one-off 
costs relating to the IPO, the increase in the provision for future costs for the 
group’s former head office, a share-based payment charge related to shares 
allocated to employees prior to the IPO for nil consideration and income 
from the post office in relation to converting 191 of the group’s existing post 
offices). We believe this is an appropriate basis for materiality as it reflects 
recurring performance.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the Committee 
all audit differences in excess of £50,000 as well as differences below that 
threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We 
also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified 
when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope 
of our audit
The group business consists of a collection of retail stores and operates as a 
single operating segment, entirely within the UK, as defined in note 5 to the 
financial statements. The financial results of the group are aggregated at a 
consolidated level without the need for consolidation adjustments to account 
for eliminations between group statutory companies. Therefore we identify 
only one reporting component being the group itself, which includes the 
parent company audit (which we audit to a lower materiality level), on which 
we perform our audit using a single audit team.
As this was the first period reporting as a listed group, we considered the 
additional requirements and performed additional audit procedures to 
address these risks including, but not limited to: reviews of UKGAAP to IFRS 
adjustments, treatment of IPO related costs and corporate governance 
disclosure checklists. 
Opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• 
the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• 
the information given in the Strategic Report and the directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.

Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations 
received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• 
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
• 
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
• 
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters.
Corporate governance statement Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the 
corporate governance statement relating to the company’s compliance 
with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing 
to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information 
in the annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is:
• 
materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
• 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
• 
otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
60 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Respective responsibilities  
of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, the directors 
are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for 
Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK 
and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls 
and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies 
are appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

64 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Notes to the financial statements
53 week period ended 30 November 2014 
1. Basis of preparation
The group financial statements for 2014 consolidate the financial statements of McColl’s Retail Group plc (the 
“company”) and all its subsidiary undertakings (together, “the group”) drawn up to 30 November 2014. The group’s 
accounting period covers the 53 weeks ended 30 November 2014. The comparative period covered the 52 weeks 
ended 24 November 2013. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.
The group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS 
Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations, as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the 
Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reported under IFRS. The group’s going concern position is set out 
in the corporate governance section on page 28.
An explanation of the transition to IFRS is provided in the IPO prospectus, which can be found at  
http://www.mccolls.co.uk/investor/mccolls-ipo.
The consolidated financial information is presented in sterling, the group’s functional currency, and has been rounded 
to the nearest thousand (£’000).
The preparation of financial information in compliance with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial information and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It also requires 
group management to exercise judgement in applying the group’s accounting policies.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements 
about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the financial information are disclosed in note 3.
Basis of measurement
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following items 
(refer to individual accounting policies for details):
• 
Derivative financial instruments – fair value through profit or loss; and
• 
Net defined benefit pension asset or liability – actuarial basis.
Basis of consolidation
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies 
of another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated 
financial information presents the results of the company and its subsidiaries as if they formed a single entity. 
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial information incorporates the results of business combinations using the purchase method. 
In the group balance sheet, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially 
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the group 
income statement from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date on which 
control ceases. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current financial period, the group has applied for the first time IAS19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised).  
See note 4 on page 72 for full details.

Notes to the financial statements continued
53 week period ended 30 November 2014
1. Basis of preparation (continued)
New standards in issue but not yet effective
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations, which have not 
been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been 
adopted by the EU).
IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’
IFRS10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
IFRS11 ‘Joint Arrangements’
IFRS12 ‘Disclosure’ 
IAS27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’
IAS28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’
Amendments to IFRS10, IFRS12 and IAS27 ‘Investment Entities’
Amendments to IAS32 ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’
Amendments to IAS36 ‘Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets’ 
Amendments to IAS39 ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’
IFRIC Interpretation 21 ‘Levies’
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material 
impact on the group’s financial statements when the relevant standards come into effect.
In addition to the above new standards or amendments, there are additional new standards and amendments which 
will not be applicable to the group and as such have not been listed. 
2. Significant accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable for goods and services sold through retail outlets in the period which 
fall within the group’s principal activities, stated net of value added tax. Revenue is shown net of returns. Revenue 
is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of goods and services have been passed to the buyer and can 
be measured reliably.
Commission from the sale of lottery tickets and electronic phone top-ups is recognised net within turnover, when 
transactions deriving commissions are completed, as the company acts as an agent.
In the opinion of the directors, the group engages in one principal area of activity, that of operators of convenience 
and newsagent stores. Turnover is derived entirely from the United Kingdom.
Cost of sales
Cost of sales consists of all direct costs to the point of sale including warehouse and transportation costs. Supplier 
incentives, rebates and discounts are recognised as a credit to cost of sales in the period in which the stock to which the 
discounts apply is sold. The accrued amount at the reporting date is included in prepayments and accrued income.
Other operating income
Post office, rental income and ATM commissions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the 
services to which they relate are earned.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s 
share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is recognised as an 
asset on the group’s balance sheet in the year in which it arises. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment 
at least annually and is stated at cost less any provision for impairment. Any impairment is recognised in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected 
to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated 
are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. 
If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first 
to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata 
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
66 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
See note 13 on pages 79 and 80 for further details of cash-generating units and impairment testing.
Computer software within intangible assets
Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally 
acquired computer software and software licences are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over 
their useful economic lives of five to eight years and are included within other intangible assets. Costs relating to 
development of computer software for internal use do not meet the recognition criteria of IAS38 Intangible Assets 
and are recognised as an expense as incurred. 
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. Cost 
includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs incurred attributable to bringing the asset to its working 
condition for intended use.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets less their estimated residual values on 
a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned. Principal rates used for this 
purpose are:
Land and buildings
Depreciation of land and buildings is charged as follows:
Freehold (including land where it is not separately identifiable) – 50 years
Long leaseholds improvements – 50 years
Short leaseholds improvements:
– Shops – 10 years
– Other – term of the lease
Leasehold premiums – the unexpired portion of the lease
Motor vehicles, fixtures and equipment
Depreciation of motor vehicles, fixtures and equipment is charged as follows:
– Motor vehicles – 4 years
– Computer equipment – between 5 and 8 years
– Furniture and fittings – between 5 and 10 years
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the asset’s carrying amount and are 
recognised within operating profit.
Fixed asset impairments
At each reporting date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, which is the higher of its fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. For property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
excluding goodwill, the CGU is deemed to be each trading store. Any resulting impairment is charged to 
administrative expenses.
Leased assets
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of 
ownership to the group. All other leases are classified as operating leases. For property leases, the land and building 
elements are treated separately to determine the appropriate lease classification.
Finance leases/hire purchase contracts
Assets funded through finance leases or hire purchase contracts are capitalised as property, plant and equipment 
and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter. The amount capitalised is the 
lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term at the 
inception of the lease. The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities net of finance charges. Finance costs 
on finance leases are charged directly to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest.

Notes to the financial statements continued
53 week period ended 30 November 2014
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Operating leases
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Sale and leaseback
A sale and leaseback transaction is one where a vendor sells an asset and immediately reacquires the use of that 
asset by entering into a lease with the buyer. The accounting treatment of the sale and leaseback depends upon the 
substance of the transaction and whether or not the sale was made at the asset’s fair value. For sale and operating 
leasebacks, generally the assets are sold at fair value, and accordingly the profit or loss from the sale is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Leases incentives
Lease incentives primarily include up-front cash payments or rent-free periods. Lease incentives are capitalised and 
spread over the period of the lease term.
Leases with predetermined fixed rental increases
Where a lease has predetermined fixed rental increases, these rental increases are accounted for on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the lease.
Operating lease income
Operating lease income consists of rentals from sub-tenant agreements and is recognised as earned.
Inventories
Inventories consist of goods for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated 
using a retail method which for each category of stock reduces the net selling price by the attributable average gross 
margin. Net realisable value is the price at which the stocks can be realised in the normal course of the business net of 
selling and distribution costs. Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments
Financial assets
The group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which 
the asset was acquired. The group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
Receivables
These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active 
market. They arise principally from the group’s trading operations (e.g. trade receivables), but also incorporate other 
types of contractual monetary asset. They are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly 
attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest 
rate method, less provision for impairment.
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on 
the part of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the group will be unable to collect all of 
the amounts due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net 
carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable. 
For trade receivables, which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with 
the loss being recognised within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. On confirmation 
that the trade receivable will not be collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the 
associated provision.
The group’s receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the group 
balance sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and – for the purpose of the statement of cash flows – bank 
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within loans and borrowings in current liabilities in the group balance sheet.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired 
or where the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
68 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Financial liabilities
The group classifies its financial liabilities into one category:
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities include:
• 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts – these are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds 
received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to 
the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. Where 
existing debt is refinanced with the same lender it is treated as an extinguishment of the original debt and a new 
financial liability if the modified terms are substantially different from the previous terms.
• 
Trade payables and other short term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fair value estimation
The methods and assumptions applied in determining the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are 
disclosed in note 26.
Derivative financial instruments
The only derivative financial instruments that the group enters into are interest rate swaps. The purpose of these 
transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the group’s operations and sources of finance.
The group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured 
at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps (unless qualifying as cash 
flow hedge accounting) are recognised in the income statement as finance income or costs as they arise.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares 
or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Taxation
Current taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except 
when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the current tax is also dealt 
with in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base 
and accounting base of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where a deferred tax liability arises 
from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability 
is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it is probable that there will be suitable future taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying 
differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited 
directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other 
comprehensive income respectively.

2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
Provisions
The group recognises provisions for liabilities of uncertain timing or amounts, including those for onerous leases, 
leasehold dilapidations and legal disputes. Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive 
obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to 
settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at 
the present value of the best estimate of expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax 
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The 
increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Onerous contracts/leases
Provisions for onerous leases, measured net of expected sub-let rental income, are recognised when the leased 
property becomes vacant and is no longer used in the operations of the business.
Dilapidations
Provisions for dilapidations and similar contractual property costs are recognised on a lease-by-lease basis when the 
need for expenditure has been identified, being the point at which the likely expenditure can be reliably estimated.
Pensions
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in addition to several defined contribution schemes, 
which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
Defined contribution schemes
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the income statement in the year to which 
they relate.
Defined benefit schemes
Defined benefit scheme surpluses and deficits are measured at:
• 
The fair value of plan assets at the reporting date; less
• 
Scheme liabilities calculated using the projected unit credit method discounted to its present value using yields 
available on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the liabilities; plus
• 
Unrecognised past service costs; less 
• 
The effect of minimum funding requirements agreed with scheme trustees.
A surplus is recognised where the group has an unconditional right to the economic benefits in the form of future 
contribution reductions or refunds.
Any difference between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities 
over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive 
income in the period in which they arise.
Costs are recognised separately as operating and finance costs in the income statement. Operating costs comprise 
the current service cost, any income or expense on settlements or curtailments and past service costs where the 
benefits have vested.
Past service costs are recognised directly in income unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the 
employees remaining in service for a specified period of time. In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Finance items comprise the interest on scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets.
Further information on pensions is disclosed in note 31.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other 
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
70 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Critical judgements in applying the group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately 
below), that the directors have made in the process of applying the group’s accounting policies and that have the 
most significant effect on the amounts recognised in financial statements.
Supplier income
Supplier income is generated from commercial agreements with suppliers including incentives, rebates and discounts. 
Agreements are typically for the calendar year so are not concurrent with the financial reporting period. Judgement 
is required as to the level of income which should be accrued for in relation to achieving pre-set trading targets in the 
final month of the calendar year. Changes in the judgements used would not have a significant effect on the group’s 
consolidated income statement. 
Operating segment
IFRS8 requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used by the board for assessing 
performance and allocating resources. Management has used its judgement in determining that the group has one 
single operating segment. This is based on the reports reviewed by the board of directors to make strategic decisions.
Cash-generating units (CGUs)
The group determines CGUs for the purpose of goodwill impairment based on the way it manages the business. 
Judgement is required to ensure this assessment is appropriate and in line with IAS36. This is expanded upon in  
note 13 on pages 79 and 80.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet 
date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment
The group is required to test, on an annual basis, whether goodwill has suffered any impairment based on the 
recoverable amount of its cash-generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount is determined based on value in 
use calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of a pre-tax 
discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. More information including carrying values is 
included in note 13 on pages 79 and 80.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
Financial and non-financial assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and 
circumstances suggest that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying value.
Recoverable amount is based on the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is 
calculated from expected future cash flows using suitable discount rates and includes management assumptions 
and estimates of future performance. Fair values for individual trading stores are based on a multiple of its average 
weekly sales performance. 
Details of the accounting policy on the impairment of tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are provided 
in note 2 on page 66.
Pensions
The costs, assets and liabilities of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the group are determined 
using methods relying on actuarial estimates and assumptions, including rates of increase in pensionable salaries 
and pensions, expected returns on scheme assets, life expectancies and discount rates. Details of the key assumptions 
are set out in note 31. The group takes advice from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the 
assumptions and the recognition of any surplus. Changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect 
on the group statement of comprehensive income and the group balance sheet.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases and dilapidations. These provisions are estimates, in particular the 
assumptions relating to market rents and vacant periods, and the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are 
dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted 
for in the period when such determination is made. Details of provisions are set out in note 24.

4. Changes in accounting policy and prior period misstatement 
In the current financial period, the group has applied for the first time IAS19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (revised). The most 
significant change that has impacted the group is that the amendment requires the expected returns on pension plan 
assets, currently calculated based on management’s best estimate of expected returns, to be calculated using the 
same (high quality bond) discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation. IAS19 (revised) requires 
retrospective application in line with IAS8 ‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’.
The impact on the consolidated income statement is as follows:

Total comprehensive income for the period 11,960 – (150) 11,810
Prior period restatement
It has become apparent that in preparing prior period financial statements under IFRS, a temporary difference 
on which deferred tax should have been recognised was omitted. The noted temporary difference arises in relation 
to tax deductible goodwill recognised on new store acquisitions accounted for as business combinations where 
the group entered into sale and leaseback arrangements in relation to acquired freehold property. The financial 
statements and accompanying notes have been restated to include this deferred tax asset in line with IAS8 
‘Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors’. The restatement reduced goodwill by £832,000 
and reduced the deferred tax provision by the same amount.
5. Segmental analysis and revenue 
In accordance with IFRS8 ‘Operating segments’ an operating segment is defined as a business activity whose 
operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete information is available. 
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision maker, as required by IFRS8. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating resources 
and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the board of directors. The principal 
activities of the group are currently managed as one segment. Consequently all activities relate to this segment,  
being the operation of convenience and newsagent stores in the UK.

1  Costs associated with IPO
During the 53 weeks ended 30 November 2014 one-off IPO costs of £4,539,000 were incurred of which £1,823,000 
was charged to the income statement and £2,716,000 was charged to the share premium account as being directly 
related to the issue of new shares. 
2  Share-based payments
During the 53 weeks ended 30 November 2014 share-based payments totalling £5,532,000 were made by way of an 
allocation of shares to employees prior to the IPO for nil consideration. The fair value of the shares was calculated by 
reference to the issue price on admission to the stock market on 28 February 2014. The total number of shares allocated 
was 2,900,332. Details of share-based payments to directors can be found in the directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 40 to 53. 
3  Property related costs
Provision of £2,440,000 has been made for the onerous lease relating to the group’s former head office. The provision 
has been made to recognise an expected shortfall in rental income compared with rent payable and other property 
related costs. In calculating the provision a pre-tax discount rate of 10% has been used. 
4  Post office income
During the 53 weeks ended 30 November 2014 the group received £6,743,000 income from the Post Office in relation 
to an agreement to convert 191 of the group’s existing post offices to a new local format. The group incurred costs 
of £392,000 associated with the conversions.
5  Restructuring costs
On 4 March 2014 the group completed an early debt refinancing which resulted in the write-off of £3,166,000 
of unamortised financing costs. On 15 March 2013 the group completed an early debt refinancing which resulted 
in the write-off of £1,188,000 of unamortised financing costs and additional interest of £4,409,000.
6  Tax effect of exceptional items
The tax effect of the exceptional items is a credit of £1,288,000 (2013: credit £1,306,000).

13. Intangible assets (continued)
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of 
goodwill had been allocated as follows:
30 November
2014
£’000
24 November
2013
£’000
25 November
2012
£’000
CGU1 95,476 94,725 94,648
CGU2 6,525 6,369 6,736
CGU3 35,111 29,259 29,812
137,112 130,353 131,196
For the current period, the group has reassessed the way in which it determines CGUs for the purpose of goodwill 
impairment to align with the management of the business, following the fundamental changes to the group’s 
operations, including the completion of changes to the supply chain initiated in 2013. Previously each store had been 
classed as a CGU for goodwill impairment testing. On a review of CGUs the group have concluded that three groups 
of CGUs for the purpose of goodwill impairment is more appropriate. 
The three groups are as follows:
CGU1 – Goodwill which arose from a management buy-out in 2005, including all goodwill held at that time;
CGU2 – Goodwill generated on a significant acquisition in 2008; and
CGU3 – Goodwill acquired on all other acquisitions after the management buy-out in 2005.
Under the old method, with each store being a CGU, goodwill impairment is £382,000 and this has been included in 
the current period charge. Under the revised approach, there is no impairment. £382,000 is not considered material 
to the business.
The recoverable amounts of all three CGUs are determined from value in use calculations with a discounted cash 
flow model used to calculate this amount. The key assumptions for the value in use calculation include discount rates, 
growth rates and time. In addition to the value in use calculation, a fair value is estimated based on a multiple of 
average weekly sales. The group have used a forward looking cash flow of 25 years and a pre-tax 10% discount rate. 
Management consider 25 years an appropriate period of time to base the forward looking cash flow as stores are 
expected to trade for at least this period of time. There has been no growth rate applied on a prudent basis. The fair 
value estimate uses an established market valuation method which management use when making acquisitions.
The group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment testing for goodwill using both the old and new 
methods of assessing CGUs. With reasonable possible changes in key assumptions, there is no indication that the 
carrying amount of goodwill would be significantly reduced. Increasing the forward looking cash flow to perpetuity 
would reduce the goodwill impairment by £72,000. A 1.0% change in the discount rate would result in either a 
reduction or increase, depending whether the rate was increased or decreased, of £60,000. Applying a 1.0% growth 
rate would reduce the impairment charge by £64,000. A 25% reduction in the fair value calculation would increase 
the impairment charge by £100,000.

Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates. The group has financial risk 
management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value.

On 4 March 2014 the group completed a debt refinancing and entered into a new £85,000,000 working capital facility 
available until 31 August 2018 at an annual interest rate of 2.5% above LIBOR. £60,900,000 was drawn against the 
group’s new working capital facility which, together with the proceeds from the primary fundraising at flotation was 
utilised to repay the group’s existing borrowings. On 30 July 2014 the annual interest rate was reduced to 2.25% above 
LIBOR. The facility drawn as at 30 November 2014 was £46,000,000.

Dilapidations
The provision will include estimates for certain properties for which the extent of the dilapidation has not been 
established. The level of uncertainty associated with the use of estimates is not considered to be significant. It is 
expected that most of these costs will be incurred in the next five years.
Onerous contracts
A provision is recognised for the rent due less estimated rent receivable until the anticipated disposal of a vacant 
property. The periods of vacant property commitments range from one to 10 years. In addition, provision has been 
made for excess rent over market rent on one leasehold property as part of fair value assessments made on 
acquisition. Judgement is used for certain properties in respect of how long the property will remain vacant.  
The level of uncertainty associated with the use of estimates is not considered to be significant.
£2,440,000 of the additional provision made in the period was exceptional and is described in further detail in  
note 6 on page 73.

At 30 November 2014 262 1,354 4,616 (1,247) – (284) 4,701 
Deferred tax has arisen owing to accelerated capital allowances, business combinations, pension deficit/surplus and 
other temporary differences and also in respect of the taxable gains arising on the disposal of intangible fixed assets 
where the gains have been rolled into replacement assets.
Deferred tax at 30 November 2014 has been measured at 20% (2013: 20%) being the tax rate substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date expected to be effective for future periods.
26. Financial instruments and risk management
Derivatives and other financial instruments
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise loans, cash and short term deposits together with interest rate 
derivatives. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the group’s operations. The group 
has various other financial instruments such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables that 
arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The board reviews 
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The group’s exposure to 
financial instrument risk has reduced in 2014 as a result in the reduction in borrowings. There have been no substantive 
changes in the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and measuring those risks during the periods 
in this report unless otherwise stated.
On 4 March 2014 the group completed a debt refinancing and entered into a new £85,000,000 working capital 
facility available until 31 August 2018 at an annual interest rate of 2.5% above LIBOR. £60,900,000 was drawn against 
the working capital facility which, together with the proceeds from the primary fundraising at flotation, was utilised 
to repay the group’s existing borrowings. On 30 July 2014 the annual interest rate was reduced to 2.25% above LIBOR. 
The facility drawn as at 30 November 2014 was £46,000,000.
86 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Interest rate risk
The group is exposed to interest rate risk from its use of interest bearing financial instruments. This is a market risk 
that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates. 
Floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid bear interest at rates based on one month LIBOR. It is the 
group’s policy to consider the need for interest rate hedging on an ongoing basis. No interest rate hedging is currently 
in place.
In prior years the group managed an element of its floating interest rate risk through interest rate swaps. The derivative 
agreements to which the group was party to at 24 November 2013 guaranteed a maximum fixed rate borrowing cost 
on a portion of the group’s debt up to 30 April 2015. At 24 November 2013, the interest rate derivative contract had an 
aggregate fair value of £34,000. In March 2014 these derivative agreements were terminated.

If interest rates had been 0.5% higher during the period ended 30 November 2014, with all other variables held 
constant, the post tax profit for the period would have been approximately £282,000 lower (2013: £180,000) as a 
result of higher interest expense.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises from the group’s management of working capital and the finance charges on its debt instruments 
and repayments of principal. It is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as 
they fall due.
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
overdrafts and credit facilities to ensure that it will always have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when 
they become due.

Borrowing facilities
The group had certain borrowing facilities available to it for general working capital requirements of which £46,000,000 
had been drawn at 30 November 2014 (24 November 2013: £nil).
Credit risk
Given the nature of the group’s operations, credit risk is not considered significant and arises mainly from cash deposits 
held with banks and financial institutions which have a good credit rating. Credit risk also arises from trade and other 
receivables which comprise amounts due from credit card institutions and rebates due from suppliers.

Fair value of interest rate swaps
Financial assets – current – 34
The fair value of a derivate financial instrument is split between current and non-current depending on the remaining 
maturity of the derivative contract and its contractual cash flows. The interest rate swaps are designated as fair value 
through profit or loss at initial recognition. The fair value of the group’s interest rate derivatives is calculated as the 
present value of future expected net contracted cash flows at market related rates, which are current at the balance 
sheet date.

28. Leases and commitments
Operating leases
The group leases various properties and equipment under non-cancellable operating leases. The terms of the property 
leases vary, although they tend to be with rent reviews every three to five years and many have break clauses.
The total future value of minimum lease rentals payable is as follows:
30 November
2014
£’000
24 November
2013
£’000
Land and buildings
Within one year 26,154 23,965 
Within one to five years 69,019 65,918 
After five years 60,937 50,738 
156,110 140,621 
As set out in note 7 property rental income earned during the year was £3,253,000 (2013: £3,368,000). The majority 
of the properties held have committed tenants for the next five years. All operating lease contracts contain market 
review clauses in the event that the lessee exercises its option to renew. The lessee does not have an option to 
purchase the property at the expiry of the lease period.
90 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 At the balance sheet date, the group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments:
30 November
2014

Finance leases
The group acquires the majority of its motor vehicles and computer equipment under hire purchase agreements and 
such assets are generally classified as finance leases.
Future lease payments are due as follows:

The current period is a 53 week period and therefore cash flow is impacted by certain additional payments to creditors 
and receipts from debtors, the combined impact of which is to increase cash outflow by £11,680,000 relative to a 52 
week period.
30. Contingent liabilities 
The group did not have any material contingent liabilities at 30 November 2014 or 24 November 2013.
Certain subsidiaries of the company have assigned UK property leases in the normal course of business. Should the 
assignees fail to fulfil any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the group may be liable for those defaults. 
The group cannot reliably quantify the amount of such contingent liabilities due to their uncertain nature. The number 
of such claims arising to date has been small and the liability, which is charged to the profit and loss account as it 
arises, has not been material.
92 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31. Retirement benefit schemes 
The group accounts for pensions in accordance with IAS19 revised.
The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, the TM Group pension scheme and the 
TM pension plan, in addition to several defined contribution schemes which require contributions to be made to 
separately administered funds. Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were £1,042,000 in 2014 (2013: £825,000).
The two defined benefit pension schemes are subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including 
the Scheme Specific Funding requirements. The schemes are operated under trust and as such, the trustees of the 
schemes are responsible for operating the schemes and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with 
the trust deed and rules, in the best interest of the beneficiaries of the schemes, and UK legislation (including Trust law).
The nature of the schemes exposes the group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the 
schemes in times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:
• 
Members living for longer than expected;
• 
Higher than expected actual inflation; 
• 
Lower than expected investment returns; and
• 
The risk that movements in the value of the schemes’ liabilities are not met by corresponding movements  
in the value of the schemes’ assets.
The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication on the impact on the value of the schemes’ 
liabilities of the risks highlighted.
Full actuarial valuations of the two defined benefit pension schemes are carried out in accordance with legislative 
requirements. The last full valuations of the schemes were carried out at 31 March 2013.
Contributions to the schemes are made in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the 
basis of valuations. The figures for this financial information have been based, in accordance with IAS19 revised, on 
valuations using the projected unit method.
The contributions made in respect of the accounting period were £1,376,000 in 2014 (2013: £790,000). As at 30 
November 2014 contributions of £126,000 (2013: £67,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been 
paid over to the schemes.
The agreed contribution level for future years following the latest actuarial valuation of the schemes, is £1,533,000 per 
annum increased annually by price inflation. This will be subject to annual review and at the next actuarial valuation 
the contribution level will be reassessed.
Both defined benefits schemes ceased accrual on 1 July 2008 and now have no active members. Both schemes are 
closed to new entrants. 
The disclosures are based upon the valuation of the schemes which were carried out as at 31 March 2013, updated 
to 30 November 2014 by qualified independent actuaries. The main assumptions when valuing the assets and liabilities 
of the schemes under IAS19 revised are as follows:
Group pension schemes

Rate of increase to pensions in payment:
 5% LPI 2.90 3.25 
 2.5% LPI 2.10 2.20 
Discount rate 3.50 4.25 
The long term expected return on assets has been set with reference to current market yields on government and 
corporate bonds, and expected outperformance of equities and property. The overall expected return on assets 
reflects the relative weighting of different asset classes held by the scheme.
None of the group’s own financial instruments or property, either held or occupied by the group, are held as assets 
within either schemes.

The IPO of the group took place part way through the period and therefore results for the period reflect three months 
of the pre-IPO capital structure and the weighted average number of shares does not reflect the number of shares 
in issue at the period end. Pro-forma earnings per share has been calculated to adjust for these factors. Pro-forma 
finance costs have been calculated by extrapolating finance costs incurred since the IPO over the full accounting 
period. A further deduction has been made to remove the impact of the 53rd week in the current period.
See note 6 on page 73 for full details of the exceptional items, unamortised financing costs, additional interest 
and tax effect of these adjustments.

100 McColl's Retail Group Annual Report and Accounts 2014 1c. Basis of preparation
McColl’s Retail Group plc was incorporated on 20 November 2013 as De Facto 2075 Limited. On 7 February 2014, 
McColl’s Retail Group plc replaced Martin McColl Retail Limited (formerly McColl’s Retail Group Limited) as the 
ultimate parent company, by way of a share exchange agreement, and Martin McColl Retail Limited (formerly 
McColl’s Retail Group Limited) became a wholly owned subsidiary of McColl’s Retail Group plc. Under IFRS3 this 
has been accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition. On 28 February 2014 McColl’s Retail Group plc was listed 
on the London Stock Exchange. 
The company’s financial period is the period from incorporation on 20 November 2013 to 30 November 2014. 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The directors have considered the company forecasts 
and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic 
uncertainty, and are satisfied that the company should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities. 
Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006 from 
presenting its own profit and loss account. The company made a profit after tax of £4,600,000. 
The company has taken advantage of the exemptions in FRS1 ‘Cash flow statements’ and has not prepared a cash 
flow statement. 
Accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period. 
The company has not disclosed transactions with related parties that are part of the Martin McColl Retail Limited 
(formerly McColl’s Retail Group Limited) group of companies, which are wholly owned, as permitted by FRS8 
‘Related Parties’. 
2c. Significant accounting policies 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment. 
Taxation 
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which 
timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Delivering value through 
a robust business model
1.
  Profitable and sustainable  
target markets
• Pace has an unmatched customer base of blue-chip 
PayTV and Broadband Service Providers.
• These Service Providers play a key role in creating, aggregating 
and managing complex services which are sold direct to consumers 
with whom they have strong, multi-year relationships. This is a proven, 
sustainable, highly profitable and cash-generative business model.
• Due to high levels of competition and evolving consumer demands, 
Service Providers are increasing investments to deliver the best user 
experiences to their consumers, over the best networks that can 
be effectively managed and supported.
• This in turn creates a large, sustainable and profitable target market 
for Pace to address.
Pace delivers value through a highly efficient, 
profitable and sustainable business model based 
upon our core strengths and supported by our 
long-term strategy.
What we do
Pace’s principal activities are the development, design and distribution 
of technologies, products and services for managed subscription 
television, telephony and broadband services and the provision of 
engineering design and software applications to its customers. The Group 
also provides related support services including consulting, systems 
integration and customer care centres.
How we do it
The combination of our global scale, decentralised and customer-focused 
structure, broad product portfolio, technological innovation and efficient

Strategic report / Chairman’s statement
Dear Shareholder
2014 has been a year of execution and expansion; 
the business has made good progress on its 
Strategic Plan, delivered strong financial results, 
and through both organic developments and the 
acquisition and integration of Aurora Networks, 
has created a platform for further growth.
In the year, the Group achieved a 24.5% 
increase in adjusted EBITA due to top-line 
growth through the Aurora Networks acquisition, 
improved revenue mix, supply chain efficiency 
and increased operational efficiency. The Group 
delivered a third consecutive year of strong 
free cash flow, and has delivered nearly $600m 
cumulative free cash flow in that time. This 
sustainable strong free cash flow model gives 
the Company the confidence and flexibility to 
identify and invest in both organic and acquisitive 
opportunities which will deliver long-term value 
to our customers and our shareholders.
In November 2011, the Company laid out a 
clear Strategic Plan that aimed to develop a 
distinctive, scalable and profitable technology 
solutions provider to PayTV and broadband 
industries by growing a broader platform 
across hardware, software and services. In the 
last three years, we have continued to evolve 
and deliver against this plan.
The acquisition of Aurora Networks represented 
an important evolution in the Strategic Plan, 
enabling Pace to widen out into network 
infrastructure and build deeper, more embedded 
relationships with our customers. The now fully 
integrated Networks business unit has had a 
great first year and we are confident that it will 
make further progress in 2015 and beyond.
The target of the Strategic Plan was to achieve 
a 9% Operating Margin within a 4 to 5 year 
horizon. With a 9.2% Operating Margin in 
2014, I am delighted to announce that Pace 
has achieved this target a year ahead of plan. 
However, this is only the start of the journey 
and there is significant opportunity for further 
improvement in the business.
During this time the PayTV and Broadband 
markets have also evolved significantly; our 
customers continue to respond to both the 
demands of their consumers and the various 
disruptive threats by creating increasingly 
innovative and engaging new services, building 
better and faster networks whilst delivering an 
always-on, always-supported managed service. 
Pace has been, and will continue to be, strongly 
positioned to capitalise on these increased 
investments over the next 3 to 5 years.
By continuing to execute against our Strategic 
Plan and capitalising on the significant market 
opportunity, Pace will not only strengthen its 
position as a market-leading technology solutions 
provider for the PayTV and broadband industries, 
but also become a “great technology company”.
The strong performance in 2014 and the 
trajectory of the business give the Board 
confidence to continue building on the progressive 
dividend policy that was introduced in 2009. 
Therefore the Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 4.75 cents per share, giving a full 
year dividend of 7.00 cents per share, a 27.5% 
increase on 2013. The dividend reflects the 
robust ongoing cash generation of the business.
Board changes
Mike Inglis was reappointed as a Non-executive 
Director on 13 March 2014. Roddy Murray 
resigned from his role as Chief Financial Officer 
and Executive Director on 27 July 2014. 
Mark Shuttleworth was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer and joined the Board 
on 12 January 2015.
If you have any comments on my letter or any 
part of the Annual Report, I would be delighted 
to hear from you either by writing to me at Pace 
or by email at Allan.Leighton@pace.com.
Yours sincerely
Allan Leighton
Chairman

Summary
 R 2014 has been a year of execution and

financial results and created a platform 
for further growth.
 R The acquisition of Aurora Networks Inc 
represented an important evolution 
in the Strategic Plan.
 R Pace has been, and will continue to 
be, strongly positioned to capitalise 
on operators’ increased investments 
over the next 3 to 5 years.
 R Pace will not only strengthen its position

Strategic report / Chief Executive Officer’s review
Key highlights of the year
Pace is continuing to become a more 
profitable, cash-generative business with 
a broader spread of products and customers and 
a better mix of revenue. Revenue in 2014 increased 
by 6.1% ($2,620.0m vs $2,469.2m in 2013). 
Operating margin in the period increased from 
7 .8% to 9.2% reflecting strong contribution from 
the Aurora Networks acquisition (Networks), 
better revenue mix, improving supply chain 
effectiveness and lower underlying operating 
costs. On an underlying basis (excluding 
Networks), profitability increased (operating 
margin 8.2% vs 7.8% in 2013) despite lower 
revenue ($2,355.4m vs $2,469.2m in 2013). 
The cash flow performance of Pace remains 
strong with $204.0m of free cash flow generated 
in the period, 84.6% of adjusted EBITA.
Strategic plan
The Strategic Review undertaken in 2011 
highlighted that Pace operates in sustainable and 
profitable markets where we have differentiated 
capabilities; however, the Group must continue 
to execute on its three primary objectives to take 
advantage of the opportunities for improving 
both the level and quality of its earnings. We 
remain focused on these objectives and have 
made good progress both in delivering strong 
results in 2014 and creating a platform for 
further improvement in 2015 and beyond.
In addition to the various organic developments 
Pace has undertaken over the past two years, 
the acquisition of Networks is a key step in the 
evolution of Pace and enhances our strategy to 
grow a broader platform across Hardware, 
Software and Services.

Significant progress has been made in 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness 
of the business. As the major initiatives 
which commenced in 2012 continue to 
deliver tangible benefits, a cost-focused 
discipline and high level of accountability 
is now ingrained across Pace and has 
been implemented in the newly acquired 
Networks business. 
R Underlying operating costs

, excluding the 
Networks SBU and the capitalisation and

reduced by $19.3m (7.4%) in 2014 due to 
further efficiency programmes across the 
business. Whilst reducing underlying operating 
expenses, Pace has continued to invest 
further in Software and Services and 
other growth opportunities. 
R Application of Pace efficiency and 
effectiveness principles to the Networks 
business enabled targeted cost and working 
capital synergies to be achieved ahead 
of plan.
In November 2011, the Company laid out a clear Strategic Plan that aimed to develop a 
distinctive, scalable and profitable technology solutions provider to PayTV and Broadband 
industries by growing a broader platform across hardware, software and services. We have 
continued to evolve and deliver against this Plan, within which there are three key objectives:

a weaker H1 2014 resulting in a 4.8% revenue 
decline to $2,243.2m (2013: 2.6% growth).
R STB and Media Server revenues were up 1.2% 
to $2,003.5m in 2014 (2013: $1,979.6m), 
driven largely by high demand in H2 2014 
following a number of major launches 
across all regions.
R The move to Media Servers and whole 
home solutions is continuing at speed 
across the globe with over 27% of Pace’s 
shipments in the STB and Media Server. 
Widening out
Pace has built on the momentum of 2013 
with wins across all areas of our software 
and services offerings and good progress 
on product and customer project launches.
R Pace achieved a 231.1% increase 
(2013: 5.4% increase) in non-CPE revenue 
to $376.8m (2013: $113.8m) due to the 
acquisition of Networks.
R Revenues in the Networks Strategic 
Business Unit (SBU) have been strong, 
reflecting cable operators’ need for increased 
bandwidth and Pace Networks’ product set 
being an efficient way to upgrade network 
infrastructure. Networks delivered a strong 
performance in 2014 and further progress 
is expected in 2015.

R Cash generation was strong throughout 
the year; free cash flow was $204.0m 
(2013: $209.0m) due to further realignment 
of working capital and focused cash 
management. Since the completion of 
the acquisition of Networks for a headline 
consideration of $310m on 6 January 2014 
(pro forma debt of $279.2m), net debt has 
been reduced by $186.1m (66.7%) to achieve 
a net debt of $93.1m at 31 December 2014 
(net cash at 31 December 2013: $33.0m).
The various components of the transform core 
economics stream of the Strategic Plan are 
now well embedded across the Company and 
are delivering significant financial and 
operational benefits. However, the Company 
believes significant opportunities remain for 
further improvement and will pursue areas 
of inefficiency and will relentlessly strive to 
continually improve operating effectiveness 
across all areas of the business.

Media Server wins and deployments with a 
number of customers including BeIn Sports, 
Comcast, Foxtel and Liberty Global. We 
have a strong Media Server pipeline and 
anticipate increased demand across the 
globe in 2015 and beyond.
R Demand for traditional STBs remains 
strong; in the year, Pace achieved next 
generation hardware wins at a number of 
longstanding tier one customers, including 
AT&T, Net Brazil, Oi, Sky Italia, Tata Sky 
and Zon Optimus.
R Gateway revenues were down 36.2% to 
$239.7m in 2014 (2013: $375.8m) due to 
reduced demand for legacy products in 
H1 2014. However, the launch of a number 
of new products enabled a 110.9% increase 
in revenue in H2 2014 compared to H1 2014. 
Wins were achieved with customers including 
AT&T, GVT and a number of Independent 
Operating Companies (IOCs) in North 
America. In addition, Pace launched 
a range of DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Gateways 
in the North American market, our first 
development in this growing market.

for subscribers is expected between 2014 
and 2018. Underlying the strength of the 
PayTV market are a number of key 
dynamics, both from an operator 
and consumer perspective:
 R Operator consolidation: The rate of PayTV 
and telecoms operator consolidation over 
the past 12 months, both rumoured and 
realised, is unprecedented. These significant 
investments into the PayTV space reflect 
the strength of and confidence in the PayTV 
model, and are likely to continue to reshape 
the industry landscape for many years to come. 
Each of the transactions have specific strategic 
rationale but a number of general strategic 
aims have been publicly stated. These include:

costs and service and technology innovation; 
provision of a broader offer of services; and 
enabling the larger combined entities to 
compete more effectively in an increasingly 
crowded and competitive marketplace. 
These enlarged service providers will aim to 
offer better, more innovative and engaging 
services to their customers supported by the 
very best technology, with higher expectations 
and demands on their technology vendors that 
only the largest, most innovative and diversified 
companies such as Pace can provide.
 R Subscriber growth beyond 
mature markets: In emerging markets, 
digital PayTV subscriber growth is still 
strong with over 10% subscriber CAGR 
predicted from 2014 to 2018
9
. This growth 
is driven by a number of factors such as 
demographic transition, introduction of PayTV 
into greenfield markets, analogue to digital 
transition, changing market regulation and 
increasing consumer demand for high-quality 
video entertainment. With our deep in-market 
coverage and capability, a global scale and 
broad portfolio of products and services 
including integrated solutions (Pace hardware, 
software and conditional access) designed 
for emerging market service providers, Pace is 
well placed to support service providers in 
these markets during this growth period.
 R Whole home and Media Servers 
becoming the norm: The technology 
refresh cycle to Media Servers continues 
at pace across the industry with over 5m 
devices shipped globally in 2013 and the 
total size of the market predicted to grow 
23.4% from 2014 to 2018 (CAGR) to over 
$4.6bn
9
. A Media Server combines the 
functionality of the STB and the Gateway, 
augmenting traditional broadcast with 
IP-enabled services and enabling video 
content to be distributed around the 
home; a key component of the move 
to “TV Everywhere”. The Media Server 
product segment is evolving to become the 
main hub of the home, enabling any data 
connectivity (video, voice, broadband, home 
automation, etc.) around the home with both 
operator-provided and consumer-purchased 
devices. Pace has been widely acknowledged 
as a clear market leader in the Media Server 
segment, having shipped over 7 million 
Media Servers and over 7 million thin client 
devices over the last three years, with wins 
and deployments for more than 15 service 
providers around the world.

 R Rapidly evolving advanced user 
experiences: As communications and 
entertainment services converge and 
we move to an always-connected world, 
increasingly technology-aware consumers 
are demanding ever more advanced and 
rapidly evolving user experiences from their 
Service Providers. TV Everywhere, Ultra 
High Definition (UHD) and great in-home 
wireless connectivity are three examples 
of advanced user experiences that are 
resulting in technology change and faster 
refresh cycles. With TV Everywhere, service 
providers are marrying the best of the Over 
the Top (OTT) experiences with the great 
content and support model of the traditional 
broadcast offering, enabling consumers to 
watch what they want to watch, whenever 
and wherever they want to watch it. The 
expected emergence of UHD video, over 
60 million UHD televisions predicted to be 
shipped in 2018 (24% of total shipments)
9
, 
brings not only a far greater picture resolution, 
but a wider range of colours and faster refresh 
of picture resulting in a far more immersive 
experience than High Definition. Consumers 
now expect to be able to access all their 
services at any time on their in-home wireless 
network. To enable this, service providers 
are rolling out advanced residential gateways 
with next generation wireless network 
technologies (such as Wi-Fi 802.11ac) that 
give greater coverage and increased bandwidth 
to the consumer. With a strong track record 
as a technology innovator for the PayTV 
industry, Pace is at the forefront of supporting 
service providers to develop and deliver 
these rapidly evolving user experiences 
to their consumers.
 R Bandwidth, bandwidth and more 
bandwidth: With increasing numbers 
of connectable devices, growing usage 
of “video everywhere” and other data 
intensive applications such as wi-fi offload, 
consumer demand for high-speed data 
is increasing at a significant rate; 
global Internet traffic is predicted to reach 
14 gigabytes (GB) per capita by 2018, up 
from 5 GB per capita in 2013
10
. To respond 
to this demand and compete in highly 
competitive markets, service providers need 
to upgrade their network capacity in a quick, 
effective and cost efficient manner. Aurora, 
one of the largest suppliers of Optical 
Transport and Access Network solutions, 
enables service providers to cost-efficiently 
increase network capacity whilst minimising 
disruption to customers, saving on power, 
space and operating expenses and leveraging 
existing network investments.
 R Supporting the increasingly complex 
connected home: As service providers 
deliver more services to consumers and 
the number of connected devices in the 
home proliferates, the connected home 
continues to become increasingly more 
complex. With the emergence of the 
“Internet of Things” it is estimated that in 
2020, the average broadband-connected 
home will have over 50 connected devices
11
. 
As this complexity increases, the need for 
the service providers to be able to effectively 
and cost-efficiently support the consumer 
becomes greater. Through our ECO Service 
Management Platform and next generation 
customer care centres, Pace manages over 
34 million devices and handles 6 million 
calls per annum on behalf of over 20 
service providers across the world. 
These dynamics are driving increased investment 
by service providers to deliver the best networks, 
the best user experiences and the best service 
experience they can to their end users. As one 
of the leading providers of technology solutions 
to the PayTV industry with a blue-chip customer 
base, strong global footprint, broad portfolio of 
products and services, the Board believes that 
Pace is strongly positioned to capitalise on these 
major industry dynamics over the next 3-5 years.

Aurora Networks – 12 months in
The acquisition of Aurora Networks, Inc 
was announced on 23 October 2013 
and completed on 6 January 2014. 
Aurora Networks is a leading developer and 
manufacturer of advanced, next-generation 
Optical Transport and Access Network 
solutions for broadband networks that 
support the convergence of video, data 
and voice applications. A leading presence 
in these solutions that are increasingly 
important for cable operators as they 
continue to fulfil consumers’ constant demand 
for ever increasing bandwidth, ensures the 
acquisition has further strengthened Pace’s 
relationships with its customers.
Aurora Networks has strengthened 
our offering and footprint:
 R Positions Pace to enable operators 
to cost-effectively support their 
consumers’ constant demand 
for ever increasing bandwidth.
 R Highly profitable and growing business 
with blue-chip customer base and 
market-leading positions, serving over 
200 customers in 50 countries, including 
all of the top 10 cable operators in the US.
 R Strong, highly experienced 
management team.
 R Creates deeper and more embedded 
relationships with key customers.
 R Cross-sell opportunity across 
customer footprints.
 R Further widens Pace out beyond PayTV 
Customer Premise Equipment (CPE).
Aurora Networks has progressed 
beyond expectations in the first 
12 months:
 R Integration – The integration of Aurora 
into Pace was completed ahead of plan 
by the end of H1 2014, following which, 
significant progress has been made in 
ramping up the supply chain to meet the 
growing customer demand. Aurora is 
now a fully integrated SBU within Pace, 
“Pace Networks”, with its own focused 
sales and engineering teams whilst 
leveraging the scale and expertise of the 
wider Group’s shared services. The 
targeted end-state run-rate synergies of 
$8m per annum were achieved in 2014, 
a year ahead of plan whilst further 
investing in supporting customers 
and new product development.
 R Trading – Networks has had a very 
strong first year as part of Pace. Trading 
has been above expectations with revenue 
of $264.6m due to strong underlying 
customer demand which is expected to 
continue into 2015. Networks delivered 
an adjusted EBITA contribution of $47 .4m, 
an operating margin of 17.9%.
 R Innovation – Networks has a track 
record of innovation and this has continued 
in 2014 with a number of new product 
and technology launches:
 R DOCSIS 3.1 compatibility across the 
Networks product range – supporting 
the next generation of Hybrid Fibre 
Coaxial (HFC) access technologies.
 R Fifth generation Universal Digital 
Return solution – the industry’s only 
upgradeable digital return solution 
and a key component to supporting 
the transition to DOCSIS 3.1.
 R UniPHY Converged Services 
Platform – high performance 
aggregation solution for advanced 
services across high speed fibre 
and Coaxial networks.
 R Distributed Broadband Access 
Architecture (DBAA) – Pace’s 
distributed, iterative and modular 
approach to enabling greater network 
capacity that leverages operators 
existing infrastructure investments.

Strategic report / Business performance continued
Serving diverse markets 
around the world
North America
North America is the largest, most advanced 
and most profitable market for digital PayTV 
and broadband technology in the world, with 
over 112 million PayTV subscribers and close 
to 104 million fixed broadband connections
13
. 
Given the already high penetration levels, we 
believe the digital PayTV market in North America 
will remain flat in terms of the number of 
subscribers for the foreseeable future, with gross 
subscriber acquisition being offset by customer 
churn between the various PayTV offerings. 
However, Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) 
will continue to grow on an annual basis as 
service providers deliver an increased range of 
revenue-generating services to their customers.
Pace is the only vendor to all of the largest 
operators in each of the Cable, Satellite and 
Telco markets; serving Comcast, DirecTV and 
AT&T respectively. In each case Pace supplies 
their most advanced in-home technology. In 
addition, Pace also serves a large number of 
other Cable and Telco operators in both the 
USA and Canada.
Total revenues in North America increased by 
6.2% to $1,635.6m in 2014 (2013: $1,540.5m), 
driven largely by new launches with major 
customers in H2 2014 and strong demand 
for Aurora products. This confirmed Pace’s 
continued position of technological leadership 
in our sector and we remain confident about 
the long-term strength of the market for our 
products in North America.
Latin America (Latam)
The Latam market is a large, diverse and 
fast-growing market, within which Pace serves 
Satellite, Cable, IPTV and hybrid operators 
across the region, with Brazil and Mexico 
the key markets.
The overall market has expanded significantly 
over the last few years and continues to display 
strong digital subscriber growth with 6% growth 
predicted from 2014 to 2018
14
. This growth is 
led by a number of factors including greenfield 
markets, deregulation in Brazil, the 2016 Olympics 
in Brazil and a number of growing PayTV operators 
in the region. Demand for PayTV is strong at all 
levels of technology: Standard Definition (SD) 
continues to support analogue to digital transition, 
High Definition (HD) and high-end Personal 
Video Recorders (PVRs) to meet growing 
consumer expectations and Pace deployed 
media servers with operators in the region 
during 2014.
Revenue in Latam increased by 4.1% to 
$373.2m (2013: $358.4m). Pace continues to 
have a diverse business in Latam; providing 
products to eight of the ten largest PayTV 
providers in the region and has made good 
progress in widening out the solutions delivered 
to this market. The Company is strategically 
well positioned with key customers in the 
region and remains confident that strong 
revenues and profitability will continue.

Europe
Europe remains a fragmented and highly 
customer specific territory for Pace. Revenues 
in Europe were down by 10.1% to $291.2m 
(2013: $323.9m), primarily due to a reduced 
win rate of new products in prior years, which 
adversely affected revenue up to H1 2014. 
Sales performance has improved and key wins 
in new and existing customers delivered a 48.7% 
growth in H2 2014 compared to H1 2014. 
Single-digit digital subscriber growth is 
predicted in the underlying European PayTV 
market
15
; we expect significant growth in the 
Media Server segment of the market as operators 
in Europe follow the innovation of North American 
operators, and in 2014 Pace shipped Media 
Servers to two European operators: Liberty 
Global and Get.
In addition, the Group is seeing increasing 
demand from operators for integrated solutions, 
incorporating Pace hardware and software 
assets, that can be quickly deployed and that 
enable the operator to innovate and differentiate 
in highly competitive markets. Pace is focused 
on developing opportunities in this area of the 
market, and has a number of projects underway.
Rest of World
Rest of World covers a diverse range of markets 
which are developing at different rates: the highly 
developed markets in Australia, New Zealand and 
South East Asia, the “fast-following” markets in 
the Middle East and Africa, and the fast-growing 
Indian market. Revenues in Rest of World are 
up 29.9% to $320.0m (2013: $246.4m). This 
increase was due to strong demand for recently 
launched products in H2 2013 and 2014.
The Company remains confident that 
these markets will provide significant growth 
opportunities both at the high end of the market 
with HD, PVR and Media Server products, and 
also as the uptake of PayTV and digitisation 
continues in emerging greenfield markets allowing 
Pace to increase its footprint with new customers 
through Software and Integrated Solutions.

Strategic report / Risk management and principal risks
Robust risk 
management processes
The Group operates a system of internal control and risk 
management in order to provide assurance that it is 
managing risk whilst achieving its business objectives.
The Group’s systems are designed to 
identify and manage, rather than eliminate, 
significant business risks, including the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives, 
but can provide only reasonable, not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
No system can fully eliminate risk and 
therefore the understanding of operational 
risk is central to the management process 
within Pace. The long-term success of the 
Group depends on the continual review, 
assessment and control of the key business

Strategic report / Financial review
The financial position of Pace improved 
significantly in 2014. This improvement is 
reflected in the 6.1% increase in revenue (to 
$2,620.0m), a 24.5% increase in adjusted 
EBITA (to $241.1m) and a 66.7% reduction in 
net debt since the acquisition of Aurora.
Pace has become a more profitable Company 
with its operating margin increasing from 7.8% 
to 9.2%. In addition, free cash flow has remained 
strong at $204.0m (84.6% of adjusted EBITA), 
due to the continued benefits of robust cash 
management and working capital in-flows. 
As a result of the strong cash flow, the net debt 
has been reduced by $186.1m (66.7%) since 
the completion of the acquisition of Aurora 
Networks on 6 January 2014.
Group Revenue of $2,620.0m (2013: $2,469.2m) 
increased by 6.1% driven by the Networks 
business and strong demand for STBs and 
Media Servers partly offset by lower revenue 
from Gateways and flat revenue from Software 
and Services. Underlying revenue (excluding 
Networks) decreased by 4.6% to $2,355.4m 
(2013: $2,469.2m). In the year, 47% of revenue 
was generated by the top 3 customers 
(2013: 57%).
Gross profit of $532.5m (2013: $448.2m) is up 
18.8%. Gross margin percentage in 2014 was 
20.3%, an increase of 2.1ppt on 2013, reflecting 
the higher margin contribution from Networks.
Operating costs pre-exceptional charges and 
amortisation of other intangibles increased by 
$36.8m (14.5%) to $291.4m (2013: $254.6m) 
reflecting the inclusion of the Networks cost 
base. Further progress has been made in 
improving operating efficiency across the 
Company during the year, both in the core 
Pace business and Pace Networks.
The IAS 38 net credit (capitalisation minus 
amortisation of development costs) was $20.8m, 
reflecting an intense period of development 
activity ahead of product launches throughout

Mark Shuttleworth
Chief Financial Officer Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 21
Adjusted EBITA was $241.1m (2013: $193.6m), 
an operating margin of 9.2% against 7.8% in 
2013. Organic adjusted EBITA was $193.7m 
with operating margin increasing 0.4ppt to 8.2%.
Exceptional costs of $7.3m (2013: $12.2m) 
relate to Aurora Networks Inc. acquisition 
costs ($5.8m) and restructuring costs across 
the business ($1.5m).
Amortisation of other intangibles, primarily 
reflecting the charge for intangible assets 
related to acquisitions made in 2010 and 2014, 
was $52.9m (2013: $42.6m). The increase was 
due to the Aurora Networks acquisition.
Segmental analysis
The Group operates through SBUs. 
Pace Americas, Pace International and 
Pace Networks are deemed by the Board 
to represent operating segments under 
IFRS 8, with revenues and EBITA shown 
in the table below.
Movements in revenue are described below. 
Although not wholly consistent, revenues 
from STB and Media Servers, Gateways 
and Software and Services in North America 
belong primarily to the Americas SBU, in Europe 
and Rest of World belong largely to the 
International SBU, and in Latin America belong 
to both the Americas and International SBUs. 
All revenue from Network products belong to 
the Networks SBU, which is the new operating 
segment for the Aurora Networks acquisition.
Pace Americas’ revenue decreased by 
$118.6m (7 .1%) in 2014 with a strong H2 2014 
only partially offsetting a weaker H1 2014. 
Operating margin increased to 9.6% (2013: 9.1%). 
The performance of Pace International improved 
as revenue increased 0.6% and operating 
margin increased to 11.1% (2013: 10.5%). 
Pace Networks had a strong first year with 
revenue of $264.6m and an operating margin 
of 17.9%.
Other amounts include unallocated central 
costs that are not classified as reportable 
segments under IFRS 8. The loss in Other, 
primarily corporate costs, increased by 6.9% 
to $44.8m (2013: loss of $41.9m).
Finance costs
Net financing costs of $5.2m (2013: $8.0m) 
reflect the improved terms of the new 
borrowing facilities despite an increase 
in average net debt during the period. 
Finance costs include $1.6m (2013: $2.1m) 
for amortisation of facility arrangement and 
associated fees.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax was $175.7m (2013: $130.8m); 
an increase of $44.9m (34.3%) on 2013. 
Taxation
The tax charge of $27.7m (2013: charge $34.1m) 
results from the full year effective tax rate of 15.8% 
(2013: 26.1%). The rate reduction reflects a mix 
of expected recurring items, including lower 
corporate tax rates in the UK and the impact 
of the Aurora acquisition and non-recurring 
items. Based on the current expected regional 
mix of trading, the effective rate for 2015 is 
expected to be in the range of 19% to 21%. 
The cash cost of corporate tax was $11.5m 
(2013: $23.8m).

Strategic report / Financial review continued
Profit after tax
Profit after tax was $148.0m (2013: $96.7m), 
an increase of $51.3m (53.1%) on 2013. 
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (EPS) was 47 .4 cents 
(2013: 31.2 cents), an increase of 51.9%. Adjusted 
basic EPS, which removes the tax affected 
impact of the exceptional costs and amortisation 
of other intangibles to reflect underlying 
performance, was 63.6 cents (2013: 44.3 cents), 
an increase of 43.6%.
Balance sheet
Intangible development expenditure assets 
increased by $20.6m (2013: $8.1m increase) 
due to an increased number of development 
projects and the first year of capitalisation of 
Networks product development in line with 
IAS 38 standards.
Tangible fixed assets increased in the period 
primarily due to the inclusion of Aurora ($6.9m). 
Capital expenditure of $26.0m (2013: $21.6m) 
was offset by the depreciation charge of $29.0m 
(2013: $25.0m). The $26.0m capital expenditure 
reflected an increase of $4.4m from 2013 due 
to the inclusion of Networks and is in line with 
the expected ongoing level for the Company.
Working capital
In the period following the acquisition of Aurora 
Networks, the pro forma working capital increased 
by $16.5m (13.1%) to $142.5m, as the increase 
in core Pace, due to the phasing of revenue in 
the year, offset the reduction in Aurora.
Inventory increased by $11.2m (7 .1%) to $168.0m 
during the period reflecting the inclusion of 
Aurora inventory. Average stock turn in the 
period was 8.2 times against 8.4 times in 2013.
Debtor days increased by 6 days to 66 days at 
December 2014 reflecting a change in sales mix.
Creditor days at 31 December 2014 remained 
at 90 days, consistent with at 31 December 2013.
Debt
In the period following the acquisition of 
Aurora, the pro forma net debt reduced by 
$186.1m (66.7%) from $279.2m to $93.1m. 
During the year, two scheduled facility 
repayment instalments were paid of $15.5m 
each in June and December 2014. 
A key target for the Group is to reduce the 
balance sheet leverage (calculated as net debt 
divided by adjusted EBITDA
18
 over the preceding 
12 months). At 31 December 2014 the net debt/
Last Twelve Months (LTM) adjusted EBITDA 
ratio was 0.34x, well within the 2x net debt 
to EBITDA ratio target set as an appropriate 
and efficient capital structure for Pace.
Liquidity and cash flows
A key performance measure for the Group is free 
cash flow, which was $204.0m (2013: $209.0m) 
and represented 84.6% of adjusted EBITA 
(2013: 108.0%). Cash outflows from interest 
payable net of interest received were $3.6m 
(2013: $5.9m). Cash spent on exceptional 
costs was $8.0m (2013: $10.4m).
The Board is confident that the Group will 
continue to be strongly cash flow positive in 
2015 and that the Group’s committed bank 
facilities are more than sufficient to meet its 
short to medium-term funding needs.
Foreign currency
In the period, approximately 81.7% of the 
Group’s revenues were denominated in 
US Dollar (2013: 81.2%), 10.9% in Brazilian 
Real (2013: 10.7%), 4.3% in Euro (2013: 7.7%), 
2.5% South African Rand (2013: 0%), 
0.4% in Sterling (2013: 0.4%) and 
0.2% in Australian Dollar (2013: 0%).
The impact of non-USD revenues, costs and 
overheads continues to be addressed through 
Pace’s foreign exchange hedging strategy.
Critical accounting policies
The Directors consider that the Group has the 
following critical accounting policies, as they 
require the use of estimates and are subjective 
in their nature:
 R Impairment
 R Royalty and warranty provisions
 R Intangible assets – capitalised 
development costs
 R Acquisition accounting
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend 
of 4.75 cents per share (2013: 3.66 cents per 
share). The full year proposed dividend increases 
27.5% to 7.00 cents per share (2013: 5.49 cents 
per share). The increase reflects the Board’s 
confidence in the outlook for the Company, its 
improving financial position and is in line with 
the progressive dividend policy introduced 
in 2009.
Dividends will be paid in Sterling, equivalent 
to 3.093 pence per share. This is based on an 
exchange rate of £ = $1.5358, being the closing 
rate applicable on 2 March 2015, the date on 
which the Board resolved to recommend the 
final dividend. The proposed dividend will be 
payable on 3 July 2015 to shareholders on 
the register on 5 June 2015.

Environment
The Company has maintained certification 
to the international management standard 
ISO 14001 at its Saltaire, Boca Raton, 
Bangalore, Paris, Tempe and San Antonio 
sites and the Group Environmental Policy 
has been applied to all Pace sites worldwide.
The Company is a signatory to the European 
code of conduct on Energy Efficiency of Digital 
TV service systems (EU code of conduct), Energy 
Star Program requirements for STBs and MEPS 
(Minimum Energy Performance Standard). Pace 
is committed to ensuring that all products are 
designed to minimise energy consumption 
through its “Design for Environment” programme.
Supply chain
The Company has continued its work with its 
suppliers in 2014 through the Electronic Industry 
Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and also implemented 
a programme to ensure full-scale adoption of the 
EICC Code of Practice throughout its supply chain.
The Company has continued its work with 
EcoVadis to ensure complete evaluation 
transparency and drive continuous 
improvement of its supply chain’s CSR 
performance, culminating in a new set 
of supply chain objectives and targets.
Charitable and community support
The Group has an established Charitable 
Donations Committee comprising employees 
based at the Group’s premises in the UK and 
the USA. The Committee considers all requests 
for charitable and community project assistance 
from employees within a financial budget and 
criteria approved by the Board on an annual basis.
The Group’s support through the Committee is 
focused on the local geographical area of Pace’s 
premises in the UK, France, India and the USA 
as well as the charitable and community 
initiatives of Group employees.
During the year, requests for assistance 
satisfying the above criteria received financial 
support amounting to $117,766 in total.
The participation of employees of the Group in 
community and charitable activities outside work 
hours has been encouraged by the provision of 
funds to match individual sponsorship raised.
Pace has continued as sponsor of the Ahead 
Partnership’s education strand of business 
engagement in the UK’s West Yorkshire region. 
This three-year commitment has enabled the 
Ahead Partnership to develop and roll out their 
“Make the Grade” business education partnership 
model in West Yorkshire.
In addition, Pace has partnered with Teach 
First to support the science, technology, 
engineering and maths (STEM) teachers in 
Yorkshire and the Humber. Pace will fund the 
provision of personal development coaches to 
Teach First participants in their second year of 
teaching. Teach First recruits, trains and supports 
teachers working in schools in low income 
communities to raise the achievement, aspirations 
and access to opportunity of children from low 
socio-economic backgrounds. 
Employment policies
The Directors recognise the importance of the 
Group’s employees to its success and future 
development and are committed to providing an 
environment that will attract, motivate and reward 
high-quality employees. The Group continues 
to invest in a range of internal and external 
initiatives to promote employee development.
Employees are kept informed of matters affecting 
them as employees and factors affecting the 
performance of the Group through regular 
employee meetings/briefings and regular 
written news briefings are distributed 
electronically.
Diversity and inclusion
The Group welcomes applications for employment 
from all sectors of the community and promotes 
equality of opportunity in employment regardless 
of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability or 
ethnic origin. It is the Group’s policy that training, 
career development and promotion opportunities 
should be available to all employees. In the 
event that an employee becomes disabled, 
the Group makes reasonable adjustments 
where any aspect of premises or working 
practices puts such a disabled employee 
at a substantial disadvantage compared 
with a non-disabled employee.
We believe that diversity is an essential part 
of how we do business and we meet the needs 
of our global customer base. We operate in 
18 countries, employing c.2,100 people and 
working with customers and suppliers from 
a broad range of backgrounds and cultures.
The charts above show the gender split 
at different levels within the Group, as at 
31 December 2014.
Health and safety
Each SBU in the Group has an established 
Health and Safety Committee made up of health 
and safety representatives, the designated 
health and safety officer and other persons 
with expert knowledge who review health and 
safety issues relevant to the Group’s business. 
Other safety-related committees also conduct 
periodic reviews of specific work practices. 
These actions complement the UK Government’s 
“Health, Work, Wellbeing” (HWW) initiative 
which has been adopted and implemented 
by the Company.
Part of the HWW incorporates return to work 
programmes and the Group’s operations in 
Saltaire, Pace West* and Pace East*, France, 
Brazil and India have adopted similar policies. 
Each division incorporates, where appropriate, 
their ergonomic risk assessments.
Pace West undertakes earthquake training 
and Pace East undertakes hurricane training. 
All of these initiatives are backed up by appropriate 
risk assessments. “Tool-box talks”, short 
presentations on specific aspects of health and 
safety, are also published on the Group’s intranet 
and shared between different parts of the Group.
Human rights
The Group does not have a specific human 
rights policy at present, but does apply human 
rights considerations to the way it does business, 
for example, through our practices in relation 
to equal pay, the right to form and join trade 
unions, and our health and safety, supplier 
and anti-corruption policies. The Group will 
continue to review whether a specific human 
rights policy is needed in the future over 
and above our existing policies.
*  Pace West is represented by the 2Wire businesses, 
and Pace East is predominantly our office 
in Boca Raton, Florida.

Governance / Framework of Corporate Governance
The Board 
The Pace plc Board is accountable to the 
Company’s shareholders for standards of 
governance across the Group’s businesses. 
Certain strategic decision-making powers 
and authorities of the Company are reserved 
as matters for the Board. Whilst day-to-day 
operational decisions are managed by the 
Chief Executive Officer the principal matters 
reserved for the Board are set out below:
 R setting the overall strategic direction 
and oversight of the management of 
the Company;
 R recommending or declaring dividends;
 R approval of the Company consolidated 
financial statements;
 R approval of major corporate transactions 
and commitments;
 R succession planning and appointments to the 
Board and senior management remuneration; 
 R review of the Group’s overall corporate 
governance arrangements including 
systems of internal controls and risk 
management; and
 R approval of the delegation of authority to 
the Chief Executive Officer and the terms 
of reference of all Committees of the Board.
Where appropriate, matters are delegated 
to a Committee which will consider them 
in accordance with its terms of reference.
Details of each Committee’s terms 
of reference are available on the Pace 
website at www.pace.com
The Board of directors currently comprises 
two executive and five non-executive directors 
who bring a wide range of skills and experience 
to the Board. 
Biographical details of all directors are to be found 
on pages 26 and 27 . The Chairman, Allan Leighton, 
is mainly responsible for the running of the Board, 
ensuring, together with the Company Secretary, 
that it receives timely and clear information 
appropriate to enable it to discharge its duties. 
The responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer, 
Mike Pulli, are to focus on running the Group’s 
business and implementing Group strategy. The 
Chief Executive Officer is assisted in managing 
the business on a day-to-day basis by the 
Executive Committee as further described below.
All the non-executive directors (other than 
the Chairman) are deemed by the Board to be 
independent and the Chairman was deemed 
independent on his appointment, as required by 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. In addition, 
the Board has designated John Grant as the 
Senior Independent Director. All directors have 
access to the advice and services of the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and are able 
to take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their 
duties, if necessary. The code can be accessed 
at https://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
Each of the directors submit themselves for 
re-election on an annual basis. New directors 
receive a programme of tailored induction on 
joining the Board and all directors are offered 
the opportunity to continually update their skills 
and knowledge by attending external training 
events. The Company has in place procedures 
to deal with directors’ conflicts of interest and 
the Board is satisfied that these procedures 
operate effectively.
The Board normally meets at least eight times 
each year. It reviews the strategic direction of 
the Group and meets with other senior executives 
and employees within the Group as required 
during the year. The Chairman holds meetings 
with the non-executive directors without the 
executive directors being present on a regular 
basis. It is the policy of the Board to undertake a 
formal review and evaluation of its performance 
including the performance of its committees, 
the Chairman and individual directors on an 
annual basis. This is generally concluded by 
written feedback in standardised form from 
each director to the Chairman or the Senior 
Independent Director in the case of appraisal 
of the Chairman. The Board considers appointing 
an independent facilitator for the evaluation 
process at least once every three years and 
resolved to do so in 2014; however this process 
was deferred to 2015 to allow the appointment 
of a new CFO to take effect ahead of the 
evaluation process. In addition the members 
meet with senior employees below Executive 
level on a regular basis in the UK and overseas 
to receive feedback over lunch, dinner 
or in informal meetings.

shareholders, in the matters to be decided, 
no potential conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships and no day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the business. 
Where directors do hold other external positions, 
these are not considered to have any impact 
on their duties for the Group. 
The Nomination Committee is comprised of 
non-executive directors Pat Chapman-Pincher,

Directors’ remuneration
The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the performance of the executive directors, 
other members of the Executive Committee 
and wider Executive Team as a prelude to 
recommending their annual remuneration, 
bonus awards and long-term share incentive 
awards to the Board. The final determinations are 
made by the Board as a whole but no director 
plays a part in any discussions concerning their 
own remuneration. There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or 
employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment (whether through 
resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) 
that occurs as a result of a takeover bid.
The 2014 Remuneration Report of the directors 
to shareholders is set out on pages 35 to 43.
Code compliance
As referred to on page 43 the Company 
granted an appointment share award to Allan 
Leighton on his appointment as Non-executive 
Chairman in 2011 and this partially vested during 
2014 and will fully vest in 2015. As noted earlier 
the evaluation of the Board by an external third 
party did not take place and was postponed to 
2015. Save in respect of these matters, the 
directors believe that the Company has complied 
throughout the year with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, as revised and adopted 
by the Financial Reporting Council. The Board 
confirms that it has established the necessary 
procedures designed to maintain a sound system 
of internal controls and that there is an ongoing 
process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Company. 
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a well-developed investor 
relations programme led by the Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer and managed 
by the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations 
and Strategy. Through this programme the 
Company maintains regular contact with major 
shareholders to communicate clearly the Group’s 
objectives and monitors movements 
in significant shareholdings. 
Investor roadshows are now held each year 
in the USA as well as in the UK and formal 
investor presentations are made twice a year 
to groups of investment fund managers. 
The opportunity for shareholders to meet the 
Chairman or Senior Independent Director, 
separately from the executive directors, 
is available on request.
All financial and trading announcements are 
published immediately on the Company’s 
website, including copies of the presentations 
made to analysts and investors. 
All shareholders are welcome to participate at 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting when 
all the directors will normally be available to 
answer questions. The results of the Annual 
General Meeting resolutions, including details 
of votes cast/withheld, are published on the 
Company’s website.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company 
will be held on 23 April 2015 at the offices of 
the Company at Salts Mill, Victoria Road, Saltaire, 
West Yorkshire BD18 3LF. Full details of the 
business to be transacted at the meeting will be 
set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 31
Governance / Audit & Risk Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce this report of Pace’s 
Audit & Risk Committee for the year ended 
31 December 2014. This reflects the provisions 
of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
Code) now in effect regarding narrative reporting.
The Committee’s duties are described later in this 
report and reflect the Code’s recommendations. 
More broadly, the Committee sees its role as 
being to ensure the integrity of the Group’s 
financial reporting and the robustness of its 
internal controls and risk management processes.
In relation to the integrity of financial reporting, 
we adopt prudent accounting policies and 
practices, with areas of judgement being 
subject to specific review by the Committee. 
We work closely with the Company’s external 
auditors to agree areas of risk of potential 
misstatement and to make sure these are 
addressed as part of the audit process.
While the ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the Annual Report and Accounts 
remains with the Board, the Board requires that 
the Committee report to the Board on whether 
it considers the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable and to provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.
Risk management at Pace is a Board 
responsibility, but the Audit & Risk Committee 
is tasked by the Board with ensuring the risk 
management process is fit for purpose. Our 
systems of internal control are designed to 
focus resource on the principal risks to the 
business which are summarised within the 
Strategic Report. We have a well-developed 
budget process, with regular forecast updates 
and Board reviews of performance.
During the year the Committee was assisted 
by the previous Chief Financial Officer and from 
28 July 2014 the Acting Chief Financial Officer, 
Belinda Ellis, the Vice President of Group 
Finance and in particular the internal auditors, 
(BDO LLP). I have also met separately with 
the Company’s auditors during which meetings 
I have discussed their views on the strength and 
depth of financial reporting and internal control 
processes operating within the Group. 
Set out in the following pages is the Committee’s 
report on its activities during the year, including 
a description of how the Committee dealt with 
those areas of financial reporting that require 
particularly careful review and judgement. 
None of these areas has proved critical in 
preparing the Group’s financial statements 
this year.
With respect to the financial statements, the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) reviewed 
our 2013 Annual Report & Accounts under 
their duty to review periodically those of all UK 
listed companies. The Audit & Risk Committee 
is currently finalising the review with the FRC 
and the 2014 Annual Report & Accounts has 
been updated where necessary.
I hope you will find this report helpful in 
understanding the work of the Committee. 
Yours sincerely
John Grant
Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee

Governance / Audit & Risk Committee Report continued
Internal audit
The Company’s Vice President of Group Finance, 
who has direct access to the Audit & Risk 
Committee primarily through the Chairman 
of the Committee, oversees an internal audit 
function including a Risk Assurance Manager 
and incorporating external qualified 
auditing professionals.
The Audit & Risk Committee reviews annually 
the arrangements for internal audit and during 
the year the Committee re-appointed BDO LLP 
(BDO) to act as internal auditors, performing 
an agreed programme of internal audits in 
collaboration with the Company’s Vice President 
of Group Finance and senior management. 
BDO attended and presented their reports to 
each of the Audit & Risk Committee meetings 
during the year.
The Committee has, amongst other things, 
considered the quality of reporting to the 
Committee and impartiality of the internal auditors 
and has concluded that the effectiveness of 
Internal Audit during the year was satisfactory.
External audit
Our auditors, KPMG Audit Plc instigated an 
orderly wind down of their business during 
the year. The Board decided to put KPMG LLP 
forward to be appointed as auditors and a 
resolution concerning their appointment is being 
put to the forthcoming AGM of the company.
The Audit & Risk Committee has satisfied itself 
that the external auditors, KPMG LLP (KPMG), 
acted independently of the Group. Previous 
appointments of KPMG and the extent of other 
work undertaken by it were considered inter 
alia in this regard.
It is the Committee’s opinion confirmed in 
discussions with KPMG that there were no 
limitations imposed by management on KPMG 
whilst performing their duties during the 
review period.
The Committee, in consultation with the 
Group’s executive management, agreed 
to the terms of the KPMG engagement letter, 
audit plan and budgeted audit fees for the 
2014 financial year.
A formal framework governs the process 
through which the Group’s auditors are 
considered to render non-audit services. 
The Committee has approved a policy in 
relation to the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditors and the nature and 
extent of non-audit services that the external 
auditors could provide within the scope 
of the policy during the year.
Details of the external auditors’ total fees paid 
to KPMG during the year are set out in Note 4 
to the Financial Statements. Non-audit fees of 
$133,000 (2013: $100,000) were paid to KPMG 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2014.
External audit appointment
The Committee reviews and makes 
recommendations with regard to the 
re-appointment of the external auditors. 
In making these recommendations, the 
Committee considers auditor effectiveness 
and independence, partner rotation and any 
other factors which may impact the external 
auditor’s re-appointment. 
The external auditors are required to rotate 
the audit partner every five years. The most 
recent change occurred in the year ended 
31 December 2012 and therefore partner rotation 
is due in the year ending 31 December 2017. 
The current external auditors, KPMG LLP 
(formerly KPMG Audit plc), were first appointed 
in 1996 and the external audit has not been 
formally tendered since then. 
Having completed the activities outlined, 
the Committee remains confident that the 
effectiveness and independence of the external 
auditors is not impaired in any way. There are 
no contractual restrictions on the choice 
of external auditor.
Role and key responsibilities
The terms of reference of the Committee 
are reviewed annually and are available on 
the Company’s website (www.pace.com).
The Committee’s main responsibilities involve:
 R monitoring the integrity of the Financial 
Statements of the Company and formal 
announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance and reviewing any 
significant financial reporting 
judgements contained therein;
 R reviewing the Company’s internal 
financial and operational control 
and risk management systems;
 R monitoring the effectiveness of the 
Company’s internal audit function 
and reviewing its material findings;
 R reviewing accounting policies, 
accounting treatments and disclosures 
in the Strategic Report and Financial 
Statements ensuring that shareholders 
may understand strategic aims and 
risks of the business of the Group and 
that the Annual Report and Accounts 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable;
 R overseeing the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditors, including making 
recommendations as to frequency 
of tendering for audit services, the 
appointment or re-appointment of the 
external auditors, reviewing their terms 
of engagement and monitoring their 
independence and ensuring that policy 
surrounding their engagement to provide 
non-audit services is appropriately applied; 
 R monitoring fraud reports and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Company’s 
whistleblowing procedures; and
 R reporting to the Board on how it 
has discharged its responsibilities. Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 33
The comply-or-explain provision relating to audit 
tendering in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code has effectively now been superseded by 
the UK Competition Commission’s final report 
and recent developments in Europe. Pace has 
been advised that new European legislation 
is likely to require mandatory rotation of audit 
firms every ten years, extendable in certain 
circumstances to twenty years. KPMG has 
been Pace’s auditor since listing in 1996 and 
the transitional rules that the EU has proposed 
are expected to require an initial change of audit 
firms no later than 2023. Until this uncertainty is 
resolved, the Committee will continue to consider 
annually whether to conduct an audit tender 
for audit quality or independence reasons.
Activities of the Committee
The main activities of the Committee during 
the year are set out below.
Financial reporting
The Committee reviewed and considered the 
following areas in respect of financial reporting 
and the preparation of the interim and annual 
financial statements:
 R the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used;
 R compliance with external and internal 
financial reporting standards and policies;
 R significant judgements made;
 R disclosures and presentations; and
 R whether the Annual Report and Accounts 
are fair, balanced and understandable.
In carrying this out, the Committee considered 
the work and recommendations of the Group 
Finance Team. In addition, the Committee 
received reports from the external auditors 
setting out their view on the accounting 
treatments and judgements included in the 
financial statements. The external auditors’ 
reports are based on a full audit of the annual 
financial statements and a high-level review 
of the interim financial statements.
With the support of the external auditor, 
the Committee assessed whether suitable 
accounting policies had been adopted, whether 
management had made appropriate estimates 
and judgements and whether the disclosures 
were fair and balanced.
The significant judgements considered by the 
Committee in areas where there was potential 
risk of material misstatement, were:
 R Royalty provisions. These are considered 
a significant area of judgement due to the 
complexity of the claims made against the 
Group, and the range of possible outcomes 
of each claim. The Committee and the 
Board receive a semi-annual report from the 
General Counsel regarding royalties under 
negotiation as referred to in Note 20 to the 
Financial Statements.
 R Capitalised development costs. Project 
development costs are capitalised and 
subsequently amortised over their useful 
economic life. The Committee considered 
the basis for selecting such costs as relevant 
development costs and the process for 
identifying the useful life. The Committee 
also reviews a summary of the larger 
projects, by carrying value, to understand 
how the costs capitalised are covered by 
future forecast margin. The Committee 
has concluded that the processes for 
capitalising development costs are robust 
and that the balance is recoverable.
 R Acquisition accounting. As part of the 
accounting for the acquisition of Aurora 
Networks, Inc, the Committee considered 
the purchase price allocation exercise and 
the basis for fair value adjustments. The 
Committee considered that the balances 
were fairly stated. 
 R Other areas of judgement reviewed by the 
Committee, but where it was concluded that 
there was not a risk of material misstatement, 
included: revenue recognition, warranty 
provisions; classification of items as exceptional; 
potential impairments of goodwill, intangible 
and other fixed assets; and treatment of tax 
assets and liabilities.
Internal controls and risk management
The Committee reviews the framework of 
internal controls and the processes by which 
the Group’s control environment is evaluated. 
In this regard, the Committee received reports 
from internal audit on the operation of, and 
issue arising from, the Group’s internal controls 
and procedures. External audit has also provided 
input and observations on the internal control 
environment and on any specific control issues 
that occurred during the year. 
The Committee also reviewed compliance 
activities in relation to internal audit reports 
submitted to the Committee in prior years 
and received a report on the status of 
recommendations and actions outstanding. 
The Committee reviews the Group’s risk 
management framework in order to ensure it is 
appropriate and operating effectively. In doing 
so, the Committee received reports from the 
Vice President of Group Finance covering: 
 R the effectiveness of the risk management 
processes and their adoption across the 
Group; and
 R a summary of the top risks to the Group, 
controls identified to mitigate these risks 
and actions planned to reduce risks 
where considered necessary.
As part of its agenda, the Committee allowed 
time for in-depth reviews of particular risk areas. 
During the year, the risk areas considered included 
business continuity management, IT Strategy, 
governance and supply chain management.

Governance / Nomination Committee Report
Committee meetings
The Committee meet at least once per year 
usually in conjunction with Board meetings. 
Activities of the Committee
During the year, the Nomination Committee 
dealt with a number of matters, including the 
recruitment of new CFO, Mark Shuttleworth 
to the Board and succession planning of key 
executive and non-executive director roles.
Pace and the Committee value the aims and 
objectives of The Davies Report on Women 
on Boards and support and apply the Group 
diversity policy set out on page 25. There is 
currently 29% female representation at Board 
level. No formal measurable objective has been 
set for female representation at Board level.
The Committee is sensitive to the need 
for the non-executive directors to remain 
independent from management in order to 
exercise independent oversight and effectively 
challenge management as necessary. 
The Committee continually assesses the 
independence of the non-executive directors 
and has determined that all the non-executive 
directors are independent. None of them serve 
as directors of any companies or affiliates in 
which any other director is a director. However, 
more importantly, each of the non-executive 
directors is prepared to question and challenge 
management, to request more information and 
to ask the difficult question. They insist on robust 
responses both within the boardroom and 
sometimes between Board meetings. 
We value the input we receive from our 
longer serving directors given their deep 
understanding of the Group. We are however 
focused on planning for the future to build a 
balanced Board with the skills and experience 
fit to face the challenges that lie ahead. The 
Committee recognises that, in due course, 
longer serving directors will step down and 
therefore it will continue to search for other 
suitable non-executive directors, whose 
experience will align with the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
CFO Recruitment Process
The Committee appointed the Zygos 
Partnership, a London based global executive 
international search firm and a signatory to 
the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms in Board Appointments. Zygos 
has no other connection to the Company.
The Group HR Director also assisted the 
Committee in the process. With their help the 
Committee developed a company, job and 
person profile and approved a long list followed 
by a short list of candidates. This was followed 
by an interview process by both Zygos and 
Pace directors and executives alongside rigorous 
reference checking.
The Board announced the appointment 
of Mark Shuttleworth as CFO on the 
recommendation of the Committee on 
18 November 2014 and the appointment 
took effect on 12 January 2015.
Committee responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for a number 
of matters relating to the composition of the 
Board and its committees. In particular it is 
responsible for:
 R reviewing the structure of the Board;
 R evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity 
of the Board;
 R advising the Board on any areas 
where further recruitment may 
be appropriate; and
 R succession planning for key executives 
at Board level and below.
Where necessary and appropriate, 
recruitment consultants are used to assist 
the Committee in delivering its objectives 
and responsibilities. The Committee leads 
the process for the identification and selection 
of new directors and makes recommendations 
to the Board in respect of such appointments. 
The Committee also makes recommendations 
to the Board on membership of its 
committees. The Committee terms of 
reference, can be found on the Pace 
website (www.pace.com).

Governance / Remuneration Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present to you our 2014 
Remuneration Report, my first report as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
following my appointment on 1 November 2014 
and the first report since shareholders adopted 
the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy) 
at the 2014 AGM.
Full details of the Policy are available on the 
Company’s website at www.pace.com and 
the Policy Table summarising the key aspects 
of the Policy are incorporated in pages 41 to 43 
of this Annual Report. There follows the 2014 
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 36 
to 40 giving details of remuneration earned 
in the 2014 financial year. This report will be 
subject to an advisory vote by shareholders 
at the forthcoming AGM.
In the rest of this statement, I summarise the 
Committee’s main activities during the year. 
More details can be found in the Annual 
Report on pages 36 to 40.
During 2014 the Committee has considered 
the remuneration packages of the executive 
directors and confirmed that, in its opinion, 
these remain appropriate, aligning with our 
strategy and shareholders’ interests. In performing 
this review the Committee considered the three 
key elements of the Strategic Plan; namely to 
transform core economics, maintain PayTV 
hardware leadership and widen out in software, 
networks, services and integrated solutions. 
In order to align the incentive performance 
measures with this strategy and the key 
performance indicators most relevant to Pace’s 
business, we determined that the most 
appropriate measures remained adjusted 
EBITA, EPS and cash management metrics. 
This is supported by individual objectives to 
drive the correct balance of behaviours and 
focus on the current business priorities.
No increases in directors’ salaries were awarded 
in the year, the third successive year of 0% 
increase in directors’ salaries. Our Remuneration 
Policy recognises that Pace is an international 
business with a major portion of its customers 
and employees, including the Chief Executive 
Officer, based in the USA, which is also a 
factor considered by the Committee. 
The rules of the Company’s Performance 
Share Plan (PSP) and Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan (DSB) for the 2014 award cycle provided 
for performance outcomes to be adjusted 
in circumstances of financial misstatement, 
misconduct or inaccuracies in underlying 
information or assumptions (Clawback). 
For PSP awards granted in 2014 the Committee 
chose cumulative adjusted EPS as the sole 
performance target and the baseline target 
was adjusted to take account of the Aurora 
Networks acquisition. The Committee reviewed 
the vesting of the PSP and Option awards 
granted in 2011 and concluded that no PSP 
or Option awards would vest in 2014. 
The other main work of the Committee 
centred around the resignation of Roddy Murray 
in July 2014 and the remuneration package 
to be offered to a new CFO. The remuneration 
package offered in order to attract and recruit 
the new CFO was consistent with the Policy 
and the market for FTSE 250 Finance Executives 
and subject to individual negotiation upon selection. 
As announced in November 2014 the new CFO, 
Mark Shuttleworth, joined Pace on 12 January 
2015. His remuneration is broadly similar to the 
previous CFO save that the salary has been set 
at £340,000 per annum. The Committee expects 
to award Mark Shuttleworth share awards 
under the Company’s share plans in 2015 
up to 2 times salary.
Looking ahead to 2015 and beyond, the 
Committee intends to continue to measure 
achievement of incentive performance targets 
by reference to adjusted EBITA, EPS and cash 
management metrics, supported by relevant 
individual objectives. We also intend to make 
PSP awards utilising the increased level approved 
at last year’s AGM, albeit on a selective basis 
as the Committee deems appropriate.
We believe that our remuneration framework 
and the Policy continue to result in a fair reward 
for performance and the chosen measures of 
performance provide a tangible incentive to 
deliver our core business strategy.

The Committee 
The Committee determines the Company’s 
policy on the remuneration of executive 
directors, the members of the Executive 
Committee and the wider Executive Team. 
The Committee determines their individual 
remuneration packages.
The members of the Committee in 2014 were 
Mike Inglis (appointed 13 March 2014, Chairman 
from 1 November 2014) Pat Chapman-Pincher 
(Chairman to 1 November 2014), Allan Leighton, 
John Grant, and Amanda Mesler. The composition 
of the Committee is in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Committee’s 
terms of reference are on the Company’s website.
During the year Mike Pulli and the Group Director 
of HR, Jane Johnston, were invited to attend 
meetings of the Committee to provide advice 
to enable it to take informed decisions. 
No director was present when their own 
remuneration was being discussed. Kepler 
Associates retained by the Committee, 
assisted in relation to remuneration matters. 
They provided no other services to the Company. 
Pinsent Masons LLP, legal adviser to the 
Company, has provided advice on compliance 
with the legislation and regulations. Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 37
Notes to the single total figure table – audited
 R Taxable benefits comprised of car allowance 
(plus medical insurance for Roddy Murray).
 R Mike Pulli is entitled to pension contribution/
cash allowance of 18.5% of salary. Pension in 
2013 was suspended to adjust contributions to 
reflect an overpayment of contributions in 2012.
 R Bonus for Mike Pulli was 150% of base salary 
and comprised a normal bonus award 
of $518,000 of which one third will be deferred 
into Pace shares for a period of two years; 
in addition he received an enhanced bonus 
award of $607,020 which is deferred into 
Pace shares for a period of three years subject 
to continued employment conditions. 
 R Bonus for Mike Pulli was calculated 
by reference to Group adjusted 
EBITA generated above the minimum 
target threshold of $232 million and the 
Committee’s assessment of the executive 
director’s achievement of personal objectives 
including the following: integration of the 
Aurora Networks business and achievement 
of synergies; cash and debt management; 
and launch of five new key customer products.
 R Long-term incentives receivable in year 
 R Mike Pulli – had the following long-term 
incentives receivable in the year which will 
vest in March 2015: 1,395,275 share options 
granted under the 2005 Unapproved 
Share Option Plan on 14 December 2011 
at an option price of 69.75p and 523,519 
Performance Share Plan nil-cost share 
awards made 14 March 2012 with a share 
price applicable on grant of 90.00p. The 
amounts receivable are included in the 
single figure of remuneration for 2014 since 
the performance period for these share 
awards concluded in 2014. A US Sharesave 
option granted in 2013 vested during the 
year with a share option price of 153p. 
Share options granted in April 2011 under 
the 2005 Unapproved Share Option Plan 
and PSP awards made under the 
Performance Share Plan due to vest 
in the year did not meet the minimum 
required performance targets and 
lapsed in the year.
 R Allan Leighton – the Chairman’s 
Appointment Share Award matching 
share awards made 31 May 2011 vested 
on 31 May 2014. Sufficient shares of 
162,134 were sold to pay the related tax 
liabilities on 4 June 2014 at a share price 
of 361.05. The remaining 176,676 shares 
are subject to share retention conditions 
until at least the fifth anniversary of 
appointment date (31 May 2011).
 R Non-executive directors’ fees were reviewed 
during the year with base fees increasing 
from £42,000 to £44,000 and the increment 
for chairing the Remuneration Committee and 
Audit & Risk Committee was increased from 
£8,000 to £10,000, with effect from 1 August 
2014. There was no change in fees for 
the Chairman.
 R GBP to US dollar exchange rate used to 
calculate remuneration paid in GBP, 2014: 
0.6068 (2013: 0.6397).
Statement of implementation 
of Remuneration Policy in 2015
2015: the directors’ remuneration will be in line 
with the Policy.
2015 bonus: the bonus targets for executive 
directors have been set by reference to a range 
of Group adjusted EBITA and personal 
performance outcomes above 2015 expectations 
at the start of the year. Targets for executive 
directors to earn a potential enhanced bonus 
share award have been set by reference to 
exceptional performance in all our metrics 
of cash management, Adjusted EBITA and 
personal performance target outcomes above 
current 2015 expectations at the start of the year.
2015 PSP: the performance targets for the PSP 
awards to be made to the executive directors 
will be set by reference to adjusted cumulative 
EPS growth over a three year period with minimum 
25% vesting at 6% per annum cumulative growth 
and 100% vesting above 12% per annum 
cumulative growth. Awards on this basis are 
expected to be made to executive directors 
in 2015 and will not exceed two times salary.
Clawback and performance adjustment: 
the annual bonus has for some years been 
subject to adjustment if cash management 
targets are not met. For 2014 and subsequent 
bonus, deferred bonus and PSP awards, Pace 
has now introduced additional Clawback and 
performance adjustment in circumstances 
of misconduct, restatement of accounts 
or a mistake in calculating the payout.

It is inherent in the methodology for calculating the single figure of remuneration that for a particular year it includes amounts that the executive did 
not actually receive in that year, due to deferral or due to retaining options after the date they first became exercisable. In December 201 1, Mike Pulli replaced 
Neil Gaydon as CEO. It would be misleading to show the full year’s total remuneration for each, so time pro-rating has been applied.

Statement of directors’ shareholdings and share interests – audited
The Committee operates individual shareholding target requirements for executive directors with a requirement (subject to a discretion of the Committee) 
for such executives to retain a portion of any net awards (i.e. after tax and exercise cost) of newly vested share-based incentives made after 2009 
until the target shareholding level is reached. The target shareholding is 100% of the executive’s annual salary. Up to 50% of shares earned but held 
under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan are deemed to count towards the ownership target. Each executive is required to achieve target 
ownership level within a period of five years. Mike Pulli has achieved the required minimum shareholding. 
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build up a meaningful shareholding. Allan Leighton purchased a significant individual shareholding 
on appointment. Details of the appointment share awards made to him in 2011 as a one-off exception to policy have been disclosed in these 
accounts and in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 accounts.

Base salary Set to reflect 
expected contribution 
to delivering the 
Company’s strategy. 
Salaries are set in the 
context of overall pay.
It is the intention of 
the Remuneration 
Committee to set 
base salaries at a 
competitive level after 
considering those 
paid by comparable 
companies, 
recognising the 
market value of the 
executive’s role, skill, 
responsibilities, 
performance 
and experience.
Reviewed annually with any change 
effective from 1 January.
When setting salary, the Committee 
takes into account the level of 
increase for employees more 
generally, market data, business 
performance, external economic 
factors, the complexity of the 
business and the role, cost and 
the directors’ experience 
and performance.
The Committee’s policy in relation 
to salary is:
 R up to median salary on 
appointment depending on the 
experience and background of 
the new executive director;
 R on promotion, up to the median 
salary for the new role; and
 R otherwise pay increases are 
set by reference to inflation 
and other pay rises generally 
for employees.
The policy maximum is for the 
percentage increase in executive 
directors’ salaries not to exceed 
10% in any year, but this is subject 
to an overriding discretion in 
exceptional circumstances. 
Salary levels and increases will 
be determined with reference 
to market practices and rates 
in the relevant location. 
There are no 
performance 
conditions, although 
individual performance 
is considered when 
reviewing salaries.
Benefits To provide 
reasonable market 
competitive benefits.
The Committee provides a range of 
benefits to executives in line with the 
Pace policy. These comprise a fully 
expensed car plus fuel (or an equivalent 
cash allowance), private medical 
insurance, permanent health insurance 
and life insurance, and may include 
relocation assistance and other benefits 
customarily provided in the relevant 
location where applicable.
No more generous than the 
equivalent benefits to those 
provided in 2014 but recognising 
the cash cost/value of providing 
such benefits can vary significantly 
according to the age, health and 
location of the individual.

A cash allowance is paid in lieu

director may, at their discretion, redirect 
all or part of this allowance into any 
defined contribution pension 
arrangement in their home country 
(including 401k plans in the USA).

Annual bonus To incentivise and 
reward performance 
against annual 
financial, strategic 
and operational 
goals, which are 
consistent with the 
medium to long-term 
strategic needs 
of Pace.
The award of annual bonus under the 
plan is determined following the year 
end by the Committee based on 
performance against the targets 
set at the beginning of the year and 
the Committee’s assessment of 
achievement of personal objectives.
A minimum of one-third of any bonus 
outcome is payable in Pace shares 
and all of any enhanced bonus 
award is payable in Pace shares and 
automatically deferred for a minimum 
period of two years under the Group 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Committee retains the power 
to reduce the bonus otherwise 
payable by up to 50% based on its 
assessment of the management of 
Pace’s cash position during the year. 
The Committee has reserved the 
power to seek clawback of the 
deferred element of bonuses 
in certain circumstances.
Normal maximum: 150% of salary.
Exceptional maximum: 225% 
of salary.
In line with expectations: 75% 
of salary.
Threshold: 25% of salary.
The policy is for 
corporate objectives 
to be linked to key 
drivers of value 
creation, which may 
include EBITA, EPS, 
adjusted EPS 
or other operational 
measures. In addition 
the scale of annual 
bonus will depend 
on achievement of 
individual personal 
objectives aligned 
to the objectives of 
the Group that year.
Long-term 
incentives
To incentivise 
long-term value 
creation, aligning the 
interests of executives 
and shareholders 
through the delivery of 
awards in shares. The 
selected performance 
targets support the 
long-term strategy of 
Pace and aid retention 
of executive directors.
The Committee can make annual 
share-based awards to executive 
directors under the Pace Performance 
Share Plan. These can take the form of 
nil-cost options or conditional awards.
Clawback provisions are included 
in the Plan Rules and provide the 
Committee with the power to adjust 
unvested and/or unexercised awards 
in certain circumstances.
Awards can be settled through 
market-purchased shares, treasury 
shares or new issue shares.
Normal maximum: 100% of salary.
Exceptional maximum (subject 
to shareholder approval): 200% 
of salary.
As a percentage of maximum 
opportunity, the following amounts 
are payable for the corresponding 
levels of performance as a 
percentage of the award:
Minimum: 25%
Maximum: 100%
Other points on the vesting 
schedule may be determined at 
the Committee’s discretion when 
the performance targets are set.
The policy is 
for corporate financial 
targets to be set, 
measured over a 
minimum of three 
financial years and 
linked to the key drivers 
of value creation, 
which may include 
EBITA, adjusted 
EPS or other 
operational 
measures.

Governance / Directors’ Report continued
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
continued
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the group and parent 
company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the group and 
parent company financial statements, 
the directors are required to: 
 R select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently; 
 R make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; 
 R state whether they have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the EU; and 
 R prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is inappropriate 
to presume that the group and the parent 
company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard 
the assets of the group and to prevent and 
detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
directors are also responsible for preparing a 
Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and 
those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance 
and integrity of the corporate and financial 
information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the 
directors in respect of the annual 
financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 R the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 R the strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the issuer 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together 
with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
Each of the persons who is a director as 
at the date of this report confirms that:
 R So far as the director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s auditors are unaware; and
 R The director has taken all the steps that he 
or she ought to have taken as a director in 
order to make himself/herself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
We consider the annual report and accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s position and performance, business 
model and strategy.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Pace Plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 50 to 88. In our opinion: 
 R the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 
and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 R the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 R the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied 
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
 R the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were as follows:
Revenue recognition ($2,620.0m)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee Report), page 60 (accounting policy) and pages 64 to 65 (financial disclosures).
 R The risk – On occasion, the Group contracts to sell hardware, software and services within a single arrangement. Accounting for these 
arrangements can be complex as the total contract value is allocated to each identified component on a relative fair value basis and recognised 
as revenue as the related goods or services are delivered. The identification of components and the allocation and recognition of revenue 
relating to components is a key area of judgement for our audit.
 R Our response – Our audit procedures included, testing authorisation controls relating to the identification and approval of significant contracts, 
the identification of components within those contracts, the allocation of revenue to components and the recognition of revenue for those components. 
We read significant new contracts entered into during the year to understand the contractual terms and to make our own assessment of the 
components identified by the Group. We assessed allocation of revenue for significant new contracts, on a relative fair value basis, to identified 
components of contracts through corroboration of contractual milestones, agreement, on a sample basis, of costs incurred to date and analysis 
of revenue and margins. As part of our assessment of amounts recognised as revenue in the period we recalculated the deferred revenue 
balance at the balance sheet date. 
Royalty under negotiation provisions ($49.9m)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee Report), page 62 (accounting policy) and page 80 (financial disclosures).
 R The risk – The Group’s products incorporate third party technology. Due to the complexity of intellectual property rights arrangements the 
Group is exposed to the risk of infringement of third party rights. Potential claims can be submitted many years after a product has been 
deployed and extensive negotiation is commonplace. Determining whether to recognise a provision, and the amount of the provision to be 
recognised, requires the Group to make judgements and estimates that are inherently subjective.
 R Our response – Having discussed the significant claims with the Group’s in-house patent expert and legal team, our audit procedures included 
considering the extent to which the Directors’ estimates take into account a balanced assessment of the latest available information on the ongoing 
claims at the balance sheet date, and the accuracy and reliability of the sources of that information. For the most significant claims, we also make 
enquiries of the Group’s external legal advisors. We read correspondence between the Group and individual claimants. We read information 
published by claimants, such as press releases, highlighting their successes against other parties, as part of our assessment of the strength of 
the claimant’s case. We considered the Group’s historical experience in assessing the level of provision required by comparing actual outcomes 
from previous claims to provisions made. We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of royalty provisions.
Capitalised development costs ($85.0m)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee Report), page 59 (accounting policy) and pages 69 and 70 (financial disclosures).
 R The risk – The Group conducts a significant level of development activity. The Group has to apply judgement in identifying projects meeting the 
criteria for capitalisation under the requirements of accounting standards and to capture accurate time and costs information for those projects. 
There is a risk that capitalisation occurs on projects that do not meet the criteria, that incorrect amounts are allocated to projects or that projects 
are not as successful as initially anticipated leading to overcapitalisation and the need for impairment.
 R Our response – Our audit procedures included testing controls over the authorisation of new development projects and the monthly monitoring 
of ongoing development projects. We agreed costs assigned to a sample of larger value projects to time recorded or to invoices and considered 
the reasonableness of labour rates used. As part of our assessment of the benefits expected to be generated for the Group from these projects, 
which is a key factor in determining whether capitalisation is appropriate, we considered the Group’s project margin forecasts. We assessed the 
appropriateness of key inputs, such as the value and timing of sales by reference to our knowledge of the Group’s business, our experience of 
the industry, and consideration of publicly available information, such as press releases. We have also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of development costs.

2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement continued
Business combinations (goodwill additions of $141.7m, other intangible additions of $138.0m)
Refer to page 33 (Audit Committee Report), page 58 (accounting policy) and page 88 (financial disclosures).
 R The risk – The Group acquired Aurora Networks during the current financial year. The acquired intangible assets of technology and customer 
relationships are valued using discounted cash flows methods. In applying the methodologies, the Group makes a number of key assumptions 
and estimates relating to each class of intangible asset, including; growth and attrition rates, discount rates and product life cycles. The identification 
and valuation of acquired intangibles requires judgement and is sensitive to the assumptions used.
 Amounts not allocated to acquired assets, including acquired intangible assets, are allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is not amortised and affects 
the income statement only on a future impairment. We considered the estimation of the fair value of Aurora Networks’ inventories to be a significant 
audit risk, due to the inherent judgement involved in estimating the fair value, their materiality and ageing. 
 R Our response – Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to, an assessment of the competency of the external experts used by 
the Group to value significant acquired intangibles. We used our own valuation specialists to challenge and corroborate using our experience, 
market data and information from similar transactions, the process for identifying intangible assets and to consider the methodology and 
assumptions used to determine the present value of cash-flow projections. 
With respect to the valuation of inventories, we critically assessed the methodology used by the Group to calculate the fair value adjustment. 
Our testing included: physical stock-take attendances, recalculation of ageing reports and sample testing of inventories to post acquisition date 
sales invoices.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at $10.5m, determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before 
taxation of $175.7m, of which it represents 6%.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding $0.5m in addition to other identified 
misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
Of the Group’s 26 reporting components, we subjected 6 to audits for group reporting purposes. The components within the scope of our work 
accounted for the following percentages of the Group’s results:
Number of components Group revenue (%) Group profit before tax (%) Group total assets (%)
Audits for group reporting purposes 6 94 96 97
Remaining components 20 6 4 3
Total 26 100 100 100
The remaining components, none of which individually represented more than 2% of Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets, were 
subject to analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from $4.0m to $10.0m having regard 
to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components. The work on 4 of the 6 was performed by component auditors, and the rest 
by the Group audit team. The Group audit team visited 2 component locations in the UK and the USA, including to assess the audit risk and strategy. 
Physical meetings, video conferences or conference calls were also held with all component auditors that were not physically visited. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group audit team 
was then performed by the component auditor.

In our opinion: 
 R the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
 R the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements; and 
 R information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 28 to 30 with respect to internal control and risk management 
systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements. 
5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 R we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they consider 
that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 R the Audit and Risk Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 R adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
 R the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
 R certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 R we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or 
 R a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:

We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on pages 45 and 46, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements

1 Basis of preparation and business environment
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements:
Basis of preparation
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention 
as modified by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Group’s Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the 
European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Company’s Financial Statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted 
by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company. The result of the Company for the year is shown 
in Note 25.
Financial year end
The current year’s Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2014 and the previous year’s Financial Statements are for the year 
ended 31 December 2013.
Going concern
The Group has borrowing facilities in place until January 2019. At 31 December 2014 these are in the form of a $310 million term loan, which 
is subject to repayment through instalments every six months plus a final payment, and a $150 million revolving credit facility. These facilities 
are subject to financial performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Group has prepared a financial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short-term and medium-term plans. 
The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management and revenue reduction, and has 
concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have adequate working capital available to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation
The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings (Note 13) drawn up to 31 December 2014. 
Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power to affect those returns. 
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation. Investments 
in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the Financial Statements of the Company.
Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars which is the Company’s 
functional and presentational currency.
The US Dollar/Pound Sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2014 was 1.56 (2013: 1.64).
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty
The Group’s main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 57 to 63. Judgements and 
assumptions have been required by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies in many areas. Actual results may differ from the estimates 
calculated using these judgements and assumptions. Key areas of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows:
Warranty provisions
Pace provides product warranties for its products. Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility 
of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before field deployment data is available, these 
estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the field.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting 
of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis 
and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.

1 Basis of preparation and business environment continued
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty continued
Royalty provisions
Pace’s products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence. Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing third party 
intellectual property rights. Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed. Any such claims are always 
vigorously defended.
Provisions for royalty claims are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle 
a claim that has resulted from the sale of a product allegedly using technology of a patent owner, and the amount of the outflow can be reliably measured. 
The directors have made provision for the potential royalty payable based on the latest information available, which represents the best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should 
mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts 
provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are finally settled.
Impairment reviews
As is required by International Accounting Standards, the Group carries out impairment reviews of its non-financial assets on an annual basis, 
or when indicators of impairment exist. Such reviews involve assessing the value in use of an asset or cash-generating unit (CGU) by reference 
to its estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value. The judgements in relation to impairment reviews relate to the assumptions 
applied in calculating the value in use, and the future performance expectations. 
Intangible assets – Capitalised Development Costs
The Group business includes a significant element of research and development activity. Under accounting standards, principally IAS 38 
‘Intangible Assets’, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benefits from projects 
deemed to be commercially viable. The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management of the forecasted economic 
benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with the selection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life 
of the associated revenues from the product.
Acquisition Accounting
As part of the accounting for business combinations it is necessary to perform a purchase price allocation exercise to identify appropriate 
categories of intangible assets that have been purchased. Such an exercise involves judgement with regard to the types of assets identified, the 
value of those assets and the useful economic lives applied with regard to amortisation rates. The amounts recognised are calculated by reference 
to management forecasts and assumed discount rates, obsolescence curves and attrition rates. 
For significant acquisitions, whilst the Directors use appropriate qualified independent valuation advisors to assist in the purchase price allocation 
work, the exercise inherently requires significant judgement and estimation to be taken. 
2 Accounting policies
Business combinations
Subsidiaries are entities that the Company has power over, exposure or rights to variable returns and an ability to use its power to affect those 
returns. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date 
and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in 
the acquiree, less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the 
acquisition date. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners 
of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and 
share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination. If a business combination results in the 
termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the 
agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from 
a past event and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. Transaction costs 
that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional 
and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

2 Accounting policies continued
Goodwill continued
Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill 
is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, 
that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 (date of transition to Adopted IFRS) 
has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually. The Group performs its annual impairment review 
at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset categories 
as follows:
Customer contracts and relationships three to ten years
Technology and patents  one to ten years
Other    three years
Research and development expenditure
All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred. Where a product is technically feasible, production and sales are 
intended, a market exists and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from commercial launch. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost 
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised 
as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between six and thirty months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Company’s distributable profits 
as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the income statement within the Administrative expenses category.
Impairment charges
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill, 
and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated 
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated 
so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Group’s corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are utilised by more than one CGU. Corporate assets are allocated to 
CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated. 
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro-rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

2 Accounting policies continued
Exceptional items
Items that are significant by virtue of their size or nature and that are considered non-recurring are classified as exceptional operating items. 
Such items which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructuring and profits and losses made on 
the disposal of properties, are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category, albeit analysed as a separate line within 
that category, and are highlighted separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements. Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit 
measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive of value added 
tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the customer and 
substantially all of the Group’s work is completed, which is usually upon delivery to the customer or his/her agent. The Group does not recognise 
revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be 
measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is inherently judgemental.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over the period over 
which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken and any future obligations remaining.
Finance income and finance costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, 
using the effective interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses recognised on financial assets. 
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss 
using the effective interest method. Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Government grants
Grants in respect of specific research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement 
or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the project’s related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity 
dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Allowance for doubtful debts
Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant. Where necessary, 
provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement. 
Inventory
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate transport and 
handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale. Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.

Property, plant and equipment
The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, the cost of 
property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The principal 
economic lives used for this purpose are:
Long leasehold properties Period of lease
Short leasehold properties Period of lease
Plant and machinery One to ten years
Motor vehicles  Four years
Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed to have occurred.
Leased assets
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Assets held 
under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives. The interest 
element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over 
the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the 
date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional 
currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the 
functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s 
presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated 
at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences 
arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of such that 
control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks 
arising from operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes. The directors have determined that the instruments qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows that are either 
attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness. Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows 
of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the movement in fair value of the 
derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income/costs. If a hedge 
of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains or losses that were 
recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement when the transaction occurs.

Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision 
for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Taxes
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled. 
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future from which 
the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments
The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding 
increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the 
amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions 
at the vesting date. For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured 
to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense 
with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured 
at each reporting date and at settlement date. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expenses in profit or loss.
Employee share ownership plans
The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benefits Trust are treated as being those of the Company. Until such 
time as the Company’s own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at equity.
Employee benefits
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. The Group 
has no defined benefit arrangements in place.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable
Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders’ equity. A liability is recorded for a final dividend 
when the dividend is approved by the Company’s shareholders and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
(a) Royalty provision
Provisions for royalty claims are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle 
a claim that has resulted from the sale of a product allegedly using technology of a patent owner, and the amount of the outflow can be reliably 
measured. The directors have made provision for the potential royalty payable based on the latest information available, which represents the best 
estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation.

Provisions continued
(b) Warranty provision
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold. The provision is based on historical warranty data 
and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product 
by product basis and provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
(c) Restructuring
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been announced publicly. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
(d) Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable 
cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
Contingent Liabilities
A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence 
of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in where there is a liability that cannot be recognised 
because it cannot be measured reliably. The Group does not recognise a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the financial statements.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group

3 Segmental analysis
In accordance with IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) has been identified as the Board of Directors which 
reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance of the business and make decisions.
The Group determines operating segments on the basis of SBU areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.
During the period the Group created a new SBU named Pace Networks, which contains the Aurora Networks Inc business acquired in 2014. 
In addition, certain other activities were restructured and split out across the Pace International and Pace Americas SBUs.
The Group has the following operating segments which are also reportable segments for the purpose of IFRS 8:
 R Pace Americas;
 R Pace International; and
 R Pace Networks.
Other amounts include unallocated central costs that are not classified as reportable segments under IFRS 8.
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is reviewed by the CODM. 
Adjusted EBITA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain 
segments, relative to other entities that operate within these industries. 
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. There are no 
material inter-segment transactions.
The tables below present the segmental information on the revised basis, with prior periods amended to conform to the current period presentation.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share 45.6c 29.8c
Adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share 63.6c 44.3c
Adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share 61.2c 42.2c
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on a profit after tax of $148.0 million (2013: $96.7 million) divided by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue of 312,334,970 (2013: 309,740,316), excluding shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.

Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year 324,474,857 325,036,838
Diluted earnings per ordinary share varies from basic earnings per ordinary share due to the effect of the notional exercise of outstanding share options. 
The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year is calculated using the treasury stock method which accounts for the 
fact that not all options are wholly dilutive. Further details of the outstanding share options held at the end of the year can be found in Note 27 .
To better reflect underlying performance, adjusted earnings per share is also calculated (adjusting profit after tax to remove amortisation of other 
intangibles and exceptional items, post-tax). The earnings amount is calculated as follows:
2014 2013
$m $m
Profit after tax 148.0 96.7

Tax effect of above (1.2) (3.2)
Adjusted profit after tax 198.6 137.2
The Group’s effective tax rate of 15.8% (2013: 26.1%) has been used to calculate the tax effect of adjusted items.

Goodwill
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations and relates to the following acquisitions:
 R XCom Multimedia Communications SA (now Pace Europe SAS) in February 2001;
 R the STB and connectivity solutions business of Royal Philips Electronics (Pace France) in April 2008;
 R Bewan Systems SA (Bewan) in April 2010;
 R 2Wire, Inc. (2Wire) in October 2010;
 R Latens Systems Limited (Latens) in November 2010; and 
 R Aurora Networks, Inc. in January 2014.
Financial statements Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 70
11 Intangible assets continued
Goodwill continued
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across Strategic Business Units, which are groups of cash-generating units (CGUs) as follows:
 R $138.7 million within Pace International (2013: $153.1 million); 
 R $190.7 million within Pace Americas (2013: $189.5 million); and
 R $141.7 million within Pace Networks (2013: n/a).
These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is 
monitored for management purposes. The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill 
might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections based on the following 
year’s budget and the Group’s three year plan. These forecasts have been approved by the Board, and have an appropriate long-term growth rate 
of 1% (2013: 1%) applied to them.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based discount 
rate. The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 10.4% (2013: 13.4%).
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes to selling prices 
and direct costs. Sales growth, selling prices and direct costs are built up within the budget and three year plan on a product by product basis 
utilising the knowledge and expertise of operational staff. The anticipated launch dates for new products, the achievable prices and direct costs 
to be incurred are therefore highly judgemental. The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments 
of the time value of money for the Group.
The directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered the following reasonable changes in the assumptions:
 R movements in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%; and
 R reductions in cash flows of up to $10 million per annum.
The directors consider that there is sufficient headroom within the value in use calculations at 31 December 2014.

probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised.
The UK Finance Bill 2013, which includes the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015, 
was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. As a result, UK deferred tax has been calculated on the rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

18 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
The Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost. For more information about the Group’s exposure to interest 
rate, foreign currency and liquidity risk, see note 19. 
The Company has a facility underwritten by HSBC, RBS and JP Morgan incorporating Lloyds, Santander, Wells Fargo, Silicon Valley Bank 
and CIC & Fifth Third in a syndicated deal.
The main facilities at 31 December 2014, which are all denominated in US Dollars, consist of a $310 million term loan facility together 
with a $150 million revolving credit facility.
The facilities have a termination date of 6 January 2019. Amortisation of the original $310 million term loan commenced on 6 January 2014 and two 
$15.5 million repayments were made during the year. Further repayments are to be made every six months until 6 January 2019, when a final bullet 
repayment of $77.5 million is due to be made. 
Interest is payable on the facilities at LIBOR plus a specified margin. The margin is subject to a ratchet linked to overall leverage conditions of the Group.
Facility arrangement and associated fees of $5.4 million were capitalised and are being amortised over the life of the facilities and included within 
the overall interest costs.
There are certain financial covenants with regard to the facilities. These are principally linked to interest cover and net leverage.
In addition to the main facilities, a Bi-lateral Bonding Facility with RBS was also entered into and covers bank guarantees, principally in respect 
of Duty and Deferment requirements for $7.7 million (2013: $9.0 million).

(c) Gains and losses on currency derivatives
The majority of the Group’s production costs are denominated in US Dollars. The Group endeavours to obtain as much of its income as possible 
in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to hedge forward progressively against movements in the value of foreign currencies, in respect of cash 
receipts and payments expected from transactions over the next twelve months.

The Group’s derivatives contracts qualify for hedge accounting and have a fair value at the balance sheet date of $4.4 million (2013: $0.5 million).
(d) Credit risk
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration 
of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets. 
There were no significant impairments in the periods under review.
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:
2014 2013
Carrying amount $m $m
Trade receivables 843.2 422.7
Cash and cash equivalents 182.1 33.0

Euro-zone countries 15.8 9.7
United States 530.2 227.7
Other regions 101.9 63.4
843.2 422.7
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings. At each balance sheet date there was no significant 
concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Group’s total revenues, as explained in Note 3.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2014, 91% were within terms (2013: 92%). Of the balance 5% were less than 30 days past due, with the 
remaining amounts over 30 days due (2013: 5% less than 30 days past due). There were no material bad debt provisions deemed necessary 
against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
(e) Liquidity risk
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash 
flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements:

It is not expected that the cash flows included in the maturity analysis could occur significantly earlier, or at significantly different amounts.
The Directors have considered the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur, 
together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
(f) Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Group’s earnings. The directors 
consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve month period would have a $2.6 million impact on cash flows (2013: $Nil). 
The Group’s key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling. A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against these would have 
an adverse impact of $Nil (2013: $1.0 million) on the profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2014 and an adverse impact of $0.6m 
(2013: $5.8 million) on equity.

(g) Capital management
Capital risk management
The Group and Company manage their capital, being the net assets base, to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain 
an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises equity attributable to equity 
holders of Pace plc, consisting of issued ordinary share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 21, 22 and 24 and cash 
and cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in Note 18.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders (through the progressive 
dividend policy introduced in 2009), issue of new shares and buy-back of existing shares and issuing new borrowings or repaying existing borrowings.
Note 21 to the Financial Statements provide details regarding the Company’s share capital and movements in the period. There were no breaches 
of any requirements with regard to any relevant conditions imposed by either the UKLA or the Company’s Articles of Association during the periods 
under review.
Details of the Company’s facilities are given in Note 18. The facilities have been subject to certain financial performance covenants. There have 
been no breaches of these covenants in the period under review.

20 Provisions continued
Royalties under negotiation
Provisions for royalty claims are recognised when it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle 
a claim that has resulted from the sale of a product allegedly using technology of a patent owner, and the amount of the outflow can be reliably measured. 
The directors have made provision for the potential royalty payable based on the latest information available, which represents the best estimate of 
the expenditure required to settle the present obligation. Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should 
mitigate the amounts being sought. The Group will vigorously negotiate or defend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided 
may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are finally settled.
Other provisions
Other provisions mainly relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within the Group, along with professional fees to be incurred 
in relation to the Aurora acquisition and certain other provisions.
Warranty provisions
Pace provides warranties for its products from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold. 
The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost of repair information and a weighting of all 
possible outcomes against their associated probabilities. The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and 
provisions are adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must 
be calculated at the outset of product shipment before field deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the 
product in the field.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.

The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the Company may refuse to transfer shares in the following customary circumstances: where 
the share is not a fully paid share; where the Company has a lien; where the share transfer has not been duly stamped with the correct amount of stamp 
duty; where the transfer is in favour of more than four joint transferees; where the share is a certified share and is not accompanied by the relevant 
share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Board of Directors may reasonably require to prove the title of the transferor; or where the 
instrument of transfer is in respect of more than one class of share. These restrictions are in addition to any which are applicable to all UK listed 
companies imposed by law or regulation.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting specifies deadlines for exercising voting rights and appointing a proxy or proxies to vote in relation to resolutions 
to be passed at the Annual General Meeting. All proxy votes are counted and numbers for, against or withheld in relation to each resolution are announced

At the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 April 2015, shareholders will be asked to renew the directors’ power to allot shares and buy back 
shares in the Company and to renew the disapplication of pre-emption rights. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or on voting rights.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of controls following 
a takeover bid other than in relation to: (i) employee share plans; and (ii) the Company’s borrowings, which would become repayable on a takeover 
being completed.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide that: (i) all directors must stand for election at the first Annual General Meeting after having been appointed 
to the Board; and (ii) at each Annual General Meeting, one-third of the directors who are subject to retirement by rotation must retire from office and 
may seek re-election. The Articles set out the procedure for determining the identity of the directors to retire at a particular Annual General Meeting.
Shares in the Company are held in the Pace plc Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust) for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Company’s 
employees’ share plans. The Trustees of the Trust may exercise the voting rights attaching to shares held in the Trust in respect of which the beneficial 
interest has not vested in any beneficiary provided that they are satisfied that to do so is in the beneficiaries’ interests. The Trustees have waived 
their right to vote in respect of any such shares held above 5%.
Own shares held
At 31 December 2014, the Pace plc Employee Benefit Trust held 2,229,868 (2013: 2,692,189) shares in the Company which cost $8.9 million

Total dilutive share awards differs from the dilutive weighted average number of shares in issue because although all of the performance share awards 
are dilutive, only a proportion of the share options are dilutive based on their respective exercise price and the average share price for the period.
The following tables reconcile the number of share awards outstanding and the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) for all share plans.

On 6 January 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Aurora Networks Inc, a group of companies leading the development and 
manufacture of advanced, next-generation Optical Transport and Access Network solutions for broadband networks that support the convergence 
of video, data and voice applications, for a cash consideration of $323.5 million. Prior to the acquisition the Group had no interest in the acquiree, 
and an explanation of the rationale for the acquisition is set out in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
In the period from the acquisition date to 31 December 2014, Aurora Networks Inc contributed revenue of $264.6 million and adjusted EBITA 
of $47.4 million. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014, the consolidated results would not be materially different.

Inventories of $62.9 million at 6 January 2014 have been reduced by $20.0 million as a fair value adjustment was made within the measurement 
period, to write down inventories to their recoverable amount.
33 Contingencies
Currently there are claims against the Group in which it is asserted that certain of the Group’s products infringe third party patents. Claims for which 
a probable cash outflow has been determined have been provided based on the Directors’ best estimate (note 20). Within the claims portfolio, 
there are claims for which it is believed that the probability of a cash outflow is remote. The Directors believe that a cash outflow in relation to the 
remaining claims is more than remote but not probable. This element of the portfolio includes claims where the counter-party has not submitted a 
monetary claim for damages, claims that have only recently been received and claims that have not provided the Group with sufficient information 
to determine if Pace products are involved. As a result, it is not yet possible to reliably estimate the financial impact on the Group. Any claim received 
by the Group is subject to thorough scrutiny. The Group will vigorously negotiate and defend any claims involving Pace products and, based on its 
experience, the amounts at which such claims are ultimately settled is unlikely to be material.

Multiple accounts on the shareholder register 
If you have received two or more copies of this document, this could mean that there is more than one account in your name on the shareholder 
register. This may be caused by either your name or address appearing on each account in a slightly different way. If you would like any multiple 
accounts combined into one account, please contact Capita Asset Services.

The Company is obliged by law to make its share register available upon request to the public and to other organisations, which may use it as a mailing list, 
resulting in shareholders receiving unsolicited mail. Shareholders wishing to limit the receipt of such mail should write to the Mailing Preference Service,

Market Overview
Increased digital media consumption
Increased broadband penetration leading to increased digital 
media consumption and internet powered business models
The number of internet users continues to rise, in terms of 
both broadband penetration and those that have access to the 
medium in public places. There are currently 2.5 billion global 
internet users (Source: ITU). In key markets like China and 
Russia, penetration remains below 50%; in the likes of India and 
Indonesia, wired broadband penetration is under 10%. Even in 
markets like the US, there is room to grow with fixed broadband 
penetration at only 77%, and several million users remain on 
dial-up connections.
Broadband prices are also either generally flat – in developed 
markets – or declining – in developing markets. Hence increased 
take up of home broadband is forecast in most markets, 
encouraging further online interaction.
The amount of time that people spend using the web 
continues to rise, even in developed markets. Social media 
sites, in particular, have proved enormously popular and have 
increased the amount of time that users spend on the internet. 
The range of devices via which users can access the web, 
including tablets and mobiles, is also increasing the amount of 
time people spend online, and its relevance in people’s lives.
After years of home broadband being the most popular way to 
access the internet, access via mobile broadband, most often 
via mobile phones rather than PCs and laptops, has come to 
dominate. Penetration of mobile-internet services will reach 
54% by year end 2017 compared with 51% for fixed broadband.

Proliferation of smart connected devices providing enhanced 
user experience and a significant connected TV and 
mobile opportunity
IHS Screen Digest predicts that there will be more active 
connected living-room devices than TV households in the 
Western world by 2016. Smart connected devices shipped 
worldwide are forecast to increase from c.1.5 billion in 2013 to 
c.2.4 billion in 2017 with growing penetration of smartphones 
(1.5 billion global smartphone subscribers growing at 30% in 
2013) and connected devices across the world. The number 
of smartphone shipments is expected to reach 1.7 billion in 
2017 from 0.5 billion in 2011. Tablet devices are seeing a more 
rapid growth than smartphones with three times more iPad 
shipments than iPhones in the first three years after launch.
Consumers’ attention is more divided than ever as media 
multitasking becomes the norm. The amount of time spent 
with mobile is growing at 14 times the rate of desktop web, with 
smart-device users spending 19% of their time on mobile web 
and 81% of their time on mobile apps (based on US smartphone 
users; Source: Nielsen).

Increasing consumption of sport  
through digital media
The Group works with KantarSport and TV Sports Markets to 
publish an annual survey of how sports fans are consuming 
sports content. The report covers a wide range of media (TV, 
print, radio, online, social), a wide range of devices (televisions, 
connected TVs, mobiles, tablets, PCs) and a wide range of 
content formats (video, data, editorial, news). The report covers 
14 global markets – United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, 
Italy, USA, Brazil, China, Australia, Russia, India, Indonesia, Japan 
and Turkey – in which there are over 990 million sports fans.
The report found that the proportion of sports fans consuming 
sport ranges from 65% of the adult population in France to 
97% of the urban internet connected adult population in China. 
Fans in Europe and the USA spend, on average, between five 
to nine hours per week consuming sport. This increases to over 
11 hours per week in Brazil and Indonesia, 14-15 hours per week 
in China and Turkey and 19+ hours per week in India. Although 
TV continues to be the dominant media for following sport, 
consuming sport online is the second most popular method 
fans use to follow sport. There has been an expansion in the use 
of social media platforms both for fans following and by sports 
properties engaging with their fans.
There has been a continued growth in the tendency to watch 
and read online and a more significant uplift in following sport 
via a mobile device. In Germany, France, Italy, Japan and 
Australia upwards of 1 in 2 fans consume sport online, whilst 
in Spain, USA, UK and Russia this increases to 2 out of 3 fans 
and in Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Turkey 8 out of 10 fans 
consume sport online. Reading articles online via a PC is the 
most common online activity in all markets except China and 
India, which have a high proportion of fans watching online 
sports coverage.
The number of consumers accessing TV via internet connected 
TVs and set top boxes has increased year-on-year across 
all markets with the greatest growth in users coming from 
Germany and Spain. In all markets, there has been an increase in 
the proportion of sports fans using mobile devices to consume 
sport. In Russia, mobile devices are now used by 49% of fans to 
consume sport compared to 26%, 12 months ago and in Spain, 
mobile consumption has increased to 39% from 28% in 2012.

10 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Online, mobile and video advertising  
spend following consumer eyeballs
Online, mobile and video advertising spend following 
consumer eyeballs and driving internet advertising as the 
fastest growing advertising category
On a global level, internet advertising continues to defy the 
wider economic circumstances, growing in terms of both 
volume, and its share of the global ad pie. Internet advertising 
exceeded US$100 billion for the first time in 2012, representing 
year-on-year growth of 16.4%, and a share of the global ad 
market of 20%. Internet advertising is projected to be the fastest 
growing advertising category, growing to US$185 billion in 2017, 
a CAGR of 13% over the five-year period 2013-17.
Online is becoming a more dominant format of advertising and 
is now the second highest advertising revenue generator behind 
television. Online is expected to increase its share of the total 
advertising market from 20% in 2012 to 29% in 2017, just short  
of television’s share of 33%. 
Display advertising continues to expand with the declining cost 
of display advertising turning it into an extremely cost efficient 
way to build mass and reach quickly. New and more creative 
brand-oriented formats, new forms of targeting, and new forms 
of buying and trading display advertising, will continue to drive 
the medium forward.
Video advertising and mobile advertising will start to play 
a significant role in the online ad market by the end of 2017, 
with an overall CAGR of 25.8% and 27.0% respectively. Video 
brings some of the branding advantages that TV has enjoyed 
to IP devices, particularly as more and more premium content 
providers start to offer ad-funded content online. Its share of 
the total market will increase from 4% in 2012 to 7% in 2017 with 
North America and developed Western European markets 
driving the early adoption. Mobile devices are starting to 
become the primary rather than secondary way to reach the 
internet, which opens up new opportunities for advertisers such 
as in-app and location-based advertising. Mobile advertising 
revenues will exceed classified revenues in 2015 and will 
represent 15% of the online market in 2017.

In-play betting continues to be  
a key focus area
In-play betting continues to be a key focus area of a number 
of major multi-territory and local online betting platforms
Live in-play sports betting continues to be a high growth 
segment with a wide range of betting players now offering and 
augmenting their live in-play services. In-play betting represents 
the fastest growing part of sports betting, contributes a majority 
of online sportsbook (non-horse racing) turnover and the major 
driver of growth for the big online players (e.g. bet365, Unibet, 
Sportingbet etc.). Also, streamed events make up an increasing 
proportion of in-play events for all sportsbooks.
Sportsbooks have found in-play products to drive customer 
loyalty, improved engagement, longer time spent on their 
websites and increased frequency of bets. The combination of 
these factors has resulted in increasing sports yield per active 
user across Europe and emerging markets and continues to 
increase as sportsbooks add more in-play events, e.g. Betfair’s 
In-play markets per Premier League match doubled to c.130 
between March and June 2013 (Source: Betfair 2013 results).

Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 11
Strategic  
Report
Corporate  
Governance
Financial 
Statements It is a pleasure to introduce Perform’s third Annual 
Report as a public company. It has been another 
busy year for the Group and these results reflect its 
good, international revenue growth and a number 
of material acquisitions.
The results also reflect the challenges for 2014 with margin 
improvement, more effective integration of acquisitions and 
better management information systems all critical to ensure 
the long-term success of the Group.
2013 was a busy year for the Group with year-on-year 
revenue growth of 37% to £208.1 million (2012: £151.6 million) 
and the Group achieved profit after tax of £4.6 million 
(2012: £13.5 million). The 3% decline in Adjusted EBITDA to 
£36.4 million (2012: £37 .5 million) and the marginal decline 
in adjusted basic earnings per share to 10.4p (2012: 11.2p) 
were disappointing and reflected the weaker than expected 
performance in the second half of the year in Content 
Distribution, T echnology and Production and Display 
Advertising and Sponsorship. In addition, the pace of the 
Group’s recent growth has led to a substantial increase in 
the Group’s cost base. As a result we have undertaken a 
full review of our cost base and plans are now underway to 
address these challenges. In particular, restructuring plans are 
now being implemented, we are accelerating the integration 
of Opta and the roll-out of a new revenue and booking 
system has commenced.
These disappointments over-shadowed the growth of, and 
the increasing diversification and internationalisation of, the 
business and a number of important acquisitions, including 
the sports data business Opta and the establishment of the 
US venture Perform Sporting News Ltd.
The growth of the Advertising and Sponsorship revenue 
streams, both video and display, has been impressive with 
revenues growing 51% year-on-year and these revenues now 
comprise 23% of the Group’s total revenues compared to 
21% in 2012. In many cases this growth came through the 
establishment of in-house advertising sales teams in markets 
including the US, Canada, Spain, Nigeria and the Netherlands.
Particular highlights during the year include:
• the start of the process to renew the Watch&Bet service  
for the period 2014 to 2016;
• the addition to the Watch&Bet service of National 
Basketball Association content and the return of over 
2,000 events including Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1  
as part of a new deal with the sports agency MP & Silva;
• the international growth of the ePlayer, with the product 
now live in 26 territories and delivering over five billion 
streams across the year with a headline sell-through-rate 
of 48%;
• the re-brand and re-launch of all 37 editions of Goal; and 
• the successful share placing and resulting acquisition 
of Opta.
In January 2014, David Surtees, who had acted as Chief 
Financial Officer for the Group since 2008, stood down. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank David for his 
significant contribution over the last six years. David joined 
shortly after the formation of the Group and has helped to 
grow and build the business. We wish him well for the future. 
The search to find his successor is underway and we will 
make an announcement in due course.
As a Chairman and as a Board we view governance as 
particularly important. The Board meets regularly to discuss 
strategy and holds the Executive team accountable for its 
execution whilst ensuring that the entrepreneurial culture that 
has seen the Group grow so successfully over the last few 
years is maintained wherever possible.
Looking ahead, our priorities for 2014 are clear:
• selective acquisitions where complementary to the growth 
strategy and where integration and synergies can be 
achieved efficiently;
• continue to execute the Group’s organic growth strategy;
• improve margin through more effective management of 
the cost base;
• improve integration of acquisitions and deliver related  
cost savings more quickly;
• improve management information systems; and
• invest in new platforms and in new editorial content to 
grow the Group’s audiences, in particular across Goal in  
the run up to and during the FIFA 2014 World Cup Finals.
Finally, on behalf of the Group’s Board, I wish to express 
my sincere thanks again to all the Group’s employees for 
their commitment and support throughout another very

Strategic  
Report
Corporate  
Governance
Financial 
Statements The Group has made good progress over the last 
year and continues to execute its growth strategy.
The Group has reported substantial increases in revenues 
and has continued to expand its rights portfolio, distribution 
clients, unique users, video streams and subscriber numbers. 
These results highlight the good operational and revenue 
growth the Group has delivered this year, even with the 
weaker than anticipated performance in the second half of 
the year.
The Group supplemented its strong organic revenue growth 
with two important acquisitions. 
In March the Group acquired the digital assets of American 
City Business Journals Inc.’s (“ACBJ”) consumer web division 
Sporting News including Sportingnews.com. The Group 
established a new subsidiary, Perform Sporting News Ltd, 
and contributed its US and Canadian consumer businesses 
including the local versions of ePlayer and Goal. The new 
subsidiary is 65% owned by the Group and 35% by ACBJ. 
The Group is entitled to buy out ACBJ’s equity for a pre-
determined fixed cash price at any time and also has an 
annual option each April from 2017 to acquire the equity 
based on a multiple of prior year EBITDA calculation subject 
to a minimum and maximum value and satisfied by the issue 
of new shares at the Group’s discretion.
The deal enhanced the Group’s direct to consumer scale 
and presence in the US and Canada and it has become a 
top seven digital sports media player in the world’s largest 
sports media market. It combines video, display and mobile 
advertising inventory to allow a complete product offering 
to be sold to advertising and sponsorship partners and has 
a sales team which covers every key media market in the US 
and Canada.
In July the Group acquired Opta, a leading provider of rich 
sports data to the media sector, sports clubs, leagues and 
federations, for cash consideration of £40 million together 
with a management incentive scheme of up to £7 million 
linked to the delivery of the business’s EBITDA for the year 
to 30 June 2014. The acquisition was funded through the 
issuance of 23.9 million new ordinary shares which raised total 
net proceeds of £112.6 million.
Opta complements the Group’s existing content distribution 
business by catering to the significant opportunity of rich 
data within the wider media sector and allows the Group 
to exploit the significant consumer opportunity of rich data 
through its own products such as Goal. It also strengthened 
the Group’s presence in key European media markets.
Although the Group will continue to seek a small number 
of complementary acquisitions, the focus in 2014 will be 
to ensure the effective integration of the acquisitions the 
Group has made over the past three years. In many instances 
acquisitions are still operating on their own platforms and are 
relatively autonomous from other areas of the business, which 
has led to duplication and inefficiency. Our aim is to make 
sure the majority of acquisitions are fully integrated during 
2014 with duplication and inefficiency reduced.
The opportunities for long-term sustainable growth remain 
significant. The exciting developments in mobile and 
connected technology, innovation in digital sports rights 
and international expansion offer significant opportunities. 
The Group continues to invest in growing its international 
presence and in 2013 made good inroads in Africa, Middle 
East, South America and South East Asia that will enable the 
Group in the medium to long-term to maintain growth.

14 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The focus for the Watch&Bet team during the year was to 
complete the new licence arrangements for the 2014 to 2016 
period. In 2013 the service offering was increased to 16,543 
events (2012: 14,729) with the start of the contracts with 
the WT A Premier events, US Open and National Basketball 
Association and the return to the service of the rights for 
Italian Serie A and French Ligue 1. 
As we move into 2014 the service now has the highest quality 
content 24 hours a day, 365 days a year , with the majority of 
rights contracted until well into 2015. We have spent more on 
rights than we previously anticipated but as a result we now 
have a better quality mix of content, cleared for more platforms.
The Group’s media product portfolio was significantly 
enhanced by the acquisition of Opta and we expect strong 
growth in this area in 2014 as the importance of sports 
statistics grows for both global media organisations and fans 
around the world.
The average number of full time staff employed in the year 
increased by 439 to 1,345. As a result of the margin decline 
experienced in 2013, a full cost review has been initiated that 
will result in a marginal decline in overall headcount in 2014, 
as efficiencies are realised following the full integration of 
acquisitions. In addition to making changes to our overall staff 
structures, we have planned change programmes for 2014 in 
data operations, software development, technical platforms, 
content management, supplier procurement and offices and 
facilities. Each of these programmes will require significant 
changes but they are necessary to improve underlying 
margin in 2015 and Management are confident they will 
not affect the revenues or operations of the Company 
during 2014.
These were only a few of many highlights in what was both 
an exciting but also challenging year for the Group. Following 
the completion of the Watch&Bet renewals for the 2014-
2016 term, aligned with strong contracted revenues across 
RunningBall, Opta and Omnisport, the Group now has over 
£280 million of revenues contracted, contracting or under a 
recurring supply agreement from betting for 2014-2016 which 
gives us a great foundation to continue building success into 
2014 and beyond.
Simon Denyer
Joint Chief Executive Officer
2013 was a transitional year for the Group with some very 
clear successes and some disappointments. T otal Group 
year-on-year revenue growth was 37% (2012: 47%), with 
incremental underlying growth excluding the impact of Opta 
and Sporting News of 26%, which reflected how the Group 
continued to benefit from positive structural trends such as 
increased digital media consumption, growth in connected 
device penetration, growth in online video advertising and 
growth in in-play online sports betting. All of these trends are 
forecast to continue to improve over the next few years and 
the Group should continue to benefit from them.
Across the Group the growth of its advertising and 
sponsorship business was both a success, with this segment 
representing 23% of revenues (2012: 21%) and growing 51% 
year-on-year (2012: 130%), but also a disappointment with 
revenues in the second half of the year being lower than 
those we expected. In 2014 we will invest in our internal 
reporting and management information systems to improve 
revenue visibility and as a Board we have taken a more 
conservative view of forecasts in this business segment. That 
said, 2014 should show strong year-on-year revenue growth 
as investments in content, both editorial and rights, and 
our consumer products deliver more users and increased 
inventory with the positive effect of the FIFA 2014 World Cup.
The Group’s video-on-demand network, the ePlayer, had 
a very positive 2013. The Group increased the number of 
territories the ePlayer was live in from 24 at the end of 2013 to 
26, with launches in Brazil and Mexico. T otal streams viewed 
across the year increased to 5.0 billion (2012: 4.5 billion) and 
average monthly unique users increased to 126 million (2012: 
112 million). Importantly, across the year the Group’s ability 
to monetise these streams improved with a headline sell-
through-rate increasing to 48% (2012: 39%) with investment 
in sales teams and rights in Italy, Netherlands, Nigeria, Spain 
and the US.
Goal was successfully re-branded and re-launched, increasing 
its average monthly audience from 37 million unique users 
across web and mobile in 2012 to 43 million. By the end of 
2013, 37 editions were live, in 17 languages and over 1,500 
stories were being published each day. Goal will have a 
significant presence at the FIFA World Cup in Brazil in 2014, 
which should prove a good catalyst for consumer usage and 
advertising revenue.

Compelling content is at the heart of 
the Group’s products and services 
and ultimately drives the Group’s 
revenues and profitability. The Group’s 
rights buying strategy is to expand its 
rights portfolio by securing exclusive 
live video rights to distribute on the 
Watch&Bet service, by securing 
exclusive live video rights in selected 
markets and across selected platforms 
for exploitation via Livesport.tv and 
acquiring video-on-demand clip rights 
for distribution across the ePlayer 
and Omnisport suite of products. In 
addition, the Group also acquires data 
rights from football leagues such as the 
English Premier League and German 
Bundesliga to exploit across the Opta 
and RunningBall data services.
Since 2008 the Group’s strategy 
has been to expand its business 
geographically both organically 
and through acquisition, reducing 
the Group’s dependence on a small 
number of territories, in particular the 
United Kingdom, and being able to 
take advantage of opportunities in 
new markets. In 2013 this strategy has 
involved the continued expansion of 
ePlayer territories, with the ePlayer 
being launched in Mexico and Brazil, 
and significant investment in rights 
and advertising sales teams in the US 
through the acquisition of Sporting 
News and the Netherlands through the 
acquisition of Voetbalzone. In 2014 the 
Group will look to launch the ePlayer 
in Russia and expand its own in-house 
advertising sales teams across a range 
of territories.
With its wholly and majority owned 
websites, including Goal, Sporting 
News and Mackolik, and its ePlayer 
network the Group has actively 
sought to grow its audience and 
increase the size of its Direct to 
Consumer sourced revenues. This 
direct access to consumers allows 
improved engagement, better 
product development and improved 
and more targeted monetisation. 
In 2013, advertising became even 
more of a significant part of the 
Group’s business. The driver to 
advertising growth is audience 
growth. A number of key tactics 
are used to deliver audience growth 
including search engine optimisation, 
social marketing and integration, new 
languages, new platforms and user 
journey optimisation. A dedicated 
team of digital market analysts is 
charged with continuing to deliver 
audience growth.
The Group has three categories of 
target acquisition:
•  Local Champions: strong single 
territory digital sports media 
businesses that are similar in their 
product or service offering to 
the Group;
•  Direct to Consumer platforms: local or 
global sports portals and destination 
sports websites; and
•  Complementary Products: digital 
sports products such as sports data, 
social gaming and fantasy.
In 2013 the Group acquired:
•  Sporting News – creating a top seven 
digital sports media group in the very 
important US market;
•  Opta – significantly strengthening 
its position in the provision of sports 
content to the media sector; and 
•  Voetbalzone – creating a leading 
player in the Dutch digital sports 
media market.
The Group has a strong balance sheet 
with cash of £101 million and net funds 
of £53 million at the year end and 
will continue to consider strategic 
acquisition opportunities.
The Group’s strategy is to develop 
products and delivery solutions 
for all digital platforms including 
smartphones, tablets, personal 
computers, gaming consoles and 
connected TVs. The increased 
market penetration of such devices 
and the increased consumption 
of media on such devices allow 
consumers better and easier access 
to the Group’s content and products. 
In 2013 the Group launched its 
products on a range of new digital 
platforms and devices including 
Samsung connected TVs, T witter 
and Facebook.
In 2014, the Group will continue 
to launch Goal and Livesport.tv 
across a range of new connected 
platforms and build audiences across 
social platforms.

primarily due to (a) a 43% increase in Content Distribution 
revenues resulting from increased licence fees from sales 
of Watch&Bet, a full year of RunningBall, the inclusion of 
six months of Opta and (b) a 51% increase in advertising

decreased 3% from 2012 to 2013 as the Group has not yet 
effectively integrated the acquisitions it has made with 
many acquisitions still operating on their own platforms 
in a relatively autonomous manner. These acquisitions 
will be fully integrated during 2014 with duplication and 
inefficiency reduced. In addition the Group’s staff and 
cost bases have increased at a greater rate than revenues 
during 2013 and a full cost review and change programme 
has been initiated across many of the Group’s functions to 
address this in 2014.

online sportsbooks the opportunity to 
maximise revenues from in-play betting.
Football, tennis and basketball remain

in 2013 Perform secured or renewed 
rights contracts for the French Ligue 1, 
Italian Serie A and Major League Soccer 
from USA, Wimbledon, US Open, 
WT A Premier and the NBA – further 
strengthening the appeal of Watch&Bet 
during a very important year of 
renewals for the service. 
Also in 2013, the Group renewed key 
premium video-on-demand clip rights 
deals for the NFL, MLB and NHL in the 
US and, for the first time, acquired the 
Mexican Primera League clip rights for 
the Mexican market.
As data becomes an increasingly 
important part of the Group’s content 
mix, new rights deals were secured with 
Football DataCo covering the English 
Premier League, Football League and

the German Bundesliga.

Growth strategy: 
Expand geographically
2
Since 2008 the Group’s strategy has been 
to expand its business geographically 
both organically and through acquisition, 
reducing the Group’s dependence on 
a small number of territories and being 
able to take advantage of opportunities 
in new markets. 
In 2013 this strategy has involved the 
continued expansion of ePlayer territories 
with the ePlayer being launched in Mexico 
and Brazil and significant investment in 
rights and advertising sales teams in the 
US through the acquisition of Sporting 
News, the Netherlands through the 
acquisition of V oetbalzone and Japan 
through the acquisition of Ad Networks.
In 2014 the Group will look to launch 
the ePlayer in additional territories and 
expand its own in-house advertising 
sales teams across a range of territories 
in EMEA and South East Asia.
Strategy in action
• Perform has secured its 
position as a top seven digital 
media business in the US

Statements The Group seeks to grow its audience – direct access to 
consumers allows improved engagement, better product 
development and more targeted monetisation.
Growth strategy: 
Grow the audience
3
With its wholly and majority owned 
websites, including Goal, Sporting 
News and Mackolik, and its ePlayer 
network the Group has actively 
sought to grow its audience and 
increase the size of its direct to 
consumer (D2C) sourced revenues. 
This direct access to consumers allows 
improved engagement, better product 
development and improved and more 
targeted monetisation. 
The Group’s own display network 
had 90 million average monthly 
unique users in 2013 (2012: 54 million). 
Following a significant re-development 
and re-brand in preparation for the 2014 
World Cup, Goal increased its audience 
to 43 million in 2013 compared to 
37 million in 2012.
2013 also saw Perform take a major step 
into the US market with the acquisition 
of Sporting News, one of America’s 
oldest sports media brands and a 
leading online and mobile player in the 
sports display space. The acquisition of 
Sporting News combined with ePlayer 
meant that Perform attracts an average 
of 18 million US unique users per month 
in 2013, up from six million in 2012.
Mackolik delivered 27 million average 
monthly unique users, whilst in Germany 
the audience grew by two million to 
five million on Spox.com and Sportal.de, 
with Soccerway’s audience growing by 
34%. In Holland we grew our audience 
by two million monthly unique users 
through the acquisition of Voetbalzone.
Video remains an important part of the 
Group’s audience growth strategy and 
2013 saw the launch of ePlayer into two 
new territories including Mexico and 
Brazil. Key content deals were either 
newly secured or renewed in the US 
(NFL, MLB and NHL), Italy (Serie A) 
and Mexico (Primera Liga). The ePlayer 
now sits on over 1,500 publisher sites 
and will undergo a significant technical 
re-development and re-launch in 2014 
in order to enhance its functionality 
for publishers.

24 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Growth strategy: 
Pursue complementary  
strategic acquisitions
4
The Group acquired four businesses in 2013.
Strategy in action
• In July 2013 Perform acquired 
Opta and strengthened its 
position as a leading player in 
the provision of sports content 
to the media sector.
The Group has three categories of 
target acquisition:
• Local Champions: strong single 
territory digital sports media 
businesses that are similar in their 
product or service offering to  
the Group;
• Direct to Consumer platforms: local or 
global sports portals and destination 
sports websites; and
• Complementary Products: digital 
sports products such as sports data, 
social gaming and fantasy.
For all acquisitions, by leveraging the 
Group’s content portfolio, international 
sales teams and technology platform, 
revenue growth and profitability can 
be maximised.
In March 2013, the Group announced 
the acquisition of Voetbalzone, the 
number one independent football site 
in the Netherlands. The acquisition 
complemented the Dutch launch of 
ePlayer in 2012 and Perform is now 
the number one digital sports media 
network according to comScore. Since 
launch the Group has put in place a 
sales team and secured content deals 
with Ajax, FC T wente, NEC Nijmegen 
and Ado Den Haag.
March also saw the Group take a major 
step into the US sports media space 
with the acquisition of Sporting News. 
The combination of SportingNews.
com, Goal.com and the US ePlayer 
positioned the Group as a top seven 
multi-platform sports media business 
in the US and importantly added an 
experienced and well-connected sales 
team. Since acquisition the Group has 
moved advertising sales in-house, 
appointed a highly experienced Chief 
Revenue Officer and re-launched 
the Sporting News iOS tablet and 
smartphone application.
In June 2013, the Group acquired the 
assets of Ad Networks KK which had 
been the Japanese advertising sales 
agent for the Group in Japan.
In July 2013, Perform completed the 
acquisition of Opta, a market leader in 
collecting, packaging, analysing and 
distributing sports data in digital format 
to the media, betting and professional 
sports sectors. The acquisition 
complements Perform’s existing content 
distribution business and in particular 
strengths the Group’s position in the 
provision of sports content to the media 
sector. Since acquisition, Perform’s 
global sales team are now selling 
Opta and there has been a significant 
commercial integration and marketing 
push to promote Opta and Omnisport’s 
joint World Cup offering.
The Directors are satisfied with 
the financial performance of 
the acquisitions.

Statements The Group continues to launch its products on a range of 
new digital platforms.
Strategy in action
• In 2013, Livesport.tv launched 
across Samsung Smart TV 
and tablet devices.
The Group’s strategy is to develop 
products and delivery solutions for all 
digital platforms including smartphones, 
tablets, gaming consoles and connected 
TVs. The increased market penetration 
of such devices and the increased 
consumption of media on them allows 
consumers better and easier access to 
the Group’s content and products. 
In 2013 both Goal and Livesport.tv 
launched across Samsung Smart TV 
devices while Goal launched Goal Live 
– a live scores iOS app and T witter feed 
that updates football scores faster than 
any other provider. 
Sporting News launched its 3.0 iOS 
application for tablets and mobiles 
which combines the best in sports 
reporting with social content from 
top sports influencers and dynamic, 
packaged daily issue. Since its 
December 2013 launch the application 
has already been downloaded over 
150,000 times and in January 2014 
delivered 4.7 million page impressions.

The Group’s growing 
rights portfolio includes 
a number of premium 
sports properties such 
as US Open Tennis.
Perform utilises this rights portfolio to deliver a range of 
products covering live video, video-on-demand, sports 
data, sports news and editorial and sports statistics. These 
products are sold to online bookmakers, broadcasters, mobile 
operators and other business clients around the world.
Watch&Bet is a major supplier of live sports video to online 
bookmakers. The service delivers live streaming of sports 
content directly to consumers through bookmakers’ websites 
over the internet and via mobile networks, without bookmakers 
having to invest directly in content and streaming technology. 
Watch&Bet generates revenue through fixed-term, multi-year 
licences, giving the Group long-term, visible revenues. 
During the year six new licensees acquired the Watch&Bet 
service increasing the total number of licensees to 46 
(2012: 40). The geographical diversification of Watch&Bet 
continued, with historically the largest territory, the UK, 
representing 5% (2012: 5%) of Group revenues and no  
other territory representing more than 4% (2012: 4%). 
The existing Watch&Bet cycle expired on 31 December 2013 
and during 2013 the 2014-2016 renewal process was a key 
focus, ensuring the right model for customers with the right 
breadth of content to ensure the service remains a must 
have. The licence model has evolved to offer the bookmakers 
enhanced benefits whilst, at the same time, enabling further 
growth opportunities for the Group.
The semi-exclusive model has been retained with the number 
of licensees per territory being increased from six to eight. 
The core package, of 16,000 video events and 90,000 
data events will be offered on a minimum annual fee basis, 
as opposed to a minimum number of events, providing 
bookmakers with improved flexibility to select the content 
that is most relevant for their market and customer base. 
During 2013, the Group’s rights portfolio increased by 12%, 
delivering 16,543 live events (2012: 14,729). New or renewed 
rights included the NBA, Serie A and B, Ligue 1, US Open 
Tennis, WT A Premier and a range of additional A TP and 
soccer tournaments. The Group currently has over 16,000 
events contracted for delivery in 2014 and 13,000 events 
contracted for delivery in 2015.
The new Watch&Bet service will combine the Group’s live 
video with the live data content provided by RunningBall. 
RunningBall is a leading provider of real time sports data to 
The Group has licensed the digital sports media rights to 
over 200 leagues, tournaments and events.

During the year, the number of live events that RunningBall 
covered increased by 56% to 78,012 (2012: 49,866). T wo 
sports, beach volleyball and handball, were launched in 2013 
and more football and basketball matches were covered. 
The Group was also appointed official supplier of live data 
to the betting sector by Football DataCo ( covering English 
Premier League, Football League, Scottish Premier League and 
Scottish Football League ) for three seasons from August 2013.
WatchandT rade is a major supplier of live sports video to online 
bookmakers. The service delivers live streaming of sports 
content directly to bookmaker trading desks. The service is 
licensed on a non-exclusive basis. During the year the number 
of customers licensing the product decreased from 68 to 62.
The WatchandT rade video and RunningBall data products 
are also being combined to create a single trading interface 
with the introduction of a settlement tool to enable data to be 
cross-referenced with data to settle bets.
In July the Group acquired Opta, a leading provider of 
rich sports data to the media sector, sports clubs, leagues 
and federations. Opta complements the Group’s existing 
content distribution business by catering to the significant 
opportunity of rich data within the wider media sector 
and allows the Group to exploit the significant consumer 
opportunity of rich data, whilst also strengthening the Group’s 
presence in key European markets. Between the date of 
acquisition and year end there were 458 customers who 
took an Opta product or service compared to 332 in the 
comparative six month period in 2012.
In 2014, GSM ( a provider of sports statistics to the betting, mobile 
and media sectors ) will be integrated into Opta. GSM, which had 
205 customers at 31 December (2012: 208), will be retired as a 
brand with all customers becoming part of Opta’s customer base.
Omnisport is a sports news product that combines video, 
editorial, images and data. It is available across multiple 
platforms (television, online, smartphones and tablets) in a 
number of formats (Uncut, Ready, Bulletin), in 11 languages 
and in six regional variants. During the year the number of 
customers licensing the product increased from 158 to 213.
The majority of the year-on-year revenue increase in content 
distribution has been due to increased licence fees from sales 
of the Watch&Bet service, a full year of RunningBall results 
and the inclusion of six months of results from Opta.

Goal, which is the world’s largest football website, 
SportingNews, Spox, Mackolik, Sahadan, Voetbalzone, 
Sportal.de, Sportal.com.au and Soccerway. 
In March, Perform Sporting News Limited was created 
in partnership with US publisher American City Business 
Journals Inc and is already ranked top seven in the US 
digital sports media comScore rankings. SportingNews.
com which is a well-known US sports media brand and 
publication, has had 10 million average monthly unique

Spox and Sportal.de, the Group’s German portals delivered 
five million average unique users up from three million in 2012.
The Group benefitted from a full year of advertising revenues 
on Mackolik, a leading T urkish digital sports business which 
owns T urkey’s top two most visited sports sites, Mackolik.com 
and Sahadan.com. The sites delivered 27 million average 
monthly unique users in 2013 (2012: 21 million).
Advertising and sponsorship (display)
In 2013 the Group had an average of 90 million monthly unique

the Premier League’s official website.
The Group’s owned display network had 90 million average 
monthly unique users (2012: 54 million) during the year, with 
26% of this traffic coming from mobile devices.
Goal unique users increased to 43 million average unique 
users (2012: 37 million). During the year there was a successful 
re-brand and re-launch of all 37 editions of Goal across 
multiple platforms, which has markedly enhanced user 
experience, improved natural search referrals and increased 
page views per visit. Goal is now available in 17 different 
languages. The re-branded Goal iOS reached the T op 10 
of the free sports category in the Apple App Store in over 
50 countries. Goal Live, the fastest live score app in the world, 
was also launched during the year. The focus for 2014 will 
be to leverage Goal’s unique position to secure advertising 
and sponsorship agreements. Significant commitments have 
already been agreed with Puma and Samsung.

investment in sales teams in North America, Germany, Spain,

Statements The Group generates video advertising and sponsorship 
revenues through the sale of pre-roll video advertisements 
on its video-on-demand network, the ePlayer. 
Advertising and sponsorship (video)
The ePlayer is embedded on the websites of over 1,500 
leading publishers and sports portals in 26 territories. In 2013 
five billion videos were streamed and 2.5 billion pre-roll 
adverts sold (resulting in a sell-through-rate of 51% up from 
39% in 2012) with content including National Football League, 
the National Basketball Association, Serie A and Ligue 1.
The ePlayer’s content portfolio consists of a set of global 
and territory specific sports video clips, packaged into 
different branded channels including football, tennis, golf 
and motorsport. Approximately 60,000 two to three minute 
sport clips were distributed through the ePlayer in 2013, with 
many clips re-voiced in different languages specifically for 
individual territories.
The number of live territories increased in the year to 26 with 
the ePlayer launching in Brazil and Mexico. The sell-through-
rate in Q4 2013 of 54% was a considerable improvement both 
quarter-on-quarter (Q3 2013: 42%) and year-on-year (Q4 2012: 
45%). This reflects the Group’s improved ability to monetise its 
traffic and an improvement in the quality of available inventory.
The adjacent table separates the ePlayer business into three 
territory categories: the United States and the United Kingdom, 
FIGS (France, Italy, Germany, Spain ) and the rest of the world 
(including T urkey, Japan, India, South Korea ). The territory of a 
stream and a unique user is determined by geographic location 
of the unique user and is based on data from Omniture.

US and UK streams have increased to 2.7 billion (2012: 2.1 
billion) with increased distribution and improved content. In 
the US the ePlayer is now embedded on over 400 websites 
and has continued to be ranked number one or two by 
comScore for Online Sports Video. The Group renewed its 
domestic clip rights deal with the National Football League 
(NFL) in the US and secured domestic clip rights to the 
National Hockey League (NHL) in Canada.
The sell-through-rate in the US and UK improved to 71% 
(2012: 63%) primarily due to the sales team being brought 
in-house in the US from the second half of the year and the 
investment in that team, including the recruitment of a new 
Chief Revenue Officer.
Streams in FIGS decreased from 1 billion in 2012 to 0.6 
billion in 2013 as the Group continued to focus on improving 
monetisable stream inventory. The Group renewed the 
domestic clip rights for Serie A and acquired Serie B in 
Italy and La Liga domestic clip rights in Spain. In addition 
Spox began to transition from an online portal to one with 
broadcast capabilities. As well as displaying live NBA games 
Spox also provided live coverage of FIBA, EuroBasket and 
Euroleague. Live friendly football games were also broadcast 
on the portal.
As a result of these new rights and initiatives, the focus on the 
quality of the streams and the improved performance of the 
sales teams across the region, the sell-through-rate improved 
to 64% from 29% in 2012.
Streams in the rest of the world increased to 1.7 billion from 
1.4 billion in 2012 as the Group launched the ePlayer in Brazil 
and Mexico and continued to improve traffic in key markets 
such as T urkey and Japan. The sell-through-rate improved 
from 13% to 20% as sales teams continued to become better 
established and the Group brought ad sales teams in-house 
through Asia. Russia is expected to go live in 2014.

Income Statement
The Group’s revenue increased to £208.1 million in 2013, an 
increase of £56.5 million (37%) from £151.6 million in 2012. 
Adjusted EBITDA (defined as earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation and excluding amounts in 
respect of share-based payments and exceptional items) 
decreased to £36.4 million in 2013 from £37.5 million in 
2012. The Group’s profit after tax decreased to £4.6 million 
from £13.5 million in 2012 due to the decrease in underlying 
EBITDA and increase in depreciation, amortisation, 
exceptional and financing charges partially offset by 
lower share-based payment charges.

Cost of sales increased from £67.2 million (representing 44% 
of revenue) to £100.5 million (representing 48% of revenue), 
an increase of £33.3 million (50%). The increase during the 
year was primarily a result of the increased volume and mix 
of content acquired by the Group to support its product and 
revenue development, the full year inclusion of RunningBall 
and Mackolik, and the effect of six months of Opta and nine 
months of SportingNews.
Content costs increased by £18.8 million ( 46%) to 
£59.9 million due to the increased number and mix of sports 
events and rights acquired, including the effect of acquiring 
WT A and official media and trader betting data rights and 
due to higher revenue shares related to the increase in 
subscription revenues.
Publisher shares increased by 45% from £6.4 million to 
£9.3 million due to increases in advertising and sponsorship 
revenues and the related payments to ePlayer publishers and 
third-party websites.
Technical and software fees increased by £3.1 million ( 40%) 
to £10.9 million due to the increased number of end users, 
customers, new products and new services.
Production costs increased by £8.5 million (71%) to 
£20.4 million due to the full year effect of scouting costs 
of producing RunningBall data, the effect of six months of 
data collection and related analysis costs of producing Opta 
data, the effect of nine months of editorial content and video 
produced for SportingNews, WT A live production costs and

Y ear-on-year revenue growth excluding the acquisitions of Opta 
and SportingNews was 26%.
Content distribution had a good year, with revenues increasing 
by 43% to £132.9 million (2012: £93.0 million). The majority of 
this growth has been driven by increased licence fees from 
sales of the Watch&Bet service, reflecting new licensees 
and additional content, a full year of RunningBall results and 
£10.9 million from the inclusion of six months of Opta. 
Advertising and sponsorship (video) revenues increased by 
48% to £19.6 million (2012: £13.3 million) due to increasing 
audiences and total streams viewed and more of these 
streams being monetised, in particular in the United Kingdom 
and United States.
Advertising and sponsorship (display) revenues increased by 
54% to £28.3 million (2012: £18.4 million), Revenues increased, 
even without the benefit of Euro 2012, due to the launch of 
Perform Sporting News, a full year of Mackolik’s results, the 
effect of the Goal re-brand and re-launch and the Group’s 
investment in sales teams in North America, Germany, Spain, 
France, Italy, Norway, the Middle East and the Netherlands. 
Subscription revenues increased by 15% to £14.1 million (2012: 
£12.3 million). This increase was primarily due to the launch 
of new mobile services for Goal, the inclusion of a full year 
of subscription revenues generated by the Mackolik group 
of websites and increased revenues from client branded 
products such as Foxsoccer2go.com and T ennis TV.com.
T echnology and production revenues were £13.2 million 
(2012: £14.6 million ). Revenues marginally decreased year-on-year

place the Group’s new debt facility and the Group’s share 
placing. In addition, exceptional items include a six months’ 
charge in respect of the Opta Management Incentive of 
£3.5 million (2012: £nil). A downward revaluation of the 
contingent consideration due on Spox/MSD of £2.4 million 
(2012: £nil) is also included. These costs are considered 
exceptional by the Directors as they are items that are 
material in size and are unusual and infrequent in occurrence.
Share-based payments
The Group incurred share-based payment charges relating to 
the Group’s non-recurring Growth Securities Ownership Plan 
(GSOP) of £1.2 million in 2012. There were no charges for this 
scheme in 2013.
The charge relating to the Group’s ongoing Performance 
Share Plan and Save As You Earn Scheme was £0.7 million 
(2012: £2.0 million). The decrease in the charge resulted from 
the Group revising down the expected number of shares 
that will be awarded under the 2011 and 2012 Performance 
Share Plans.
Amortisation and depreciation
Amortisation and depreciation increased from £6.5 million in 
2012 to £8.3 million in 2013, an increase of £1.8 million (28%). 
The increase was primarily due to the increased investment 
in the Group’s technical infrastructure and software 
development and the related amortisation and depreciation 
of the businesses acquired.
Acquisition-related amortisation increased from £2.9 million 
in 2012 to £6.0 million in 2013. The increase of £3.1 million was 
primarily due to the full year amortisation of Mackolik and 
RunningBall intangibles and the inclusion of the amortisation 
relating to Opta, Voetbalzone and SportingNews intangibles.
Investment income
Investment income primarily relates to bank interest 
receivable of £0.4 million (2012: £0.5 million).
Accretion of deferred consideration
The accretion charge in respect of deferred consideration on 
the Group’s acquisitions increased from £1.9 million in 2012 to 
£4.0 million in 2013.
Finance costs
The Group’s finance costs increased from £1.3 million in 
2012 to £2.5 million in 2013 primarily due to bank interest, 
commitment and other costs in respects of the Group’s term 
loan and revolving credit facility drawn down during the year.
Gross profit 
The Group’s gross profit increased from £84.5 million in 
2012 to £107 .6 million in 2013, an increase of £23.1 million 
(27%). Gross profit margin was 52% in 2013 compared to 
56% in 2012. The decrease arose due to certain content 
and production in 2013 contributing a lower margin than in 
2012. This will be addressed in 2014 as set out in the outlook 
section below.
Administrative expenses (before exceptional items, 
share-based payments and depreciation and 
amortisation charges) 
The Group’s administrative expenses, excluding exceptional 
items, share-based payments and depreciation and 
amortisation charges, increased from £47 .0 million in 2012 to 
£71.2 million in 2013, an increase of £24.2 million (52%).
This increase was primarily as a result of increased staff 
employed (from an average of 906 in 2012 to an average 
of 1,345 in 2013), and their related costs, the inclusion of a 
full year of RunningBall and Mackolik administrative costs, 
six months of Opta and nine months of SportingNews related 
administrative costs.
The average cost of an employee remained flat at £40,000 in 
both 2012 and 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, 
tax, depreciation and amortisation, share-based payments 
and exceptional items and is considered by the Directors to 
better reflect the underlying performance of the Group and 
thus is a key measure of the Group’s financial performance. 
Exceptional items adjusted are either non-cash, one-off (such 
as relating to acquisitions or restructuring) or non-recurring in 
the medium term (such as integration costs).
Adjusted EBITDA decreased from £37 .5 million in 2012 
to £36.4 million in 2013, a decrease of £1.1 million (3%). 
This decrease resulted from the significant organic and 
acquisition-related growth causing duplication in certain 
areas, certain items of content, editorial and production 
related costs contributing lower margins and the staff base 
growing quickly. These items will all be addressed in 2014 as 
set out in the outlook section below.
Exceptional items
During the year the Group incurred acquisition-related 
exceptional costs of £9.8 million (2012: £5.3 million) primarily 
relating to professional fees and integration costs, acquisition-
related integration costs (including a certain amount of

Acquisitions
In March 2013 the Group acquired the digital assets of 
American City Business Journals Inc’s (“ACBJ”) consumer 
web division Sporting News including Sportingnews.com. 
The Group established a new subsidiary, Perform Sporting 
News Limited (“PSN”), and contributed its US and Canadian 
consumer businesses including the ePlayer and Goal. PSN is 
owned 65% by the Group and 35% by ACBJ.
In March 2013 the Group acquired Voetbalzone BV , the 
number one independent sports site in the Netherlands, for 
initial cash consideration of €2 million. Additional consideration 
of up to €10.5 million is payable based on the EBITDA of the 
business for the years to 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015.
In July 2013 the Group acquired Opta, a leading provider of 
rich sports data to the media sector, sports clubs, leagues and 
federations for cash consideration of £40 million, together 
with a management incentive scheme of up to an additional 
£7 million linked to delivery of the business’ EBITDA for the 
year to 30 June 2014.

The Group also incurred a net exceptional foreign exchange 
related finance charge of £1.4 million due to the foreign 
exchange difference between the £ sterling liability 
recognised at 31 December 2012 in relation to the €50 million 
of deferred consideration due for RunningBall and the 
amount actually paid in March 2013. This charge was offset 
by a foreign exchange movement on the €50 million bank 
debt between March 2013, when it was drawn down to 
finance the RunningBall deferred payment, and the year end.
Profit before tax
Profit before tax decreased from £16.9 million in 2012 to 
£4.1 million in 2013, a decrease of £12.9 million (76%). Adjusted 
profit before tax, excluding exceptional items (including 
exceptional financing costs), share-based payments, 
accretion of deferred consideration relating to acquisitions 
and acquisition-related amortisation, decreased from 
£30.3 million in 2012 to £26.0 million in 2013.
Taxation
The Group recognised a tax credit of £0.5 million (2012: 
£3.4 million charge) as the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities 
in respect of acquisition intangibles offset the tax charge on 
the Group’s profit before tax.
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are based on 
profit attributable to owners of the Parent plus exceptional 
items (including exceptional financing costs), share-based 
payments, accretion of deferred consideration relating to 
acquisitions and acquisition-related amortisation divided 
by the adjusted weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by 
7% to 10.4p (2012: 11.2p). 
Statutory basic earnings per share reflects the Group’s 
statutory profit and was based on the average number 
of ordinary shares outstanding in 2013 of 251 million 
(2012: 233 million). Statutory basic earnings per share 
decreased to 1.6p from 5.5p.

(2012: £5.6 million).
In July 2013 the Group issued 23.9 million new ordinary shares 
raising total net proceeds of £112.6 million to fund the acquisition 
of Opta and other potential future acquisitions. The equity was 
raised via a cash box structure which resulted in £65.6 million 
being credited to distributable reserves and the remaining 
£47 million being credited to non-distributable reserves.
In May 2012, 13.5 million new ordinary 2 and 7 /9th pence 
shares were issued in part consideration for RunningBall. 
Share capital increased £0.4 million and a merger relief 
reserve of £47.2 million was created.

debt was £48.3 million (2012: £7.1 million) including finance 
leases of £nil (2012: £0.2 million). Closing net funds were 
£52.7 million (2012: £26.5 million).
The bank debt was classified as current as at 31 December 
due to a breach of certain undertakings in the bank facilities 
agreement which had not been waived at that date. 
Subsequent to the year end the Group received a waiver for 
these breaches. All covenants were met during the year.
Fixed assets
During the year the Group continued to capitalise expenditure 
on additions and improvements to its technical software as 
new functionality and services were developed. Internal staff 
costs of £7 .0 million were capitalised in 2013 (2012: £2.6 million). 
Further external development and software costs were 
capitalised of £4.0 million (2012: £2.9 million). Therefore total 
intangible asset additions were £11.0 million (2012: £5.5 million). 
This included investment in enhancements to Goal, the ePlayer, 
Watch&Bet and the Group’s subscription products.
The Group continued its investment programme to update and 
improve the equipment used to support its technical hardware 
platform and invested £3.8 million during 2013 (2012: £4.9 million ).
Of the total £14.8 million (2012: £10.4 million) invested 
relating to technical software and hardware, £9.5 million 
(2012: £6.5 million) related to investment in new products, 
£2.7 million (2012: £2.2 million) related to additional supply 
side capacity, £2.0 million (2012: £1.1 million) related to back 
office and £0.6 million (2012: £0.6 million) related to renewals.
In addition, the Group invested £0.4 million in land and 
buildings, leasehold improvements and furniture and fittings 
(2012: £0.5 million).
consideration of up to €7 million is payable based on the 
EBITDA of Activaweb for the years to 31 December 2013, 
2014 and 2015. The remaining 49% will be acquired in 
two tranches – 29% will be transferred on payment of the 
consideration in 2015 and 20% will be transferred on payment 
of the consideration in 2016. Activaweb owns several French 
websites including Matchendirect.fr.
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operating activities (before exceptional 
items) was £24.5 million (2012: £18.8 million). The 2012 cash 
generated was also before the GSOP payment.
The exceptional GSOP payment of £6.0 million was paid out 
in 2012. There were no payments in respect of this scheme in 
2013. Payments relating to exceptional costs were £7 .0 million 
(2012: £5.3 million).
Capital expenditure during the year was £14.4 million 
(2012: £10.4 million) with increased investment in the Group’s 
technical hardware and software development.
Spend during the year in relation to acquisition of subsidiaries, 
excluding working capital related payments and cash 
acquired was £87 .7 million relating to the acquisitions of Opta 
(£37 .5 million ), V oetbalzone (£1.6 million ) and the earn-out 
payments for RunningBall (£42.6 million ), Spox (£0.9 million ), 
Mackolik (£2.1 million ), Perform Sales Japan (£0.7 million ) and 
WatchandT rade (£2.3 million ). During the year the Group also 
completed the buy-out of the non-controlling interest in TCS 
(£0.9 million ), resulting in total acquisition spend to £88.6 million.
In 2012 total acquisition spend was £31.8 million (£31.4 million 
net of cash acquired) and primarily related to the acquisitions 
of RunningBall and Mackolik.
In May 2012 the £11.3 million balance of the Group’s term 
loan facility was converted into a new term loan facility of 
£11.3 million. This new facility was provided by Bank of Ireland 
plc and Royal Bank of Scotland plc who also provided Perform 
Group plc and Perform Media Services Ltd with a €30 million 
term loan facility and a €20 million multi-currency revolving 
credit facility. The agreement also allowed, subject to further 
negotiation, an additional multi-currency revolving credit facility 
of up to €20 million. The €30 million term loan facility and a 
€20 million multi-currency revolving credit facility were fully 
drawn down in March 2013 to finance the deferred RunningBall 
payment. In addition, the Group also has available an additional 
multi-currency term facility of up to €20 million and drew 
down €10 million from this in June 2013.
Financial review 
continued
40 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 acquisitions are still operating on their own platforms and are 
relatively autonomous from other areas of the business, which 
has led to duplication and inefficiency. Our aim is to make 
sure the majority of acquisitions are fully integrated during 
2014, with duplication and inefficiency reduced.
A full cost review has also been initiated that will result in a 
marginal decline in overall headcount in 2014, as efficiencies 
are realized following the full integration of acquisitions. In 
addition to making changes to our overall staff structures we 
have planned change programs for 2014 in data operations, 
software development, technical platforms, content 
management, supplier procurement and offices and facilities. 
Each of these programs will require significant changes but 
they are necessary to improve underlying margin in 2015 and 
management are confident they will not affect the revenues 
or operations of the company during 2014.
The opportunities for long-term sustainable growth remain 
significant. The exciting developments in mobile and 
connected technology, innovation in digital sports rights 
and international expansion offer significant opportunities. 
The Group continues to invest in growing its international 
presence and in 2013 made good inroads in Africa, Middle 
East, South America and South East Asia that will enable the 
Group in the medium to long-term to maintain growth.
The Group has made a positive start to 2014, with January 
and February showing strong year-on-year growth in 
revenues, EBITDA and operational metrics. The Group has 
significant visibility over full year revenues, with in excess of 
£144 million already contracted, and remains confident that 
it will deliver full year revenue and EBITDA growth in line with 
the Board’s expectations. The Group’s 2014 growth strategy 
is set out on pages 20 to 27.

In March 2013, when the Group acquired the digital assets 
of ACBJ’s consumer web division, the Group established 
a new subsidiary, Perform Sporting News Limited (“PSN”), 
and contributed its US and Canadian consumer businesses 
including the ePlayer and Goal. PSN is owned 65% by the 
Group and 35% by ACBJ. ACBJ contributed loans and equity 
of $4.2 million to cover PSN’s working capital requirements.
As the Group retained control of the assets it contributed, 
there was no gain or loss from the transfer of those 
assets, which have been measured at their carrying value 
immediately prior to acquisition. The Directors consider that 
the fair value of the consideration transferred (representing 
35% of the fair value of the assets and liabilities transferred 
by the Group) is equal to the fair value of the consideration 
received, being 65% of the assets transferred by ACBJ. The 
35% transferred is accounted for as an equity transaction and 
is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the 
assets transferred and their book value.
The Group has a forward contract to acquire the remaining 
49% of Mackolik in 2016. On acquisition in 2012 the value of 
that forward contract which the Group has recognised as 
a liability was £14.9 million, with a corresponding debit to 
equity (as this represents a transaction with a shareholder in a 
non-controlling interest). In addition, the Group is committed 
to pay 49% of Mackolik’s distributable profits to the owners 
of the non-controlling interest in that business until the 
Group owns 100% of it. The Group recognised a liability on 
acquisition with a corresponding debit to equity for the fair 
value of these dividends of £4.9 million.
Prospects and outlook
The Group is confident that demand for its products and 
services will continue to increase supported by structural 
growth drivers and through the Group’s own growth strategy.
Increasing penetration of residential broadband connections, 
smartphones and connected televisions combined with the 
impact of digital technology on the sales and marketing 
strategies of the sports and media industries will continue to 
drive demand for our products and services. These industries 
need innovative solutions to generate new revenue streams 
and protect existing revenues and the Group is well placed to 
capitalise on these trends.
Although the Group will continue to seek a small number 
of complementary acquisitions, the focus in 2014 will be 
to ensure the effective integration of the acquisitions the 
Group has made over the past three years. In many instances

Macro risk
Summary Description Mitigating actions
Dependency on 
digital technologies 
and communications 
networks; changes in 
technologies, macro 
business dynamics 
and user behaviour
Like many digital media and content businesses, the Group is 
dependent on third-party internet, mobile and other technology 
and service providers to deliver its products and services. 
Management focus continually on ensuring that the Group has 
in place robust arrangements with appropriate third parties. 
However, ultimate control of many platforms and technologies is 
out of Management’s control. The operation of these platforms 
and technologies may be the subject of unexpected change 
or failure; changes in the terms on or means by which they are 
available may adversely impact the Group’s businesses and/
or its customers; and continuous development in the speed, 
capacity and capability of key platforms and technologies which 
is important to the expansion of the Group’s products, territorial 
reach and economics may not be successful.
The Group constantly monitors changes in technologies, 
user behaviour and technological trends which could affect 
(positively or negatively) the sustainability, usability and 
economic viability of its products and services. It actively 
deploys available product, development and other 
resources to minimise adverse impact that may result.
Macro economics 
vs. revenue and 
geographic diversity
The Group’s revenue streams are dependent on the overall 
macro economic environment at both global and national 
levels. These could affect the appetite of its business 
customers to purchase the Group’s products/services and 
advertising/sponsorship inventory, and/or the disposable 
income of the Group’s direct consumer customers. Adverse 
economic headwinds in the key business sectors in which the 
Group’s business customers operate could also impact the 
Group’s results. 
Although macro economic trends are out of Management’s 
control, at the heart of the Group’s growth strategy is the 
diversification and geographical expansion of the Group’s 
revenues (as delivered through both the Group’s M&A 
activity and continued growth of its organic businesses). 
Management considers that this revenue and geographic 
diversity insulates the Group well against all but extreme 
economic circumstances (as demonstrated by the Group’s 
continued growth during recent years).
Regulatory change 
and the costs of 
compliance
The Group operates businesses across a range of sectors and 
jurisdictions. Regulatory change could occur which adversely 
affects one or more parts of the Group’s business and which 
may impact the Group’s results. In particular, although the 
Group does not undertake activities in the betting sector 
that are directly regulated, all of the Group’s betting operator 
customers are regulated and regulatory change affecting 
betting operators could impact their appetite or ability to buy 
or use certain of the Group’s services (e.g. Watch&Bet). Laws 
regulating digital consumer products and services, consumer 
data, digital audio-visual distribution and media content are 
also of specific relevance to the Group.
The Group actively monitors laws and regulations applicable 
to it and its customers, especially as it expands into new 
territories. The Group has recently appointed a senior lawyer 
to the post of Head of Regulatory Affairs and continues 
to implement appropriate compliance programmes. As 
the Group‘s businesses expand, the costs of compliance 
will grow, but they are kept in close check by a prudent, 
proportionate risk-based approach to compliance.
Rights costs 
and margin
Competition from third parties for certain rights is strong. This 
may result in the Group choosing not to acquire certain rights 
or being outbid for them. The Group may also experience 
increased costs for those rights which it does acquire. The loss 
of certain rights may result in some of the Group’s products 
and services becoming less attractive to business customers 
and/or consumers.
The Group has a specific team focussed on the acquisition 
and management of rights. Management continuously 
assesses the Group’s requirements for rights-cleared content 
(including careful assessment of the economic viability of 
each set of rights ) in order to ensure that it makes strategically 
appropriate and economically informed decisions. The Group 
has a highly-developed approach to the selection of rights and 
the scheduling of content in its services to ensure that value is 
derived from the rights purchases it makes.
Protection of the 
Group’s content, 
brands and 
intellectual property 
The digital ecosystem brings with it an inherent risk of content 
piracy and rights/IP infringement. If substantial piracy of 
certain of the Group’s content were to occur this may diminish 
demand for or the value of some of the Group’s services. 
Imitation or passing-off of the Group’s brands could result in 
diminution in the value of those brands and infringement or 
theft of the Group’s proprietary intellectual property could 
result in the damage to the Group’s businesses and the value 
of that IP. Infringement of the rights in third-party content 
used by the Group could result in the Group being liable to 
compensate third parties and/or the suspension or loss of the 
affected content.
The Group monitors infringement of its content, brands and 
intellectual property rights and continues to develop a range 
of strategies with which to respond where required. The 
Group’s recently appointed Head of Regulatory Affairs has 
specific responsibility for the management and protection of 
the Group’s proprietary intellectual property. Content piracy 
and intellectual property rights infringement are not currently 
considered by Management to be a material risk to the Group 
and the costs and resources incurred in dealing with this risk are 
prudent and proportionate. All arrangements under which the 
Group acquires rights to use content, brands and/ or intellectual 
property are considered carefully by the Group’s legal function 
to ensure that appropriate protections are incorporated.

Summary Description Mitigating actions
The Group’s 
technology and 
operations
Reliance on key technologies and operations, integrations 
and development: The Group’s business is naturally reliant 
on its technology and operational functions to support and 
develop its platforms, systems and infrastructure to meet the 
needs of the Group’s businesses. 
At any given time the Group is undertaking a number of 
strategically significantly development activities, and failure 
or delay in delivering them could have an adverse effect on 
the Group’s results or prospects. Some of these activities are 
complex, cutting-edge and require substantial innovation. 
The Group is also working continuously to integrate its 
multiple organic and acquired platforms, technologies and 
operations so as to derive maximum value and efficiency 
from its assets. Some of these integrations are operationally 
and technologically complex and all change is inevitably 
accompanied by risk; if not executed successfully or on 
time scales anticipated, the Group may fail to realise the full 
potential value of and synergies between its constituent parts 
and this may affect its economic performance.
The Group is also highly conscious of the risks associated with 
changes in the availability of or support for key third-party 
technologies and services that are critical to the Group’s 
operations; the need to give continuous focus to ensuring 
that it has adequate disaster recovery plans and facilities; 
appropriate security technology and associated policies; and 
the capabilities necessary to support its live operations and 
sufficient and experienced personnel capable of managing 
the risks associated with running (whilst integrating) multiple 
technical platforms. Failure of or defects in any one or more 
of these aspects of the Group’s operations could impact 
continuity of those operations and the Group’s results.
The Group devotes significant management time and 
resource to the identification and mitigation of risks relating 
to its technology and operations, which are key to its 
businesses. It has significant experience in these matters 
and Management regard the technological and operational 
risks faced by the Group as in-line with expectations in the 
context of a fast-growing and acquisitive business.
The Group’s financial 
and legal affairs, and 
its people
Exchange risk: A significant portion of the Group’s revenues 
and costs are in Euros and Dollars, and the Group is 
increasingly exposed to trading in other currencies. The Group 
could be exposed to adverse movements in the currencies in 
which it trades.
Management prepare cashflow forecasts by currency and 
attempt, where possible, to naturally hedge the Group’s 
cashflow. Management will continue to carefully monitor the 
Group’s cashflow and consider alternative arrangements if 
there is a material unhedged exposure.
Tax: Adverse changes in taxation could affect the Group’s 
results and the Group could be exposed to a variety of tax 
risks in various countries. 
Management work closely with external tax advisers on an 
ongoing basis to mitigate tax risks.
Content liability: The Group produces and handles very 
substantial volumes of content. If use of an item of content 
breaches a third-party’s rights, applicable law or regulation, 
or otherwise carries legal risk (for example, because it is 
found to be defamatory) the Group may be subject to legal 
or regulatory proceedings, penalised and/or required to 
compensate third parties; resulting costs may impact the 
Group’s financial performance and the Group may experience 
reputational damage.
The Group requires that its editorial staff abide by an 
editorial code of practice. Content produced is reviewed 
against that code by its senior and managing editors prior 
to publication to ensure suitability for each geographical 
market it is published in.
Personal data: The Group continues to grow its direct to 
consumer business and uses or controls increasing quantities 
of personal data. If the Group does not adequately protect and 
manage this data it may be exposed to risk of non-compliance 
with applicable laws.
The Group continues to invest in the legal and regulatory 
compliance function, which grew significantly in 2013. 
Management regularly assess the legal and regulatory 
requirements of the Group and adjust the level of resource 
as necessary.

Summary Description Mitigating actions
Organisational change: As the Group continues to 
expand and mature it will engage in sometimes substantial 
organisational change in order to ensure that its people 
structure and resources are appropriate for its needs. 
Organisational change programmes carry an inherent degree 
of risk. The Group may not always be able to effect change as 
rapidly or in the manner it anticipates. Delays or unexpected 
changes to change programmes may impact the Group’s 
operations and its results.
The Group appointed its first Chief Personnel Officer in 
March 2013 and has continued to invest in its HR function, 
which grew significantly in 2013. This function will support 
the business as it continues to grow and evolve.
The Group’s business M&A: The Group continues to pursue opportunities for 
expansion (including geographic) through mergers and 
acquisitions. This activity may not be successful and the Group 
may not achieve technical and/or other synergies as quickly as 
it anticipates. 
The Group is accumulating significant M&A experience 
in the sector in which it operates and continues to make 
valuable resources available to the team responsible 
for M&A to ensure that opportunities are explored and 
evaluated appropriately.
Traffic shift to mobile: Digital advertising and sponsorship 
inventory is growing rapidly on mobile devices, but across 
many parts of the digital media industry mobile inventory 
revenues are growing less quickly than the traffic itself. This 
trend may affect the Group to some extent and impact the 
Group’s ability to monetise its inventory assets, which may in 
turn impact its results.
The Group continues to invest in mobilising all of its 
products to ensure equal usability for the users accessing 
our services via a smartphone. Additionally, all our 
advertising and sponsorship publishers now include a 
strong element of mobile inventory, which is driving growth.
Products: Constant technological and user behaviour changes 
necessitate that the Group engages in continuous and 
sometimes rapid product development. 
Management are highly focussed on ensuring that the 
Group makes maximum progress in this respect, but the 
Group’s strategy or its product innovations may not be 
successful or may take longer to deliver to the market or 
monetise than anticipated. This could impact the Group’s 
economic performance.

real, positive impact.
Perform Sporting Communities launched two projects in 2013
Indian playing fields
The Group provided support – funding, fundraising and 
in-kind advertising – to set up a series of initiatives across 
India to promote sports for all children. By tapping into 
children’s love of sports, the programme equipped them with 
vital knowledge and life skills to be able to make informed, 
independent decisions about their lives, such as deciding 
to complete school. The three-year programme is being 
delivered by the Company’s chosen charity partner – Plan 
International – a well-respected organisation that has a 
global presence.
The Group has pledged £250,000 over a three-year period 
– with Perform employees across the world taking part 
in fundraising activities to try and double this figure and 
increase the scope and reach of the project. Advertising 
opportunities across the Group’s owned websites will also 
promote Plan International.
Goal kit giveaway
In 2013 the Group offered 100 Goal branded football kits 
to community football teams around the world. Valued at 
£350 each, the kits were donated for free, with the Group’s 
staff nominating local groups that would benefit from them. 
Alongside this, local Goal editors and users were also asked to 
nominate community groups to receive the kits.
Nominations have been received from around the world, 
including Poland, Kenya, the USA and Germany – along with 
numerous UK submissions.
Other charitable donations
During the year, the Group donated £10,000 to charitable 
causes including the UK Children’s Heart Unit Fund and 
Kindergarden: Los Enanitos de la Esperanza.
During the year to 31 December 2012 the Group donated 
£20,000 to charitable causes including the Children’s Heart 
Unit Fund, York Against Cancer, the Dove T rust, Sport Relief, 
SME T rust and Grassroots Soccer.
During 2013 the Group established Perform Sporting Communities, a 
programme through which the Group will provide funding to support sporting 
activities that improve the lives of people, encourage healthier lifestyles and 
create better opportunities for education and social engagement.

• receive support in developing and implementing practical 
low or no cost actions for improving environmental 
performance; and
• assistance in engaging staff to ensure that improved 
environmental performance becomes part of the everyday 
work environment.
Employment policies
Equal opportunities and human rights
The Group’s policy is always to ensure that all persons are 
treated fairly irrespective of their age, race (including colour, 
nationality, ethnic or national origins), sexual orientation, 
disability, gender including gender reassignment, religious 
beliefs or political opinion, trade union membership or 
non-membership, marital and physical or mental status or 
any other factors including pregnancy and maternity. The 
Group endeavours to provide those who have physical or 
mental disabilities with equal opportunities in the application 
and recruitment process, and specific assistance and 
arrangements (including training, career development and 
promotion arrangements) to enable them to work for us 
wherever and whenever this is reasonably practicable.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to providing a consistently safe 
and effective working environment for all staff, including 
contractors, customers and members of the public. In doing 
so it will, as a minimum, comply with local health and safety 
legislation, but will exceed those requirements should it be 
necessary to do so. The Group has a Health and Safety Policy 
available to all employees and applied to the Group’s business 
operations worldwide. The Health and Safety Policy sets 
out the organisation and arrangements for achieving and 
maintaining adequate standards of health and safety at work 
throughout the Group. 
Overall, Group health and safety is the responsibility of 
the Chief Operating Officer. Each Executive member of 
the Group Board is responsible for giving appropriate 
consideration to the health and safety implications arising 
out of decisions or proposals made within the remit of their 
respective areas of corporate responsibility. 
For subsidiary companies, health and safety is the 
responsibility of the Managing Directors who will establish 
appropriate and effective systems and arrangements to 
ensure compliance and to achieve the corporate objectives. 
All employees are expected to exercise personal responsibility 
in preventing injury to themselves and others and to co-
operate with Management in complying with health and 
safety legislation. 
Employee involvement
Employee communication
The Group recruited a Chief People Officer (“CPO”) in 
March 2013 and he has sought to enhance the Group’s 
communications with its employees.
The Group believes that employee communication is 
important in building strong relationships with, and in 
motivating and retaining, employees. The Group makes use 
of various methods and channels including annual Senior 
Management seminars, weekly newsletters, face to face 
briefings, open discussion forums with Senior Management, 
team briefings, email and corporate internet to ensure that 
matters of interest and importance are conveyed to and 
heard from employees quickly and effectively and that all 
employees are aware of the financial and economic factors 
affecting the performance of the Company.
Employee share schemes
The Group recognises the importance of good relationships 
with employees of all levels. The Group operates a 
Performance Share Plan for Senior Management and a share 
save scheme available to all staff. Details of these plans are set 
out in note 26 to the financial statements.
Political donations
The Company made no political donations during the year.

The Board fully supports the principles of good corporate governance and is 
committed to the continuous improvement and development of appropriate 
structures, processes and procedures throughout the Group to bring these 
principles to life.
 
Our entrepreneurial culture is complemented by a strong governance framework 
which facilitates co-ordination throughout the Group, delivers financial efficiency 
and enables effective risk management consistent with the principles of good 
corporate governance. The Board is pleased to confirm its compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code in all respects.
 
The Board recognises its responsibility to ensure that the Group’s governance 
framework is focussed on improving the business, strengthening internal controls 
and management processes.
 
As such, under Simon and Oli’s leadership this year, the Group has introduced an 
Executive Committee. Simon and Oli are now supported by the Group’s Chief 
Operating Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, General 
Counsel and the Managing Directors of the Group’s Direct to Consumer and 
Content Distribution divisions and the APAC, EMEA and Americas regions as well 
as the Group’s new Chief Personnel Officer who joined in March 2013. In addition to 
optimising the allocation and adequacy of the Group’s resources they are also able 
to leverage synergies and efficiencies across the Group’s operations. 
 
I am currently supporting Simon and Oli and the Group’s Chief Personnel Officer in 
a rigorous search for the Group’s new Chief Financial Officer, who, on appointment, 
will join the Group’s Executive Committee and main board, as well as the Risk 
Committee. As mentioned in my opening Chairman’s statement, the Board are 
grateful to David Surtees for his six years’ service as Chief Financial Officer and 
wish him well. I would also like to welcome Richard McMorris, the Group’s General 
Counsel, as the Group’s new Company Secretary.
 
Key to giving the Board confidence in the Group’s approach to controls and risk 
is the effectiveness of the Group’s external audit process. Grant Thornton UK 
LLP had been the Group’s auditor since 2005. The Board, and Audit Committee, 
decided to issue a request for proposal for external audit and audit related services 
in light of the Group’s continued growth and international expansion and due to 
the mandatory rotation of the Grant Thornton audit partner. Following a thorough 
and rigorous process set out in the Audit Committee Report, Deloitte LLP were 
appointed as auditor.

Review sections on pages 1 to 41 report on the activities and results for the year and give an indication of the Company’s planned future

Directors’ Report 
54 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 In May 2012 the Group acquired RunningBall Holding AG via the acquisition of RunningBall’s two immediate holding companies for 
consideration of €120 million. Initial consideration of €70 million consisted of €20 million in cash, financed from existing cash resources, and 
€50 million in the form of 13.5 million new ordinary shares in the Company which were issued to the sellers. The number of issued shares was 
based on the average closing mid-market price of the Group’s ordinary shares and the average closing mid-point sterling:euro exchange rate 
over the 30 trading days preceding 15 May 2012. The fair value of the 13.5 million new ordinary shares issued was calculated based on the bid 
price at the date of acquisition. A merger relief reserve has been created to record the excess over nominal value on the issue of the shares in 
relation to the acquisition.
The Company does not hold any treasury shares.
The Company is subject to the continuing obligations contained in the Listing Rules with regard to the issue of ordinary shares for cash. 
The provisions of section 561(1) of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) (which confer on shareholders rights of pre-emption in respect of 
the allotment of equity securities which are, or are to be, paid up in cash other than by way of allotment to employees under any employees’ 
share scheme as defined in section 1166 of the Act) apply to the issue of shares in the capital of the Company except to the extent that such 
provisions were disapplied as set out in the Company’s Prospectus.
The Company may by ordinary resolution increase, consolidate, or subject to the Act, sub-divide its share capital. The Company may by 
ordinary resolution also cancel any shares which, at the date of the passing of the resolution, have not been taken or agreed to be taken by 
any person and diminish the amount of its authorised share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled. Subject to the provisions of the 
Act, the Company may by special resolution reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve and share premium account in any way.
Subject to the Act and without prejudice to any relevant special rights attached to any class of shares, the Company may purchase any of its 
own shares.
With regard to the appointment and replacement of Directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Corporate 
Governance Code 2010, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. The Articles of Association may be amended by special resolution 
of the shareholders.

Essential contracts
The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with suppliers of goods and services, including a variety of content rights-holders. 
Whilst these arrangements are important to the Group, individually none are them are essential to the business of the Group.
Corporate and social responsibility

• the approval of the interim and annual financial statements and interim management statements; and
• any interim dividend and the recommendation of any final dividend.
The Board held eight scheduled meetings during 2013. The Group’s strategy was regularly reviewed. All Directors participated in 
discussions relating to the Group’s strategy, financial and trading performance and risk management. The Board considers it met 
sufficiently often to enable the Directors to discharge their duties effectively.

Corporate Governance
58 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Board balance and independence
Paul Walker, Peter Williams, Marc Brown, Peter Parmenter and Gabby Logan are, in the opinion of the Board, independent of Management 
and free from any business relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Directors consider that the Board has an appropriate balance of skills and experience by virtue of the Directors’ varied backgrounds 
(see biographical details on pages 52 and 53).
Board appointments
Board nominations are recommended to the Board by the Nomination Committee under its terms of reference. All Directors are subject to 
re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter to re-election every year in line with 
the Company’s Articles of Association and provision A.7.1 of the Code.
Information and professional development
On appointment, Independent Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction, including meetings with members of the Management 
team and briefings on particular issues. 
As an ongoing process, Directors are briefed and provided with information concerning major developments affecting their roles and 
responsibilities. In particular, the Directors’ knowledge of the Group’s worldwide operations is regularly updated by arranging presentations 
from Senior Management throughout the Group. The Chairman and Executive Directors consult with each Non-Executive Director to ensure 
that they are all able to allocate sufficient time to the Group to discharge their responsibilities.
The Non-Executive Chairman works closely with the Company Secretary to ensure that the Board is supplied in a timely manner with 
information in a form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to effectively discharge its duties. Where there are occasions when Directors 
are unable to attend a meeting, they have the opportunity to review meeting papers and submit comments to the Non-Executive Chairman. 
Directors are also supplied with a monthly Chief Executive Officer report and a monthly financial report which provides the Board with 
information on operational and financial performance and the Group’s business plans.
All Directors are able to consult with the Company Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for the Board as a whole. Directors may obtain, in the furtherance of their duties, independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Group’s expense. In addition, all Directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and all 
Senior Management.
Board performance evaluation
The Board recognises that it is required to regularly undertake a formal and rigorous review of its performance and that of its committees. 
The Board engages in continuous self-assessment and analysis of its effectiveness. The Chairman and Company Secretary are already in the 
process of arranging full external evaluation of the Board’s effectiveness, anticipated to be complete by the end of Q3, 2014.
Committees
The Board is supported by a number of committees including the following principal committees: Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Nomination Committee. All the Independent Non-Executive Directors are members of each of the principal committees of 
the Board.
The terms of reference of each of the principal committees are available on request by writing to the Company Secretary at the 
Company’s registered address and are available on the Group’s website: http:/ /investors.performgroup.com/board-and-governance/ 
board-of-directors.aspx.
The committees, if they consider it necessary, can engage with third-party consultants and independent professional advisers and can call 
upon other resources of the Group to assist them in developing their respective roles.

Peter Williams (Chair) 3/3
Marc Brown 3/3
Peter Parmenter 2/3

The main roles and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set out in written terms of reference. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for:
• monitoring the integrity of the annual and half-yearly financial statements of the Group, and any formal announcements relating to the 
Group’s financial performance;
• assessing whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted, including reviewing significant financial reporting judgements;
• advising the Board on whether the Committee believes the annual financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and 
understandable, and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy;
• considering the scope of the annual external audit and the work undertaken by the external auditor;
• making recommendations for the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and approving their remuneration 
and terms of engagement;
• assessing the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the external auditor;
• developing and implementing policies on the engagement of the external auditor for the supply of non-audit services; 
• reviewing the Group’s internal financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems;
• overseeing the Group’s procedures for detecting fraud; and
• reviewing arrangements by which employees may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting and other matters.
The Board is satisfied, in accordance with the provisions of the Code, that at least one member of the Audit Committee has recent and 
relevant financial experience, given the nature of the Senior Management positions previously held by Peter Williams (see biographical 
details on pages 52 to 53).
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. The attendance record of Committee members is recorded in the table above. At the 
invitation of the Chairman of the Audit Committee, the Joint Chief Executive Officers, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chairman of the Board 
and the Group’s external auditors regularly attend meetings.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control procedures and risk 
management systems. The Audit Committee is also responsible for assessing whether the Group requires an internal audit function. 
The Group does not currently have an internal audit function. Given that most of the Group’s financial functions are currently centralised, 
such a function is not considered necessary. This will be reconsidered as the Group grows.
During the year the Audit Committee was presented by the Group’s Management with updates of the Group’s current internal control 
procedures and risk management systems. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements and the Group’s internal controls 
and risk management systems are appropriate. The Audit Committee considers that the Group has continued to make good progress 
on risk during the year, resulting in better process, understanding and awareness combined with a greater engagement right across 
the business. The debate on risk, risk tolerance and risk appetite will continue to be a focus for the Board and the Committee during the 
next year.
Peter Williams
Chairman of the 
Audit Committee
60 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 In addition, the Committee reviewed the adequacy of the “whistle-blowing” arrangements in place to enable employees to raise, in 
confidence, any concerns they may have. The Committee is satisfied that such arrangements remain appropriate.
Financial reporting and significant financial judgements
The Audit Committee reviews whether suitable accounting policies have been adopted, whether Management have made appropriate 
estimates and judgements and also seeks support from the external auditors to assess them. The Committee has reviewed the following 
principal issues for the year ended 31 December 2013:
• Accounting for acquisitions – appropriate identification and fair value determination of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions 
of Opta, Sporting News and Voetbalzone and the useful lives attached to each as well as the appropriate identification and fair value 
determination of other assets and liabilities arising from those acquisitions. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the accounting treatment 
adopted was appropriate.
• The Group, reflecting the acquisitive nature in the last two years, chooses to highlight a number of items as exceptional to better illustrate 
the underlying performance of the Group. These costs are non-recurring or relate directly to acquisitions. In addition, exceptional items 
include certain integration costs (including appropriate internal salary costs) which are expected to decline in 2014.
• Accounting for rights costs – appropriate recognition and valuation of rights costs including the appropriate consideration in relation to the 
Group’s change in accounting estimate for these costs. The revised approach, as more fully described in note 1 of the financial statements, 
requires estimates in respect of future pattern of economic benefits to the Group arising from these costs. The Audit Committee is 
satisfied that the accounting treatment adopted is appropriate and that the judgements underpinning this treatment – most notably in 
respect of future revenues attached to these costs – are appropriate.
• Consideration of impairment for goodwill with an indefinite useful life – considering whether goodwill with an indefinite useful life should 
be impaired is a judgmental exercise which requires estimates of future revenues, costs and the use of appropriate discount rates and 
growth rates based on the expected growth of the business. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the accounting treatment adopted is 
appropriate and that no impairments were required following a review of the underlying calculations and assumptions.
• Going concern – the Audit Committee has assessed the Group’s cashflow and bank covenant forecasts and is satisfied that the going 
concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Auditor appointment
Key to giving the Board confidence in the Group’s approach to controls and risk is the effectiveness of the Group’s external audit process. 
Grant Thornton UK LLP had been the Group’s auditor since 2005. Following the finalisation of the Group’s 2012 audit (being the first 
full financial year that the Group had operated as a public company) the Audit Committee considered Grant Thornton’s role as auditor. 
The Audit Committee concluded that in light of the following items it should issue a request for proposals for external audit and audit 
related services:
• 2012 represented the final year that the exiting Grant Thornton audit partner was allowed to serve under the Code, having completed 
seven years of service (five of which were before the Company’s listing); and
• the changing shape and continued international expansion of the Group both organically and by acquisition.
The Audit Committee issued a request for proposals to provide the following external audit and audit related services:
• The audit of the Group’s Parent Company, the Group’s accounts and those of certain subsidiaries;
• To report in the Annual Report whether certain remuneration and governance disclosures were in accordance with appropriate legislation 
and rules/regulations; and
• To review the interim financial statements.
Five firms were invited to tender, including the incumbent auditor. Their proposals were assessed by the Audit Committee against the 
following criteria:
• Organisation and capability – including the firm’s global coverage, experience, scope of service, technical expertise and support culture 
and independence assurance;
• Audit approach and delivery – including knowledge of the business, audit planning process, quality of accounting judgements, timely 
resolution of audit issues and transition experience;
• Audit quality – including quality assurance, audit effectiveness, audit reporting, integrity, independence, objectivity, process improvement 
and added value;
• Resourcing and engagement team – including quality of proposed engagement team, skills and personal qualities of audit partners and 
leadership, team structure, resourcing model and succession, responsiveness; and
• Fees and terms.

Report

Financial

continued
The process comprised the following stages:
• A review of an information dataroom compiled by the Group’s Management;
• Interviews for each firm with key members of Management;
• A written proposal to the Audit Committee; and
• T wo firms (KPMG LLP and Deloitte LLP) were then selected by the Audit Committee to make presentations to the Audit Committee and 
key management including one of the Group’s CEOs, the CFO, the Group Financial Controller, the Head of Financial Reporting and the 
General Counsel.
All five firms met the criteria for appointment; the Committee concluded, however, that Deloitte demonstrated the most appropriate audit 
approach and the capability to deliver a high-quality audit service to the Group. There were, and are, no contractual obligations restricting 
the Group’s choice of independent auditor. 
The Committee notes the latest guidance from the Financial Reporting Council following the report from the Competition Commission 
issued on 15 October 2013. Amongst other things this requires the Audit Committee to: 
• Assume sole responsibility for audit matters such as agreeing audit scope and audit fees, advising the Board on the reappointment of 
external auditor and initiating tenders;
• Initiate a new advisory vote on the Audit Committee report;
• Issue a mandatory tender of the external audit every ten years;
• Note the increased frequency of reviews by the Financial Reporting Council’s Audit Quality Review team and the public disclosure of the 
grade awarded following the review; and
• Ensure compliance with the prohibition of “Big Four only” clauses in loan documentation.
The Committee has reviewed the guidance and will implement these recommendations as required for the 2014 financial year.
Despite appointing a new auditor in the year any recommendation for their reappointment will be the subject of rigorous review each year. 
Indeed, the Audit Committee has adopted a formal framework in its review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit 
quality which will involve consideration of the following: the audit partners, with focus on the lead audit engagement partner, the audit team, 
planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas of audit risk, the execution of the audit, the role of Management in an effective 
audit process, communications by the auditors with the Audit Committee, how the auditors support the work of the Audit Committee, how 
the audit contributes insights and added value, a review of independence and objectivity of the audit firm and the quality of the formal audit 
report to shareholders.
Effectiveness of the external audit process
An assessment of the external audit process will be completed each year by the Audit Committee and senior members of the Company’s 
finance team. Feedback will also be sought from the CEOs and divisional management. The assessment tool adopted will be comprehensive 
and will be completed by way of a formal questionnaire in the first year and thereafter every three years, with the key areas being reviewed 
every year. The feedback from this process will be considered by the Audit Committee and will be provided both to the auditors and to 
Management. Action plans arising will also be reviewed by the Committee.
The effectiveness of Management in the external audit process is assessed principally in relation to the timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers analysing those judgements, Management’s approach to the value 
of the independent audit, the booking of any audit adjustments arising and the timely provision of draft public documents for review by the 
auditor and the Audit Committee.
Every three years, the Audit Committee will request that a partner independent of the audit engagement team discusses the quality of the 
external audit process with the Audit Committee chairman and the CFO using this evaluation framework.
Non-audit services and independence
The Audit Committee will also assess the audit firm’s independence through challenge to Management. The Audit Committee has 
considered, and will continue to consider, the audit firm’s independence with reference to their audit and non-audit fees which for 2013 are 
set out in note 4 to the financial statements. The Audit Committee has concluded that the audit firm is independent. 
The Committee recognises that the independence of the auditors is an essential part of the audit framework and the assurance that it 
provides. The Committee monitors the types of non-audit work that are undertaken by the external auditor to ensure that their objectivity 
and independence is not compromised. Any significant proposed non-audit assignments require prior approval and the Committee receives 
a report at each meeting providing details of non-audit assignments carried out by the external auditor in addition to their audit work.
62 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Accountability 
The Board acknowledges that this report should present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Group’s position and 
prospects. In this context, reference should be made to the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement which includes a statement in compliance 
with the Code regarding the Group’s status as a going concern, and to the independent auditor’s report which includes a statement by the 
auditor about their reporting responsibilities. The Board recognises that its responsibility to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment extends to interim and other price-sensitive public reports and reports to regulators as well as information required to be 
presented by law.
At the request of the Board, the Audit Committee considered whether the 2013 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and 
whether it provided the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy. The Audit 
Committee is satisfied that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.
Internal control
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and the Audit Committee reviews its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Audit Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the key 
procedures which have been established to ensure internal control. As part of this review there are procedures designed to capture and 
evaluate failings and weaknesses, and in the case of those categorised by the Board as significant, procedures exist to ensure that necessary 
action is taken to remedy the failings.
In accordance with the revised guidance for Directors on internal control (“the Revised Turnbull Guidance”), the Board confirms that there 
is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. These include those relating to 
social, environmental and ethical matters. This process was in place throughout 2013 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. The process is regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee which reports its findings for consideration by the Board and is in 
accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance. The key procedures operating within the Group were as follows:
• during the year the Audit Committee met to evaluate risk and consider the appropriateness of the Group’s risk assessment systems and 
internal control policies;
• the Group consists of a number of units each with its own management structure which forms part of the overall management structure 
of the Group. The senior executives of these units report to the Executive Directors on a monthly basis;
• the significant risks faced by the Group are considered regularly by the Group’s Risk Committee and the Executive Committee is charged 
with the development and implementation of appropriate monitoring and mitigation plans, where appropriate;
• the Group has a comprehensive system of budgetary and re-forecasting control, focused on monthly performance reporting which is at 
an appropriate detailed level. A summary supported by commentary and performance measures is presented to the Board each month. 
The performance measures are subject to review to ensure that they provide relevant and reliable indications of business performance;
• the Group has established procedures for the delegation of authority;
• the Group’s divisions operate within a framework of policies and procedures which are laid down in policy and procedure manuals and 
cover key issues such as authorisation levels; and
• the Group has established policies and procedures designed to ensure the maintenance of accurate accounting records sufficient 
to enable the preparation of financial statements, and consolidated financial statements, in accordance with the financial reporting 
frameworks applicable to the Group, the main feature of which is a structured system of review and approval by Management and 
the Board.

Annual Remuneration Committee 
Chairman Statement
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Our remuneration policy is designed to support the Group’s business vision and strategy while aligning rewards to individual and Group 
performance. The Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure that pay and performance are closely aligned, that the structure 
incentivises achievement of stretch performance targets, that the policy reinforces alignment with shareholder interests through share 
ownership and that remuneration is appropriately competitive to support the recruitment and retention of employees of outstanding calibre.
It is with these objectives in mind that the Committee reviewed the policy during the year. As a result of this continual review, the Committee 
determined several revisions were appropriate beginning with calendar year 2014 to the annual bonus scheme and to the alignment of the 
remuneration policy for key senior employees with that for Executive Directors.
Specifically, the annual bonus has been refined as follows:
• An increase in bonus opportunity from 25% of salary to 100% of salary to ensure the remuneration policy is appropriately competitive and 
to encourage achievement of annual objectives;
• Introduction of a performance underpin such that, for any annual bonus to be paid, the Committee must judge that the Executive 
Director’s personal performance has been satisfactory during the year under review;
• Widening of the performance range to ensure that annual performance targets are stretching and achievable, so that vesting begins at 
‘threshold’, increases to ‘target’, with full vesting for ‘stretch’ performance; and,
• Introduction of bonus deferral, so that one-third of any annual bonus paid is deferred in Perform shares for three years.
During the year the Committee also introduced share ownership guidelines for both Executive Directors and Executive Committee 
members. In addition, the Committee intends to extend participation of the PSP further into the organisation to support a performance-
oriented culture and strengthen the alignment between rewards for senior executives and the Group’s long-term strategy.
The Committee is mindful of the need to reinforce the link between remuneration and Group performance and is satisfied that the incentive 
outcomes in 2013 prove this to be the case. The PSP awards granted in 2011 were subject to three-year revenue growth targets and Adjusted 
EPS growth targets; over this period the Group’s performance exceeded this stretch revenue growth target of 40% p.a. and achieved 
Adjusted EPS growth of 35% p.a. and the Committee therefore determined that the 2011 PSP awards would vest as to 50% of maximum. 
Based on annual performance no bonus was payable to Executive Directors.
We have written our Remuneration Report in order to comply with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group’s Regulations 2013. 
Unlike last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, this year’s report is divided into three sections:
• This Annual Statement.
• The Policy Report, which sets out our forward-looking remuneration policy. We propose that this will apply from the date of our 2014 
AGM, subject to obtaining shareholder approval.
• The Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out how our Directors were paid in the year ending 31 December 2013 and how the 
Policy will apply for the year ending 31 December 2014.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report will be subject to two votes at our 2014 AGM. As set out in the Notice to the AGM, the Policy Report will 
be put to a binding vote, and the Annual Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory vote.
The Committee believes that the Group’s remuneration policy and the revisions made during the year reinforce our objectives and provide effective 
incentives for exceptional Group and individual performance. We fully support the aim of the reporting arrangements to increase transparency 
related to this topic and we welcome any feedback you may have on our remuneration policy and Directors’ Remuneration Report.

Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee
66 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 This section of the report sets out the remuneration policy for Directors which shareholders are asked to approve at the 2014 AGM. 
The Committee intends that this policy will formally come into effect from approval at the 2014 AGM. The information provided in this part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Our remuneration policy is designed to support our business vision and the implementation of our strategy. It aims to deliver a remuneration 
package that:
• can attract, retain and motivate high-quality talent in a challenging and competitive business environment;
• delivers an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation;
• places strong emphasis on performance, both short and long-term;
• strongly aligns achievement of strategic objectives and delivery of sustainable value to shareholders interests; and
• seeks to avoid incentivising excessive risk taking.
The Group seeks to achieve this alignment over both the short and long-term through the use of an annual performance-related bonus 
which rewards the achievement of a balanced mix of financial, operational and other relevant performance measures, and the use of a 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) which is currently linked to revenue growth and Adjusted EPS growth.
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on 
remuneration for senior executives. Remuneration decisions are also informed by external considerations, including global demand for talent.
Remuneration paid to Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors in 2013 and remuneration arrangements proposed for 2014 are set 
out later in this report.

Performance is determined by 
the Committee on an annual 
basis by reference to Group 
financial measures (e.g. Group 
Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA), 
as well as the achievement of 
personal or strategic objectives
The financial and personal/
strategic objectives are typically 
weighted 67% and 33% of 
maximum, respectively
The Committee uses its 
judgement to determine 
the outcome of personal or 
strategic objectives
A review of the quality of 
earnings is conducted by 
the Committee to determine 
whether any adjustments 
should be made to the reported 
profit for the purpose of bonus 
outcomes, where appropriate, 
so that bonus outcomes are 
fair and not impacted by 
unbudgeted non-recurring or 
one-off items, or circumstances 
outside of Management’s 
control that could distort the 
overall quality of earnings
The Committee reserves the 
right to make adjustments 
to payments up or down, 
within the limits of the Plan, if 
it believes exceptional factors 
warrant doing so. Any discretion 
exercised will be justified in the 
following annual report

Notes to the policy table
Payments from existing awards
Executive Directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration 
policy detailed in this report. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measurement selection and approach to target setting
Performance targets are set to be stretching and achievable, taking into account the Company’s strategic priorities and the economic 
environment in which the Company operates. Targets are set taking into account a range of reference points including the Group’s strategic 
plan and broker forecasts for both the Group and sector peers. For the annual bonus, performance targets for financial measures are set 
with reference to the Company’s budget for the year. The Committee believes that the performance targets set are stretching, and that the 
maximum outcomes are only available for truly outstanding performance.
The measures used under the annual bonus are selected annually to reflect the Group’s main strategic objectives for the year and reflect 
both financial and non-financial priorities.
The Committee considers that Adjusted EPS growth and revenue continue to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance 
of the Company as they are transparent and well-aligned with shareholder interests and Company strategy. The above policy has been 
designed to be sufficiently flexible to allow the Committee to introduce additional measures for future cycles to ensure that the vesting of 
awards continues to drive the delivery of Company strategy.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy

Remuneration policy for other employees
Remuneration arrangements are determined throughout the Group based on the same principle – that reward should support our business 
strategy and should be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high-performing individuals without paying more than is necessary. Perform 
is a global organisation with employees at a number of different levels of seniority and in a number of different countries and while this 
principle underpins all reward arrangements, the way it is implemented varies by geography and level.
Many employees participate in cash-based annual incentives or sales commission plans (opportunities and specific performance conditions 
vary by organisational level with business area-specific metrics incorporated where appropriate), and key senior executives participate in the 
performance share plan. Benefits for employees around the Group reflect the local labour market in which they are based. All employees in 
the UK currently participate in similar pension arrangements as the Executive Directors. 
Pay scenario charts
The charts below provide an estimate of the potential future reward opportunities for the Executive Directors, and the potential split 
between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: ‘Minimum’, ‘On-target’ and ‘Maximum’.
Potential reward opportunities are based on Perform’s remuneration policy, applied to basic salaries as at 1 January 2014. Note that the 
projected values exclude the impact of any share price movements and dividend accrual. 
The ‘Minimum’ scenario shows basic salary, pension and benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration). These are the only elements of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration packages which are not at risk.
The ‘On-Target’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus a target payout of 50% of the annual bonus and threshold vesting of 25% 
of the maximum award under the PSP.
The ‘Maximum’ scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout of all incentives.
Approach to recruitment remuneration
External appointments
In the event of hiring a new Executive Director, the Committee will typically align the remuneration package with the above remuneration 
policy. However, the Committee retains the discretion to make remuneration proposals on hiring a new Executive Director which are outside 
the standard policy to facilitate the hiring of someone to the calibre required to deliver the Group’s strategy, as follows:
Component Approach Maximum annual grant value
Basic salary The basic salary will be determined by reference to external data which 
takes into account the new appointee’s duties and responsibilities, as well as 
internal relativities and their current remuneration. Where new appointees 
have initial basic salaries set below market, larger increases may be made 
over a period of years as part of phased increases to market, subject to the 
executive’s development in the role
Pension New appointees will be entitled to become members of the Company’s 
defined contribution scheme or receive a cash alternative on the same terms 
as other executives
Benefits and SAYE New appointees will be eligible to receive benefits and participate in SA YE in 
line with the policy

PSP New appointees will be granted awards under the PSP on the same terms as

150% of salary,

In determining the appropriate remuneration for a new Executive Director, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors 
(including the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of 
Perform and its shareholders.
The Committee may also make an award in respect of a new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a 
previous employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these 
awards and the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the Committee may avail itself of Listing Rule 9.4.2 R if appropriate (which 
provides for awards outside of the normal long-term incentive structure provided the ‘arrangement is established specifically to facilitate, in 
unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of the relevant individual’). In certain circumstances, for example in order to rebalance 
the pay mix for a new Executive Director towards the long-term and to ensure the overall fair value of the package is maintained, the 
Committee may grant a sign-on award as part of the initial package. In doing so, the Committee will ensure that the award is granted in 
Company shares and subject to performance conditions, and may additionally apply a holding period.
Internal promotion
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the Committee will determine remuneration in line with the 
policy for external appointees as detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to his promotion to the 
Board, the Company will continue to honour these arrangements. Incentive opportunities for below Board employees are typically no higher 
than for Executive Directors, but measures may vary to provide better line-of-sight. For more details on the remuneration policy for other 
employees see page 70. 
NED recruitment
In recruiting a new Non-Executive Director, the Committee will use the policy as set out in the table on page 73. A base fee in line with the 
prevailing market rate would be payable for Board membership, with additional fees payable for acting as Senior Independent Director or as 
Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees as appropriate.

The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate the employment by giving 
12 months’ written notice and that the Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice, in line with the practice of many comparable 
companies. The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide that their remuneration is reviewed (although not necessarily increased) at 
least on an annual basis. Executive Director service contracts are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
If employment is terminated by the Company, the departing Executive Director may have a legal entitlement (under statute or otherwise) 
to additional amounts, which would need to be met. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to settle any other amounts reasonably 
due to the Executive Director, for example to meet the legal fees incurred by the Executive Director in connection with the termination 
of employment, where the Company wishes to enter into a settlement agreement (as provided for below) and the individual must seek 
independent legal advice.
In certain circumstances, the Committee may approve new contractual arrangements with departing Executive Directors including (but not 
limited to) settlement, confidentiality, restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements. These will be used sparingly and only entered 
into where the Committee believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to do so.

Non-Executive Directors
The terms of engagement of Non-Executive Directors are set out in letters of appointment. Non-Executive Directors are currently appointed  
for a three-year term, subject to satisfactory performance, re-nomination and re-election at annual shareholder meetings. Non-Executive 
Directors may terminate their engagement upon written notice. The letters of appointment do not contain provision for notice periods or 
compensation if their appointments are terminated by Perform except in the case of the Chairman. The Chairman’s appointment is terminable 
by either party giving to the other three months’ written notice or at any time in accordance with the Articles or the Act. The Company has the 
ability to terminate this appointment by the payment of a cash sum in lieu of notice equal to the fee payable for any unexpired portion of the 
notice period. Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are available to view at the Company’s registered office.
72 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Details of the Non-Executive Directors’ terms of appointment are shown in the table. The appointment and re-appointment and the 
remuneration of Non-Executive Directors are matters reserved for the full Board.

The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Company’s performance-related incentive plans and do not receive any 
pension contributions.
External appointments policy
The Board recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to serve as directors of other companies which can bring benefits to the 
Group. Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing that the Chairman’s permission is sought 
and granted. The policy is that fees may be retained by the Director, reflecting the personal risk assumed in such appointments. Details of 
external appointments and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on 
remuneration for senior executives. For example, the Company’s approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with 
consideration given to the scope of the role, level of experience, responsibility, individual performance and pay levels in comparable 
companies. The Committee does not currently consult with employees specifically on the effectiveness and appropriateness of the 
executive remuneration policy and framework. However, the Company seeks to promote and maintain good relationships with employee 
representative bodies as part of its employee engagement strategy and consults on matters affecting employees and business performance 
as required in each case by law and regulation in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Company consults regularly with shareholders on all matters affecting its strategy and business operations. As part of that process, 
we also engage with shareholders on matters relating to executive remuneration. When determining remuneration, the Committee takes 
into account views of shareholders and best practice guidelines issued by institutional shareholder bodies. The Committee is always open 
to feedback from shareholders on remuneration policy and arrangements, and intends to consult with shareholders in advance of any 
significant changes to remuneration policy going forwards. The Committee will continue to monitor trends and developments in corporate 
governance and market practice to ensure the structure of the executive remuneration remains appropriate.

Committee are reviewed annually and can be accessed on the Perform website (www.performgroup.com).
The Committee’s main responsibilities
The Committee’s duties include:
• Setting a remuneration strategy that ensures the most talented leaders are recruited, retained and motivated to deliver results;
• Reviewing the effectiveness and appropriateness of the remuneration policy;
• Determining the terms of employment and remuneration for Executive Directors and Senior Managers including recruitment and 
termination arrangements;
• Approving the design, targets and payments for all short and long-term incentives for Executive Directors and Senior Managers; and

Committee’s advisers
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings to provide advice so as to ensure that the Committee’s decisions are informed and 
take account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole. These individuals include the Chairman, the Joint Chief Executive Officers, 
Company Secretary, Chief People Officer and Global Head of Reward. No individual was present when their own remuneration was 
being discussed.
The Committee also receives advice from independent consultants. During the year the Committee received advice from the 
following consultants:
Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) was appointed by the Committee in October 2013 following a competitive tender process. The Committee 
undertakes due diligence periodically to ensure that Kepler remains independent of the Company and that the advice provided is impartial 
and objective. Kepler is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants, details of which can be 
found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. In 2013, Kepler Associates provided independent advice on executive remuneration and 
incentive design, and provided remuneration data. Kepler Associates does not advise the Company on any other matters. Their total fees for 
the provision of remuneration services to the Committee in 2013 were £38,500 on the basis of time and materials.
Shareholder voting
Perform remains committed to ongoing shareholder dialogue and takes an active interest in voting outcomes. In the event of a substantial 
vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ remuneration, Perform would seek to understand the reasons for any vote and would set 
out in the following Annual Report and Accounts any actions in response to it.

Variable pay awarded in respect of the financial year
For 2013, one-third of the annual bonus was measured against each of EBITDA, revenue and personal performance. Given the close link 
between these targets and Perform’s longer-term strategy, the Committee has deemed that the targets remain commercially sensitive 
and will not be published. The Committee intends to disclose bonus targets for future years on a retrospective basis when they cease to be 
commercially sensitive. The Remuneration Committee determined that no bonus awards will be granted in respect of performance in 2013.

Annual bonus
For 2014 the Committee has approved an annual bonus opportunity for the Joint CEOs and the CFO in line with the stated remuneration 
policy. For 2014, bonuses will be based on Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and personal performance, each equally weighted.
The Adjusted EBITDA, revenue and personal performance targets set by the Committee require Executive Directors to deliver significant 
stretch performance. Given the close link between these targets and Perform’s longer-term strategy, targets remain commercially sensitive 
and will not be published until such time that the Committee is confident there will be no adverse impact on the Company of such 
disclosure. At this time the Committee believes that disclosure of targets in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report is appropriate.
PSP
The Annual Report on Remuneration is published prior to the date of grant of awards under the PSP.
For 2014, the Committee intends to grant PSP awards to Executive Directors in line with the stated remuneration policy.
Detail of these awards will be set out in next year’s report.
Pension and benefits
The Joint CEOs and the CFO will receive matching contributor pensions contributions of 5% of salary and benefits in line with the stated 
remuneration policy. 
NED fees
The annual fees payable to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors were reviewed effective 1 January 2013 taking into account general

80 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors have to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs) and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent Company accounts in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Practice and applicable laws). Under company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs and profit or loss of the 
Parent Company and Group for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions 
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Opinion on financial statements of Perform Group plc
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union;
•  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of cash flows 
and the related notes 1 to 32 and the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 7. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation as applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company 
financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 57 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
•  we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is 
appropriate; and
•  we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition
The completeness of revenue arising from video and display 
advertising as a result of the complexity of the Group’s 
customer contracts.
We assessed management’s process and controls over the completeness and 
validity of advertising revenue. We substantively tested a sample of revenue 
items by reference to individual sales insertion orders, independent data on the 
adverts viewed and the ultimate invoicing.
Acquisition accounting
The Group made a number of acquisitions in the period. There 
a number of judgements associated with this including the 
identification and fair value determination of intangible assets 
arising and the useful economic lives assigned to such assets. 
This process involves assumptions and Management judgement 
particularly with respect to the estimate of future cash flows, 
associated discount rates and useful economic lives.
The two principal acquisitions in the year were Perform Sporting News and 
Opta. We tested the design and implementation of the controls over the 
identification of intangible assets. We assessed whether the intangible assets 
met the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations for separate recognition 
and used our internal valuation specialists to challenge the inputs to the valuation 
models used to determine the value of the intangible assets. We also challenged 
the discount rates, estimated cash flows, growth rates and useful lives used by  
comparing to historical data, where appropriate, or industry benchmarks on 
similar assets and our understanding of the future prospects of the businesses. 
84 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Content costs
The Group significantly increased its investment in content 
rights during the period. Management has revised the 
approach to the recognition of costs in the Income Statement 
to be based on the pattern in which the future economic 
benefits of the content rights are expected to be consumed 
by the Group. This has been accounted for as a change 
in accounting estimate. This revised approach requires 
Management to estimate expected usage of content rights by 
reference to the estimated future economic benefits arising. 
We evaluated the method for recognition of content costs, including the 
appropriateness of the change in accounting estimate and associated 
disclosures, taking into account the expected profiles of future usage 
associated with these rights costs based upon contractual data available and 
historic trends.
Impairment of goodwill
The Group’s assessment of impairment of goodwill requires 
Management judgement and is based on estimates of 
future cash flows, long-term growth rate, and associated 
discount rate.
We challenged Management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for 
goodwill. We specifically assessed the cash flow projections, discount rate and 
long-term growth rate used against our understanding of the future prospects 
of the business and the prevailing Group cost of capital at the year end.
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 61.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to 
express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the 
risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £1.15 million, which is below 5% of adjusted profit before tax, and is below 2% of equity. Adjusted 
profit before tax is defined as Group profit before tax excluding exceptional items (including exceptional finance charges ), share based 
payments, amortisation of acquisition intangibles and the accretion of acquisition-related deferred consideration. These adjustments are made 
consistently by the Group in their earnings communications with the market and, in the opinion of the Directors, provide a more comparable 
measure with similar organisations and are consistent with the profit measures most relevant to analysts and investors.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £23,000, as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on 
disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our group audit scope focussed primarily on the audit work at seven locations; four of these were subject to a full audit (Switzerland, USA and the 
London offices of Perform and Opta ). The remaining three were subject to an audit of specified account balances where the extent of our testing 
was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. These locations 
represent the principal business locations and account for 97% of the Group’s total assets, 98% of the Group’s revenue and 89% of the Group’s profit 
before tax. All locations making a profit greater than materiality were included in the scope. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for 
undertaking audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work at the full scope locations was executed at levels 
of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality .
 
The Senior Statutory Auditor visited the principal overseas operating location.  In years when a location is not visited, a senior member of the 
Group team attends the close meeting by conference call.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 85
Strategic  
Report
Corporate  
Governance
Financial 
Statements Independent auditor’s report to the members 
of Perform Group plc continued
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have not been 
made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have 
nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s 
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual 
report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing 
our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit 
and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report 
appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied.  
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team, strategically focussed second partner reviews 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our 
audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other 
than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation 
of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or 
materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

General Information
Perform Group plc is a public limited liability company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. 
The address of the registered office is Sussex House, Plane Tree Crescent, Feltham, Middlesex, TW13 7HE. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors’ Report (on page 54).
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
Group operates. Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards
IFRS 13 – Fair Value Measurement – The Group has applied IFRS 13 for the first time in the current year. IFRS 13 establishes a single source 
of guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures about fair value measurements. IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would 
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the 
measurement date under current market conditions. IFRS 13 requires prospective disclosure from 1 January 2013. In accordance with 
these transitional provisions, other than additional disclosures presented, the application of IFRS 13 has not had any material impact on the 
amounts recognised in the Group financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 1 – Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income – This amendment requires items of other comprehensive 
income to be grouped by those items that will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and those that will never be reclassified, 
together with their associated income tax. The amendments have been applied retrospectively, and hence the presentation of items of 
comprehensive income have been restated to reflect the change. The effect of these changes is evident from the condensed consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
New and revised Standards on consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosure – In May 2011, a package of five standards on 
consolidation, joint arrangements, associates and disclosures was issued comprising IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 
Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, IAS 27 (as revised in 2011) Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 (as 
revised in 2011) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. The Group have applied these standards for the first time in the current year, 
although there has been no material impact on the results, disclosures or financial position of the Group.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
• IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective 1 January 2015);
• Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities – Amendments to IAS 32 (effective 1 January 2014);
• Mandatory Effective Date and Transition Disclosures – Amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 (effective 1 January 2015);
• Investment Entities – Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 (effective 1 January 2014); and
• IFRIC 21 Levies (effective 1 January 2014).
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the 
Group in future periods except that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed.
Basis of accounting
The Group’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with applicable 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements 
have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply 
with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments that are 
measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on 
the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Notes to the Group financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2013
92 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 
31 December each year. Control is achieved when the Company:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of 
the three elements of control listed above.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins where the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control 
of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling 
interests. Total comprehensive income of the subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests 
even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with 
those used by the Group. All intra-Group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between the 
members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. The interests of non-controlling 
shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s 
identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying 
amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity. 
Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration 
paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in profit or loss is calculated as the difference 
between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous 
carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. All amounts previously 
recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the 
related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equity as specified/
permitted by applicable IFRS). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded 
as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement or, when 
applicable, the costs on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or jointly controlled entity.
Going concern
The Group had cash balances of £101.0 million at the year end and £48.3 million of debt relating to borrowings. Having reviewed cash 
flow forecasts and budgets the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future, being a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Further detail is contained in the Directors’ statement of 
going concern in the Directors’ Report (see page 57).
Business combinations
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, 
and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of 
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or 
loss as a bargain purchase gain.

1. Accounting policies continued
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Contingent and deferred consideration arising as a result of acquisitions is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of 
the consideration transferred in a business combination. Contingent and deferred consideration is based on management’s best estimate of 
the likely outcome and best estimate of fair value, which is usually, but not always, a contracted formula based on a multiple of EBITDA. The 
contingent and deferred consideration is recorded as a liability and changes in fair value that qualify as measurement period adjustments 
are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise 
from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts 
and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. 
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent and deferred consideration that do not qualify as measurement 
period adjustments depends on how this is classified. Contingent and deferred consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured 
at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent and deferred consideration that is 
classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition 
and Measurement, or IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss 
being recognised in profit or loss.
To the extent that contingent consideration is substantively linked to employment or service conditions, where the selling shareholders 
continue to provide post-combination services those payments will be charged to the Income Statement as a remuneration over the 
relevant period. 
Where the Group has an option to acquire a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary the fair value of that option is recognised as a liability 
with a corresponding movement in reserves, in accordance with IAS 27. The changes in fair value of the option at each reporting date are 
recognised in the Income Statement. If the contingent consideration is subject to service-related provisions it is charged through the Income 
Statement as a service cost over the relevant period. However, if there are no service related conditions, the changes in the fair value are 
recognised in the Income Statement as a finance cost.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the 
Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the 
measurement period or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that 
existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Additional consideration and details with respect to the Group’s policies relating to the acquisition of non-controlling interests and contingent 
consideration are set out in “critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty” below.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after re-assessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration 
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the 
acquiree (if any), the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is internally monitored for impairment purposes at the level of the Group’s single operating segment – accordingly the Group only 
has one cash-generating unit (“CGU”) for impairment testing purposes. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is 
not amortised.
The recoverable amount of the Group’s CGU is determined from value in use calculations. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation is treated as an 
asset of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
94 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services falling within the Group’s continuing ordinary activities, after the 
deduction of value added tax. Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Content distribution
Content distribution relates to sales of the Group’s Watch&Bet, Opta, Omnisport, GSM, WatchandTrade and RunningBall products. Content 
distribution revenue is recognised over the course of the contract using a stage of completion method. Stage of completion is measured 
as the ratio of value of content delivered to date to total value of content to be delivered over the life of the contract period. Any content 
distribution monies received in advance of the contract commencing are recognised in current liabilities as deferred income.
Subscription
Sales of online subscription products, mobile downloads, online pay-per-view transactions and sms alerts are recognised on a gross basis 
evenly over the period in which the service is provided by the Group. The client’s shares of such revenues are shown within cost of sales.
Technology and production
Service fees generated from the ongoing provision of website servicing, maintenance and hosting to customers are recognised in line with 
the service delivery to the customer, which is usually evenly across a contractual period. Fees arising from the building of products for 
customers or for structural enhancements to existing customer products are recognised in line with contractual milestones (which reflect the 
stage of completion) during the contractual build period.
Advertising and sponsorship (display and video)
Revenue related to sponsorship activity is recognised in line with the services physically delivered compared to the services specified within 
a contract agreed with an advertiser.
Revenue related to display and video advertising is recognised based on the number of advertising impressions physically delivered 
compared to the required number of advertising impressions included within a contract agreed with either a brand or an advertising agency. 
Where the Group is selling advertising to a third-party website, revenue is recognised on a gross basis as the Company bears the credit risk. 
The client’s shares of such revenues are shown within cost of sales. 
Content costs
The Group typically licenses the right (from sports associations, sports bodies, leagues or their agents or partners) to supply live sports 
content to online bookmakers and/or to supply aggregated non-exclusive video-on-demand (typically highlights) via the Group’s 
embeddable video player (embedded on publisher websites) or distributed in a news feed (typically highlights).
The rights the Group licenses are for a fixed period of time, typically three years. The rights are generally paid in instalments over the length 
of the contract, typically quarterly in advance (and as such the Group will recognise a prepayment).
Previously the Group recognised an expense for sports streaming rights when the sporting event was streamed. During the year the 
Group invested significantly in new rights for the 2014-16 W&B licence period and growth of the ePlayer globally and as a result the 
Directors determined that the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits attributed to those rights would not follow the 
previously applied pattern, with greater weight being attributed to the 2014-2016 events than the 2013 events. The Group now amortises its 
payments for sports streaming rights to cost of sales, based on a weighting of when the value of the rights will be returned, over a period 
not exceeding the contractual period. See Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty on page 100 for 
further detail.

Exceptional items
The Group aggregates, highlights and separately presents significant income or costs due to their nature within its Income Statement. 
The Directors consider that this presentation provides a more helpful analysis of the Group’s underlying performance particularly when it is 
undertaking acquisitions. The policy requires the Directors to exercise judgement in determining such items.
Items which may be included within this category include:
• Costs directly relating to acquisition activity including earn-out related incentive arrangements classified as remuneration, changes to the 
assessment of acquisition-related financial liabilities, consultancy, legal, finance and other professional adviser costs that otherwise would 
not have been incurred had the acquisition not occurred;
• Acquisition integration costs including dual-running costs, contracts identified as onerous as a consequence of integration decisions, 
consultancy, redundancy, and project management and related costs (which may include those of employed staff specifically engaged to 
assist the integration of acquisitions);
• Reorganisation and restructuring costs including dual-running costs, contracts identified as onerous as a consequence of reorganisation 
or restructuring decisions, consultancy redundancy, and project management and related restructuring costs (which may include those of 
employed staff specifically engaged for a limited period of time to assist the management of reorganisations and restructures);
• Significant unforeseen gains/losses arising on foreign exchange assets or liabilities relating to non-trading items such as contingent 
consideration or bank loans; and
• Other particularly significant or unusual items which may include but are not limited to profits or losses on disposal or termination of 
operations or assets, litigation costs and settlements.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value, or if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a 
finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to 
qualifying assets in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement over the term of the relevant lease and in accordance with the terms 
of the relevant leases. Operating lease costs relating to accommodation are recognised in the Income Statement under ‘ Administrative expenses’.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more 
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates. For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are retranslated 
to pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are 
recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities 
that are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss 
in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated to 
pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of 
transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. 
The Group elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
96 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred, except to the extent that these are directly 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets. Such borrowing costs are added to the cost of those assets.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and further excludes items that are never 
taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition (other than in a 
business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to 
control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other 
comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and 
liabilities on a net basis. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognised as an administrative expense 
and provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its residual value, using the straight-line 
method, over its expected useful life as follows:
• Freehold land and buildings – indefinite life
• Internet hosting platform – three years
• Office furniture and equipment – three years
• Leasehold improvements – three years
• Motor vehicles – three years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, over 
the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets – computer software development
Where in the opinion of the Directors, the Group’s expenditure in relation to development of software results in future economic benefits, 
these costs (including directly attributable overheads) are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset.
Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 97
Strategic  
Report
Corporate  
Governance
Financial 
Statements 1. Accounting policies continued
Development costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefit will result from the project and the following criteria 
are met:
• the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete and sell or use the intangible asset;
• the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate future economic benefits and the ability to use or sell the intangible 
asset can be demonstrated;
• it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use it or sell it; and
• the development costs can be measured reliably.
Where these criteria are not met development costs are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Amortisation is recognised as an administrative expense and provided on computer software development at a rate calculated to write each 
asset down to its estimated residual value (assumed to be nil), using the straight-line method, over three years. 
Methods of amortisation, residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Intangible assets – other
Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations, that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. Amortisation is recognised as an administration expense and amortised, on a straight-
line basis, over their useful economic life on the following basis:
• Trademarks/domain names/URLs – twenty years
• Database content – three to twelve years
• Customer relationships – three to twelve years
• Website architecture – three to twelve years
• Software – three to twelve years
After consideration by the Directors in light of the size of the acquisitions, the nature of the assets acquired, competitive benchmarking and 
external valuation advice received, the Directors have concluded that it was appropriate for the trademarks and domain names to be written 
off over twenty years.
Had this change occurred at 1 January 2012 intangible asset amortisation would have increased by £0.5 million for the year ended 
31 December 2012 and £0.4 million for the period ended 30 June 2013.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, tangible and intangible assets and intangible assets not yet 
available for use to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does 
not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit/
product to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is 
an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value, less costs to sell, and the value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows, which are based on budgeted figures, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.

Year ended 31 December 2013
98 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Financial liability and equity
Financial liability and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. Equity 
instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings
Borrowings are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, with an interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis. The effective interest method is a method of 
calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating the interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate 
is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a 
shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derivative financial instruments
From time to time the Group enters into certain financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk 
including foreign exchange vanilla options and interest rate swaps. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 22.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a 
financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or 
current liabilities.
In the event a premium is paid for a derivative financial instrument, this premium is recognised over the life of the relevant contract. 
In addition, certain of the Group’s acquisitions contain an option to acquire non-controlling interests at specified dates in the future for either 
fixed or variable future payments. The accounting for these options is set out in ‘Business Combinations’ pages 93 and 94.
Trade receivables and other receivable financial assets
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition (plus transaction costs if any) and carried at 
amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank accounts, deposits receivable on demand and deposits with maturity dates of three 
months or less from the date of inception. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents where offset conditions are met. 
Trade and other payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition (plus transaction costs if any) and carried at 
amortised cost. The fair value of trade and other payables has not been disclosed as, due to their short duration, Management considers the 
carrying values recognised in the balance sheet to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. The fair value 
excludes the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-
based transactions are set out in note 26.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its 
estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the non-market based vesting conditions. The impact of the 
revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The fair value of SAYE share options is recognised as an expense and adjusted to reflect the number of shares expected to vest. SAYE 
share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in accelerated 
recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the 
liability. At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with 
any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.

Pension
The Group makes contributions on behalf of employees to an independent, defined contribution pension scheme. The Group has no further 
legal obligation to pay contributions after the payment of its fixed contribution that is matched by an employee. These contributions are 
recognised as an expense in the period the relevant employee services are received.
Segmental reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, operating segments are reporting in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting 
provided to the Board of Directors, the chief operating decision maker. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and 
associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period 
in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects 
both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The items below are critical judgements that the Directors believe have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements: 
Content costs
The Group typically licenses the right (from sports associations, sports bodies, leagues or their agents or partners) to supply live sports 
content to online bookmakers and/or to supply aggregated non-exclusive video-on-demand (typically highlights) via the Group’s 
embeddable video player (embedded on publisher websites) or distributed in a news feed (typically highlights).
The rights the Group licenses are for a fixed period of time, typically three years. The rights are generally paid in instalments over the length 
of the contract, typically quarterly in advance (and as such the Group recognises a prepayment).
Previously the Group recognised an expense for sports streaming rights when the sporting event was streamed. During the year the Group 
invested significantly in new rights for the 2014-16 W&B licence period and growth of the ePlayer globally and as a result the Directors’ 
determined that the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits attributed to those rights would not follow the previously 
applied pattern with greater weight being attributed to the 2014-2016 events than the 2013 events. The Group now amortises its payments 
for sports streaming rights to cost of sales, based on a weighting of when the value of the rights will be returned, over a period not 
exceeding the contractual period. Consequently an additional £6.4 million of rights were categorised as a prepayment at 31 December 2013. 
Had this change in estimate been undertaken in the half year financial statements for 2013, an additional £1.0 million would have been 
categorised as a prepayment at 30 June 2013.
Whilst in substance the sports rights are intangible assets, given their nature they are not capable of recognition as an intangible asset until 
the sports event occurs, at which time an asset is capable of recognition.
The rights may relate to individual events (such as an international football match) or a series of sporting events (such as a football league 
season). In contrast to, say, an acquired film licence, a sports right is not based on an exploitation right protected by copyright. Rather the 
organiser declares to the Group that it will waive the exercise of its own rights to stream the sport to the sportsbooks.
A sports broadcasting right arises when the sporting event is actually held, broadcast or streamed. The intellectual property relating to a 
sporting event is only created once the sporting event has actually been held.
If the rights relate to a series of sporting events, such as the streaming of football league matches for an entire season, the sports right 
has the characteristics of a successive supply agreement because the required performance by the organiser in the form of the above 
mentioned waiver of the exercise of its rights to stream the sport only happens on the relevant match day.
In the case of rights for video-on-demand offerings, these highlights are generally viewed on publisher websites very soon after the event 
and unlike a film or TV programming are generally viewed significantly less as time passes after the original event. The Group has considered 
whether there is any residual value to such video-on-demand offerings and concluded that any value would be minimal and not material.
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
100 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The amounts to be paid are based on the sports events to be streamed. There is no minimum amount that would be payable if the event 
does not occur. No payment is made if a match is postponed. Payments are made for the value of the future events and not for a right to 
future content.
Any advance payments made (of when the event is held and when the expense is recognised) represent a pre-payment of the rights or the 
organisers’ waiver of the exercise of its rights not to stream the sport. In substance part of the pre-payment becomes an intangible asset 
when the event or tournament takes place and is simply expensed to match the revenue recognised.
Commitment to acquire content rights
The Group has commitments to acquire internet content rights. As at 31 December 2013 these commitments total £114 million (2012: 
£84 million). The Directors do not consider this commitment to be a financial liability as this commitment relates to future payments for 
future sporting events that the Group has acquired the right to stream. For the reasons set out above and as the organiser declares it waives 
the exercise of its own rights to stream the sport, the Group does not consider it meets the criteria for recognition of an intangible asset nor 
does it consider it has a financial liability in accordance with IAS 39 until the sporting event has been delivered.
Whilst the Group has a commitment to make these payments, such payments are dependent on the sporting events occurring. In the event 
that a particular event or set of events does not occur the Group would not be required to make all, or part of, the “committed” payments 
referred to above. In the light of this, the Group considers the long-term contract to contain a number of executory components and, therefore, 
does not consider the future amounts payable that are conditional on the occurrence of the sporting event and the delivery by the right’s owner 
of the live stream to be a financial liability as neither party has performed any of its obligations relating to the future sporting events. 
Segmental reporting
In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are reporting in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
Board of Directors, the chief operating decision maker. The performance of the Group is monitored on the same basis as the Group’s 
consolidated accounts.
Management information that is regularly reported to the Board for the purposes of allocating resources and monitoring performance is 
the monthly board pack. The board pack contains an analysis of revenue for the Group’s five activities. It is the Directors’ assessment that 
the revenue only information reported in the monthly board pack does not constitute discrete financial information in the context of the 
definition of an operating segment as set out in IFRS 8. The revenue information that is presented in note 3 is, however, considered to be 
useful information for the readers of our annual report and accounts.
The Group considers it only has a single operating segment. 
The Board does not monitor the profitability of the five activities individually. Whilst the Group reports its revenues across the five activities 
(which is considered the most helpful and transparent for its investors) operationally the Group has a number of products (such as 
Watch&Bet) that operate off one common technology platform, sets of rights typically cleared for all products and platforms and staff 
who sell, manage and produce this content across multiple products.
A key decision for the Board is whether to acquire a particular set of (high value) sports rights. The Board make their decision based on 
whether the business, in aggregate, can generate revenue across the five activities for that set of sports rights in excess of the cost. 
In light of the fact that value of acquired rights is typically not split between the Group’s different products and platforms it is not possible to 
present a reliable, accurate or helpful measure of profitability to the Board and any profitability of the five activities would be arbitrary and 
unreliable for the purpose of making decisions (and involve significant allocation and apportionment of Group wide costs).
Treatment of subsidiary undertakings and related deferred and/or contingent consideration
The Group has two subsidiaries, Mackolik Internet Hitzmetleri Ticaret A.S. (“Mackolik”) and Perform Sporting News Limited (“PSN”), which 
were not wholly owned at the year end.
These have all been consolidated and included as subsidiary undertakings within the Group’s financial statements. The Directors have 
reviewed the accounting treatment of each subsidiary to confirm that they should not be accounted for as joint ventures. In each case these 
reviews concluded that the Group had effective control either through its actual influence on the strategic and operational policies of the 
companies exposure to a variable return from its involvement and through its contractual rights to acquire 100% control of voting equity.

Perform Sporting News Limited (“PSN”)
In March 2013 the Group partnered with American City Business Journals (“ACBJ”) to establish a new company, Perform Sporting 
News (“PSN”),
As part of the agreement, the Group is entitled to buy out ACBJ’s equity at any time for a pre-determined cash price of $65 million, before 
1 January 2017, or $75 million, between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 (except for the months of April and May in each year) and 
$85 million after 1 January 2019 (except for during the months of April and May).
The Group also has the option between 1 April and 30 April in every year commencing with 2017 to buy out ACBJ’s equity based on a 
multiple of PSN’s EBITDA for the financial years ending on the prior 31 December. The consideration will be subject to a minimum value of 
$35 million and a maximum value of $85 million.
If the Group does not exercise its option in April 2017 or any April thereafter, ACBJ will have the option between 1 May and 31 May in each 
year to acquire the Group’s shareholding based on a multiple of PSN’s EBITDA for the financial year ending the prior 31 December.
The Group has considered the fair value of this financial asset. Based on an assessment of future forecasts the option has no significant value 
at the year end.
Mackolik
The Mackolik Sale and Purchase Agreement contains a forward contract to enable the Group to acquire the remaining 49% interest in 2016. 
The Directors have judged that this does not result in a 100% acquisition on the acquisition date. The sellers of the 49% interest remain 
exposed to the risks and rewards of ownership (the distributable profit of the company will be distributed pro-rata to the share ownership 
until the point at which the Group acquires the remaining 49%) until these shares are acquired by the Group.
The Group have obtained an independent valuation of what the forward contract to acquire the 49% of the controlled subsidiary is 
worth in 2016 and as the risks and rewards of owning the 49% will not be transferred to the Group until actual payment is made in 2016, 
in accordance with IAS 32 and 39, the Group have recorded a liability (with a corresponding debit to equity) for the present value of 
£14.9 million of the independently valued liability. 
Whilst there are no employment provisions connected to the payment of the contingent consideration, there are certain service-related 
provisions contained within the Sale and Purchase Agreement. As such it is the Directors’ view that any difference between the independent 
valuation of the forward contract and the present value of the amount the Group expects to pay must be related to those service-related 
provisions. As such any difference will be taken to the Income Statement as an acquisition-related service charge. The Directors’ best estimate 
( at the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2013) of the amount to be paid in 2016 is approximately £23 million. The present value of this 
payment at the date of acquisition was £15.1 million. Consequently, a £0.2 million service charge is being recognised in the Income Statement 
over the period from acquisition until the date of payment in 2016. The charge recognised in 2013 was £44,000 (2012: £22,000). The Directors 
will re-assess their estimation of the final payment at each reporting date and any future differences will be charged ( or credited) to the 
Income Statement.
The accretion in respect of the unwind of the discount being applied to the Directors’ best estimate of the final payment (£23 million) to 
present value (£15.1 million) is being recognised in the Income Statement as a finance charge over the period from the acquisition date to the 
date of the final payment in 2016. The charge recognised in 2013 in respect of this accretion was £2.1 million (2012: £1 million).
In addition, distributable profits of Mackolik for each financial year between 2012 – 2015 will be distributed to the Group and other 
shareholders pro-rata to their respective holdings. These contractual dividend payments represent an obligation to make payments to the 
shareholders and accordingly the present value of the expected future payments have been recorded as a liability with a corresponding 
entry recognised directly in equity. The liability will be remeasured at each reporting date with any subsequent amendments being 
recognised as a service charge or credit through the Income Statement. The Directors’ current best estimate of the undiscounted cash flows 
is approximately £6.0 million and discounted is £5.0 million.
The accretion in respect of the unwind of the discount being applied to the Directors’ best estimate of the final payment (£6 million) to 
present value (£5 million) is being recognised in the Income Statement as a finance charge over the period from the acquisition date to the 
date of the final payment in 2016. The charge recognised in 2013 in respect of this accretion was £0.5 million (2012: £0.2 million).
The independent valuation of the option to acquire the 49% non-controlling interest of £14.9 million plus the present value of the future 
liability for the dividends of £4.9 million exceeds the payments for the 51% of £16.5 million (including the working capital payment). 
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
102 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 In addition, the Sale and Purchase Agreement contains a provision which allows the shareholders to re-purchase the 51% in the event the 
Group does not purchase the non-controlling interest. The independent valuer considers this has a discounted value of approximately 
£2 million. The Directors believe that the remaining differential represents a discount on the fair value accepted by the sellers of the 51% 
stake, who have exited the business, in order to receive cash consideration upon disposal of 51% of their shares and to reduce any ongoing 
ownership risk.
Perform Media Sales Japan
In June 2013 a new Japanese company Perform Media Sales Japan was incorporated. The Group owns 70% of the share capital of the new 
company. Perform Media Sales Japan acquired the assets of Ad Networks KK which had been the Japanese advertising sales agent for the 
Group in Japan. The Group has the option to acquire the remaining 30% in 2017 based on a multiple of Perform Media Sales Japan’s 2016 
EBITDA up to a maximum value of £12 million. The Group has considered the fair value of this financial asset. Based on an assessment of 
future forecasts the option has no significant value at the year end.
Spox Media GmbH and mediasports Digital GmbH
The contingent consideration in respect of the acquisition of Spox Media GmbH and mediasports Digital GmbH is payable to the previous 
private equity owners and four other individuals, only two of whom are continuing to provide post-combination service. The private equity 
owners were the majority shareholders in the business prior to the acquisition and the Group anticipates that approximately two-thirds of the 
contingent consideration will be payable to them. The remaining third of the contingent consideration is split amongst the four individuals in 
proportion to their shareholdings. The Directors’ view is that the amount allocated to the two individuals providing a continuing service is not
material and as such no service-related charge has been recognised.
Contingent consideration
Contingent consideration arising as a result of acquisitions is stated at fair value. Contingent and deferred consideration is based on 
Management’s best estimate of the likely outcome and best estimate of fair value, which is usually, but not always, a contracted formula 
based on a multiple of EBITDA. 
Subscription and advertising sales revenue recognition
The Group provides online and mobile subscription based products to its customers, usually via customer branded websites to end users. 
The Group sets the price of these products, collects revenues and delivers the products, including after service customer care. The Directors 
have reviewed the products and the nature of how they were supplied and concluded that the Group acts as Principal and accordingly 
revenue generated from these products should be shown as that of the Group with customer revenue share payments included in cost 
of sales.
The Group sells online advertising inventory for a network of internet sites. The Group has built this network and seeks advertising 
campaigns from brands and media agencies to deliver via this network. The Group employs its sales staff at its own risk, effectively 
negotiates prices and delivers (traffics) the advertising campaigns. The Directors have reviewed these arrangements and concluded that 
the Group acts as Principal and accordingly revenue generated from these products should be shown as that of the Group with customer 
internet sites revenue share payments included in cost of sales, rather than as an agent.
Internally generated software and research
Management monitors progress of internal software development projects by using a project management system. Significant judgement 
is required in distinguishing whether such development should be written off or capitalised. Development costs are recognised as an asset 
when all the criteria are met, where this is not the case costs are not capitalised and are written off as incurred.
The Group’s Management also monitors whether the recognition requirements for development costs continue to be met. This is necessary 
as the economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems or developments after 
the time of recognition.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
The estimates and assumptions, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below. Where a source of uncertainty has been discussed above it has not been 
duplicated below.
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the single cash-generating unit to which goodwill has 
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value.

During the year the Group acquired Perform Sporting News, Opta and Voetbalzone. The related costs (given their size and nature) have 
been classified as exceptional by the Directors. In addition, certain costs were incurred in relation to the issue of new equity (related to the 
acquisition of Opta) (refer to notes 24 and 28). The management incentive on acquisition relates to six months’ charge in respect of Opta 
(£3.5 million). A credit was recognised with regards to the downward revaluation of the acquisition-related financial liability due on Spox/
MSD (£2.4 million). Finally, certain costs in relation to restructuring costs have been classified as exceptional.
During 2012 the Group acquired RunningBall Holding AG (a class 1 transaction), Mackolik Internet Hitzmetleri Ticaret A.S. and Sportal GmbH.  
The related costs (given their size and nature) have been classified as exceptional by the Directors.  In addition, certain costs were incurred 
in relation to the issue of new equity (directly linked to the acquisition of RunningBall) (refer to notes 24) and the arrangement of the Group’s 
new debt facilities (directly linked to the acquisition of RunningBall) (refer to note 21); these have also been categorised as exceptional.
Of the £9.8 million exceptional items, £0.3 million, which is net of the Spox/MSD contingent consideration revaluation of £2.4 million 
(£2.7 million gross), is disallowable. No tax charge has been recognised in respect of the revaluation of contingent consideration nor has 
any tax benefit been taken on the £2.7 million non-deductible items. A tax credit of 23% has been recognised in respect of the allowable 
exceptional items in the Group’s tax credit for the year.

Total finance costs 7,927 3,127
Interest payable in both years primarily relates to bank interest on the Group’s borrowings. Other bank charges and finance costs relate 
to the amortisation of the arrangement fee paid on the Group’s current term loan and the cost of the related fixed rate hedge (£132,000 
(2012: £132,000) and £75,000 (2012: £55,000) respectively), non-utilisation fees paid under the Group’s new debt facilities (refer to note 
21) (£159,000 (2012: £296,000)), a foreign currency hedge premium (£177,000 (2012: £nil)) and other bank charges (£124,000 (2012: 
£176,000)). Other bank fees in 2012 primarily related to the amortisation of the term loan, a non-utilisation fee under the Group’s debt facility, 
the related interest rate swap cost and other bank charges.
Accretion of deferred consideration relates to the unwind of the discount applied to the valuation of the liabilities for contingent payments 
due in respect of the acquisitions of Mackolik (£2,516,000; 2012: £1,182,000), Voetbalzone (£640,000; 2012: £nil), Spox (£434,000; 
2012: £293,000) and WatchandTrade (£419,000; 2012: £387,000). Refer to notes 1 and 28 for a further explanation.
The exceptional £1.4 million foreign exchange charge is due to the difference between the liability recognised at 31 December 2012 in relation 
to the €50 million RunningBall deferred consideration and the amount actually paid in March 2013. This charge was also impacted by a 
foreign exchange movement on the €50 million bank debt between March 2013 when it was drawn down and the period end.

As set out in the accounting policies – critical judgements section the Group has only one operating segment.
The lowest level that goodwill is internally monitored for impairment purposes is at the level of the Group’s single operating segment – 
accordingly the Group only has one cash-generating unit (“CGU”) for impairment testing purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The Group 
compares the carrying amount of the unit (including goodwill) to the recoverable amount of the unit.
The recoverable amount of the Group’s CGU is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
These assumptions have been revised in the year in light of the current economic environment which has resulted in more conservative 
estimates about the future. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. Changes in selling prices, volumes and direct costs are based on past experience and 
expectations of future changes in the market.
Recoverable amounts for the cash-generating unit were calculated using cash flows calculated for one year as forecast by Management 
and approved by the Board of Directors. A long-term growth rate of 2.5% was applied in order to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond 
this period. The cashflows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 12% (2012: 10%). In determining the discount rate, Management 
applied judgement in respect of several factors which included assessing the risk attached to the future cashflows and making reference to 
the capital asset pricing model (the “CAPM”) as advertised to determine the pre-tax discount rate. Management gave consideration to the 
selection of appropriate inputs to the CAPM, which included the risk free rate, the equity risk premium and a measure of systematic risk.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from 
a range of possible trading and economic scenarios. The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities 
summarised as follows:
– An increase in the discount rate by 1%;
– A decrease of 5% on forecast EBITDA over the term.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would result from either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in 
forecast cashflows.

Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
The due date for trade receivables will vary depending on the jurisdiction and product but is typically between 30 and 90 days. Trade 
receivables do not bear any effective interest rate. All trade receivables are subject to credit risk exposure, however, the Group does not 
identify specific concentration of credit risk with regards to trade receivables, as the amount recognised consists of a large number of 
receivables from various customers.
Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are set out in the table below:

The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables has been included in the Income Statement. Amounts charged to the 
provision account are generally written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Some of the unimpaired trade receivables are past due as at the reporting date. Financial assets past due but not impaired are shown below:

In May 2012 the £11.3 million balance of the Group’s term loan facility (“Old Facility A ”) was converted into a new term loan facility of £11.3 million 
(“Facility A ”) which was provided to Perform Media Services Ltd. This new facility was provided by Bank of Ireland plc and Royal Bank 
of Scotland plc who also provided Perform Group plc and Perform Media Services Ltd a €30 million term loan facility (“Facility B”) and a 
€20 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (“Facility C”). The agreement also allowed an additional multi-currency term facility of 
€20 million (“Facility D”) (together the “New Facilities”).
Facility B and Facility C were fully drawn down in March 2013 to finance the payment of deferred consideration for RunningBall and €10 million 
of Facility D was drawn down in June 2013.
T ogether Facilities A, B, C and D form the “Facilities Agreement”. Facility A bears interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of LIBOR plus a 
margin of 3.5%. Facilities B, C and D bear interest at a rate equal to the aggregate of EURIBOR plus a margin of up to 2.5%. 
T wo-thirds of the interest rate of Facilities A, B and D is required to be hedged. T wo-thirds of Facility A has been hedged. All of Facilities B and D 
have been hedged. Interest is charged and payable quarterly.
The Facilities Agreement requires the Borrower to comply with certain financial covenants.
Facility A is being repaid in equal instalments of £1,416,667 (the first instalment was in June 2012) and on each subsequent quarter date. Facility 
A must be repaid by no later than 31 March 2014. Facility B is being repaid in equal quarterly instalments of £2,272,500 (the first instalment was 
in September 2013). Facility D is due to be repaid in one instalment in March 2016. Facility C may be repaid and redrawn quarterly and will need 
to be repaid in full in March 2016.
The amounts provided above are net of fees paid to the banks. Of these fees, £410,000 were offset against the loan on inception of Old Facility 
A and these are being amortised to the Income Statement over the length of the loan. The carrying value of the fees at 31 December 2013 is 
£26,000. The arrangement fee for Facilities B and C was £544,000, with £272,000 paid on arrangement and £272,000 paid in March 2013 on 
utilisation of the Facilities. These are being amortised to the Income Statement over the length of the loans.. The carrying value of these fees as 
at 31 December 2013 is £410,000.
A bank fee of £86,000 was incurred when Facility D was drawn down. These fees are being amortised to the Income Statement over the term 
of the loan. The carrying value of these fees as at 31 December 2013 is £68,000.
Due to a technical breach, which Management were aware of at the balance sheet date, IAS 1:69 requires that the loan is classified as a current 
liability. The technical breach was remedied without penalty after the balance sheet date. The loan will be classified as a long-term liability in the 
Interim financial statements for the six months to 30 June 2014.
22. Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to capital risk, foreign 
exchange rates, interest rate risks, the risk of default by counterparties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business 
needs. These risks are managed as described below.
The Group’s risk management is co-ordinated at its headquarters, in close co-operation with the board of Directors, and focusses on actively 
securing the Group’s short to medium-term cash flows by minimising the exposure to financial markets.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes. The most significant financial risks to which 
the Group is exposed are described below.
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
118 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Capital risk
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern whilst having enough capital to 
continue its acquisition strategy and sustain future product development. The Group will continue to seek to maximise the return to shareholders 
through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance although this is a longer-term aspiration. The Group’s overall strategy has not changed in 
the last year.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net funds, which includes cash and cash equivalents after deducting the borrowings disclosed in 
note 21, and equity of the Group, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The primary reason for the Group to raise debt or equity is to finance its acquisitions.
The Group’s Directors review the capital structure on an ad-hoc basis and do consider the impact any acquisitions ( and how they are financed) 
have on the Group’s capital structure before completing any acquisition ( or financing). As part of this review the Board considers the cost of 
capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group had a gearing ratio of 16% at 31 December 2013 (2012: 4%). The ratio has increased in the year due to the Group drawing down on its 
bank facilities to satisfy the contingent consideration in respect of the RunningBall acquisition, offset partly by equity issued during the year to 
part-fund the acquisition of Opta.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows:
2013
£’000
2012
£’000
Debt 48,260 6,925
Equity 295,578 170,507
Debt to equity ratio 16% 4%
Debt is defined as all borrowings and equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group that are managed as capital (see note 21 for 
further details on debt).
Due to the current fast growth and acquisitive nature of the Group, the Group does not currently have a long-term target gearing ratio 
although the Group’s preference is for future significant acquisitions to be financed by equity rather than debt. The Group also has no 
current policy as to the level of equity capital and other reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The Group currently does not envisage paying a dividend in the short-term, consistent with its intentions as set out when the Group listed.
The fair value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is as follows:

Total exposure 14,320 3,747 168 18,235
Exposures to currency exchange rates arise from the Group’s retranslation of its foreign subsidiaries as well as the Group’s overseas sales and 
purchases, which are primarily denominated in euros and US dollars.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity with regard to the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities 
and the euro/sterling exchange rate and the US dollar /sterling rate. It assumes a +/- 10% movement in each exchange rate on both years.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.

Net profit (1,118) (490) (1,061) (278)
Equity (1,789) (1,206) (2,363) (619)
The Group’s objective when managing currency risk is to ensure that changes in exchange rates would not have a material impact on 
the Group. The Group’s policy is to review the level of revenues and costs denominated in various key currencies and to naturally hedge 
wherever possible. Where this is not possible and a currency risk is forecast the Directors’ strategy is to acquire forward options to mitigate 
the level of risk. 
In addition to the monetary assets and liabilities set out above the Group has acquisition-related liabilities which will be settled in foreign 
currencies. The contingent consideration for Mackolik (£22.4 million) is 79.7 million Turkish Lira, the contingent consideration for Spox 
(£1.1 million) is €1.3 million and the contingent consideration for Voetbalzone (£5.2 million) is €6.3 million. If at the year end sterling was 10% 
stronger, profit and equity would increase by £2.6 million. If at the year end sterling was 10% weaker, profit and equity would decrease by 
£3.2 million.
Notes to the Group financial statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2013
120 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at floating rate interest rates. The Group is required to hedge Facilities A, B and 
D as per the facilities agreements, at least two-thirds of the loans via interest rate swaps, hedging floating rate interest for fixed rate interest. 
The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis.
For Facility A, a floating rate of LIBOR (plus 3.5% premium) is swapped to a fixed rate of 1.94% (plus 3.5% margin); for Facility B, a floating 
rate of EURIBOR (plus 2.5% premium) is swapped to a fixed rate of 0.5175% (plus 2.5% margin); for Facility D, a floating rate of EURIBOR 
(plus 2.5% premium) is swapped to a fixed rate of 0.545% (plus 2.5% margin). The Directors do not consider that this derivative had a 
material value at either 31 December 2012 or 2013.
The Group’s hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align them with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring the most 
appropriate hedging strategies are applied.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group 
has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate as a means 
of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group uses publicly available financial information and its own trading records to 
assess the creditworthiness of counterparties. The Group continually monitors its exposure to counterparties and the aggregate value of 
transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. 
Cash held by counterparty is presented to the Board on a monthly basis. The credit risk on these funds is limited because the counterparties 
are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, 
spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. 
Cash balances are held across a number of banks, the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty 
or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics. The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are 
related entities. Concentration of credit risk to any counterparty did not exceed 3% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is managed by short and long-term cash flow forecasts. Sufficient cash reserves are held to meet short-term working capital 
requirements.
As at 31 December 2013 and 2012, the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities have contractual maturities (including interest payments 
where applicable) as summarised below:

Financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements require disclosure of fair value measurements 
by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy:
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as 
prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices); and
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market date (that is, unobservable inputs).
The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices where available. Where the market value is not available, 
the Group has estimated relevant fair values on the basis of publicly available information from outside sources or on the basis of discounted 
cash flow models where appropriate.
The Group only holds financial instruments categorised as Level 2 or Level 3 financial instruments. There have been no transfers of assets or 
liabilities between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the year.
The Level 2 financial instruments held relate to cash and cash equivalents, current borrowings, trade and other receivables and trade and 
other payables.

In addition to the amounts set out above the Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset at 31 December 2013 of £3 million 
(2012: £1.3 million) relating to losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that there will be future 
taxable profits available to offset such losses.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £0.7 million (2012: £0.4 million) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will 
not reverse in the forseeable future.

A total charge of £712,000 (2012: £3,246,000) relating to the Group’s share-based payment schemes has been included in the Income 
Statement. The current year charge relates to the PSP and SA YE.
Growth Securities Ownership Plan (GSOP)
In March 2010, the Board put in place a Growth Securities Ownership Plan (the “GSOP”). Under the GSOP, certain key non-shareholding 
employees were given the opportunity to purchase a financial instrument which tracked the Group’s enterprise value, defined as market 
capitalisation for these purposes, over a set period, being the period ending 12 months after the occurrence of an exit event. 
21 senior employees (none of whom is a Director) held a total of 35 units under the plan. The terms of the GSOP provided for cash payments, 
on a pro-rata basis, by the Company to participants, subject to such participant’s continued employment at the Group at the date payable, 
if the Company’s enterprise value at the end of the relevant period exceeded a floor amount. The amount payable to participants increased 
up to a maximum aggregate amount of £6 million which was payable if the Company’s enterprise value at such time is not less than 
£450 million. 
The Admission to the London Stock Exchange (“Admission”) constituted an exit event under the scheme. The Group paid the maximum 
amount of £6 million to the participants in May 2012.
The fair values of the financial instruments entered into under this scheme were calculated and were purchased by the participants at this 
price. In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group recognised a charge of £1,228,000 in 2012 and £4,770,000 in 2011 in respect of this cash settled 
scheme. No further charges or payments will be made under the plan.
Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The Group has put in place a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) to provide long-term incentives to Executive Directors and Senior 
Management of the Group. Share awards made under the PSP are based on a percentage of salary and the share price the date before the 
date of grant and are subject to a matrix of non-market based performance targets (including annual compound growth of the Group’s 
revenues and adjusted earnings per share) over a three-year performance period. There is no exercise price on these shares.

124 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Award – 24 June 2011
An award made in June 2011 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2013 with awards vesting in June 2014 subject to 
continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,400,000 shares will vest. The fair 
value of each award is £2.19 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 100% of the awards made in June 2011 would vest. However during the year 2% of the awards 
lapsed and Management expects a further 3% of the awards will lapse in the remaining vesting period. As such, Management expect a 
further 5% of participants will leave before the awards vest and have revised their performance valuation to 50%.
As such, and in accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a credit (including true-up) of £235,000 (2012: charge of £1,242,000) in 
respect of this equity settled scheme.
Award – March 2012
An award made in March 2012 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2014 with awards vesting in March 2015 subject to 
continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,500,000 shares will vest. The fair 
value of each award is £3.03 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 65% of the awards made in March 2012 would vest. None of the awards lapsed during the 
year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expect that 20% of the shares will vest and 10% of participants will leave 
before the awards vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a credit of £187,000 (2012: charge of £747,000) in respect of this equity 
settled scheme.
Award – September 2012
An award made in September 2012 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2014 with awards vesting in September 2015 
subject to continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 100,000 shares will vest. The 
fair value of each award is £3.74 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 65% of the awards made in September 2012 would vest. None of the awards lapsed during 
the year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expect that 20% of the shares will vest and 0% of participants will leave 
before the awards vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of £3,000 (2012: £28,000) in respect of this equity settled scheme.
Award – March 2013
An award made in March 2013 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2015 with awards vesting in March 2016 subject to 
continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,400,000 shares will vest. The fair 
value of each award is £4.70 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. None of the 
awards lapsed during the year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expects that 50% of the shares will vest and 10% of 
participants will leave before the awards vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of £923,000 (2012: nil) in respect of this equity settled scheme.
Award – September 2013
An award made in September 2013 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2015 with awards vesting in September 2016 
subject to continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 110,000 shares will vest. The 
fair value of each award is £5.40 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
None of the awards lapsed during the year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expects that 50% of the shares will vest 
and 10% of participants will leave before the awards vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of £21,000 (2012: nil) in respect of this equity settled scheme.
Save As You Earn scheme (SAYE)
The Group has a share save scheme which uses shares to provide long-term incentives to employees of the Group. Employees were 
invited to join in November 2012 and the plan started in January 2013 and matures in January 2016. The charge for the year was £190,000

Acquisitions have been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting. The goodwill arising on these acquisitions will be subject to 
an annual impairment review. 
Opta Sports Data Limited (“Opta”) 
On 9 July 2013 the Group acquired Opta Sports Data Limited (“Opta”) for £40 million consideration and a management incentive up to 
£7 million. 
The management incentive is conditional upon meeting certain financial and non-financial targets including continued employment 
through to 30 June 2014. The management incentive is therefore not part of the overall consideration but instead is being accrued based 
on Management’s assessment of whether the conditional performance criteria will be met.
The following table sets out identifiable assets and liabilities acquired at the acquisition date. Fair values are provisional as at 
31 December 2013 and are based on the information held to date:

• Deferred tax liabilities in relation to the recognised acquisition intangibles totalling £5.3 million which will be amortised over the 
corresponding periods to those set out above.
• The fair value of acquired receivables at the date of acquisition (£2.7 million) is net of a provision for unrecoverable debtors (£0.7 million).
• Provision for potential employment tax related liabilities (£1.8 million).
The goodwill arising on acquisition of Opta is largely attributable to the anticipated synergies created by the highly complementary business 
activities. None of this goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related costs (included in administrative expenses) amount to £2.2 million.
The Group’s results for the period include post acquisition revenue of £11.0 million and a profit after tax of £1.9 million. Had the acquisition 
occurred on 1 January 2013 it would have contributed revenue and statutory profit after tax for the period of approximately £17.9 million and 
£2.3 million respectively.
Perform Sporting News Limited (“PSN”)
On 28 March 2013 the Group partnered with American City Business Journals (“ACBJ”) to establish a new company, Perform Sporting News 
Limited (“PSN”). The ownership of PSN is weighted 65:35 in the Group’s favour and as such it has been determined the Group has control 
over the newly formed entity. 
The fair value of consideration was determined to be 35% of the Perform entity transferred by Perform to ACBJ in exchange for 65% of 
Sporting News.

 – The domain name was valued at £4.0 million with an estimated life of 20 years.
 – Customer relationships have been valued at £0.9 million with an estimated life of 8 years.
 – The technology platform has been valued at £0.4 million with an estimated life between 4 and 12 years.

• An onerous contract provision has also been recognised at acquisition for an advertising marketing agreement with AOL totalling 
£1.3 million which will be released over the remaining life of the agreement expiring February 2014.
The other reserves created on acquisition is the difference between the book value and fair value of the Perform assets contributed to the 
new venture.
The goodwill arising on acquisition of Perform Sporting News is attributable to the anticipated profitability and cashflows arising from the 
business acquired. None of this goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.
As part of the agreement, the Group is entitled to buy out ACBJ’s equity at any time for a pre-determined cash price of $65 million, before 
1 January 2017, or $75 million, between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 (except for the months of April and May in each year) and 
$85 million after 1 January 2019 (except for during the months of April and May).
The Group also has the option between 1 April and 30 April in every year commencing with 2017 to buy out ACBJ’s equity based on a 
multiple of PSN’s EBITDA for the financial years ending on the prior 31 December. The consideration will be subject to a minimum value of 
$35 million and a maximum value of $85 million and can be satisfied by the issue of new shares at the Group’s discretion.
If the Group does not exercise its option in April 2017 or any April thereafter, ACBJ will have the option between 1 May and 31 May in each 
year to acquire the Group’s shareholding based on a multiple of PSN’s EBITDA for the financial year ending the prior 31 December. The 
consideration will be satisfied in cash and will be subject to a minimum and maximum value.

Year ended 31 December 2013
128 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Group has considered the fair value of this financial asset. Based on an assessment of future forecasts the option has no significant value 
at the year end.
Acquisition-related costs (included in administrative expenses) amount to £2.7 million.
The Group’s results for the period include incremental post acquisition revenue of £5.6 million and a loss after tax of £2.1 million. Had 
the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013 it would have contributed incremental revenue and statutory loss after tax for the period of 
approximately £7.5 million and £2.8 million respectively.
Voetbalzone B.V.
The Group acquired Voetbalzone on 4 March 2013 for initial consideration of €2 million. Additional contingent consideration of up to 
€10.5 million is payable based on the EBITDA of Voetbalzone for the years to 31 December 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Perform Media Sales Japan
In June 2013 a new Japanese company Perform Media Sales Japan was incorporated. The Group owns 70% of the share capital of the new 
company. Perform Media Sales Japan acquired the assets of Ad Networks KK which had been the Japanese advertising sales agent for the 
Group in Japan. The Group has the option to acquire the remaining 30% in 2017 based on a multiple of Perform Media Sales Japan’s 2016 
EBITDA up to a maximum value of £12 million. The Directors consider that whilst this option represents a financial asset it has no significant 
value as it is calculated and satisfied at fair value.

Parent company financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2013
132 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The individual financial statements for the Company have been prepared in accordance with UK law and applicable UK GAAP 
accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the financial year and the 
preceding year.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards and company law.
Going concern
The Company had cash balances of £75,542,000 at the year end and no borrowings. Having reviewed cash flow forecasts and budgets for 
the year ahead the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Exemptions
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented a 
profit and loss account for the Company alone. The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Parties from disclosing 
related-party transactions with entities that are wholly owned and part of the Perform Group plc Group. The Company has not published its 
individual cash flow statement as its liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependent on the Group rather than its own cash flows.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any , for impairment.
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of management services to the Group’s subsidiaries and are also derived from the 
Group’s continuing, ordinary activities, after the deduction of value added tax. 
Foreign currency translation
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are 
translated at the closing rate. Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the profit and loss 
account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and further excludes items that are 
never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.

Statements Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, 
with the following exceptions:
• provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal 
of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding 
agreement to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance 
sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the 
replacement assets are sold;
• deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted; and
• deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based compensation plans for the employees of subsidiaries using the Company’s 
equity instruments, as detailed in note 1 to the Group financial statements. The fair value of the compensation given in respect of these 
share-based compensation plans is recognised as a capital contribution to the Company’s subsidiaries over the vesting period. The capital 
contribution is reduced by any payments received from subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments.

Performance Share Plan (PSP) 
The Group has put in place a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) to provide long-term incentives to Executive Directors and Senior 
Management of the Group. Share awards made under the PSP are based on a percentage of salary and the share price the date before the 
date of grant and are subject to a matrix of non-market based performance targets (including annual compound growth of the Group’s 
revenues and adjusted earnings per share) over a three-year performance period. There is no exercise price on these shares.
Award – 24 June 2011
An award made in June 2011 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2013 with awards vesting in June 2014 subject to 
continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,400,000 shares will vest. The fair 
value of each award is £2.19 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 100% of the awards made in June 2011 would vest. However during the year 2% of the awards 
lapsed and Management expects a further 3% of the awards will lapse in the remaining vesting period. As such, Management expect a 
further 5% of participants will leave before the awards vest and have revised their performance valuation to 50%.
As such, and In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a credit (including true-up) of £235,000 (2012: charge of £1,242,000) 
in respect of this equity settled scheme.
Award – March 2012
An award made in March 2012 is measured over a performance period to 31 December 2014 with awards vesting in March 2015 subject to 
continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,500,000 shares will vest. The fair 
value of each award is £3.03 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 65% of the awards made in March 2012 would vest. None of the awards lapsed during the 
year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expect that 20% of the shares will vest and 10% of participants will leave 
before the awards vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a credit of £187,000 (2012: charge of £747,000) in respect of this equity 
settled scheme.
Award – September 2012

subject to continued employment. In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 100,000 shares will vest. The 
fair value of each award is £3.74 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. At the 
previous year end Management expected that 65% of the awards made in September 2012 would vest. None of the awards lapsed during 
the year. Based on the Group’s three-year forecasts, Management expect that 20% of the shares will vest and 0% of participants will leave

value of each award is £4.70 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant. None of the

In July 2013 the Group issued 23.9 million new ordinary shares raising total net proceeds of £112.6 million to fund the acquisition of Opta 
and other potential future acquisitions. The equity was raised via a cash box structure which resulted in £65.6 million being credited to 
distributable reserves and the remaining £47 million being credited to non-distributable reserves.
During 2012, as part of the Group’s acquisition of RunningBall, 13.5 million new ordinary shares in the Company were issued to the sellers. 
The number of issued shares was based on the average closing mid market price of the Group’s ordinary shares and the average closing 
mid-point sterling/euro exchange rate over the 30 trading days preceding 15 May 2012. The fair value of the 13.5 million new ordinary shares 
issued was calculated based on the bid price at the date of acquisition.
A merger relief reserve of £47.2 million has been created to record the excess over nominal value on the issue of the shares in relation to 
the acquisition.

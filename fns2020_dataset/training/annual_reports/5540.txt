Chairman’s Statement
In the year to 30 September 2009, EBITDA fell by 13% to £445 million and profit before tax and exceptional items 
fell to £208 million, giving adjusted earnings per share of 30.7 pence, a decrease of 22% over the prior year.
A valuation of the entire pub estate has been carried out at the year end in line with our normal practice, which 
resulted in a fall in the valuation of 7%. At the year end the estate comprised 7,399 pubs valued at £5.4 billion.
The Board continues to focus on the Group’s debt reduction programme in order to maximise flexibility when 
refinancing our bank facility which matures in May 2011. As part of this plan and despite the solid operating and 
financial performance of the business, the Board is not recommending the payment of a final dividend.
Trading conditions across the pub industry remain difficult with the economic recession continuing to cause weak 
consumer confidence and put pressure on discretionary spending. Given this challenging environment we have 
worked closely with our licensees and provided unprecedented levels of financial support.
Our operational focus, as always, is to optimise trading profit and to this end we shall continue to invest in our 
pubs and in support of our licensees whilst disposing of those outlets which no longer have a viable future as a 
pub. The disposal programme is expected to continue at a similar or higher level throughout the coming year.
In May this year, the Business and Enterprise Select Committee (BEC) published a report on pub companies. 
Having considered its findings, we have put in place key commitments which we believe will improve the 
relationship with our licensees. 
We are delighted that having examined the issues raised in the super-complaint regarding the UK pub industry by 
the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), the Office of Fair Trading has concluded that there is no evidence that supply 
ties are resulting in competition problems or that they contribute to higher prices or prevent pubs offering a wide 
choice to consumers.
Given the current economic climate and the reducing size of the estate, we are likely to see some further decline 
in trading profit in the short term. Nevertheless, we remain confident in our strategy and believe that we are well 
positioned to drive the business forward through these difficult times.

Chief Executive’s Review 
(Incorporating the Business Review)
RESULTS
This has been another very testing year for the pub industry, with licensees having to endure weak consumer 
spending alongside rising overhead costs, duty increases ahead of inflation and aggressive pricing from 
supermarkets.
This has presented many challenges for the ETI business as the volume of beer sold in pubs has continued to 
decline and it has been necessary to provide direct financial assistance to help our licensees survive these 
difficult times. As a result, EBITDA for the year to 30 September 2009 decreased by 13% to £445 million and profit 
before tax and exceptional items fell to £208 million, giving adjusted earnings per share of 30.7 pence, a decrease 
of 22% over the prior year.
Adjusted to take account of pub disposals, the decline in average net income per pub has continued at around 8%, 
with EBITDA per pub down by 11%, in line with the first half of the year. It is, however, encouraging that the 83% 
of our pubs let on substantive agreements continued to perform well in current market conditions, with average 
net income per pub down by just 3% for the year. The annual revaluation of the pub estate resulted in a 7% fall in 
value to £5.4 billion.
Cash generation, from trading and the disposal of non-core pubs, has been strong and underlying Group net debt 
has been reduced by £142 million.
TRADING
Trading conditions across the economy have been challenging for all consumer facing businesses. Consumers are 
cautious with their discretionary spending whilst overhead cost inflation for the service sector has remained high, 
driven by increases in minimum wage, utility costs and business rates. Pubs in general, and good quality pubs in 
particular, have proved remarkably resilient, although we have seen significant regional variations in performance, 
with average net income per pub down by 11% in the North, 9% in the Midlands and 5% in the South, including 
just 3% in London. Whilst the 83% of our pubs on substantive agreements have delivered £448 million of net 
income, down just 3% from last year at an average of £73,000 per pub, the remaining 17% have struggled with 
periods of closure, sub-optimal temporary letting and general underperformance which have together resulted in 
a 39% fall to an average of £37,000 per pub.
Against this background, we have continued to provide unprecedented levels of support to licensees. In addition 
to our Price Freeze package, which held back key brand price increases for six months and cost over £3 million, 
we provided non-contractual rent concessions and special discounts costing £18 million during the year to a total 
of 1,900 licensees under our Business Recovery Scheme (BRS). It is encouraging that in the majority of cases this 
financial assistance, costing an average of £9,500 per pub, was sufficient to put the licensee back onto a secure 
footing and move the business forward. As we accelerate the disposal of poorer quality pubs and as top quality 
licensees develop their businesses to succeed in these recessionary times, the requirement for direct financial 
support is beginning to recede.
The introduction of Temporary Management Agreements (TMAs) during the year has been partially successful, 
allowing us to take control of viable pubs where the operator has failed and move them quickly through a 
refurbishment and relaunch programme. However, this success has come at a high cost and, having seen a peak of 
218 pubs operating as TMAs, it is encouraging to see that the reletting programme has now gathered momentum, 
with just 183 pubs operating under the TMA scheme at 30 September, a number which we expect to reduce 
significantly during the coming year.
Whilst offering assistance to good quality licensees who are prepared to work with us and tackle the difficult trading 
environment in partnership, we have also faced substantial increases in the cost of business failures, incurring costs 
estimated at some £25 million during the year, through non-payment of rent, lost sales, closure costs and legal fees. 
Again, however, it is encouraging to see that the rate of business failures is beginning to abate.

Chief Executive’s Review 
(Incorporating the Business Review)
RETAILERS IN PARTNERSHIP
It is easy to dwell on the difficulties of trading in the current environment and to overlook the resilient nature of the 
ETI business, the great commitment of the ETI team and the tremendous performance of the majority of our licensees.
During the past year, the team has successfully disposed of a large number of non-core pubs, reduced by almost 
20% to 769 the number of pubs let on temporary tenancy agreements and also reduced the number of closed but 
viable pubs from over 200 to just 90.
There has been a small increase in the percentage of pubs let on substantive agreements and these pubs 
continue to deliver average net income just 3% down on last year. With such a large number of our licensees 
managing their businesses successfully though this recession, it is no surprise that overdue balances at 0.8% of 
turnover are unchanged from last year and that 75% of all licensees, broadly the same as last year, pay their rent 
and beer supply balances by direct debit. The level of bad debts incurred has increased during the year but is still 
low at just 0.4% of turnover. During the past year, we have received 1,529 formal applications to take pubs with 
us (2008 — 1,566) and have successfully let 860 pubs (2008 — 410 pubs). This can be taken as a tribute to the 
quality of our pub estate and the inherent fairness, flexibility and attractiveness of a business model which not 
only offers a low cost of entry to entrepreneurs wishing to run their own pub business but also provides ongoing 
support and shares the risks once the pub is up and running. 
Greatest credit must go to the vast majority of our licensees who face the daily challenges of running a pub, 
overcoming whatever obstacles are placed in front of them and developing businesses that are consistently 
attractive to customers.
Among the many awards won by ETI licensees during 2009 were: the Telegraph at Wallasey, voted Wirral CAMRA 
Pub of the Year; Ye Olde Rose & Crown and the Nags Head, Walthamstow, joint runners-up in the CAMRA Best 
Real Ale Award, East London & City; the Bell & Cross, Clent voted UK Pub of the Year in the Good Pub Guide; the 
White Horse, Ramsden Heath voted Best Pub in East Anglia by the Morning Advertiser; and the Harwood Arms, 
Fulham voted Best New Gastropub in the 2010 Time Out Eating and Drinking Awards.
PUB ESTATE
The annual revaluation of the pub estate, completed as at 30 September 2009 and carried out on a basis 
consistent with previous years, resulted in a reduction in value of 7% to £5.4 billion, equivalent to an average 
value of £726,000 per pub. 
During the year, we invested £52 million into the pub estate, working alongside licensees to improve 
facilities in more than 1,500 pubs. There were just four acquisitions at the beginning of the year, completing 
those transactions where contracts had already been exchanged. The main focus of the estates team was to 
concentrate on disposing of underperforming and non-core pubs, achieving gross sale proceeds of £113 million. 
Taking account of all costs of disposal, net proceeds of £106 million were slightly ahead of book value. During 
the year to 30 September 2008, net income from these 368 pubs amounted to £9 million. In normal trading 
times, a relatively small number of pubs become unviable and would be sold each year. The current economic 
environment has accelerated the demise of unviable pubs and we currently expect to continue this disposal 
programme at a similar or higher level throughout the coming year, reducing the total number of pubs in our 
estate and improving average quality and profitability.
We own the freehold of 98% of our pubs, have 181 short leasehold properties and pay an annual leasehold rent 
of just £2.6 million. We have a number of freehold pubs, predominantly in central London, which we believe 
present attractive investment opportunities for long-term property investors. With a view to testing this market, 
we placed six pubs into an auction in October 2009, the results of which were very encouraging with rental yields, 
based upon 35-year, non-index linked leases back to ETI, averaging just over 6%. We believe that this market may 
provide an opportunity to raise additional funds in advance of our refinancing at attractive long-term rates, whilst 
retaining operational management and an ongoing income stream from the pubs concerned. A further fourteen 
pubs will be placed into auctions during December 2009 and, if this too proves successful, we shall continue this 
programme throughout the coming year.

GROUP FINANCING
Debt facilities
ETI has a flexible financing structure comprising securitised bonds, corporate bonds and bank debt. At 
30 September 2009, underlying net debt was £3,562 million compared to £3,704 million at the beginning of 
the financial year. 
The £1.6 billion securitised bonds amortise over 22 years and attract a fixed rate of interest of approximately 
6.5% until final maturity. The Group is currently £64 million ahead of the amortisation schedule. The £1.2 billion 
corporate bonds are non-amortising and attract a fixed rate of interest of 6.5%, with the next scheduled maturities 
being £60 million in February 2014 and £600 million in March 2018. The bank facility of £1 billion currently pays 
interest at 80 basis points over LIBOR and is due for renewal in May 2011.
The bank facility is covered by two interest rate swaps inherited with the acquisition of The Laurel Pub Company 
in 2002. These swaps limit the benefit to the Group of the current low interest rate environment but expire 
relatively shortly. The first swap, £350 million at 4.89%, expires on 30 September 2011 and the second swap, 
£275 million at 6.66%, expires on 1 June 2012.
A programme to reduce the level of borrowings under the bank facility has been successfully implemented during 
the year. In October 2009, we held detailed discussions with the 13 members of our banking group who represent 
98% in value of the outstanding facility. Based on these discussions and input from our advisers, the Board 
remains confident that adequate banking facilities will be available to the Group at the time of our refinancing.
Liquidity and financial covenants
At the year end, committed bank facilities of £198 million were undrawn and a liquidity facility of £190 million 
is in place in respect of the securitised bonds. During October 2009 the £100 million secured bank facility with 
HBOS plc was repaid as borrowings under this facility were no longer required and the facility was cancelled to 
save commitment fees.
All debt facilities have financial covenants which are tested on a periodic basis and covenant tests confirmed that 
sufficient headroom was maintained throughout the year. Financial forecasts are prepared on a regular basis and 
reviewed by the Board to ensure ongoing compliance with all covenants.
TAX CHARGE
The pre-exceptional tax charge of 26% is the same as prior year, slightly favourable to the estimated rate of 27% 
at the half year. It is expected that the statutory corporation tax rate of 28% will apply in 2010.
EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
Income Statement. Exceptional items are those which are specifically identified by virtue of their size or nature 
to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. As a result, the Group focuses on 
‘pre-exceptional’ performance measures in order to compare underlying performance year on year. The most 
significant exceptional item in the year is the movement in valuation of the pub estate and related assets of 
£151 million. 
INDUSTRY ISSUES
The pub in the community
For the vast majority of pub-goers in the UK, the pub remains at the heart of their community, the ‘home of 
responsible drinking’, providing a safe and professionally supervised environment where adults can enjoy 
food, drink and good company. This vital part of British culture is under greater threat than ever before and it 
is essential that Government and all elements of the pub industry work together to ensure that pubs not only 
survive but prosper.

Chief Executive’s Review 
(Incorporating the Business Review)
Business and Enterprise Committee (BEC) inquiry
Following a report on pub companies issued by the BEC in May 2009, ETI wrote to the Secretary of State for 
Business, Innovation and Skills setting out firm commitments designed to address concerns expressed in the BEC 
report, in particular ensuring that new licensees are properly advised and fully appraised of all key facts when 
taking on a pub business. In addition, ETI has worked closely with the British Beer and Pub Association, the British 
Institute of Innkeeping and other industry bodies to develop an industry-wide code of practice. 
Great progress has been made, with firm commitments in place to ensure that potential licensees have proper 
access to the information required for them to develop a viable business plan and to have that business plan 
validated by an experienced industry professional. Importantly, there has been industry-wide acceptance of the 
Pub Independent Rent Review Scheme (PIRRS), the low-cost alternative to arbitration at the time of rent reviews.
CAMRA super-complaint to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT)
At the end of October 2009, the OFT published a report in response to a super-complaint made by the Campaign 
for Real Ale (CAMRA). The super-complaint reiterated many of the concerns raised by the BEC report and claimed 
that the existence of the tie, particularly as exercised by the large pub companies, foreclosed the market to 
smaller brewers, led to restricted choice and higher prices for consumers and made it difficult for tied pubs to 
compete on price with their competitors in free houses and managed pubs.
The OFT reached the conclusion, supported by independent evidence, that the CAMRA complaints were 
unfounded and that further investigation of competition issues within the beer and pub market is not warranted. 
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
The ETI team has worked hard and delivered creditable results in very difficult circumstances, supporting good 
quality licensees with substantial financial assistance where appropriate, improving the overall quality of the 
pub estate through investment and the disposal of non-core pubs and significantly reducing the level of bank 
borrowing.
The coming year is expected to be equally challenging, with weak consumer confidence compounded by further 
increases in duty and taxes. Given the current economic climate and the planned reduction in the size of our pub 
estate, we are likely to see some further decline in trading profit in the short term. Nevertheless, we shall remain 
focused on stabilising performance in the estate, accelerating the disposal of pubs which do not fit the profile of 
our business moving forward whilst working alongside good quality licensees to provide support and investment 
to develop our best pubs. At the same time as steadily de-leveraging our business through the reduction in the 
level of bank debt, this strategy will ensure that the core of our estate is of a quality and profile to prosper as the 
pub market continues to evolve. We remain confident that, in the medium-term, the business will be in a good 
position to deliver positive returns for shareholders.

A review of the year’s activities is given in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review 
(incorporating the Business Review) on pages 2 to 6.
Directors and their interests
The names of the current directors together with related biographical information are set out on pages 7 and 8. 
All directors served throughout the year and were in place on the date of signing of these financial statements.
The rules for the appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association. 
Directors are appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general meeting of holders of ordinary shares 
or by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. The Corporate Governance Report sets 
out further details of the requirements for re-election of directors on page 23. In addition, further details of the 
workings of the Nominations Committee are set out on page 25. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, Mr Harding and Mr Townsend retire from the Board 
at the Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for reappointment. The Board believes that their performance 
continues to be effective, that they demonstrate commitment to their roles and have a range of skills and 
experience relevant to the direction and control of the Company. In addition, Mr Harding considers that he has 
sufficient time to commit to the Company’s affairs notwithstanding his other business commitments and has no 
conflicting interests. 
Other than employment contracts, at no time during the year did any of the directors have an interest in any 
contract with the Group. The interests of the directors in the share capital of the Company, other than with respect 
to options to acquire ordinary shares (which are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report) were as follows:

Directors’ Report
Subject to applicable statutes, shares may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution decide, or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not make specific provision) as 
the Board may decide. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend and speak at general meetings of the 
Company, to appoint one or more proxies and, if they are corporations, corporate representatives and to exercise 
voting rights. Holders of ordinary shares may receive a dividend and on a liquidation may share in the assets 
of the Company. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company’s annual report and accounts. 
Subject to meeting certain thresholds, holders of ordinary shares may requisition a general meeting of the 
Company or the proposal of resolutions at Annual General Meetings.
Voting Rights and Restrictions on Transfer of Shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by 
proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy and entitled to 
vote has one vote for every ordinary share held. Further details regarding voting at the Annual General Meeting 
can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 27 and in the notes to the notice of the Annual General 
Meeting on pages 126 to 128. Details of the exercise of voting rights attached to the ordinary shares held by the 
Employee Share Trust are set out in the section entitled ‘Shares held by the Employee Share Trust’ below. Voting 
rights for the ordinary shares held in treasury are suspended. None of the ordinary shares, including the shares 
held by the Employee Share Trust, carry any special rights with regard to control of the Company. Electronic and 
paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must be received by the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 
hours before a general meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than:
n certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example, insider 
trading laws);
n pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code whereby the directors and certain employees of the 
Company require approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s shares; and
n where a person with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated shares has been served with 
a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of ordinary shares and for voting rights. 
Own shares acquired and held by the Company
At the Annual General Meeting held on 22 January 2009, the Company was given authority to purchase up to 
75,846,017 of its ordinary shares during the next 15 months or until the date of its next Annual General Meeting. 
During the financial year the Company did not make any on market purchases of its shares. As at 30 September 
2009 50,000,000 shares were held in treasury. The maximum number of shares held in treasury during the year 
ended 30 September 2009 was 50,000,000 on 1 October 2008 for a period of 365 days, representing 9% of total 
called up share capital at that time. The present authority for the Company to purchase its own shares will expire 
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 January 2010. The directors will be seeking a new authority for 
the Company to purchase its ordinary shares which will only be exercised if market and financial conditions make 
it advantageous to do so. It is expected that any shares purchased pursuant to a share buy-back programme will 
be cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly. Alternatively the shares may be purchased 
and held as treasury shares. Further details are set out in the explanatory notes to the notice of Annual General 
Meeting on pages 129 to 132.

Directors’ Report
Shares held by the Employee Share Trust
The Company has established an employee benefit trust (‘EBT’), the trustee of which is Halifax EES Trustees 
International Limited. As at 30 September 2009 the trustee held 7,992,048 shares, representing 1.58% of the total 
called up share capital excluding treasury shares at that date, which are used to satisfy awards made under the 
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes. The voting rights in relation to these shares are 
exercisable by the trustee; however, in accordance with investor protection guidelines the trustee abstains from 
voting. The executive directors as employees of the Company are potential beneficiaries of shares held by the EBT. 
The maximum number of shares held by the EBT during the year ended 30 September 2009 was 8,768,087 on 
1 October 2008, representing 1.73% of total called up share capital excluding treasury shares at that time. 
During the year, 776,039 shares with a nominal value of £19,401 were disposed of by the EBT by way of the 
exercise of share options under the share schemes. Of these, a total of 746,856 shares were disposed of through 
the exercise of short-term and long-term incentives for a consideration of £20. 
Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (adopted by special resolution on 17 January 2008) may only be amended 
by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. 
Significant Agreements
The Company has entered into supply and distribution contracts with Scottish & Newcastle UK Limited and InBev 
UK Limited which are terminable upon a change of control of the Company. 
In addition, the Company is a party to certain funding documents which contain provisions that allow the 
counterparties to terminate funding to the Company in certain circumstances where there has been a change of 
control of the Company. These include:
n The second supplemental credit agreement (the ‘Credit Agreement’) dated 15 May 2006 between the 
Company and the financial institutions named in the Credit Agreement which provides that if any person 
or persons acting in concert gains control of the Company, the Company must promptly notify the agent 
and the lenders must then negotiate with the Company with a view to continuing the loan facilities under 
the Credit Agreement. If at the end of the required time frame, the Company has not received a notice of 
continuance of the loan facilities from the lenders, the loan facilities will be terminated and all of the loan 
commitments cancelled under the Credit Agreement; and
n The £60 million 6% Secured Bonds due 2014, the £125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2025, the 
£125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2021, the £275 million 6.375% Secured Bonds due 2031, the 
£600 million 6.5% Secured Bonds due 2018 (collectively the ‘Secured Bonds’) the terms and conditions 
of each of which provide that following the occurrence of a restructuring event (defined in the terms 
and conditions to include (i) any person or persons acting in concert becoming interested in more than 
50% of the shares of the Company, (ii) any person or Group of connected persons acquiring control of the 
Company, or (iii) any person or persons acquiring the right to appoint more than 50% of the directors of 
the Company) the Secured Bonds must, if they are not rated, after a written resolution of the bondholders, 
be either redeemed by the Company or the Company must successfully seek an investment grade rating 
for the Secured Bonds. If the Secured Bonds are rated, on a restructuring event, they must be redeemed by 
the Company where such rating is below investment grade or later falls below investment grade.
Compensation for Loss of Office
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for 
loss of office or employment that occurs as a result of a takeover bid. Further details of the directors’ service 
contracts can be found in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 39.

Directors’ Report
Directors’ indemnities
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to grant the directors indemnities in relation to their 
duties as directors, including qualifying third party indemnity provisions (within the meaning of the Companies 
Act 2006) in respect of any liabilities incurred by them in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty 
or breach of trust in relation to the Company. No such indemnities have been granted.
Employment policies 
The Group is dependent on the skills and commitment of its employees and recognises the importance of creating 
a workplace in which all employees are inspired and enabled to give their best. A core set of common values 
means that employees at all levels of the business are encouraged to make the fullest possible contribution as 
their performance is central to the successful delivery of its objectives. 
To attract and retain these skills the Group is committed to equal opportunities and the creation of an entirely 
non-discriminatory and diverse working environment. The aim of the policy is to ensure that no job applicant or 
employee receives less favourable treatment because of, amongst other matters, gender, marital status, race, age, 
sexual preference, religion, belief or disability. All decisions are based on merit of the individual concerned. The 
Group is dedicated to undertaking its business operations in a way which respects individual human rights, treats 
individuals with dignity and allows freedom of association.
The Group gives full consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons where the requirements 
of the job can be adequately fulfilled by a handicapped or disabled person.
Where existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy wherever practicable to provide continuing 
employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion 
to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
The Group’s employment policies and procedures are described in detail in a Staff Handbook which is provided 
to all employees upon joining the Group. The Staff Handbook is regularly reviewed and updated to take account 
of relevant employment legislation and best practice, and new policies and procedures are developed if required. 
These include specific policies on equal opportunities, flexible working, training and development, acceptance of 
gifts and hospitality and whistle-blowing. 
The Group has systems in place to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure the privacy of personal 
information. 
Employee involvement and reward
The Group actively encourages learning and development and believes that effective training is essential to the 
maintenance and improvement of the Group’s success and individual performance. The Group is committed to 
providing all employees with relevant training to meet the business needs of the Group and to improve individual 
employee skills. In providing this training and support we expect high standards and commitment in return. All 
employees are provided with initial induction training and are set challenging personal objectives and participate 
in discretionary bonus schemes.
The Group operates a comprehensive employee appraisal process which ensures that clear goals are set, personal 
objectives are monitored, key competencies are assessed and any performance concerns addressed through 
appropriate training and focus. Every employee has the opportunity to discuss work-related aspirations and 
participate in appropriate training and development programmes.
During the year continued emphasis has been placed on effective communication regarding matters which 
may affect employees and the overall performance and development of the Group. The policy of providing 
employees with information about the Group has continued. Employee engagement is met through a variety of 
means including, conducting an employee satisfaction survey, regular briefings and team meetings through its 
management structure which allows a free flow of information and ideas via publications such as the ‘Innsider’ 
and ‘Eagle Eye’. Employees can also ask the executive management team questions on an anonymous basis via 
the ‘Ask the Exec’ forum. In addition, regular departmental reviews provide an opportunity for employees to be

made aware of key objectives and strategy. The use of email and the corporate intranet supplement effective 
communication to all employees
The Company continues to encourage employee ownership of its shares through the provision of the following 
employee share plans administered by HBOS Employee Equity Solutions:
n the Save As You Earn Scheme in which 230 employees have entered into savings contracts for either five 
or seven years at the end of which they are entitled to purchase shares at a discount of 20% to the market 
price of the shares at the time of the issue of the options; and
n the Share Incentive Plan in which 299 employees have purchased shares out of pre-tax income up to 
statutory limits which are held in a trust. The Company currently offers employees purchasing shares into 
the trust a matching share award. 
Community, environment and corporate responsibility
The Group recognises its responsibilities to achieve good environmental practice and to continue to strive for 
improvement in areas of environmental impact. Our approach is to work through education, communication and 
direct action wherever possible. In addition, the Group believes that the interests of responsible, entrepreneurial 
pub businesses need to be aligned to the interests of local communities and consumers. We therefore seek to 
ensure that our pubs provide a friendly, safe and controlled environment, and to promote the positive contribution 
that pubs make to their local communities.
We work to ensure that we provide the right resources, energy and focus to meet the expectations of our 
licensees and other stakeholders in this area. We have made further progress in this area during the year which 
has been recognised by our continued inclusion in the FTSE4Good index.
Full details of our responsibility policies and initiatives can be found on our website, www.enterpriseinns.com
Risks and uncertainties
This section highlights the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. The Group is exposed to a variety of 
financial, operational, economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. This is not an exhaustive analysis of all the 
risks the Group may face and some risks are not considered to be material. The Group has formal management 
processes in place to identify and evaluate these risks. Some of the risks are external and therefore beyond our 
control. The Board formally reviews these material risks and ensures that these are appropriately managed by 
the executive management team and the Board retains overall responsibility for the Group’s risk management 
framework.
The internal audit function provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of the internal control 
procedures. This is done through completion of the annual internal audit plan, which takes into account current 
business risks. The Audit Committee is responsible for annually reviewing the overall effectiveness of the risk 
management programme.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance 
with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the

The directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial 
position of the Group and the financial performance and cash flows of the Group for that period. In preparing

n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
n present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable,

the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at 
any time the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities.

Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board recognises that good governance helps the business deliver its strategy, generate long-term 
shareholder value and minimise risk. For the year under review the appropriate governance provisions are as set 
out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008 
(the ‘Combined Code’). 
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance as set out in the Combined 
Code provisions, the Turnbull Guidance on Internal Control and appropriate best practice guidance issued 
by investor bodies. Our corporate governance framework is directed in a manner which is responsible and in 
accordance with high standards of honesty, transparency and accountability. The Board considers that this 
statement on governance provides the information to enable shareholders to evaluate how the provisions and 
principles of the Combined Code have been applied.
Statement by the directors on compliance with the Combined Code 
The Board is responsible for the policies and controls put in place to discharge the Company’s responsibilities 
under the Combined Code. These include, for example, a sound system of internal controls and risk management 
procedures designed to ensure the Company’s policies achieve compliance. 
Throughout the year ended 30 September 2009 the Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set 
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and the principles of good governance.
The Company has also complied with the Smith Guidance on Audit Committees.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board
Role
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the success of the Group and for its overall strategic 
direction, its values and its governance. It provides the leadership necessary to enable the business objectives to 
be met whilst ensuring that obligations to its shareholders are safeguarded. 
Composition
As at 30 September 2009 the Board comprised the Chairman, three executive directors and four independent 
non-executive directors. The role of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and separate and clear divisions 
of accountability and responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out in writing and operate effectively. 
During the year the Board has again reviewed its composition and has concluded that its composition fully 
satisfies the requirements of the business and ensures proper governance of the Group. There were no changes to 
the membership of the Board during the year.
The Chairman, Mr H V Reid, has primary responsibility for leadership of the Board, sets its agenda and devotes 
such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties. He facilitates the effective engagement of 
the non-executive directors. He is responsible, jointly with the Chief Executive, for the effective communication 
with the Company’s shareholders and representation of the Group externally.
The Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen, has executive responsibility for executing the Group’s strategy and 
development. He leads the management of the Company in order to optimise long-term shareholder value by 
meeting key strategic and financial objectives.
The Board requires that all non-executive directors are free from any relationship with the executive management 
that could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgement. The Board recognises that length of service 
can impact on the independence of a non-executive director and, having considered this, is satisfied that all non-
executives remain independent in character and judgement for the purposes of the Combined Code. The Board 
membership and that of its Committees is designed to ensure that no one individual or group dominates proceedings 
and that their wide variety of skills allows effective leadership across the Company’s business activities.
17092ENTERPRI.indd   21 17092ENTERPRI.indd   21 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  22   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009

Corporate Governance
Mr D A Harding and Mr W S Townsend are seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting on 21 January 
2010. The Board is satisfied that Mr Harding and Mr Townsend continue to perform effectively and demonstrate 
commitment and time to their role and duties and have a range of skills and experience relevant to their 
continued appointment. In addition Mr Harding considers he has sufficient time to commit to the Company’s 
affairs notwithstanding his other business commitments and has no conflicting interests. Newly appointed 
directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following 
appointment to the Board. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 
21 January 2010 can be found in the Notice of the meeting on pages 124 to 128.
Biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 7 and 8. 
Operation of the Board
The Company has an effective Board which leads and controls the Company and is responsible to the 
shareholders for its proper management and its success. The Board therefore provides entrepreneurial leadership, 
sets and monitors the Company’s strategic aims, reviews management performance and examines major capital 
expenditure and acquisition opportunities. 
The Board has established guidelines requiring that specific matters are reserved for a decision by the full Board. 
This ensures that the Board maintains control over strategic, major financial and key operational issues. Such 
matters include, for example, the approval of financial statements, material acquisitions and disposals of assets, 
risk management and governance policies. All meetings of the Board are structured to allow open discussion by 
all directors and ensure full participation in the decision-making process. 
Meetings and Attendance
The Board held six scheduled meetings in the past year and is expected to hold a similar number of such 
meetings over its next financial year. The Board can convene additional meetings as necessary to consider 
matters that are time critical. In addition, two separate Strategic Business Reviews are held ‘off site’ annually at 
which high level strategic issues, such as future business direction and its financial and operational implications 
are reviewed and debated. These Strategic Business Reviews have a strong operational focus and also give the 
Board the opportunity to hear contributions from the senior management team.

Corporate Governance
Non-executive directors and the Senior Independent Director 
The non-executive directors complement the skills and experience of the executive directors and bring an 
independent judgement to the decision-making process at Board and Committee level. Their role requires a time 
commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus additional time as necessary to properly discharge their 
duties. In terms of commitments outside of the Company any material changes must be reported to and pre-
cleared with the Chairman.
The Company has appointed a Senior Independent Director, Mr A J Stewart, whose role and responsibilities 
are clearly defined, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Senior Independent Director is available to 
shareholders if they have any concerns that cannot be resolved through contact via normal channels.
In compliance with the Combined Code the Senior Independent Director met with the other non-executives 
during the year to discuss matters in a forum that did not include executive directors or the Chairman. In addition, 
all of the non-executives including the Chairman met twice during the year without the executive directors being 
present to discuss in detail the matters which they believed to be relevant for the purposes of the Strategic 
Business Reviews, including key operational and financial issues, performance of the Chief Executive and overall 
feedback arising from the performance evaluation process.
Information and Training
The Board and its committees are supplied with full and timely information which enables the proper discharge of 
their responsibilities. 
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense. There is a formal written procedure concerning independent professional 
advice setting out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board. The Company has arranged appropriate 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to provide cover in the event of legal action against its directors. 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its committees and is responsible for advising 
the Chairman on matters of corporate governance, ensuring the good flow of information to the Board and 
its committees and between the non-executives and senior management. The written responsibilities of the 
Company Secretary are available on the Company’s website. On 1 October 2009, Mr J A Poole, formerly Deputy 
Company Secretary, was appointed Company Secretary.
All new directors receive an appropriately tailored induction programme arranged to develop their knowledge 
and understanding of the Group and the key business issues, including social, environmental and ethical issues. 
The training needs of each director are regularly reviewed and assessed by the Board. Existing directors undertake 
such professional development as is necessary for them to carry out their duties as directors. During the year 
the directors have, amongst other matters, received appropriate guidance on further changes introduced by the 
Companies Act 2006.
Re-election of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company require that any directors appointed by the Board will put themselves 
up for election at the next following Annual General Meeting and also that directors will submit themselves for 
re-election at least once every three years.
The Board has determined that re-election of the Chairman and non-executive directors is not automatic and is 
subject to formal review and recommendation by the Nominations Committee and approval by shareholders. 
Board Committees
In order to ensure effective leadership and governance the Board governs through clearly identified committees 
which have delegated powers to deal with specific aspects of the Company’s affairs. A summary of the operation 
of these committees is set out below. All committees of the Board that are subject to the requirements of the 
Combined Code are chaired by an independent director or have a majority of independent directors as members. 
The names and biographical details of all Board Committee members are set out on pages 7 and 8.

Corporate Governance
The Audit Committee
The Board’s obligation to establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply 
financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the 
Company’s external auditor is met through the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr D O Maloney who has current and relevant financial experience. The 
Committee’s other members are Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray. All members are independent. 
The Committee met three times during the year to coincide with the financial reporting and audit cycles of the 
Company including the submission of the interim and annual financial statements. Representatives from the 
external auditor, the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer were in attendance at part or all of each 
meeting by invitation. As a matter of best practice the Committee is able to meet alone with external auditors as 
required at the end of its meetings.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in accordance 
with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s website. 
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters including the interim and annual 
accounts prior to their submission to the Board, and monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure 
the integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Committee advises the Board on the 
appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration and discusses the nature and scope of their work. 
The Committee has also been concerned to ensure that the appropriate standards of governance, reporting and 
compliance are being met. The Company has in place a whistle-blowing policy under which employees may, in 
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in such matters as financial reporting.
For the year under review the Committee:
n has monitored the integrity of the financial statements, interim and final report and accounts and relevant 
regulatory announcements;
n agreed the annual internal/external audit plan and has considered external auditor reports and has 
monitored and followed up management actions in response to issues raised;
n met regularly with management and with internal and external auditors to review the effectiveness of 
internal controls and business risk management and is satisfied that proper and satisfactory internal 
controls remain in place to identify and contain business risk; 
n has monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function; 
n reviewed and monitored the independence and objectivity of external auditors; and
n carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of external auditors for the provision of non-audit 
services and reviews this annually. 
The policy is designed to:
n ensure that the engagement does not impair the objectivity of the auditor’s opinion on the Group financial 
statements;
n establish a transparent process and reporting to enable the Committee to monitor policy compliance; and
n avoid unnecessary restrictions on the engagement of auditors for non-audit services where the provision of 
advice is of a higher quality and more cost-effective than other providers. 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   24 17092ENTERPRI.indd   24 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16     Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009   25
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Corporate Governance
The policy covers the type of services permitted including:
n advice and assurance work regarding direct and indirect tax matters including tax compliance;
n due diligence investigations related to potential acquisitions and disposals; and
n accounting advice and reviews of accounting standards.
The Committee is confident that in reviewing the external auditor’s Annual Audit Results Report the objectivity 
and independence of the auditor are not impaired by the provision of non-audit services. This report includes a 
statement confirming compliance by the auditor with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standard 5 (‘Non-
Audit services provided to audit clients’). The Committee is satisfied that such non-audit work is best handled 
by them due to knowledge of the Group. The Committee aims to have non-audit work carried out in a manner 
that affords full value for money and considers it appropriate for commercial and practical reasons, including 
confidentiality, to use the external auditor for certain non-audit services. The amount of non-audit fees charged by 
auditors is disclosed in note 6 to the accounts.
The Nominations Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mr H V Reid and its members are the Chief Executive Mr G E Tuppen and the four 
non-executive directors Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney. 
The Committee is responsible for proactively refreshing and reviewing the Board’s composition. The Committee 
nominates, for approval by the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard to its balance 
and structure. The Committee is also responsible for succession planning and takes into account the knowledge 
and skills mix required by the Board in the future. The Committee meets as required and met once during the 
year. The Committee seeks the advice of external recruitment consultants as necessary and follows a formal and 
transparent procedure to ensure that new appointments comply with the principles set out in the Combined Code 
and satisfy the needs for the balance of the Board. Any appointments are based on merit and against objective 
criteria, including the time available to, and the commitment which will be required of, the potential director. 
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in accordance 
with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code to ensure that no director is involved in discussions 
regarding his or her own succession. These terms of reference are available on the Company’s website. The 
individual terms and conditions of appointment of directors can be inspected during normal office hours at the 
Company’s registered office and at the Annual General Meeting.
During the year in review the Committee:
n reviewed the plan for the retirement of directors under the Company’s Articles of Association; 
n reviewed the framework and the proposed timetable for succession planning for executive and non-
executive appointments; 
n reviewed the composition, and recommended to the Board the appointment of new Chairs, of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees;
n recommended to the Board the appointment of Mr J A Poole as Company Secretary; and 
n carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mrs S E Murray and its members are the three other non-executive directors Mr A J 
Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mr D O Maloney. The Committee is responsible for determining the contract terms, 
remuneration and other benefits of the executive directors and senior management, including performance-related 
bonus schemes and the Chairman’s fee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the Board.
17092ENTERPRI.indd   25 17092ENTERPRI.indd   25 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  26   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Corporate Governance
The Committee appoints external remuneration consultants and advisers as necessary to provide remuneration 
services and advice to the Remuneration Committee and the Company. The Committee met on six occasions 
during the year. 
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in accordance 
with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s website. 
The responsibilities of the Committee, together with an explanation of how it applies the principles set out in the 
Combined Code, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report which includes details of directors’ remuneration 
and directors’ interests in options, together with information on service contracts, and is set out on pages 29 to 39.
During the period in review the Committee:
n determined the remuneration for executive directors and the Chairman;
n reviewed overall levels of remuneration for senior managers;
n determined the awards and, where relevant, performance targets under the Company’s incentive 
arrangements under the Annual Bonus Plan and Long-term Incentive Plan 2005;
n carried out a comprehensive ‘benchmarking’ review of executive directors’ remuneration;
n carried out a comprehensive review of annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements;
n agreed the content and presentation of the remuneration report for inclusion in the report and accounts; 
and 
n carried out an annual evaluation of its performance. 
Executive Committee
The Board delegates day-to-day management of the Group to the Executive Committee which comprises the three 
executive directors and is chaired by the Chief Executive. The Executive Committee generally meets weekly and 
other members of the Group’s Executive Management and Senior Management Teams attend as necessary to 
provide input and to facilitate communication of the Executive Committee’s decisions to the rest of the Group.
Finance Committee and Disclosure & Monitoring Committees
The Board has delegated, within agreed terms of reference, responsibility for certain matters of a routine nature 
which are not reserved for full Board consideration to a Finance Committee. This Committee comprises two 
executive directors, one of which must be the Chief Financial Officer. In addition and to ensure full compliance 
with its obligations under the Disclosure Rules published by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has 
established a Disclosure Committee comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to 
maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to make timely and accurate disclosure of 
information via a regulatory news service when it is impracticable to hold a full Board meeting. A separate 
Monitoring Committee has been established to monitor compliance with the Listing Rules published by the UK 
Listing Authority, including a policy based on the Model Code which covers dealings in securities of the Company 
and applies to directors, persons discharging managerial responsibility and employee insiders.
Performance evaluation
Principle A.6 of the Combined Code provides that the Board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. During the year the Company has 
internally undertaken a critical self assessment performance evaluation programme in accordance with this principle 
and has effectively evaluated the Board, its Committees and its individual directors, including the Chairman. 
Board performance evaluation 
The process was led by the Chairman and all directors completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to 
score a number of performance criteria. The results of these questionnaires are compiled into a report by the 
Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the findings to the Board. This year’s review found that the Board

continued to work well notwithstanding the current economic and strategic challenges and the difficult trading 
environment. 
Board Committee performance evaluation
For the Board Committee performance evaluation processes each Committee Chairman and Committee member 
completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria. The results of 
these questionnaires were compiled into a report by the Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the 
findings to the Board. This year’s review found there was a continued unanimous agreement that the Board 
committee structure is adequate and that the structure supports the Board, that the structure of each committee 
was right for the business and meets the governance requirements of the business and that transition following 
appointment of new Chairs to the Audit and Remuneration Committees has been successful.
Non-executive director performance evaluation
This process was led by the Chairman and all non-executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire 
in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria. Each non-executive director then met on a 
confidential basis with the Chairman to review their questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail including any 
matters arising from the evaluation of the Board and Committee performance. In addition, the Senior Independent 
Director met with the other non-executives without the Chairman being present to review the Chairman’s performance.

is also set challenging performance objectives. The successful achievement of these objectives makes up part of 
the short-term incentive criteria under the Annual Bonus Plan 2005.
Shareholder relations
The Board places considerable importance on maintaining clear communications with its stakeholders directed 
to ensuring a mutual understanding of its objectives and has a continuing dialogue with institutional investors to 
discuss the progress of the business and deal with a wide range of enquiries. This includes one on one meetings, 
presentations after the preliminary announcement for the year and the results for the half year and specific 
analyst presentations with feedback from the Company’s brokers as necessary. 
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring, via the Company Secretary, that views of major shareholders are fed 
back to the Board on a regular basis. The effectiveness of how shareholder views are communicated forms 
part of the annual Board performance evaluation process. During the year information about the progress of 
the Company, including reports, regulatory announcements released through the London Stock Exchange 
and presentations, is made available simultaneously on its website so that shareholders have full access to 
material information. Directors regularly receive copies of analyst reports and reports on movements in major 
shareholdings as well as key broker comments.
The Annual General Meeting, held in January each year, is the principal opportunity to encourage participation 
by private investors and procedures at such meetings are in accordance with the Combined Code. The Chairmen 
of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer 
questions. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 21 January 2010 can be 
found in the Notice of the meeting on pages 124 to 128. The Notice is sent by first class post to shareholders 
who have opted for hard copy communications at least 20 working days before the Annual General Meeting and 
details of proxy votes for and against are made available after the result of hand votes. In accordance with the 
Combined Code the Company has proposed in the Notice separate resolutions on each substantial matter. Again 
this year the Company is, in line with relevant guidelines, offering shareholders a facility for electronic proxy 
voting and voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. The voting results are announced on 
the same day to the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website.

Corporate Governance
The Company has adopted, pursuant to good investor practice, innovative ways of communicating with 
shareholders and, in accordance with the provisions introduced in the Companies Act 2006, has given 
shareholders the opportunity to receive shareholder communications, such as the report and accounts, the interim 
report and notices of meetings, electronically via the internet rather than in paper form through the post.
Finally the Company’s Registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, deal with a wide range of investor queries 
on behalf of shareholders. Details of additional shareholder services are set out on page 123.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the overall system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
It carries out such a review at least annually covering all material controls including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management systems.
An ongoing process on internal control has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks 
faced by the Group. This process is reviewed regularly by the Board and, with advice from its Audit Committee, 
is satisfied that this meets the requirements of the guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1999 and the Turnbull 
Guidance. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. It should be recognised that such systems 
can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. This process has 
been in place since the start of the financial year and up to the date of approval of the accounts. 
The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are 
as follows:
n Regular Board meetings are held and the Board has agreed a schedule of matters reserved for its 
consideration.
n The Board carries out an annual review of corporate strategy which includes a review of risks facing the 
business, and how these risks are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis within the organisation. 
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
n An established organisational structure with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of 
authority.
n An established internal audit function which implements the annual internal audit plan as agreed by the 
Committee.
n Documented and enforced policies and procedures.
n Appointment of staff of the necessary calibre to fulfil their allotted responsibilities.
n Comprehensive budgets and forecasts, approved by the Board, reviewed and revised on a regular basis, 
with performance monitored against them and explanations obtained for material variances.
n A detailed investment approval process, requiring Board approval for major projects. Post-investment 
appraisals are conducted and are reviewed by the Board.
n The Audit Committee of the Board, comprising non-executive directors, considers significant financial 
control matters as appropriate.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Information not subject to audit:
Remuneration Committee and advisers
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is composed entirely of independent non-executive 
directors and is chaired by Mrs S E Murray, its other members being Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mr D O 
Maloney. No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided. Mr H V 
Reid and Mr G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee except when their own remuneration 
is being discussed.
The Committee’s key objectives are to:
n Determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration 
package for executive directors. 
n Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of 
Schedule A and B of the Combined Code. This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts & Reports) 
Regulations 2008. 
The Committee seeks advice relating to directors’ remuneration from Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’, a trading 
name of Hewitt Associates, Inc) who were appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the 
Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Company’s incentive schemes and 
executive remuneration more generally. In particular, Hewitt New Bridge Street assisted the Committee in its 
recent full review of the Company’s executive remuneration policy, details of which are set out below.
Ernst & Young LLP (‘E&Y’) have also been appointed by the Committee to provide technical and administrative 
advice to both the Committee and the Company on the operation of the Company’s incentive plans. E&Y are the 
Group’s auditor and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation. 
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on responsible investment disclosure, the Committee 
will ensure that the incentive structure for the executive directors and senior management will not raise 
environmental, social or governance (‘ESG’) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More 
generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which 
prevents it from taking into account ESG matters or, indeed, any other operational/financial risks that relate to 
the Company’s business.
The Committee Chairman liaises with relevant senior managers in the Group to ensure that pay and employment 
conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account when framing the executive remuneration policy.
Remuneration Policy — Executive Directors 
The Committee regularly reviews the executive directors’ remuneration packages to ensure they take due account 
of the Company’s specific circumstances, market practice, the views of its shareholders and are aligned to the 
Company’s key strategic objectives.
A detailed review of the Company’s executive remuneration policy has recently been conducted by the 
Committee, with the assistance of HNBS. The Committee considered this review timely in light of the challenging 
trading conditions experienced by all consumer facing businesses which are materially different from the 
conditions that prevailed at the time of the Committee’s last review. When conducting its analysis of market 
practice, the Committee considered pay practices adopted amongst two comparator groups of companies: (i) a 
group of listed companies in the Travel and Leisure sector and (ii) a broader group of listed companies from the 
wider market. Both groups comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Enterprise Inns.
17092ENTERPRI.indd   29 17092ENTERPRI.indd   29 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  30   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Committee concluded that the existing policy and approach remained both relevant and appropriate in terms 
of the balance between (i) fixed and variable pay, (ii) short-term incentive and long-term incentive pay and (iii) 
cash-based and share-based remuneration. Specifically it was decided that: 
n There should be no increase in base salaries or pension provision for the financial year beginning 
1 October 2009.
n The basic structure of the annual bonus in terms of (i) maximum bonus opportunity, (ii) the use of both 
challenging EPS targets and individual strategic targets, and (iii) a significant element of deferral into 
shares, should remain unchanged.
n The current approach to long-term incentive provision, which is provided via the regular annual grant 
of awards under the Company’s 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan that only vest in full five years after 
grant subject to challenging performance conditions, should also be continued. There have been two 
minor changes to the detailed manner in which the performance conditions operate as set out in the 
commentary on pages 32 and 33.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy will, therefore, continue to be designed to ensure that the level and 
structure of remuneration arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional 
individuals required to enhance shareholder value. The fixed elements of the package comprise basic salary, 
benefits and pensions. 
It is the Committee’s policy that the performance-related elements of the package, comprising short-term cash 
and deferred share bonuses and long-term share-based awards, should equate to around two-thirds of total 
remuneration for the executive directors based on an on-target, expected value approach to valuing the package. 
The Committee will continue at all times to be mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
The Committee believes that these performance-related incentive arrangements provide rewards which reflect an 
appropriate balance between Group and individual performance and align the rewards to executive directors with 
the long-term interest of shareholders. The current policy is for share-based awards to be satisfied by the use of 
existing shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust (further details are set out in the Directors’ Report on page 9).
The executive directors may accept outside appointments provided that such outside appointments do not in any 
way prejudice their ability to perform their duties as executive directors of the Company. The extent to which any 
executive director is allowed to retain any fees payable in respect of such outside appointments, or whether such 
fees are remitted to the Company, will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly. The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against 
appropriate comparators and taking account of individual performance. Benefits include car allowances or the 
use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances. In determining the basic salary for the executive directors 
the Committee takes account of the changes to individual responsibilities, benchmark data received from its 
remuneration advisers and current market and economic conditions. Following the Committee’s most recent 
detailed review of pay levels and structure, it was decided that there be no increase in basic salary levels for the 
financial year beginning 1 October 2009. 
Pensions
The pension contributions for the executive directors equate to 25% of basic salary. As previously reported the 
Committee agreed that, from 1 October 2006, G E Tuppen would receive a sum equivalent to 25% of basic salary 
in lieu of his pension contributions as a salary supplement (this is not included in any bonus and share incentive 
award calculations). No changes have been made to executive pension provision following the Committee’s 
recent review.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans (the ‘Plans’)
For the year under review the Company had the following relevant Plans:
n The Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 (‘the 2002 Plan’). The 2002 Plan (adopted at the 2002 Annual 
General Meeting) provided for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and 
long-term share incentives.
n The Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan (‘the 
2005 Plan’ both adopted at the 2005 Annual General Meeting). 
The 2005 Plan replaced the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan. All 
awards made under the 2002 Plan have now been exercised.
Further details of the Plans are set out below.
Short-term cash and share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the terms of the 2005 Plan (currently in operation) executive directors are eligible to participate in an 
annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Committee. For the year under review the maximum award level 
under the 2005 Plan for the Chief Executive was 125% of salary. For the other executive directors the maximum 
award level was 100% of salary. 
Awards under the 2005 Plan are subject to demanding performance targets. For the year under review, 80% of 
the executive directors’ bonus was subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, 
with 20% subject to challenging individual strategic targets. 60% of any bonus earned is paid in cash, with the 
remaining 40% deferred into shares (a Deferred Share Award). Deferred Share Awards may not ordinarily be 
exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period. Awards between the minimum and 
maximum limits are calculated by reference to performance achieved against the pre-set targets.
The bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 35. The bonuses paid range from 
18% to 23% of salary and were paid for performance against the challenging individual strategic objectives 
that were set at the start of the year (comprising 20% of the total bonus opportunity) and which related to key 
financial, strategic and operational targets. No bonus was payable in relation to the EPS element of the bonus. It 
has been decided that, to further strengthen the alignment of interests between executives and shareholders and 
to reflect current challenging trading conditions, this entire bonus shall be payable as a Deferred Share Award, 
notwithstanding the fact that the rules of the bonus plan require only 40% of any bonus earned to be deferred. 
Following the Committee’s recent review of executive remuneration, it was decided to retain the core elements 
of the executive directors’ bonus opportunity for the forthcoming year. As a result, for the financial year beginning 
on 1 October 2009 (i) there will be no change in maximum bonus opportunity, (ii) 40% of any bonus earned will 
be payable as a Deferred Share Award and (iii) 80% of the total bonus opportunity will be payable by reference 
to performance against a sliding scale of adjusted EPS targets and 20% will be payable for performance against 
individual strategic targets. Due account was taken of the lower projected EPS result for the financial year 
beginning on 1 October 2009 when setting the EPS targets in that both (i) the threshold level of EPS performance, 
at which point this element of the bonus becomes payable, and (ii) the higher EPS target, at which point this 
element of the bonus pays out in full, are more challenging compared to the budgeted EPS than was the case in 
previous years.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan
Under the 2002 Plan (under which no awards have been made since financial year 2003/04), awards of ordinary 
shares were made to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI 
over three years. 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   31 17092ENTERPRI.indd   31 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  32   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Directors’ Remuneration Report
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 
(15.8% simple), and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary (averaged over a three year period), 
adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by 20% compound (72.8% simple). 
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth 
in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets. 
The final award under the 2002 Plan was made in the financial year 2003/04 and was exercised in the year under 
review.
Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the 2005 Plan (which is currently in operation), long-term incentive awards have two elements:
n an award of Performance Shares (worth up to 150% of salary each year); and 
n an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in ‘Investment Shares’, 
which are then matched on a 2:1 basis. 
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are:
n shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan; and
n shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Following the Committee’s recent detailed review of executive remuneration, it was decided that the 2005 Plan 
remained an appropriate vehicle through which long-term incentives are provided to senior executives. 
Past awards made under the 2005 Plan do not vest in full until five years after grant and are subject to 
challenging adjusted EPS targets and relative TSR-based performance conditions. 
The Committee believed that the use of both EPS targets and relative TSR targets was appropriate at the relevant 
time for the following reasons:
n the adjusted EPS targets encouraged the executive team to deliver strong adjusted EPS performance over 
the three year performance period; and
n the TSR targets required the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of the majority of 
companies in the FTSE 100 index.
For awards made under the 2005 Plan in the past, half of these awards were subject to a performance condition 
based on average compound annual adjusted EPS growth. This EPS-based condition measured the Company’s 
average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by comparing the Company’s adjusted EPS for the year prior to 
the date of grant (the ‘base year’) with the adjusted EPS for the third financial year following the base year. The 
EPS growth targets to which past awards are subject are as follows:
  Level of match under the relevant
 Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Average compound  portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
annual adjusted EPS growth Award that vests Investment Shares)
Less than 7% 0% 0:1
7% 20% 0.4:1
15% 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting occurs if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7% and 15%. 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   32 17092ENTERPRI.indd   32 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16     Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009   33
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Directors’ Remuneration Report
The remaining half of the awards have been subject to a TSR condition which compares the Company’s TSR 
performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 (as at the 
date of grant) as follows:
  Level of match under the relevant
 Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Company’s TSR ranking v.  portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
the FTSE 100 Award that vests Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0:1
Median 20% 0.4:1
Upper quintile 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting will occur if the Company’s TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile. 
All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant. The Committee seeks 
independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met. 
While a main conclusion drawn from the Committee’s recent review of executive remuneration was that the 2005 
Plan should continue as the main long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives, it was decided that 
minor changes should be made to the manner in which the performance conditions should operate.
First, for the awards granted in December 2008 and, as is currently intended, all future awards, TSR will be 
calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each company over the three month period prior to grant and 
vesting (a six month average was used for previous awards), unless the Committee determines that a shorter 
or longer period is a more appropriate way of ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the 
Company’s TSR performance over the period.
Second, it has been the Committee’s general policy that no part of the TSR portion of awards should vest unless 
the Company’s adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes 
that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin. However, the Committee decided that this underpin should not be 
applied to the awards made in December 2008. This decision was made on the basis that, while it was considered 
important at the time to ensure that the December 2008 awards are consistent with past awards, via the use of 
the same challenging EPS growth and relative TSR targets, these awards also needed to reflect the circumstances 
facing the Company at the time they were made and to ensure they constituted an appropriate incentive for the 
Company’s management team. 
The Committee is currently considering what performance conditions should apply to awards made in the year 
beginning on 1 October 2009. The Committee believes that these conditions must take full account of and be 
closely aligned with the Company’s strategic objectives and the challenging trading conditions being experienced 
by all consumer facing businesses. In the event that the Committee concludes that there should be materially 
different targets applied to these awards than those described above, the Committee will consult with the 
Company’s major shareholders before their grant.
Remuneration Policy — Non-Executive Directors
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association. 
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having 
taken advice on appropriate levels in light of the time commitment and responsibilities of each individual. The 
Chairman’s fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee. No increases were made to 
the base level of non-executive directors’ fees for the financial year beginning 1 October 2009 although changes 
will be made to reflect changes in individual responsibilities.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which 
they are entitled to receive twelve months’ notice of termination. There are no special provisions in the 
executive directors’ contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office. The Committee would consider 
the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments 
accordingly. A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the 
context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
The service contracts of the executive directors include the following terms:
Executive Directors  Date of Agreement Effective Date Notice Period
G E Tuppen  25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months
D C George  25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months
W S Townsend  31 October 2000 1 October 2000 12 months
The terms of appointment for Mr H V Reid, Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding, Mrs S E Murray and Mr D O Maloney 
take due account of best practice. Their respective appointments shall continue on an annual basis from Annual 
General Meeting to Annual General Meeting, subject to re-election, when applicable. 
In respect of the Chairman and non-executive directors, the dates on which their appointments took effect and 
the current expiry dates are as follows:
Chairman and 
Non-Executive Directors Date of Appointment Expiry Date
H V Reid 21 January 1997 Terminable on 12 months’ notice
A J Stewart 29 May 2001 Terminable on 6 months’ notice
D A Harding 6 November 2003 Terminable on 6 months’ notice
S E Murray 3 November 2004 Terminable on 6 months’ notice
D O Maloney 10 July 2008 Terminable on 6 months’ notice
Biographical details of all directors can be found on pages 7 and 8.
Forward-looking statement
The Committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as detailed in this report, under review during 
the next year to ensure that the Company’s reward programmes remain competitive and provide appropriate 
incentives.

Notes:
(i) These shares have vested and have been used to count towards the participant’s co-investment in Investment Shares for the 
purposes of calculating the Matching Share award for the financial year 2006/07 under the 2005 Plan, details of which are set 
out below.
(ii)  These shares have vested and have been used to count towards the participant’s co-investment in Investment Shares for the 
purposes of calculating the Matching Share award for the financial year 2007/08 under the 2005 Plan, details of which are set 
out below. These shares represented the deferral of the entire bonus payable under the 2005 Plan for the year 2006/07.
(iii) These shares have vested and have been used to count towards the participant’s co-investment in Investment Shares for the 
purposes of calculating the Matching Share award for the financial year 2008/09 under the 2005 Plan, details of which are set 
out below.
(iv) Market value is calculated using the mid market price of the ordinary shares at 30 September 2009 being £1.245.
(v) The share price at which the number of Deferred Shares granted under the 2005 Plan is calculated will not be confirmed until 
after the date of the approval of the accounts. The number of Deferred Shares awarded for the financial year 2008/09 is therefore 
estimated using the mid market price of the ordinary shares at 30 September 2009 being £1.245.
(vi) Market value is based on a percentage of basic salary earned as a result of achievement of performance objectives for the year 
2008/09. These awards have become unconditional since the end of the financial year. It is intended that the relevant portion 
of these awards will be used towards the participant’s co-investment in Investment Shares for the purposes of calculating the 
Matching Share award for the financial year 2009/10 under the 2005 Plan, details of which are set out below.
 £1 in aggregate is payable by the participants on the exercise of each year’s short-term incentive award.

Notes:
(i)  The award is calculated using average salary paid to participants between 1 October 2003 and 30 September 2006. Market value 
of each share is taken at the start of the incentive period (230.9 pence).
(ii)  The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined under the 2005 Plan. 
Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days following announcement of the results for the 
financial year 2003/04 (341.9 pence).
(iii) The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined under the 2005 Plan. 
Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days following announcement of the results for the 
financial year 2004/05 (440.25 pence). 
(iv) The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined under the 2005 Plan. 
Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days following announcement of the results for the 
financial year 2005/06 (597.7 pence). The EPS condition for this award has been tested by Hewitt New Bridge Street and agreed 
by the remuneration committee at the date of this report and resulted in none of the award subject to the EPS condition vesting. 
Similarly, the EPS growth ‘underpin’ to which the TSR element of the award is subject was not satisfied, resulting in none of the 
TSR element of the award vesting.

under the 2005 Plan. Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days

Notes to the Group Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies
The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2009 were authorised 
for issue by the Board on 16 November 2009. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
registered in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union.

subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. 
Prior year comparatives have been restated. Please see note 13e for further information.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in 
a business combination. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for 
impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired. On disposal of an operation, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
profit or loss on sale. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been 
reinstated. Any such goodwill is not included in determining any profit or loss on disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held 
at cost. The Group’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each 
year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such 
valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except where 
they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an expense 
in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the revaluation 
reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in value is 
recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their 
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at 
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. 
Landlords’ fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords’ fixtures and fittings and short life 
landlords’ fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of 
additions to long life landlords’ fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords’ fixtures 
and fittings has been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost 
less residual value over their useful economic life. 
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease 
term and their useful economic life of 50 years. 
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line 
basis to residual value.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are 
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is 
less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-
in-use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same 
asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement. 
Leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. 
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future 
minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable. 
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease payments are 
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest 
on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income Statement. 
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement 
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as 
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term. 
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of 
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for 
disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be 
highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is actively 
marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and operating 
lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised. 
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprise tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred 
on disposal.
Repairs and Maintenance
 Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred. 
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or 
less are classified as cash equivalents. 
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures, secured bonds and securitised bonds are measured at 
amortised cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the 
amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across 
the life of the instrument.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified 
as derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and 
are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is 
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted 
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it 
meets the Group’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective. 
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets 
the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity. 
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the case of 
interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds 
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up Share Capital and 
the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium. 
Net debt
Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash. Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to 
banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred 
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets 
and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be 
settled net or simultaneously. 
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Provisions
 Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the provision would 
therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Pension obligations
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income 
Statement as incurred. 
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount 
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and 
the fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected 
return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until 
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of 
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of beverages 
are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees. Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the 
income relates. 
Segmental reporting
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ during the year. The new standard has no impact on the 
presentation of segmental information within note 2. The standard requires that segment information is presented 
in the same basis as that for internal reporting purposes, consistent with the reports provided to the chief decision 
maker. The Group has one business segment, being the operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate. The Group 
operates solely within the UK.
Share-based payments 
The Group has taken advantage of the exception in IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply IFRS 2 
only to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005. 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance 
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period 
by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income 
Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation 
models. 
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.

1. Accounting policies (continued)
Operating profit
Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading 
activities before net (loss)/profit on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of pub estate 
and related assets, interest, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items
 The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
Income Statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or 
nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following:
a) Exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative expenses
In 2008 the operating exceptional item shown within administrative expenses related to legal, professional and 
advisory fees in respect of the review of REIT restructuring.
The exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative costs in 2009 relate to the operation of temporary 
management agreements (TMA). The presentation as exceptional is based on the fact that the cost is not considered 
to be part of the normal course of business and it is not expected to be incurred for an extended period. 
b) Net (loss)/profit on sale of property, plant and equipment
Net (loss)/profit arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment including goodwill allocation.
c) Movements in valuation of pub estate and related assets 
 Any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the Income 
Statement. If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the increase in value 
is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised. Where pubs identified 
for disposal are written down to ‘fair value less costs to sell’, the associated write-down is also recognised in this 
line. The majority of the impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and recognised in the 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 
d) Movement in fair value of financial instruments
The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is recognised in 
the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted. The movement in the fair value of swaps where hedge 
accounting is not applied is shown as an exceptional item. 
Tax
A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the pub estate. On transition to IFRS, 
the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999. This led to an increase in 
goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief, 
a debit or a credit is recognised in the Income Statement. This has been classified as an exceptional tax item due to 
its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same 
period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in equity and recognised in the 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. 
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income 
Statement.

New standards and interpretations
During the year the Group has adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments:
n Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009
n IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009
n IFRIC 14 — The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction — 
effective 1 October 2008
They have had no material impact on the results of the Group.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the 
date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Group are not expected to 
have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some changes 
to the presentation of the financial statements. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Group 
will be required to implement the standard:
n Amendment to IAS 1 — Presentation of Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009
n Amendment to IAS 27 — Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements — effective 1 October 2009
n Amendment to IFRS 3 — Business Combinations — effective 1 October 2009
n Amendment to IFRS 2 — Vesting Conditions and Cancellations — effective 1 October 2009
n Amendment to IAS 39 — Eligible Hedged Items — effective 1 July 2009
n Amendment to IFRS 7 — Financial Statement Disclosures — effective 1 October 2009
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual 
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’). The valuation is based on market observations and 
estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after 
proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market 
value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the pub estate 
is provided in note 18 of these financial statements. 
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and these 
estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting 
policy for PPE. 
b) Testing goodwill for impairment
The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate goodwill 
to the group of Cash Generating Units (CGUs) that benefits from the synergy of acquisitions and reflects the level 
at which goodwill is monitored. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit that the goodwill has been 
allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating future cash flows and 
applying a suitable discount rate. Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 16.

Notes to the Group Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies (continued)
c) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are 
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The 
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract 
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation 
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d) Taxation 
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot 
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not 
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a 
liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting 
treatment.
e) Other 
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension 
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

Temporary Management Agreements (TMAs) were introduced during the year, allowing the Group to take 
immediate control of viable pubs where the operator has failed and move them quickly through a refurbishment 
and relaunch programme. Management companies are paid to run the pubs and the Group benefits from the profits 
and is responsible for any losses.
The exceptional revenue, cost of sales and administrative costs in 2009 relate to the operation of temporary 
management agreements (TMA). The presentation as exceptional is based on the fact that the cost is not 
considered to be part of the normal course of business and it is not expected to be incurred for an extended period. 
The net cost of £5 million comprises administrative costs of £8 million being management fees and net losses; this 
cost is offset by £3 million of gross profit on beer sales to these pubs.

(i)  The statutory corporation tax rate changed from 30% to 28% on 1 April 2008. Therefore, the applicable tax rate 
in the note above is 29% for the year ended 30 September 2008, being six months of the year at 30% and six 
months of the year at 28%.
(ii)  On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the 
revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets. The 
deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occured 
since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of £330 million as the fair value of the 
net assets acquired had been reduced. In previous years this pre-acquisition liability has reduced due to capital 
gains indexation relief, and a credit has been recognised in the Income Statement. Indexation is calculated 
with reference to the movement in the Retail Price Index (RPI) during the year. Up until 30 September 2008 
RPI had been increasing; however, for the year ended 30 September 2009 the movement in the index has been 
negative. The exceptional indexation debit for the year ended 30 September 2009 is £9 million compared with 
a £26 million indexation credit in 2008. This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and 
because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period.

e) Prior year adjustment
On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the 
revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over, into other assets. The 
deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business combinations that have occurred since 
1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill as the fair value of the net assets acquired had 
been reduced. 
The deferred tax liability has moved each year due to indexation. Any indexation relating to the pre-acquisition 
liability is recognised in the income statement and has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and 
because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income Statement in the same period. The 
indexation relating to post acquisition gains is recognised as a movement in the revaluation reserve.
During the year, the method of calculating the deferred tax liability recognised in relation to the pub estate has 
been revised. This has resulted in a £30 million adjustment to prior year balances. Due to the fact that the impact 
of the change is considered by the Group to be material, it has adjusted the results presented at 30 September 
2008 by means of a prior year adjustment.
The effect of the restatement of the 30 September 2008 financial statements is summarised below:

14. Earnings per Ordinary share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit of £6 million (2008 — restated# earnings of £183 
million) and on 497.8 million (2008 — 497.4 million) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares 
in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in 
treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based 
on earnings adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax, of £153 million (2008 — £195 million) and on 
497.8 million (2008 — 497.4 million) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during 
the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.

Allocation to disposals
In accordance with IAS 36, due to the increased level of disposals goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of, 
based on the relative value of the disposal to operations retained. Accordingly, goodwill of £8 million has been 
allocated to the 368 pubs disposed of during the year.
Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. For this purpose, the goodwill is 
allocated to the pub estate being a group of Cash Generating Units. This represents the lowest level within the 
Group that goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. The impairment test 
compares the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit with its carrying amount; the recoverable amount is 
determined from value-in-use calculations. 
Value-in-use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flow over a five year period. The cash flows have 
been risk adjusted to include the impact of the reduction in consumer spending as a result of the difficult economic 
conditions. The key assumptions in these estimates have been reviewed by the Board and are believed to be reasonable. 
Cash flows beyond five years are extrapolated using a 3% growth rate (2008 — 3%). The key driver to maintaining the 
growth rate is management’s focus on an ongoing commitment to improve the quality of the estate through churn and 
capital expenditure whilst remaining focused on meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand.

Notes to the Group Accounts

16. Goodwill (continued)
The discount rate is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC) which has been risk adjusted 
to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making this 
adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted by using an average of the highest four market 
risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at the year end date. The pre-tax risk adjusted 
discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2009 was 8% (2008 — 8%). 
As of 30 September 2009, the pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 10% before any impairment would 
be required. Management have considered the volatility within the current economic climate within the risk 
adjusted cash flow and a reduction of 3% in the growth rate of cash flows would result in no impairment. 
There is no impairment to goodwill in the period.

Revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
With the exception of properties identified for disposal the Group’s licensed land and buildings were revalued as at 
30 September 2009 by Humberts Leisure Limited and Christie & Co., independent Chartered Surveyors, and by the 
internal Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor. 
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards 
‘Red Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated 
by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or 
tenancies under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub 
quality and tenure. The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub 
sector.

18. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by 
Humberts Leisure Limited (2,062 pubs). The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by 
the Head of Estates. The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers. This 
review ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited (‘Unique’) has been valued by Christie 
& Co. (200 pubs). The methods of this valuation have been applied across the rest of the Unique estate on a pub 
by pub basis in line with the requirements of the securitisation. The results of both the Unique and Enterprise 
valuations are also compared, ensuring consistency. 
During the year Christie & Co. and Humberts Leisure Limited included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclosure in 
their valuation, which requires the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material 
effect on the valuation. Christie & Co. and Humberts Leisure Limited state they have used valuer judgement to 
interpret the most recent available evidence and current market sentiments to arrive at their valuation, however 
caution that in present economic circumstances the shelf life of any valuation report is reduced. 
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held 
at fair value less costs to sell. This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds (ERV) which are 
provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows:

million). Additions during the year include £2 million of property held under finance leases (2008 — £3 million).
At 30 September 2009, the Group had entered into contractual commitments to purchase £3 million (2008 — £8 
million) of property, plant and equipment.

20. Trade and other receivables (continued)
Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount 
of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to 
minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where 
appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt 
provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and 
is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral 
held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management 
considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2009 the value of collateral is £31 million 
(2008 — £31 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables. An analysis of the provision held 
against trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by 
licensees.

There are no indications as at 30 September 2009 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect 
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The 
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest 
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Group’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only 
invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

Non-current assets held for sale comprises both freehold and leasehold licensed and unlicensed properties that 
have been identified by the Group for disposal as part of the continued improvement in quality of its property

Fair values
The debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, independent valuers. Fair 
value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates. The finance lease payables are valued by calculating 
the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below:

Interest rate swaps 
On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an 
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates 
until September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised 
directly in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised in the Income 
Statement.
All of the Group’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds, 
securitised bonds and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s 
operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps. The purpose of such 
transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Group’s sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no 
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk
The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The 
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
n Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
n Regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
n Maintenance of undrawn bank facilities 
At 30 September 2009, the nominal value of the Company’s borrowings (excluding interest rate swaps and finance 
lease payables) comprised:

and interest payments, including interest rate swaps. In 2008 the total amount of debt payable shown above 
differed from the total book value of Group debt of £3,861 million as the book value of Group debt includes the fair 
value of interest rate swaps which is based on discounted cash flows. The contractual maturity of trade and other 
payables is within one year. 
An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set out in note 25.

Liquidity Facility is due for renewal on 30 September 2010.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows its debenture and bonds except for the A2N bonds at a fixed rate. Bank debt and the A2N bonds 
are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure 
to changes in interest rates. This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps 
acquired by Group companies. At 30 September 2009, the Group’s borrowings were 92% fixed (after including the 
impact of interest rate swaps) with an average interest rate of 6.5% for 10 years (2008 — 89% fixed at an average 
rate of 6.5% for 10 years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments 
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if interest 
rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Security
Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which comprise 
the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs Limited and its 
subsidiaries. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies. 
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds. The value 
of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2009 is — Property, Plant and Equipment 
£5,310 million (2008 — £5,832 million), operating lease premiums £15 million (2008 — £18 million) and pubs held 
for sale £43 million (2008 — £11 million).

24. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt
The Group’s capital structure is managed to support its objective of maximising long-term shareholder value through 
ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and acquisition 
opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key 
elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Group’s operational and strategic requirements. The overall 
financing strategy of the Group is presented to the Board annually as part of the budgeting exercise.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net debt 
is defined as the book value of the Group’s debt less cash (note 23). Equity is defined as total shareholders’ funds.

28. Pension
The Group makes defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans and these payments are 
charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of the Group 
reorganisation) established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999. The plan has defined contribution and 
defined benefit schemes. The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The most 
recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the plan was at 5 April 2008. This has been updated 
to 30 September 2009. The valuation was carried out by Mercer, independent professionally qualified actuaries, 
using the projected unit credit method.

28. Pension (continued)
The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are determined by reference to the relevant 
indices published by FTSE. 
The expected rates of return shown for 30 September 2009 are after a deduction for plan expenses of 0.75% p.a. 
(2008 — 0.75%)
The mortality tables used to value the plan’s liabilities are PMA92(YOB)mc less 1 year age rating for current 
pensioners and for future retirees. These tables give a life expectancy as set out above.
The history of the plan for the current and prior years is as follows:

Total contributions to the defined benefit scheme during the year to 30 September 2010 is expected to be £840,000 
and the deficit is expected to be eliminated in the next two years.
Since the acquisition of the defined benefit scheme on 31 March 2004, the total amount of actuarial gains and 
losses recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense is a loss of £1 million (2008 — £1 million).

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote at meetings.
At 30 September 2009, the Group owned 50 million (2008 — 50 million) of its own shares as treasury shares with a 
nominal value of £1 million (2008 — £1 million) and a market value of £62 million (2008 — £89 million). 
In addition, at 30 September 2009 the Group held 7,992,048 shares with a nominal value of £0.2 million and a 
market value of £10 million (2008 — 8,768,087 shares, nominal value £0.2 million, market value £16 million). 
These shares are held by the Employee Benefit Trust and Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Limited and are shares used 
to satisfy awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes (note 30). 
During the year the Group made on market purchases totalling nil (2008 — 5 million) of its own ordinary shares for 
an aggregate consideration of £nil (2008 — £29 million). Transaction costs were therefore £nil (2008 — £0.2 million).

30. Share-based payments
The Group operates share-based payment schemes for both directors and other employees. Details of the Short-
Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which form part of the remuneration of the 
executive directors are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 39. 
The Group also operates an Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS), a Savings Related Share Option Scheme (SAYE) 
and a Share Incentive Plan (SIP). 
A total expense of £nil (2008 — £2 million) has been incurred in the year in relation to share-based payments. This 
expense relates wholly to the equity-settled schemes described above.
Share Incentive Plan
The SIP is open to all employees. At times determined by the Company, employees may allocate the lower of 
£1,500 and 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary. The Board may also decide to award 
matching shares. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee. If shares are removed from trust within 
three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost. Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a 
period of five years. Matching shares were awarded in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme. 
Details of the number of matching shares held in trust during the year are as follows:
    2009 2008
Outstanding beginning of year    152,371 115,172
Granted    291,101 51,511
Vested    (69,359) (3,110)
Forfeited/expired    (5,700) (11,202)
Outstanding at end of year     368,413 152,371
Weighted average remaining contractual life   1.9 years 1.1 years
Employee Share Option Scheme 
The ESOS is open to all employees. Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the Board. The 
current intention of the Board is to issue options with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share at 
grant date. Options will normally vest after three years if an employee remains in service and if EPS or EBITDA 
growth targets are met. For options granted during the years ended 30 September 2006 and 2007 options will only 
vest in full if the average compound annual percentage growth in adjusted EPS between the grant date and the 
third anniversary of the grant date is 8.33%. For options granted during the year ended 30 September 2008 options 
will only vest if aggregate EDITDA for the three consecutive financial years commencing 1 October 2008 is more 
than £1.4 billion. Options may normally only be exercised during the period of seven years commencing on the 
third anniversary of the date of grant of the option. Options will usually be settled by issuing ordinary shares held
by the Employee Benefit Trust.

Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board. Participants contract 
to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five or seven years. At the end of the 
savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares at a price set before the savings began. The 
option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on the date that participants are invited to 
take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share if lower. Options will usually be settled using ordinary 
shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and will usually be exercisable for six months after the fifth or seventh 
anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

STIP and LTIP
Executive directors are eligible to participate in an STIP and LTIP plan. A summary of the rules of these schemes 
along with details of shares that have been granted and are outstanding in relation to individual directors is 
included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 39. 
Other members of the executive management team are also eligible to participate in an STIP scheme. Share 
awards vest based on achievement of personal objectives and/or Group EBITDA targets. Shares awarded vest

Directors pay £1 to exercise awards granted under the STIP and LTIP. This is a one-off charge. All of the shares 
outstanding at 30 September 2009 are not yet exercisable.
† The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed 
until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the 
year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2009. The number of shares granted 
in 2008 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2008. This number has also been changed 
to reflect the maximum number of shares granted in the year. Where the conditions are not met the shares are 
released in the forfeited/released line.
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was £0.85 (2008 — £5.30 restated 
for actual number of shares granted in 2008) and under the LTIP was £0.38 (2008 — £2.86).
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was 
£0.58 (2008 — £4.53).
Fair value of share schemes
The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using 
share option valuation models. The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the Black–Scholes model. The 
element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black–Scholes model. The 
element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.

Expected life of option (years)  2–4§ 2–4§ 3–5‡ 3–5‡
Expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of 
the option. The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria 
have therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP. These 
conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR 
element of the scheme. 
† The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed 
until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of STIP shares granted during the 
year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2009. The 2008 weighted averages 
have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2008.
§  Two STIP schemes are in place. One vests equally after two and three years and the other vests after four years. 
‡  The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after three, four and five years.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Enterprise Inns plc
We have audited the Group financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2009 
which comprise the Group Income Statement, Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, Group 
Balance Sheet, Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 34. The financial reporting framework that 
has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 
497 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 20, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
n give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 30 September 2009 and of its profit for the 
year then ended;
n have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
n have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies
The financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2009 were authorised for issue by 
the Board on 16 November 2009. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited Company incorporated and registered in 
England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements. Separate consolidated financial 
statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
 Prior year comparatives have been restated. Please see note 13 for further information.
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held 
at cost. The Company’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued 
each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry 
out such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve 
except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised 
as an expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the 
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in 
value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their 
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at 
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. 
Landlords’ fixtures and fittings are split into two categories, long life landlords’ fixtures and fittings and short life 
landlords’ fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of 
additions to long life landlords’ fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and short life landlords’ fixtures 
and fittings has been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis to write off the total cost 
less residual value over their useful economic life. 
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease 
term and their useful economic life of 50 years. 
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line 
basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net sales 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are 
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is 
less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value-
in-use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same 
asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Leases
Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of 
future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease 
payable. Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the Income 
Statement. 
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement 
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as 
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term. 
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of 
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified 
for disposal by the Company. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale 
should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease 
is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and 
operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised. 
Investments
Fixed asset investments are initally recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual 
impairment test.
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprises tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred 
on disposal.
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or 
less are classified as cash equivalents. 
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, debentures and secured bonds are measured at amortised cost. This 
method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of 
the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the 
instrument.
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified 
as derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and 
are subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is 
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted 
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship, it 
meets the Company’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective. 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   96 17092ENTERPRI.indd   96 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16     Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009   97

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies (continued)
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets 
the conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity. 
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge accounting 
is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for 
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the case of 
interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds 
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Called up Share Capital and 
the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium. 
Net debt
Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash. Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to 
banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred 
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between 
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. 
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of 
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to off set current tax assets and 
liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be 
settled net or simultaneously. 
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised 
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past 
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can 
be reliably estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of 
the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the 
obligation. 
Pension obligations
The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income 
Statement as incurred.

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2009
1. Accounting policies (continued)
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount 
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and 
the fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit 
credit method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected 
return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs. 
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until 
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of 
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of beverages 
are recognised when these goods are delivered to our licensees. Rents receivable are recognised on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the 
income relates. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 and applied its requirements to those awards granted 
after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005. 
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance 
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number 
of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period 
by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income 
Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation 
models. 
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
New standards and interpretations
During the year the Company has adopted the following new standards, interpretations and amendments:
n Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009
n IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009
n IFRIC 14 — The limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction — 
effective 1 October 2008
They have had no material impact on the results of the Company.
A number of new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after the 
date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected 
to have a material impact on the financial statements, although the amendment to IAS 1 may result in some 
changes to the presentation of the financial statements. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the 
Company will be required to implement the standard:

Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that 
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual 
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’). The valuation is based on market observations and 
estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after 
proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their market 
value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the pub estate 
is provided in note 4 of these accounts. 
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and 
these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed 
accounting policy for PPE. 
b) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are 
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The 
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract 
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation 
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
c) Taxation 
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot 
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not 
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a 
liability will arise. The Company reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting 
treatment.
d) Other
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension 
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a 
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

4. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
With the exception of properties identified for disposal, the Company’s licensed land and buildings were revalued 
as at 30 September 2009 by Humberts Leisure Limited, independent Chartered Surveyors, and by the internal Head 
of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor. 
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards ‘Red 
Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated by each 
property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases or tenancies 
under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location, pub quality and 
tenure. The valuations are made with consideration given to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in the Company have been valued by Humberts 
Leisure Limited (2,062 pubs). The balance of the estate held in the Company has been valued by the Head of 
Estates. The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers. This review 
ensured that the results are consistent.
During the year Humberts Leisure Limited, included a Red Book Guidance Note 5 disclousre in their valuation, 
which requires the valuer to draw attention to uncertainty in the market which may have a material effect on the 
valuation. Humberts Leisure Limited state they have used valuer judgement to interpret the most recent available 
evidence and current market sentiments to arrive at their valuation, however caution that in present economic 
circumstances the shelf life of any valuation report is reduced. 
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held 
at fair value less costs to sell. This value is based on the net estimated realisable disposal proceeds (ERV) which are 
provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows:

The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2009 was £116 million (2008 — £123 
million). Additions during the year include £1 million of property held under finance leases (2008 — £2 million).
At 30 September 2009, the Company had entered into contractual commitments to purchase £2 million (2008 — 
£7 million) of property, plant and equipment.

Non-current assets held for sale comprises both freehold and leasehold licensed and unlicensed properties that 
have been identified by the Company for disposal as part of the continued improvement in quality of its property 
portfolio. Non-current assets held for sale will usually be sold for alternative use. The sale of all assets within this 
category is expected to be completed within one year of the balance sheet date.
A balance of £2 million (2008 — £nil) in relation to these pubs is held within the revaluation reserve representing 
revaluation surpluses.

Fair values
Bank borrowings, the debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, 
independent valuers. Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates. The finance lease payables 
are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below:

Interest rate swaps 
On 29 September 2006 the Company designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an 
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until 
September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly 
in equity with changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge recognised in the Income Statement.
Both of the Company’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Company’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds 
and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s operations. The 
Company also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps. The purpose of such transactions 
is to manage the interest rate risk arising from the Company’s sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no 
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised as follows:
Liquidity risk
The Company has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The 
Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of 
overdrafts, bank loans and debentures.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
n Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
n Regular review of the Company’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
n Maintenance of bank facilities

9. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Company borrows its debenture and bonds at a fixed rate. Bank debt is borrowed at, and cash balances attract 
interest at, a floating rate. The Company’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This 
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest rate swaps acquired by Group companies. At 
30 September 2009, the Company’s borrowings were 91% fixed (after including the impact of interest rate swaps) 
with an average interest rate of 6.6% for eight years (2008 — 83% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for nine years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments 
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if interest 
rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company. The Company is exposed to a small 
amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Company’s objective 
is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where 
appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt 
provision which has been determined by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is 
based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in 
the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers 
that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2009 the value of collateral is £24 million (2008 — £25 
million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in ‘other payables’. An analysis of the provision held against 
trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade receivables which are primarily owed by licensees.

maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest 
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Company’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Company 
only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Security
Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which comprise 
the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs Limited and its 
subsidiaries. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such Group companies. 
The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and secured bonds. The value 
of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2009 is: Property, Plant and Equipment 
£2,885 million (2008 — £3,138 million), operating lease premiums £6 million (2008 — £7 million) and pubs held 
for sale £20 million (2008 — £3 million).
10. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt
The Company defines capital as total equity. The capital structure is managed to support the Company’s objective 
of maximising long-term shareholder value through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost-effective 
borrowing and flexibility to fund business and acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to 
optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Company is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all 
key elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Company’s operational and strategic requirements. The 
overall financing strategy of the Company is presented to the Board annually for approval.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net 
debt is defined as the book value of the Company’s debt less cash and cash equivalents (note 9). Equity is defined 
as total shareholders’ funds.

The deferred tax in the Company Balance Sheet relates to the following:

Share-based payments    (2) (1)
Other temporary differences    1 2
    293 356
# See below.
The Company has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and 
receivable within the Company. 
Prior year adjustment
 On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the 
revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over, into other assets. 
This deferred tax liability has moved each year due to indexation. During the year the method of calculating the 
deferred tax liability recognised in relation to the pub estate has been revised. This has resulted in a £12 million 
adjustment to prior year balances. 
Due to the fact that the impact of the change is considered to be material, it has adjusted the results presented at 
30 September 2008 by means of a prior year adjustment.
The effect of the restatement of the 30 September 2008 financial statements is summarised below:

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in 
Relation to the Company Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In 
preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
n make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
n state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
n prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditor’s Report to the 
Members of Enterprise Inns plc
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 
2009 which comprise the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Balance Sheet, the Cash Flow 
Statement and the related notes 1 to 21. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Sections 495, 496 and 
497 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 119, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient 
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
n give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2009;
n have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
n have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
n the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
n the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.

Notice of Annual General Meeting
Notes
1.  A member who is an individual is entitled to 
attend, speak and vote at the meeting or to 
appoint one or more other persons as his proxy 
to exercise all or any of his rights on his behalf. 
Further details of how to appoint a proxy, and 
the rights of proxies, are given in the paragraphs 
below. A member that is a company can appoint 
one or more corporate representatives (such as 
a director or employee of the company) whose 
attendance at the meeting is treated as if the 
company were attending in person, or it can 
appoint one or more persons as its proxy to 
exercise all or any of its rights on its behalf. In 
each case, a person attending the meeting will 
need to provide the Company or its Registrars, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, with 
evidence of their identity and, if applicable, 
their appointment as a proxy or corporate 
representative with authority to vote on behalf of 
a member. 
2.  A shareholder may appoint more than one 
proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting 
provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares 
held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be 
a shareholder of the Company. To appoint a 
proxy or proxies shareholders must complete: 
(a) a form of proxy, sign it and return it, together 
with the power of attorney or other authority 
(if any) under which it is signed, or a notarially 
certified copy of such authority, to the Company’s 
Registrars, Computershare Investor Services 
PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, 
BS99 6ZY; or (b) a CREST Proxy Instruction (as 
set out in paragraph 11 below); or (c) an online 
proxy appointment at www.eproxyappointment.
com (you will need to enter the Control Number, 
together with your unique PIN and Shareholder 
Reference Number printed on your personalised 
form of proxy), in each case so that it is received 
no later than 11.00 a.m. on 19 January 2010. To 
appoint more than one proxy, you will need to 
complete a separate proxy form in relation to each 
appointment. A personalised form of proxy for use 
in connection with the Annual General Meeting is 
enclosed with this document. If you do not have 
a personalised form of proxy and believe that you 
should, please contact the Company’s Registrars, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, on 0870 
889 4080 or at Computershare Investor Services 
PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, 
BS99 6ZY. 
3.  You will need to state clearly on each proxy 
form the number of shares in relation to which 
the proxy is appointed. A failure to specify the 
number of shares each proxy appointment relates 
to or specifying a number of shares in excess of 
those held by the member will result in the proxy 
appointment being invalid.
4.  The return of a completed proxy form, other such 
instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as 
described in paragraph 11 below) will not prevent 
a shareholder attending the Annual General 
Meeting and voting in person if he/she wishes 
to do so. 
5.  In the case of joint holders, where more than 
one of the joint holders purports to appoint a 
proxy, only the appointment submitted by the 
most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is 
determined by the order in which the names of 
the joint holders appear in the Company’s register 
of members in respect of the joint holding (the 
first-named being the most senior).
6.  Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is 
a person nominated under section 146 of the 
Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights 
(a ‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement 
between him/her and the shareholder by whom 
he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) 
as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a 
Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment 
right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, 
under any such agreement, have a right to give 
instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise 
of voting rights. 
7.  The statement of the rights of shareholders 
in relation to the appointment of proxies in 
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above does not apply to 
Nominated Persons. The rights described in these 
paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders 
of the Company.
8.  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives 
notice that only those shareholders included in 
the register of members of the Company at 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   126 17092ENTERPRI.indd   126 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16     Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009   127

Notice of Annual General Meeting
6.00 p.m. on 19 January 2010 or, if the meeting is 
adjourned, in the register of members at 6.00 p.m. 
on the day which is two days before the day of 
any adjourned meeting, will be entitled to attend 
and to vote at the Annual General Meeting in 
respect of the number of shares registered in their 
names at that time. Changes to entries on the 
share register after 6.00 p.m. on 19 January 2010, 
or, if the meeting is adjourned, in the register of 
members at 6.00 p.m. on the day which is two 
days before the day of any adjourned meeting, will 
be disregarded in determining the rights of any 
person to attend or vote at the Annual General 
Meeting.
9.  As at 9.00 a.m. on 3 December 2009, the 
Company’s issued share capital comprised 
555,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each. 
Each ordinary share carries the right to one 
vote at a general meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the 
Company as at 9.00 a.m. on 3 December 2009 is 
555,977,435.
10. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy 
or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service may do so for the Annual 
General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the 
meeting by using the procedures described in the 
CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/
CREST). CREST personal members or other CREST 
sponsored members, and those CREST members 
who have appointed a service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the 
appropriate action on their behalf.
11. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction 
made using the CREST service to be valid, the 
appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy 
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in 
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s 
specifications, and must contain the information 
required for such instruction, as described in 
the CREST Manual. The message, regardless 
of whether it constitutes the appointment of 
a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, 
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be 
received by the Company’s agent (ID 3RA50), by 
the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments 
set out in paragraph 2 above. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time 
(as determined by the timestamp applied to the 
message by the CREST Applications Host) from 
which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve 
the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change 
of instructions to proxies appointed through 
CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
12. CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should 
note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for 
any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation 
to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to 
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member, or sponsored member, or has appointed 
any voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that 
a message is transmitted by means of the CREST 
system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their 
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are 
referred, in particular, to those sections of the 
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of 
the CREST system and timings.
13. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 
members meeting the threshold requirements set 
out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement 
setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of 
the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s 
report and the conduct of the audit) that are to 
be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or 
(ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor 
of the Company ceasing to hold office since the 
previous meeting at which annual accounts and 
reports were laid in accordance with section 
437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company 
may not require the shareholders requesting any 
such website publication to pay its expenses 
in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is 
required to place a statement on a website 
under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, 
it must forward the statement to the Company’s 
auditor not later than the time when it makes 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   127 17092ENTERPRI.indd   127 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  128   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009

the statement available on the website. The 
business which may be dealt with at the Annual 
General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of 
the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
14. Any member attending the meeting has the right 
to ask questions. The Company must answer any 
such question relating to the business being dealt 
with at the meeting but no such answer need be 
given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with 
the preparation for the meeting or involve the 
disclosure of confidential information, (b) the 
answer has already been given on a website in 
the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the Company or the 
good order of the meeting that the question be 
answered.
15. If you have sold or otherwise transferred all your 
ordinary shares in the Company, please forward 
this document to the purchaser or transferee or 
to the stockbroker, bank or other person through 
whom the sale or transfer was effected for 
transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
16. The service agreements of the executive directors 
and copies of the letters of appointment of 
the non-executive directors are available for 
inspection during normal business hours on any 
weekday (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and public 
holidays) at the registered office of the Company 
and will be available for inspection for fifteen 
minutes prior to and during the Annual General 
Meeting.
17. You may not use any electronic address provided 
in this Notice, or any related documents including 
the proxy form to communicate with the Company 
for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Explanatory Notes to the Notice
of Annual General Meeting
The notice of the Annual General Meeting 
of the Company to be held on Thursday, 
21 January 2010 is set out on pages 124 to 129 
of the annual report and accounts. The following 
notes provide an explanation as to why the 
resolutions set out in the notice are to be put to 
shareholders.
Resolutions 1 to 7 are ordinary resolutions. These 
resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the 
votes cast for or against are in favour.
Resolution 1 — Laying of Accounts
The directors are required by the Companies Act 
2006 to present to the shareholders of the Company 
at a general meeting the reports of the directors and 
auditor, and the audited accounts of the Company, 
for the year ended 30 September 2009. The report 
of the directors and the audited accounts have been 
approved by the directors, and the report of the 
auditor has been approved by the auditors, and a 
copy of each of these documents may be found in the 
annual report and accounts, starting at page 9. 
Resolution 2 — Remuneration Report
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company 
to seek shareholder approval for the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report at the general meeting before 
which the Company’s annual accounts are laid. The 
Directors’ Remuneration Report is included in the 
annual report and accounts, starting at page 29. If 
shareholders vote against the report the directors will 
still be paid, but the Remuneration Committee will 
reconsider its policy. 
Resolutions 3 and 4 — Reappointment of Mr D A 
Harding and Mr W S Townsend
The Company’s articles of association require that 
any director who was not appointed or reappointed 
at either of the last two Annual General Meetings 
before this meeting must retire, although they may 
offer themselves for reappointment. Accordingly, Mr 
D A Harding and Mr W S Townsend are retiring and 
seeking reappointment. Biographical information 
for Mr D A Harding and Mr W S Townsend is shown 
on pages 7 and 8 of the annual report and accounts. 
Details of why the Board believes they should be 
reappointed are included in the directors’ report in the 
annual report and accounts, starting at page 9.
Resolution 5 — Auditor’s reappointment 
The Companies Act 2006 requires that auditors be 
appointed at each general meeting at which accounts 
are laid, to hold office until the next such meeting. 
The resolution seeks shareholder approval for the 
reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit 
Committee keeps under review the independence and 
objectivity of the external auditors, further information 
on which can be found in the annual report and 
accounts on page 25. After considering relevant 
information the Audit Committee recommended to 
the Board of directors that Ernst & Young LLP be 
reappointed.
Resolution 6 — Auditor’s remuneration
This resolution gives the directors the authority to 
determine the remuneration of the auditors for the 
audit work to be carried out by them in the next 
financial year. The amount of the remuneration paid to 
the auditor for the next financial year will be disclosed 
in the next audited accounts of the Company. 
Resolution 7 — Authority to the directors to allot 
shares
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the directors 
may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders 
to do so. Resolution 7 will, if passed, authorise the 
directors to allot the Company’s unissued shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £8,432,113.96, 
which represents an amount which is approximately 
equal to two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital 
of the Company as at 3 December 2009 (excluding 
treasury shares), the latest practicable date prior to 
the publication of the notice. 
17092ENTERPRI.indd   129 17092ENTERPRI.indd   129 03/12/2009   17:16 03/12/2009   17:16  130   Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2009
17092 03/12/2009 Proof 8
Explanatory Notes to the Notice
of Annual General Meeting
As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to 
half of this authority (equal to one-third of the issued 
ordinary share capital of the Company) will enable 
directors to allot and issue new shares in whatever 
manner (subject to pre-emption rights) they see fit. 
Paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the 
remainder of the authority (equal to a further one-third 
of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company) 
may only be used in connection with a rights issue 
in favour of ordinary shareholders. As paragraph (a) 
imposes no restrictions on the way the authority may 
be exercised, it could be used in conjunction with 
paragraph (b) so as to enable the whole two-thirds 
authority to be used in connection with a rights 
issue. Where usage of the authority exceeds the one-
third threshold in the circumstances set out in the 
guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers 
(the ‘ABI’) the directors will stand for re-election at 
the following AGM, to the extent required by the ABI.
The authority will expire at the earlier of the date 
that is fifteen months after the date of the passing of 
the resolution and the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting of the Company.
Passing resolution 7 will ensure that the directors 
continue to have the flexibility to act in the best 
interests of shareholders, when opportunities arise, by 
issuing new shares. There are no current plans to issue 
new shares except in connection with employee share 
schemes.
As at 3 December 2009, the latest practicable date 
prior to the publication of the notice, the Company 
had 555,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each 
in issue and held 50,000,000 treasury shares, which 
is equal to approximately 9.88% of the issued share 
capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as 
at that date.
Resolutions 8, 9, 10 and 11 are special 
resolutions. These resolutions will be passed 
if not less than 75% of the votes cast for and 
against are in favour.
Resolution 8 — Partial disapplication of statutory 
pre-emption rights
The Companies Act 2006 requires that, if the 
Company issues new shares for cash or sells any 
treasury shares, it must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. 
It is proposed that the directors be authorised to 
issue shares for cash and/or sell shares from treasury 
up to an aggregate nominal amount of £694,971.78 
(representing approximately 5% of the Company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 3 December 2009, 
the latest practicable date prior to the publication of 
the notice) without offering them to shareholders first, 
and to modify statutory pre-emption rights to deal 
with legal, regulatory or practical problems that may 
arise on a rights or other pre-emptive offer or issue. 
If resolution 8 is passed, this authority will expire at 
the same time as the authority to allot shares given 
pursuant to resolution 7. 
The directors consider this authority necessary 
in order to give them flexibility to deal with 
opportunities as they arise, subject to the restrictions 
contained in the resolution.

Resolution 9 — Purchase of own shares by the 
Company
If passed this resolution will grant the Company 
authority for a period of up to 15 months after the 
date of passing of the resolution to buy its own shares 
in the market. The resolution limits the number 
of shares that may be purchased to 14.99% of the 
Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 3 December 2009, the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of the notice. The price 
per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at 
a minimum amount (excluding expenses) of 2½ pence 
per ordinary share and a maximum amount (excluding 
expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over the average 
of the previous five days’ middle market prices; and 
(ii) the higher of the price of the last independent 
trade and the highest current independent bid on the 
trading venue where the purchase is carried out. This 
authority will only be exercised if market conditions 
make it advantageous to do so.
The directors’ present intention is that shares 
purchased pursuant to this authority will be cancelled 
immediately on purchase. Alternatively, the shares 
may be held in treasury, sold for cash or (provided 
Listing Rule requirements are met) transferred 
to an employee share scheme. The effect of any 
cancellation would be to reduce the number of shares 
in issue. For most purposes, while held in treasury, 
shares are treated as if they have been cancelled (for 
example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank 
for dividends). The directors will only make purchases 
under this authority if they believe that to do so would 
result in an increased earnings per share and would 
be in the interests of the shareholders generally.
As at 3 December 2009, the latest practicable 
date prior to the publication of the notice, options 
were outstanding over 16,590,519 ordinary shares 
of 2½ pence each in the Company, representing 
approximately 3.28% of the issued share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares) at that date. 
If the proposed market purchase authority were used 
in full, shares over which options were outstanding 
would, as at that date, represent approximately 3.86% 
of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding 
treasury shares).
Resolution 10 — Amending the Articles of 
Association
The Company is proposing to remove its objects clause 
together with all other provisions of its Memorandum 
of Association which, by virtue of the Companies Act 
2006, are treated as forming part of the Company’s 
Articles of Association as of 1 October 2009. Part 
(a) of resolution 10 effects the removal of these 
provisions. The Companies Act 2006 also abolishes 
the requirement for a company to have an authorised 
share capital. One consequence of part (a) of resolution 
10 is that the statement of the Company’s authorised 
share capital imported from the Memorandum is 
prevented from continuing to form part of the Articles 
of Association and operating as a limit on future issues 
of shares. Part (b) of resolution 10 deletes provisions 
from the Company’s Articles of Association that refer 
to authorised share capital. The directors will still be 
limited as to the number of shares they can at any time 
allot because an allotment authority continues to be 
required under the Companies Act 2006; an allotment 
authority is proposed in resolution 7.

Resolution 11 — Approving the notice period for 
General Meetings
Following the introduction of new rules on 3 August 
2009 to implement the Shareholder Rights Directive, 
in order to maintain its ability to call general 
meetings (other than an Annual General Meeting) 
on 14 clear days’ notice, the Company must offer 
all shareholders the opportunity to appoint a proxy 
electronically (via the website of the Company or 
its Registrars) and must obtain the approval of its 
shareholders by means of a special resolution passed 
each year. Resolution 11 seeks such approval. It is 
intended that a similar resolution will be proposed at 
future Annual General Meetings.

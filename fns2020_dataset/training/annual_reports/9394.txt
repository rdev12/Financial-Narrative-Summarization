02 5220 LiDCO’s strategy is to apply a multi-disciplinary
combination of physiological expertise, materials
technology, computing technology and software 
to monitor and display the relationship between
linked physiological variables.
The LiDCOplus monitor displays a range 
of real-time continuous hemodynamic
parameters, including cardiac output,
oxygen delivery and fluid volume status.
What is driving market growth:
• Increasing numbers of elderly people living longer
• Demand for less invasive products offering better care
• Patient knowledge due to the internet and media
The Group has developed a minimally
invasive product, disposables and
monitoring equipment which improve
the standard of care, reduce the
incidence of adverse events and 
reduce costs.
Our market
today...
Our products offer:
• Real-time, beat-to-beat cardiac
monitoring
• Minimally invasive technology,
reducing the risk to the patient
• Easy-to-use technology to assist
clinical staff
Group at a Glance
page 2 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
The LiDCOplus monitor
The LiDCOplus combines the measurement and monitoring
features of LiDCO (lithium dilution cardiac output measurement)
and PulseCO (real-time cardiovascular monitoring), significantly
enhancing ease of use and saving space around the patient. Our customers are hospitals for critical care 
and cardiovascular patients who require real-time,
minimally invasive cardiac monitoring.
The chart screen on the LiDCOplus monitor
shows the relationship between pressure, flow
and resistance in an integral bar chart display.
Complex data can be easily interpreted and
the necessary patient-corrective actions 
taken quickly.
The LiDCOplus monitor provides a variety 
of different modes of displaying data.
The monitor shows all information clearly, to
provide easy-to-read feedback to clinical staff.
...and the future
Lithium chloride solution
The LiDCO sensor is activated by a small dose of lithium chloride,
injected via a central venous catheter.The resulting arterial lithium
concentration-time curve is recorded by withdrawing blood past
the lithium sensor.
page 3 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
The LiDCO sensor
LiDCO has developed a proprietary lithium sensor using lithium
indicator dilution to calculate cardiac output.This is used to
calibrate the LiDCOplus monitor. Safe and extremely accurate,
this method is simple to perform, taking less than five minutes 
for the entire procedure. This is my first Statement since being appointed Non-Executive
Chairman in December of 2002. In fact, it is only the Company’s
second set of annual results since its admission to the London
Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) in 
July 2001.
LiDCO raised funds from the public market in order to commence
the commercialisation of its minimally invasive sensor and PC 
based monitoring technology. I was therefore excited to join the
Company at the end of its first full year of sales activity in both the
USA and the UK. In reviewing its 2002 performance I am aware
that this was a challenging period for the Company.
The challenge was to establish a new technology in a market
sector that requires change but where standards are necessarily 
of the highest order.This meant that in parallel to the sales effort
the Company had to transition its operations successfully to a
fully commercial basis with the capacity to become the supplier
of choice for the minimally invasive monitoring of risk surgery
and intensive care patients. Specific achievements to this end
included clinically validating the technology, increasing revenues
while maintaining pricing and gross margins, establishing and
assessing the marketing strategy for the USA and the UK,
automating and significantly increasing sensor manufacturing
capacity and positioning the Company to expand sales in 
2003 through registration of the Company’s in vivo diagnostic
(lithium chloride) in additional major European markets.
Towards the end of the year, the Board decided that the best 
way of maximising access to the US, our largest market, would 
be through a distribution agreement with a partner and that
given the progress made by the Company during 2002, this 
could be achieved on commercially attractive terms.To this 
end the Company has begun early discussions with potential 
US distribution partners.We remain confident of 
our prospects in 2003.

Chairman’s Review
page 4 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 I am pleased to report that during 2002 the foundations for the
commercial phase of the business were clearly established.As we
enter our second full year of sales we are confident that we have
both the product and the organisational infrastructure to access the
substantial market opportunity outlined in our flotation prospectus.
The challenges for 2003 are to roll out sales in Europe and grow
and accelerate closures of our sales pipeline in the USA.
Financial review 
Turnover increased to £2,042,000.Whilst this was lower than
original market expectations, it was 81% above the previous year
(2001 – £1,130,000), generating a gross profit of £1,263,000
(2001 – £832,000) and representing a gross margin of 62% 
(2001 – 74%), in line with the Company’s expectations.
As 2002 was the first full year of sales, administration expenses rose
to reflect higher sales and marketing costs.Administration expenses
were in line with expectations at £7,038,000 (2001 – £3,999,000).
The pre and post tax loss was £5,496,000 (2001 – £2,803,000) 
and the basic loss per share is calculated at 7.72p (2001 – 5.70p).
At the year end, net assets amounted to £8.4m, including net
current assets of £6.9m.The year end net cash balance was
£4.0m (2001 – £11.4m).The Group’s programme of investment
in working capital and production facilities is now complete,
so that the cash burn in 2003 is expected to fall significantly.
Trading review
Unit sales of monitors doubled whilst those of single use sensors
trebled. 74% of turnover related to monitors and 19% to sensors,
with 7% relating to licence fee income. 83% of the monitors 
(2001 – 98%) were sold on a capital sale basis.The average monthly
usage rate of sensors per monitor was six, which is very encouraging.
Monitor sales consisted of 211 PulseCO units and 89 LiDCO
units. In 2003, all sales are expected to be of the improved
LiDCOplus unit, which combines the software of the two
previous monitors into a single, easy-to-use unit based on 
the PulseCO monitor.
USA
During 2002 sales to US customers were made through our
direct sales force of 12 people.Turnover increased to £1,009,000
(2001 – £632,000), with 92% of monitors sold on a capital basis.
By the end of 2002, 40 hospitals had purchased the technology.
Included in these customers are a number of influential regional
referral centers including: MD Anderson (Houston), Beaumont
(Detroit), Crawford Long (Atlanta), University of Chicago and
Northwestern Memorial (Chicago). In order to expand their use 
of our minimally invasive monitoring six US customers have
already reordered monitors during 2002. Of particular note is
Sarasota Hospital (Tampa, Florida) which has fully equipped its
cardiovascular theatres and intensive care department through 
the purchase of 19 monitors.
Overall clinical acceptance of the technology has been excellent 
as evidenced by the high percentage of requests for sales proposals
resulting from hospitals’ clinical evaluation of the products.While
progress to the clinical sign off stage has been rapid, closure of sales
has proved to be significantly slower than expected, due mainly 
to cost containment by the hospital administration and consequent
lengthening of the capital cycle, an industry-wide phenomenon.
It is, however, encouraging that follow-on purchases of monitors
have experienced a shorter capital cycle time at seven months.
Despite this tough commercial environment, prices for both the
monitor and sensor products have been very robust and according
to the Company’s expectations.
Chief Executive’s Review
page 5 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
Investment in facilities During 2002 LiDCO invested £0.8m in new
production facilities at its factory in London, including construction
of a second clean room and additional automation equipment,
to satisfy expected demand. The US is the most important market and represents approximately
60% of our potential worldwide sales. Experience of our first full
year of direct sales in this market shows that the desire to change 
to our minimally invasive monitoring technology is substantially as
expected. However, the most challenging aspects regarding access to
this market are the hospital capital cycle and the physical size of the
opportunity, with around 14,000 potential customers within 3,500
hospitals. In the last quarter of 2002, following a review of US sales
strategy, the Company decided that the high level of interest in the
product and the margins being achieved in early sales meant that
seeking a major US corporate sales partner had now become 
a commercially attractive route to accessing the market and
announced its intention to start seeking a suitable partner.
UK
As with the USA we have just concluded our first full year of direct
sales co-ordinated from our Granta Park (Cambridge) office. Given
the severe shortage of funds available for capital expenditure in 
the UK NHS the sales strategy was to mostly provide monitors 
without charge and sell the sensors and associated disposables
mainly by means of a compensatory up charge.Turnover increased
to £300,000 (2001 – £113,000) – with 35% of monitors placed 
on a capital basis. Use of disposables has been very encouraging 
at 11 per monitor. By the end of 2002, 25 hospitals had adopted
our technology. Our sales force numbering six people is considered 
by the Company to be appropriate to penetrate this market fully.
Continental Europe
In anticipation of final approvals of lithium chloride, distributors
were appointed in Holland, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Czech
Republic. Sales therefore predominantly reflected stocking orders
and subsequent clinical trials in major reference centers.Turnover
increased to £441,000 (2001 – £114,000). Discussions are currently
underway to establish a distributor for Germany and Austria.
During 2002 the European sales pipeline grew significantly with
224 product demonstrations made, all of which resulted in a
request for a field trial. 184 field trials were initiated and 143
were completed. Of the 176 sales proposals made 54 resulted 
in sales closures in the year, 114 sales proposals are still in process
with eight sales proposals not proceeding due to lack of hospital
budget funding.
Far East and Japan
Sales in the Far East and Japan totalled £292,000 (2001 – £271,000).
Approval of the PulseCO system for sale in Japan is expected towards
the end of 2003. Sales throughout the Far East and Japan are made
through distributors appointed by the Company.
Clinical validation
The Company continues to support an active program of clinical
validation of the accuracy of its products in cardiac/major surgery,
intensive care, trauma and heart failure markets (see the Company
website: www.lidco.com for full publication details.) 2002 was
another successful year with studies concluding positively at: Duke
University (N. Carolina) – intensive care, University of Chicago
(Illinois) – surgical study, Hammamatsu University (Japan) – efficacy
in pathological lung oedema, Southampton University Hospital –
heart failure and ‘off-pump’ cardiac surgery.
Product applications
The Company actively assists customers to conduct trials of novel
applications of its technology .Applications currently undergoing 
trials or further development include peri-operative optimisation,
congestive heart failure and paediatrics, all large or expanding markets.
Regulatory affairs 
In 2003, regulatory approval for the LiDCO System lithium
chloride in vivo diagnostic has been received in principle in 
the following EU territories:Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy,
LiDCO has made significant progress 
towards each of the benchmarks set 
out in the flotation prospectus.
Chief Executive’s Review continued
page 6 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
Case Study// Sarasota Hospital / Florida has equipped each of 
its intensive care beds with a PulseCO monitor. “The PulseCO has
proven very beneficial to our patient care.The PulseCO’s immediate,
real-time display of hemodynamic status during difficult periods 
of patient management and while directing therapies, is a great
improvement in monitoring technology.The PulseCO also allows 
us to better manage additional patients who don’t have central 
lines in place.The PulseCO actually reduces our direct costs, a real
rarity for new technologies.”
Head of Cardiac Anesthesia, Sarasota Hospital the Netherlands and Spain.This brings the number of territories
in which the Company has approval to sell its products to 12.
In addition, approval applications are in progress for: Iran, Korea
and Taiwan and further applications will be made during 2003.
New products
On 9 January 2003, approval was received from the FDA (Food 
and Drug Administration of the USA) for the sale of the LiDCOplus
Hemodynamic Monitor in the USA.The LiDCOplus Monitor
combines the measurement and monitoring features of the
Company’s existing products: the LiDCO (lithium dilution cardiac
output measurement) and PulseCO Systems (real-time cardiovascular
monitor), thus saving premium space around the patient’s bed 
and significantly enhancing ease of use.
Research and development
The Company is actively developing additional features and
applications for its products.There are currently two principal
areas of development:
Monitoring of Patient Fluid Status 
This is one of the key unfulfilled measurements required in
critical care patients.The commercial implication of improving
the performance of the LiDCOplus in this arena is that we 
could greatly increase the numbers of patients for whom the
technology is suitable.The Company’s ambition is to have a
LiDCOplus at the bedside for all acute care patients with arterial
monitoring who require fluid management.The customer
requires a more visual way of detecting occult low blood volume
status and the amount of fluid required to restore the patient.
We are currently recording ‘fluid loading’ episodes in patients
undergoing optimisation for high risk surgery.This data will be
used to model the user interface and assess clinician and nursing
response to the novel interfaces.
Capillary Venous Pressure Measurement
This is a software algorithm which uses the arterial pressure
waveform to indicate the average pressure at the venous end 
of the tissue capillary.This would have potential application 
in fluid volume management (see above).The patent for this
measurement has been filed and is progressing to the worldwide
PCT application stage.The accuracy to which the measurement
can be made and the utility of the measurement is under
investigation.
Prospects 
The foundations to support continued growth were put in place
during 2002. 2003 will see an increasing focus by the Company
on sales in its expanded group of territories. Sales in the US are
expected to continue to be subject to a slow capital cycle. In
order to access the full market potential of the product in the 
US and accelerate the closure of pipeline accounts the Company
is in early discussions with potential US distribution partners.
Given the progress made during 2002 and the fact that the
Company has succeeded in establishing a high level of interest 
in a high margin product that is supported by a low cost
manufacturing base we believe that it is in a strong position 
to attract a suitable distribution partner.We hope to be able 
to announce on these matters further during the year.
Investment will continue in the core technology to develop
further enhancements to our sensor technology, physiological
waveform monitoring software and user interfaces.

Case Study// St. George’s Hospital / London “We bought this new
technology, LiDCO, which allows us to monitor cardiac output from
which we can calculate oxygen delivery. We can get this answer
very quickly, within about 15 minutes, and this may be very
important in determining the outcome of the patient. More than
that, it can be set up by the nurses independently of the doctor 
and also allows us to continuously monitor these variables of
cardiac output delivery. We believe it has considerable potential 
in allowing us to monitor these patients for as long as we require.”

page 10 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002 Accountability and audit
Going concern
On the basis of current financial projections, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the forseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts.
Internal control
The key procedures designed to provide an effective system of internal control are described below:
• Control environment
The Company’s control environment is the responsibility of the Directors and individual managers at all levels.The Board has
implemented an organizational structure with clearly-defined responsibilities and lines of accountability.
• Information systems and controls
Detailed budgets and forecasts are prepared annually and progress against expectations is reviewed monthly by the Board.
Underpinning these budgets is a system of internal financial control, based on authorization procedures and tiers of authority.
As a medical device company, LiDCO also has a system of regulatory controls, to ensure compliance with all requirements of 
the Medicines Control Agency, the US Food & Drug Agency and other regulatory bodies.
• Monitoring of effectiveness
The composition of the Board and the senior management team provides a suitable range of knowledge and experience to enable
adequate risk monitoring.The Company’s information systems provide detailed, regular variance reports which are reviewed and
acted upon by the Board.The external auditors report separately to the Board on the Company’s accounting and internal controls
as part of their normal audit work.
Statement of compliance
During the course of 2002 there were two areas of non-compliance with the Code, both of which were addressed before the year end:
• A 3.1: For most of 2002, the Board consisted of five Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors.This position was
remedied on 20 December 2002 with the appointment of Ms Wallis as Non-Executive Chairman, following which the Board
consists of four Executive and two Non-Executive Directors.
• B 2.2: Mr Alexander originally chaired the Remuneration and Audit Committees of the Board. Following Mr Alexander’s
resignation from these committees on 20 September 2002, the committees consisted solely of Non-Executive Directors and were
chaired by Mr Wiegman.
page 11 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
Corporate Governance Report continued Year ended 31 December 2002 Policy on remuneration
The Remuneration Committee recommends Directors’ remuneration and remuneration policies for all staff. Remuneration levels 
are set in order to attract high calibre recruits and to retain and motivate those Directors and employees once they have joined the
Company.This is achieved by a combination of base salary, bonuses and share options, which are offered both to Executive Directors
and to employees at all levels.
The fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
Remuneration committee
The members of the committee are Ms Wallis and Mr Wiegman.The committee is assisted by the Company Secretary. Mr Alexander
and Mr Levensohn both served on the committee during 2002.
Service contracts
All four of the Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company dated 29 June 2001.The contracts are not set for a
specific term, but include a rolling 12-month notice period. In addition, all Directors retire by rotation at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting and, where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment dated 20 December 2002 in the case of Ms Wallis and 2 July 2001 in the case 
of Mr Wiegman.These letters are issued in place of service contracts. In keeping with best practice, these appointments are terminable
without notice by either party.
Remuneration package
All four Executive Directors receive a base salary and allowance in lieu of benefits, as shown in the table below as Salaries and fees.
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are also shown below.
The four Executive Directors are members of the Company’s Senior Management Bonus Scheme. Under the terms of the scheme, the
Remuneration Committee assesses the Directors’ individual performances at the end of the financial year, judged against pre-determined
benchmarks. In 2002 the criteria for awarding bonuses were based on sales performance, profit before tax and the Company’s share
price, with a portion being awarded at the committee’s discretion. In 2003 the criteria are related to sales performance and the
Company’s cash position. Bonuses are capped at 100% of base salary. Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses.
No pension contributions were payable by the Group (2001 – £nil).

Activities
The principal activity of the Group was the development, manufacture and sale of cardiac monitoring equipment. Sales of the LiDCO
and PulseCO Systems commenced in the USA in July 2001 and in the UK in September 2001. Sales in the USA are handled via
LiDCO’s US branch.
Results and future prospects
The Group’s turnover for the year was £2,042,000 (2001 – £1,130,000), following the successful launch of the LiDCO and PulseCO
systems in the US in July 2001 and in the UK in September 2001.The Group made a consolidated loss after taxation during 2002 
of £5,496,000 (2001 – £2,803,000).The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend (2001 – £nil).
At 31 December 2002 the Group held £4.0m of cash (2001 – £11.4m), which provides the Group with adequate funding for its
business plan.The Board remains confident of achieving its commercial goals in 2003.
The Company’s share price at 31 December 2002 was 14p. During the year the share price ranged between 5p and 118p.
Research and development
The Group continued to develop the PulseCO system during the year, as set out in the Chief Executive’s Review. Expenditure 
on research and development amounted to £89,000 in the year (2001 – £161,000) in addition to product development costs of
£208,000 (2001 – £393,000) which are capitalised on the balance sheet and amortized.
Euro
The implications of European Monetary Union (EMU) for the firm have been considered.The necessary changes have been made to
our systems and procedures to accommodate the new currency.The cost of these changes is not significant.

Directors’ Report Year ended 31 December 2002 Supplier payment policy
The Companies Act 1985, as amended, requires the Group to make a statement of its policy and practice on the payment of creditors.
It is and will continue to be the policy of the Group to negotiate with suppliers so as to obtain the best available terms taking account
of quality, delivery, price and period of settlement and, having agreed those terms, to abide by them.
The total amount of the Group’s trade creditors falling due within the period ended 31 December 2002 represents 90 days’ worth
(2001 – 119 days’ worth) as a proportion of the total amount invoiced by suppliers during the year.
Donations
The Group made charitable contributions during the year of £nil (2001 – £1,000). No political donations were made during the year
(2001 – £nil).
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for
that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.They are
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
Going Concern
After making enquiries and performing analysis, the Directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements,
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
On the basis of the anticipated levels of sales, costs and cash flow, the Directors have satisfied themselves that the current level of cash 
in the business is sufficient for the period until the Company's operations become cash generative.
For these reasons, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
Deloitte & Touche has expressed their willingness to continue in office as auditors and a resolution to reappoint them will be
proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Deloitte & Touche has informed the Directors that it is intending to transfer its business to a limited liability partnership incorporated
under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000, to be known as Deloitte & Touche LLP . It is the current intention of the Directors
to use the Company's statutory power to give consent to the appointment of Deloitte & Touche being treated as extending to 
Deloitte & Touche LLP at the appropriate time.

Directors’ Report continued Year ended 31 December 2002 We have audited the financial statements of LiDCO Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2002 which comprise the consolidated
profit and loss account, the balance sheets, consolidated cash flow statement, reconciliation of movement in consolidated shareholders’
funds and related notes 1 to 23.These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an
auditors’ report and for no other purpose.T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As described in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the Company’s Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. Our responsibility is to audit the financial
statements in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.We also report if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Company is not disclosed.
We read the Directors’ Report for the above year and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and 
of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 
31 December 2002 and of the loss of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 1985.

Reconciliation of Movement in Consolidated Shareholders’ Funds Year ended 31 December 2002 1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.The particular accounting
policies adopted are described below.
Advantage has been taken of the exemption under s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to disclose the profit and loss account of the
Company.The loss of the Company for the year is shown in note 21.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated accounts incorporate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries.
Merger accounting
Admission to the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”) occurred on 5 July 2001.The restructuring 
of the Group agreed by the shareholders in February 2001, under which the minority holdings in LiDCO Limited would be bought 
out in exchange for shares in LiDCO Group, was conditional upon admission and is therefore deemed to have occurred on 5 July 2001.
The Directors consider that the relative rights of the shareholders have in substance remained unchanged during the re-organization.
Merger accounting has therefore been adopted as the accounting treatment for the re-organization. Under this method, results are
reported as if the acquiring companies have been combined since incorporation. No purchased goodwill is created in the transaction 
and the assets and liabilities of LiDCO Limited are not adjusted to reflect their market value.The comparative figures have been restated.
Turnover
Turnover represents amounts receivable from product sales and income from licence agreements granted. Dependent upon the terms
of each licence agreement, income from licence agreements is recognized on a straight line basis, commencing from the date of receipt
of cash over the period of the licence, subject to a maximum of ten years.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing at 
that date.These translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences arising from the different treatment of items for accounting and taxation
purposes, which are expected to reverse in the future without replacement, calculated at the rates at which it is expected that tax will arise.
Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets represent software development costs and clinical trials on the LiDCO and PulseCO systems.These have been
capitalized and are amortized in equal annual amounts over three years.
page 21 LiDCO Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2002
Notes to the Accounts Year ended 31 December 2002 1. Accounting Policies (continued)

are as follows:
Leasehold improvements Over the length of the lease
Plant and machinery 20% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20% per annum
Computer equipment 33% per annum
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
Capital instruments
Capital instruments are accounted for and classified as equity or non-equity share capital, equity or non-equity minority interests and
debt according to their form.There is no premium payable on redemption of non-equity minority interests.

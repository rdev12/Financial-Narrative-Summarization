1. Market leader
Our market-leading businesses will enable 
us to benefit from the expected growth 
in demand in the UK and our regional 
markets within the US.
 • 40 % of UK market share based 
on volume of bricks sold in 2014 
(excluding imports).
2. Scale
We have 28 clay and 15 concrete plants 
throughout the UK and US manufacturing 
over 500 varieties of bricks coupled 
with ownership of valuable long-term 
clay reserves.
 • 43 m anufacturing sites; 33 UK sites and 
10 US sites.
 • Over 150 million tonnes of clay reserves.
 • Realisable production capacity of 
1.2 billion bricks per annum.
3. Long-standing customer 
relationships
Many of our long-standing customer 
relationships have lasted over 40 years.  
Our customer focus is based on quality, 
service and consistency and our service-
led ethos is one of the key drivers in the 
growth in our market share in bricks over 
the past 10 years.
4. Growing capacity
In the UK, demand for building products is 
anticipated to increase due to Government 
support for new house-building, increasing 
household formations and population 
growth. We are investing in the latest 
technology to increase capacity and to 
meet the growing market demands.
 • Ib stock Brick’s Chesterton plant was 
built in 2013 to consolidate production 
from two previous sites and increased 
site capacity by approximately 67% 
per annum.
 • Th e new Leicester plant, due to be 
commissioned in the second half of 
2017, is expected to add capacity of 
100 million bricks per annum.

experience in the building products 
market and our CEO and CFO have 
combined experience of nearly 50 years 
at Ibstock.

IBSTOCK_02_Contents_and_Overview_DRF2.indd   9 12/04/2016   13:15 This is our first Annual Report as a public 
company and I am delighted to welcome 
you as a shareholder.
2015 was an eventful year for the Group. 
In February, Ibstock Group businesses 
comprising Forticrete, Supreme, Ibstock 
Brick and Glen-Gery were acquired by 
Bain Capital and left the CRH plc group. 
Then, in October 2015, the Group 
completed a successful listing on the 
London Stock Exchange, marking its 
return to the public markets. I joined the 
Ibstock Board in September 2015 at 
what was, and continues to be, an 
exciting time for the Ibstock Group. 
The Group is a family of brands of building 
products with a diversified range of clay 
and concrete products. We are a leading 
manufacturer of clay bricks and concrete 
products with operations in both the UK 
and the US.
The market and our strategy
The macroeconomic environment, 
and specifically demand for new homes, 
has a significant influence on the Group’s 
performance. Housing market fundamentals 
in both of our key geographies today are 
positive, and I believe the Group is well 
positioned to benefit from the continuing 
demand for new housing.
The Group’s strategy of growth through 
investment and product innovation, 
together with expansion of its existing 
product portfolios, has been at the heart of 
its success over many years. This approach 
continues today with a significant new brick 
plant under construction in Leicestershire 
and a new roof tile manufacturing plant 
being built at Leighton Buzzard. 
Our strategy is discussed in more detail 
on pages 22 and 23.
The Ibstock plc 
Group is a family 
of building 
products brands, 
and a leading 
manufacturer of a 
diversified range of 
clay and concrete 
products.

Chairman’s 
Statement
IBSTOCK_03_Chairmans_Statement_DRF2.indd   10 12/04/2016   13:12 Our results
The Group’s results for the period were in 
line with expectations set at the time of the 
IPO in October 2015. As discussed in more 
detail in the CFO’s report, the statutory 
results for the Group cover the period from 
November 2014 to the end of 2015 and 
include only 10 months’ trading results from 
the operating businesses. Consequently, 
to give shareholders a more representative 
understanding of the Group’s underlying 
performance we are also presenting our 
adjusted results for the 2015 and 2014 
calendar years, so that a clearer picture 
of our business can be seen on a full 
12-month basis with comparatives.
Reported statutory revenue was 
£358,331,000 and the statutory profit after 
taxation for the period was £101,574,000, 
with EPS of 35.2p. Our adjusted results 
for the 12-month period saw revenue of 
£413,828,000 and adjusted EBITDA of 
£107,014,000.
We have proposed a final dividend of 4.4p 
per share, which is in line with our dividend 
policy of distributing 40 to 50% of our 
adjusted profit after tax over a business cycle.
Board and corporate governance
Our business is run by an extremely 
experienced management team – Wayne 
Sheppard, Chief Executive Officer and 
Kevin Sims, Chief Financial Officer, have a 
combined experience of nearly 50 years 
with the Group and more within the 
Building Products market. Becoming a 
listed business has necessitated some 
changes in the way we work, the formation 
of the plc Board with strong independent 
Directors being central to these changes. 
As Chairman, one of my prime 
responsibilities is setting and maintaining 
the appropriate Corporate Governance 
framework and ensuring the business puts 
a qualified group of Non-Executive Directors 
together to support this. I am delighted to 
have had three such Directors bring their 
experience to the Board to date.
Jonathan Nicholls, our Senior Independent 
Director, brings over 17 years of experience 
at senior management or director level of 
businesses, including those in brick 
manufacturing, roofing and construction, 
and property development. He is a 
chartered accountant and now serves as 
our Audit Committee Chairman. Jonathan’s 
experience within the sector and financial 
background will be of great value to us. 
Michel Plantevin and Matthias Boyer 
Chammard both joined the Group in 
February 2015 after Bain Capital acquired 
the Ibstock group of businesses. Michel 
serves as managing director of Bain Capital 
Europe LLC, a role he has held for over 
12 years, and Matthias currently serves as a 
Principal of Bain Capital Europe LLC, a role 
he has held for over four years. Both bring 
great experience as Non-Executive Directors 
to a range of companies, which will continue 
to bring insight and support to the Group as 
we grow as a public company. 
I am grateful to Jonathan, Michel and 
Matthias for their invaluable help and 
support in the process that led to our listing 
in October 2015. We are now tackling the 
governance requirements of moving from 
private equity ownership to being a Group 
within the public environment. This is 
discussed in more detail in our Corporate 
Governance Statement on pages 44 to 50.
In February this year, we appointed 
Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella to the 
Board. Both have joined the Board’s 
Remuneration Committee, Audit 
Committee and Nomination Committee, 
and Lynn has become Chair of the 
Remuneration Committee. I am delighted 
to welcome Tracey and Lynn to the Board. 
Together they bring a wealth of experience 
that will be of great benefit to Ibstock as 
we continue to develop our business.
The performance of the business, and 
our success, is down to the hard work 
of all of our employees across the Group. 
I wish to thank all of our colleagues for 
their excellent work over this period. 
Outlook
As is usual at this early point in the new 
financial year, we have limited forward 
visibility ahead of the important Spring 
trading period but at this point, our full 
year expectations are unchanged.
In the UK, brick sales into the UK new 
build residential market, and most all 
other sectors including non-residential 
and infrastructure, are growing to 
expectation. Sales via distributors’ yards, 
which mainly flow into the RMI market, 
are being impacted by some destocking. 
However, we anticipate that this situation 
will improve as we progress into the 
Spring. The overall effect is that the UK 
clay business has made a slower start 
to the year than expected. Both our UK 
concrete and US brick businesses 
have made a good start to 2016. 
Market fundamentals remain positive in 
both the UK and US, with demand for 
new housing remaining robust. In the UK, 
the Construction Products Association 
is forecasting further growth in both the 
residential and RMI markets in 2016 
and we are planning for another year 
of progress.

Non-Executive Chairman

Our history
Ibstock plc is headquartered in the village 
of Ibstock in the East Midlands of England, 
where its predecessor entity, Ibstock 
Collieries Ltd, was founded nearly 200 
years ago. Each of the Group’s companies 
are long-established businesses; in 
addition to Ibstock Brick, Glen-Gery has 
been operating since 1890, Forticrete since 
the late 1920s and Supreme since 1979.
Ibstock was first listed on the London 
Stock Exchange in 1963. It acquired 
Glen-Gery in the US in 1979 and the 
UK brick operations were expanded by 
acquiring Tarmac Bricks in 1995, Redland 
Bricks in 1996 and Hepworth Brick in 
1999. Ibstock also acquired certain 
concrete operations in the 1990s.
In 1999, CRH plc acquired Ibstock. Under 
CRH’s ownership, the management of 
Ibstock diversified the clay operations of 
CRH in Great Britain with the acquisition of 
Kevington Building Products Ltd in 2001 and 
Manchester Brick in 2005. The management 
of Ibstock also expanded CRH’s concrete 
products operations in Great Britain with the 
acquisition of Supreme Concrete Ltd and 
Anderton Concrete Products Ltd in 2006 
and 2007 , respectively.
In February 2015, Bain Capital acquired 
Ibstock and its subsidiaries from CRH.
Ibstock re-joined the public markets when 
it listed on the London Stock Exchange in 
October 2015.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
IBSTOCK_03_Chairmans_Statement_DRF2.indd   11 12/04/2016   13:12 Q. What are Ibstock’s key strengths?
A.  One of Ibstock’s most important strengths 
is its people. We have committed and loyal 
teams in all of our businesses who tend to 
develop long term careers with us. Our 
strong market leading positions and focus 
on quality and customer service are 
fundamental to the success of the 
business. We have well invested factories 
and depots strategically located to serve 
their respective markets and our clay 
businesses have access to long term clay 
reserves. We work hard to innovate both in 
products and customer service and we 
employ the latest technology in our 
production and sales operations. These 
strengths support the growing market 
share we have in all our key markets.
Q.  What is your value proposition 
and can you describe your 
typical customer?
A.  Potential customers should choose 
Ibstock Group companies because 
our current customers tell us, through 
our extensive independent surveys and 
also face to face, that they choose us 
because we have the best product range 
and we are the easiest supplier (in our 
scope of supply) to do business with.
  I can’t really describe a typical customer 
because it depends on whom you 
consider to be the customer. We see the 
initial specifier as a customer as well as 
each element of the construction process 
covering perhaps: main contractor, 
sub-contractor, builders’ merchant, 
client and so on. So our customer could 
be a self-builder wanting assistance with 
brick matching via his chosen merchant 
or architect, through to major listed 
house builders, builders’ merchants or 
organisations such as Network Rail.
I am excited by 
the increased 
opportunity we now 
have to develop 
Ibstock, working 
with the incredibly 
committed teams 
that we have in 
the businesses.

Q&A with 
Wayne Sheppard, 
CEO
IBSTOCK_04_QandA_with_CEO_DRF2.indd   12 12/04/2016   13:12 Q.  How have the competitive 
environment and your market 
share evolved?
A.  Our markets have always been highly 
competitive and will continue to be so. 
New customer and technical or 
regulatory challenges impacting the 
competitive environment are always 
present which we take in our stride – 
BIM (Building Information Modelling) 
capability would be an example. All our 
businesses maintain strong and growing 
market share positions. This is driven by 
offering the best value proposition, that 
is, cost with due consideration for the 
value of the service, product support 
and consistency provided throughout 
the specification to the project 
completion process.
Q.  What pleased you most about this 
year’s (2015) results?
A.  I was pleased that we achieved strong 
sales growth in both the UK and US and 
that all businesses performed to plan. 
The pricing strength in Glen-Gery was 
particularly pleasing as was the above 
target cash performance and thus lower 
year end debt position for the Group. 
Q.  What could you have done better?
A.  Considering all the work necessary to 
manage a successful IPO process I am 
particularly pleased that we did not lose 
our focus on delivering strong 2015 results. 
Clearly one can always do better but 
there is nothing in the 2015 performance 
that did not meet our expectations. 
Q.  What difference has the IPO made 
to your business?
A.  The IPO has been very motivating for 
the management teams and all of our 
employees. This is largely because after 
a considerable period of uncertainty over 
the potential disposal of the Group under 
its previous public company ownership, 
we are now able to invest for growth. With 
supportive market fundamentals in all our 
geographies and development projects 
underway in both clay and concrete there 
is a feeling of excitement in the business. 
Our enthusiasm is shared by the investors 
we meet and it is always a pleasure to 
talk to people interested in our business, 
we are very proud of it!
Q.  How will you integrate the UK and 
US businesses?
A.  Glen-Gery was part of the original 
Ibstock plc before separation under 
CRH ownership. In view of this shared 
history, cultures are similar and a strong 
architectural bias is evident in both 
businesses. The Glen-Gery team are 
delighted to be back with Ibstock since 
the start of 2015 following separation 
in 1999. We are already sharing best 
practice in Marketing, Technical, 
Procurement and Engineering. We wish 
to ensure that our people see that 
careers can once again develop across 
the UK and US as they did in the past. 
I think it is important to mention that we 
believe in maintaining the strong brands 
within the Group and Glen-Gery with 
its 125-year history will always trade as 
Glen-Gery under Ibstock plc ownership.
Q.  How does the strategy influence 
day to day management and 
priorities of the different operating 
companies within Ibstock?
A.  Our focus on customer service influences 
the way we manage the business. For 
example, the production planning team in 
the UK brick company report to the Sales 
Director. Our desire to service the customer 
impacts all aspects of the business 
including innovation and obviously our 
investment in information technology, 
a good example of this being our sales 
teams managing much of their customer 
exchange live with smart technology.
Q.  What are your plans for 
acquisitions?
A.  We continue to look for enhancing 
acquisitions that will add to the UK 
product portfolio and strengthen our 
footprint in the US. We have worked 
hard to deliver current levels of 
performance so our performance 
hurdles are set high. We are thus 
looking for quality businesses with 
good growth prospects or businesses 
offering significant synergies and ideally 
both. We will be taking a disciplined 
approach, testing returns available 
from acquisitions against enhanced 
cash returns for shareholders. 
Q.  How does sustainability fit into 
your strategy?
A.  Sustainability is very important 
to Ibstock. We have employed a 
sustainability manager since 1995 
and issued annual sustainability 
reports since 1999; the first in our 
industry to do so. Our UK businesses 
are accredited to ISO 14001, the 
Environmental Management standard, 
with the exception of our specials 
business which will be accredited 
by the end of the year. Ibstock and 
Forticrete have also achieved ISO 6001 
Responsible Sourcing compliance. 
All our UK businesses are compliant 
with the Energy Management Standard 
ISO 50001 or the Energy Savings 
Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”). In 
addition to this we continue to invest in 
energy efficiency, CO
2 reduction, we 
generate electricity from landfill gas and 
recycle raw materials such as process 
water to minimise waste and cost.
Q.  What should we expect from 
Ibstock in the next 12 months?
A.  We will be focusing strongly on our 
markets and customer service as 
usual. We will be managing the major 
investment projects we have underway 
in UK concrete and clay; our main 
office site at Ibstock is now a major 
construction site! We anticipate another 
year of progress in all our businesses.
Q.  What excites you most about the 
business as you move forward?
A.  I am excited by the increased opportunity 
we now have to develop Ibstock, working 
with the incredibly committed teams that 
we have in the businesses. Ibstock is 
a legacy business with a near 200-year 
history and it is a privilege to steward 
it for a period before passing on the 
Company in an improved position to the 
next generation. This is why succession 
planning is such an important area to me.
Q.  What will Ibstock look like in 
five years’ time?
A.  Ibstock will continue to be regarded as 
a highly customer driven business but 
with an improved asset base in the UK 
following the investments being made in 
both clay and concrete and potentially 
with a broader product portfolio through 
acquisition. In the US, I have a similar view.
Q.  What do you see as the key benefits 
of the significant capital investment 
that has been made?
A.  Ibstock’s investment at Leicester 
provides 100 million bricks per year of 
additional capacity into a market with 
strong growth fundamentals. It will be 
the newest and most efficient factory 
in Europe. The factory has been 
designed to be the most cost efficient 
and flexible stock brick facility in the 
Ibstock portfolio. Along with previous 
investments this project ensures that 
Ibstock continues to maintain an 
industry-leading factory portfolio. Our 
investment in Forticrete is particularly 
exciting as it will add yet another 
innovative product to the roof tile 
range. Forticrete has a strong history 
of innovation and this new product 
will continue that tradition. 
Q.  What are the key risks to your 
growth plans?
A.  The strength of underlying demand 
in the UK and US new home markets 
is key. With supportive demand 
fundamentals in all our businesses 
and, in particular, strong Government 
support for new build housing in the UK, 
the outlook looks encouraging. Clearly 
anything impacting on homebuyer and, 
for RMI markets, home owner sentiment 
would be a concern.

IBSTOCK_05_Strategy_Divider_DRF2.indd   15 12/04/2016   13:11 Demand for clay and concrete products 
is directly affected by developments in the 
construction markets in which we operate, 
as well as the general level of construction 
activity. Several macroeconomic factors 
influence the levels and growth of 
construction activity, including demographic 
trends, the state of the housing market, 
mortgage availability, mortgage interest 
rates, and changes in household income, 
inflation and Government policy.
United Kingdom
Total Great Britain construction output 
is estimated at £132 billion in 2015 
(a 3.9% increase compared to 2014). 
The Construction Products Association 
forecasts Great Britain construction 
output growth of 3.6% in 2016 as activity 
is expected to rise across the key 
construction sectors of private housing, 
infrastructure and commercial.

United Kingdom housing construction, 
recent trends and developments
The UK housing market has been structurally 
undersupplied for a number of years, with 
housing starts below household formations. 
The UK Government commissioned the 
Barker Review in 2003 which suggested 
the shortage of housing in the UK at that 
time was approximately 450,000 houses.
The financial crisis of 2007/2008 had a 
direct impact on housing starts due to the 
significant decline in construction activity. 
During the period from 2008 to 2014, 
Department for Communities and Local 
Government (“DCLG”) information regarding 
household formations compared to DCLG 
information on housing starts indicated that 
there were approximately 550,000 more 
household formations during that time as 
opposed to housing starts, suggesting that 
the housing shortage had increased by that 
amount by 2014 and implying a total housing 
shortage at the end of 2014 of approximately 
1,000,000 houses.
Our markets
Clay and concrete 
building products are 
integral components 
to construction activity, 
particularly housing 
construction. 
IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 16
IBSTOCK_06_Our_Markets_DRF2.indd   16 12/04/2016   13:09 Annual housing starts are forecast to 
increase by c10% to 177,659 by 2018. 
Over the same period, the UK Government 
estimates of household formations in Great 
Britain are on average 254,000 new houses 
per annum, continuing the structural trend 
of a shortage of housing.
UK Repairs, Maintenance and 
Improvement (“RMI”) market, 
trends and developments
Total private residential RMI output in 
Great Britain in 2015 was approximately 
£17.0 billion and is forecast to increase to 
£18.6 billion by 2018 (Source: Construction 
Products Association). Historically, the RMI 
market has been more stable than housing 
starts. RMI remains primarily driven by 
gross domestic product, employment, 
consumer confidence and the level of 
housing transactions (with individuals 
renovating homes prior to a sale, or 
modifying them after purchase). Current 
underbuilding supports the RMI market. 
United States
The Company’s primary markets in the 
US are the North East and Mid West.
 
Housing starts in Glen-Gery’s primary 
markets fell sharply (approximately 68%) 
from a peak in 2005 through to 2009. 
Residential starts then increased from 
approximately 99,000 and 94,000 in the 
North East and Mid West, respectively, 
in 2009, to approximately 178,000 and 
158,000 in the North East and Mid West, 
respectively, in 2014, with support from 
improvements in the economy and growth 
in employment. Between 2015 and 2017 
both the North East region and the 
Mid West region are forecast to show 
recovering housing volumes with growth 
in Glen-Gery’s primary markets broadly 
comparable to national US housing starts.

IBSTOCK_06_Our_Markets_DRF2.indd   17 12/04/2016   13:09 Explanation of business model
The Group is a leading manufacturer 
of building products with a diversified 
range of clay and concrete products, 
and operations in the UK and the US. 
Its principal products are clay bricks, 
brick components, concrete roof tiles, 
concrete stone masonry substitutes, 
concrete fencing, pre-stressed concrete 
products and concrete products for the 
rail industry.
The Group trades through operating 
companies that have leading positions in 
their product segments and have specific 
manufacturing process skills and technical 
and commercial know-how in those product 
areas. The operating companies are strong 
brand names in their respective areas of 
operation and their commercial structures 
and policies reflect the requirements of 
their individual customer bases.
The operating companies are underpinned 
by a Group structure that sets common 
values and compliance standards and 
provides financial and strategic support. 
The Group’s management team has 
extensive experience in the building 
products market. The Group’s CEO 
Wayne Sheppard and CFO Kevin Sims 
have a combined experience of nearly 
50 years at Ibstock and are supported 
by a committed and highly experienced 
senior management team. The current 
management team has been instrumental 
in significantly expanding the Group’s 
market leadership positions over the 
last decade. 
Brief description of the inputs
Manufacturing facilities
The Group has a strategic operational 
footprint across its UK and US markets. 
Its main manufacturing locations consist of 
33 manufacturing plants and six speciality 
brick assembly sites in the UK and 10 
manufacturing plants and 10 resale 
centres in the US. The Group’s clay brick 
manufacturing plants are located near 
strategic raw material reserves. 
The Group’s concrete manufacturing 
plants providing fencing, structural 
elements, rail products and building 
products under the Supreme brand are 
geographically distributed around the 
UK creating a national plant network with 
scalable production capacity. The Group’s 
concrete masonry products, alternative 
cladding products to natural stone 
marketed under the Forticrete brand, 
are manufactured across the UK at 
plants located near areas where stone 
has historically been used for building. 
Similarly, the Group selected a plant 
in Leighton Buzzard, a location in the 
South East of England which is well 
located to serve the active South East 
building market in the UK, to produce its 
concrete roof tiles. Within the UK and the 
US, plants are also strategically located 
close to main transportation links to 
facilitate distribution.

IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 18
IBSTOCK_07_Our_Business_Model_DRF2.indd   18 12/04/2016   13:08 Raw materials and inputs
The raw materials required to produce the 
Group’s clay and concrete products are 
specific to each product and segment. The 
primary material used by the Group in the 
production of its products is clay. This clay 
and shale is sourced from clay quarries that 
the Group operates on land that it owns or 
leases under long-term agreements in the 
vicinity of its brick manufacturing plants in 
the UK and US. The Group’s clay products 
utilise fuel and power as a key part of their 
manufacturing processes to dry and fire 
the brick clays.
For the Group’s concrete products, the main 
raw materials consist of cement, sand and 
aggregates. Due to the bulky nature of these 
materials and the corresponding high 
transportation costs involved, the Group 
tends to source materials from suppliers local 
to each manufacturing facility but cement is 
interchangeable between suppliers in most 
circumstances, if necessary. Most of these 
raw materials (as well as water, which is 
another key input for the manufacturing 
of both clay and concrete products) are 
widely available commodities. 
Clay reserves and resources
In the UK, the operation of quarries 
requires planning permission. Permission 
is granted in respect of a specific quarry 
design, providing an allowable volume of 
material which may be extracted over a 
set period of time. Therefore, once the 
authorised amount of material has been 
extracted or the period of the permission 
has expired, it is necessary to apply for 
a renewal or extension of the planning 
permission. The Group holds planning 
permissions over portions of its clay 
deposits and categorises its clay 
deposits substantially on the basis 
of whether or not it holds planning 
permission for extraction of the clay.
Within the US, all quarry locations that 
Glen-Gery leases or owns are zoned 
for mineral extraction/mining. As such, 
Glen-Gery has the legal right to extract 
clay and shale with no time limit for a 
quarry it owns and for the length of 
the lease for leased quarry. 
Technical support
The Group offers technical support to its 
customers to assist in the use of its products 
in design and application. Support is 
provided by in-house technical design teams 
utilising Computer-Aided Design (“CAD”) 
where appropriate and by technical sales 
teams, including in-house designers. 
Distribution and logistics
The Group’s products are manufactured 
and distributed through a network of 43 
main manufacturing locations in the UK and 
the US. Due to the strategic locations of the 
Group’s manufacturing plants, the Group’s 
brick products in the UK travel an average 
of approximately 65 miles from the 
manufacturing plant to the customer.
In addition, in the US, the Group operates 
a network of 10 resale centres across its 
primary markets. These resale centres 
enhance access to customers in 
markets with poor distributor coverage 
and significantly increases the distribution 
capabilities of the Group’s operations in 
the US through these inclusive one stop 
shop solutions for masonry products.

IBSTOCK_07_Our_Business_Model_DRF2.indd   19 12/04/2016   13:08 Intellectual property
As at 31 December 2015, the Group 
owned over 100 trademarks worldwide. 
These trademarks primarily relate to the 
Group’s seven main brand names and 
logos as well as certain other trademarks. 
The Group’s most important trademarks 
are Ibstock Building Products, Ibstock, 
Glen-Gery, Supreme, Forticrete, Kevington 
and Anderton. In the UK, the Group’s 
concrete products are sold under trade 
names other than Ibstock, such as 
Supreme and Anderton for the Group’s 
concrete fencing, building and structural 
elements and rail products, and Forticrete 
for the Group’s concrete roof tiles, 
architectural masonry products and 
walling and cast stone. In the US, the 
Group’s brick products are sold under 
the trade name Glen-Gery.
Information technology
Within the UK, the Group uses a suite 
of applications to manage reporting 
requirements, client relationships and 
sales analytics and reporting. In the US, 
Glen-Gery has recently transitioned to 
a Group ERP platform.
The Group also utilises information 
technology systems in its manufacturing 
plants. While the technology used by the 
Group varies at different plants depending 
on their age or time when last refurbished, 
the Group believes that an appropriate 
information technology infrastructure within 
its manufacturing plants is important to 
support its growth. 
Employees
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had 
over 2,600 full time equivalent employees.
In the UK, although the Group has no formal 
collective bargaining agreements with any 
union, there are legacy voluntary procedural 
agreements in place with trade unions at 
most of the Group’s manufacturing sites and 
approximately 50% of the workforce in the 
UK is covered by these agreements. 
In the US, approximately 61% of 
Group’s workforce is covered by collective 
bargaining agreements. The Group has not 
had any union-organised work stoppages 
in the UK or US over the past ten years. 
The Group believes that it has good 
relationships with its employees and with 
the unions representing its employees. 
Brands and products
The Group’s four primary businesses are:
Ibstock Brick
The leading manufacturer by volume of 
clay bricks sold (excluding imports) in the 
UK. With 19 manufacturing plants and a 
total realisable production capacity of 
c780 million bricks per annum, Ibstock Brick 
has the largest brick production capacity 
based in the UK. Its network of 23 active 
quarries are generally located close to its 
manufacturing plants, which limits the 
transportation costs of raw materials from 
the quarries to the manufacturing plants. 
Glen-Gery
A leading manufacturer, by despatches, 
of brick in the North East and Mid West 
regions of the US. Glen-Gery has a network 
of 10 manufacturing plants, 10 resale centres 
and 29 active quarries covered by 20 active 
quarry permits in the US. Brick capacity is 
c460 million bricks per annum.
Supreme
A leading UK manufacturer of concrete 
fencing products and concrete lintels, 
with seven manufacturing plants in the 
UK. Supreme also manufactures general 
precast products for the house building 
and rail sectors.
Forticrete
A leading UK manufacturer of concrete 
substitutes for natural stone walling and 
dressings and niche concrete roof tiles, 
with seven manufacturing plants in the UK. 
Forticrete also manufactures concrete 
architectural masonry walling blocks.
Process description at high level
Clay
The Group manufactures and sells a range 
of clay products. While it has an extensive 
range of clay products, the vast majority of 
the Group’s clay revenue comes from the 
sale of its wire cut and stock bricks which 
are manufactured in two distinct production 
processes. To make a wire cut brick 
(also called an extruded brick), clay is 
continuously extruded to a required size 
and shape. The clay column is then cut by 
wire into individual bricks and is dried or 
loaded directly onto a kiln car and then 
dried. The dried bricks are fired in a kiln. 
The wire cut brick manufacturing process 
is highly automated. Stock bricks are 
manufactured by placing a mix of clay and 
water into individual moulds to create the 
brick shape, ejected from the mould and 
then dried and fired in a kiln. Although 
manufactured by modern machinery in 
an automated process, stock bricks 
retain the look of hand-moulded bricks.
These core products are complemented 
by a number of innovative and specialised 
products and components.

IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 20
IBSTOCK_07_Our_Business_Model_DRF2.indd   20 12/04/2016   13:08 Concrete
Supreme and Forticrete are the 
Group’s principal concrete 
manufacturing businesses. 
Supreme offers a variety of precast 
concrete fencing products which include 
slotted posts, morticed and recessed 
concrete posts, concrete posts for 
chainlink or welded mesh and concrete 
gravel boards or panels.
Fencing Products are “grey” concrete 
products manufactured using a semi 
dry or a wet cast manufacturing process. 
Semi dry products are manufactured 
with concrete discharged from a machine 
hopper into a mould containing steel 
reinforcement bars with high frequency 
vibration used to compact the mixture and 
then manually finished off to the required 
quality standard. The products are 
de-moulded using an instant de-mould 
system by turning the moulds over and 
allowing them to move free from the mould. 
Due to the compaction of the material 
through vibration, the products are free 
standing. Freshly cast products are 
transferred onto a curing rack where 
they undertake a curing process. Cured 
products are lifted from the curing pallets 
using an automatic stacking system. In a 
wet cast process, steel reinforcement bars 
are placed into each mould and concrete 
is discharged from the machine hopper 
into the mould.
Forticrete manufactures concrete substitutes 
for natural stone walling and dressings, 
niche concrete roof tiles and concrete 
architectural masonry walling blocks.
Concrete roof tiles are made from cement, 
sand, admixtures, water and pigments. 
These materials, with the exception of the 
pigments, are deposited in a pan mixer 
and blended. The mixture is conveyed to 
a mechanical mixer for further blending, 
adding the pigments and additional water. 
From the mechanical mixer, the concrete 
mix is extruded onto moving pallets and 
then cut to form individual roof tiles. A 
pre-cure coating is then added and the tiles 
are placed in curing chambers. Post-curing, 
the tiles are finished, coated and dried.
Value flowing to stakeholders
Customers
The Group sells its clay and concrete 
products to a diverse group of customers 
in the construction industry in the UK and 
US. Builders’ merchants, housebuilders, 
specialist brick distributors, and contractors 
and installers are the four main customer 
groups for the Group’s clay products in 
the UK. In the US, clay products sold to 
distributors constituted the majority of sales 
for the year, with the remainder sold to 
house builders, contractors and developers. 
These customers are not always the same 
as the individuals and organisations that are 
making the buying decisions for the Group’s 
products. In many cases, the preference 
of the end customers dictates the choice 
of product rather than the intermediary 
that actually purchases the product from 
the Group.
In the decision-making process for the 
choice of clay and concrete products, the 
Directors believe that the Group benefits 
from the broad recognition of its brands, 
its reputation for quality, aesthetics and 
its focus on customer service.
Dividend policy
The Directors intend to adopt a dividend 
policy based on a payout ratio of 40 to 50% 
of adjusted profit after tax over a business 
cycle. This dividend policy will reflect the 
underlying earnings and growth of the 
business and the cash conversion of the 
Group. Assuming that there are sufficient 
distributable reserves available at the time, 
the Directors intend that the Company will 
pay an interim dividend and a final dividend 
in respect of each financial year in the 
approximate proportions of one-third 
and two-thirds, respectively, of the total 
annual dividend.

STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE
IBSTOCK_09_KPIs_DRF2.indd   25 12/04/2016   13:07 Key resources 
and relationships
Delivering continuous 
improvement is the 
core of our operations, 
constantly looking for 
more efficient ways 
of doing things and 
embracing technology 
wherever possible.
Safe working environment
The Group employs over 2,600 people 
across the UK and US and it is the 
Group’s objective to provide a safe working 
environment for all our employees and the 
contractors at Ibstock sites. It is a strategic 
priority to focus on safety in the workplace, 
and Health and Safety is at the core of 
our operations. 
As a large employer in both the EU and 
the US, the Group must comply with the 
European Framework Directive on Safety 
and Health at Work and Occupational 
Safety and Health Act, respectively. 
These guarantee minimum safety and 
health requirements, and under such 
laws and regulations, employers typically 
must establish the conditions and the 
management of work in a manner that 
effectively prevents dangers to employees.
Interpretation of the legislative requirements 
is further supported in the UK by Approved 
Codes of Practice. These documents are 
used to help define Group policies and 
procedures for all employees. The Group 
has training programmes in place to ensure 
all employees are competent to carry out 
their duties and an auditing protocol is in 
place to ensure policies and procedures 
are effective and adhered to. A dedicated 
team of health and safety professionals 
support the operational employees in all 
aspects of Health and Safety management 
and leadership.
The Board carefully monitors the Group’s 
performance against our Lost Time 
Accidents KPI, which has reduced this 
measure over recent years.

Recognition and development
Our people lie at the heart of the Group’s 
operations and as such we are committed 
to developing an environment where 
every employee can thrive and give 
their very best each and every day. 
Our continual investment in their training 
and development contributes to a highly 
engaged workforce with the skills and 
experience necessary to deliver the 
Group’s business objectives both now 
and into the future. Delivering continuous 
improvement is the core of our operations, 
constantly looking for more efficient ways 
of doing things and embracing technology

Women in leadership
Karen Cuncliffe
Factory Manager, Chesterton UK
Equality and diversity
I have worked for Ibstock for 37 years, 
starting my career in 1977 as a Laboratory 
Assistant and then Lab Manager at the 
Ravenhead factory near Skelmersdale. 
I then had the opportunity to become a 
Regional Technical Manager, covering a 
number of factories before switching over 
to the production side of the business. 
I became Production Manager back at the 
Ravenhead factory before moving over to 
the nearby Roughdales factory as Factory 
Manager in 2005.
The opportunity arose to become the 
Factory Manager at Chesterton and to 
oversee its redevelopment as one of 
the world’s most efficient brickworks 
and, at the time, Ibstock’s single biggest 
investment in new plant for a decade.
Ibstock has provided both a challenging 
and supportive environment to work and 
develop in. There is a very supportive 
culture driven from the top down and as 
a manager it is very rewarding to see my 
people have and take opportunities to 
develop and thrive.
Running a factory, especially one as 
high-profile as Chesterton brings new 
and varied challenges every day, not 
least hosting some of the visitors to the 
site such as Boris Johnson and Amber 
Rudd! However, the whole team is 
focused on moving the factory forward, 
achieving new records for both quality 
and output but most importantly 
providing a safe working environment. 
I am especially proud of our safety record 
which currently stands at 1,465 days 
without a lost time accident.

Equality and diversity
We are committed to promoting equal 
opportunities in employment. All job 
applicants, employees and other workers 
(such as agency staff and consultants) 
will be treated with dignity and respect 
regardless of their age, disability, gender 
reassignment, marital or civil partner 
status, race, colour, nationality, ethnic 
or national origin, religion or belief, sex 
or sexual orientation. We believe that 
by providing a harmonious working 
environment all employees should be 
able to maximise their potential and 
contribute to our success.
Where an employee becomes disabled, 
subsequent to joining the Group, all efforts 
are made to enable that employee to 
continue in their current job. However if, 
due to the specific circumstances, it is 
not possible for an employee to 
continue in their current job, they will 
be given suitable training for alternative 
employment within the Group or 
elsewhere.
We are committed to identifying and 
eliminating discriminatory practices, 
procedures and attitudes and we expect 
all employees, officers, consultants, 
contractors, casual workers and agency 
workers to support our commitment 
and assist in all possible ways to 
prevent discrimination.
Subsequent to the period end date, 
Lynn Minella and Tracey Graham were 
appointed as Non-Executive Directors 
of Ibstock plc, bringing our ratio of 
female Directors to 25% as at the 
date of this report.

IBSTOCK_10_Resources_and_Relationships_DRF2.indd   27 12/04/2016   13:06 Apprenticeships
I joined the Ibstock apprentice scheme 
in 2014. I had taken a degree in Sports 
Science and was unsure about my 
future career path and after a number 
of jobs I decided to take some time out 
to travel. On my return, I realised that 
I would like to be involved in a 
manufacturing business and was 
excited to be accepted onto the 
Ibstock apprenticeship programme 
as a technical apprentice. Every day 
has been different! Although only in 
my second year I have already seen 
many different aspects of the business 
including helping to run the Quality 
Assurance system at the Nostell 
factory and now I am working as 
part of the team on the new factory 
at Ibstock.
The apprenticeship programme 
is tailored to suit the needs of the 
individual and I am currently studying 
for a foundation degree course in clay 
technology at Derby University as 
well as working towards my Ibstock 
Technical Workplace NVQ.

competing businesses. We believe that these 
sound, ethical principles will help us to act at 
all times with honesty and integrity, constantly 
striving to operate in the best interests of our 
business. This will help ensure that Ibstock 
plc continues to maintain and enhance its 
excellent reputation as a Group that everyone 
can trust and wants to do business with.
The Group is aware of its obligations under 
the Human Rights Act and seeks to act 
accordingly in all aspects of its operations.
Engagement with our local 
communities
The Group is proud of its long history of being 
part of the local communities in which it 
operates. Each of the companies within the 
Ibstock family provides financial support, and 
is actively engaged in, these communities. 
This involvement ranges from financial 
support for community projects to stakeholder 
engagement relating to quarry extensions. 
As part of the recent proposal to extend 
the Group’s clay quarry at Dorket Head, 
a number of public information days at the 
local Community Centre were held and 
also a number of information leaflets were 
produced providing information regarding 
the proposals. Nearly 90% of employees of 
the Dorket Head factory live within ten miles 
of the site and it is estimated that more than 
£3.5 million per annum is spent in the local 
community by the factory. Our other sites 
have a similarly high level of employees 
who live in the vicinity of their place of work. 
Recently schoolchildren from three schools 
in Ibstock helped plant 900 trees in the 
grounds of the Leicester site as part of the 
Group’s programme to build the new Ibstock 
state-of-the-art brick factory. In January 
2016, more than 280 pupils took part in the 
tree planting exercise over a two-day period. 
Activities such as this are one example of 
the way in which the Group aims to engage 
the local communities around its sites.
Environment
The Group recognises its responsibilities as 
a manufacturer to reduce the environmental 
impact of its activities. The Group is 
committed to introducing environmental 
management systems and each of our UK 
businesses and is currently accredited, or 
working towards accreditation with, ISO 
14001 – the International Environmental 
Management standard. In addition to this, 
we continue to invest in energy efficiency, 
Apprenticeships
At some point in time all employees will retire 
and over the last 20 years the Group has run 
a highly successful apprentice programme. 
Since 2012 we have enhanced this 
programme through central co-ordination 
and standardisation of the programme to 
ensure all apprentices are trained to a 
consistent standard, including specific sign 
off within the organisation in addition to that 
of the training provider. This focus ensures 
that we mitigate the risk of an ageing 
workforce and harness the skills and 
experience of these people so that when 
they retire their replacement is fully trained 
and competent to take over their role.
Employee engagement 
Customer satisfaction begins and ends 
with the relationship they have with our 
employees and delighting our customers 
can only be delivered through highly 
competent, engaged and diligent people. 
Ibstock Brick, the largest operating 
company within the Group has run 
employee opinion surveys for the last 
18 years. Consistently our response rates 
have been in excess of 80% and allow us 
to identify specific improvement areas 
and formulate action plans to consistently 
improve employee engagement. Following 
our successful listing, the survey will be 
comprehensively revised to ensure that we 
fully capture the true drivers of employee 
engagement and ensure that we continue 
to deliver for our customers. The revised 
survey will also be implemented across all 
of the Group companies to ensure we are 
measuring engagement consistently across 
the Group and also facilitate comparison 
across the entities within the Ibstock family. 
A variety of methods are used to engage 
with employees, including factory and 
departmental briefings, and in-house 
publications. The Group will use one or 
more of these channels to brief employees 
on the Group’s performance and the 
financial and economic factors affecting 
the Group’s performance. In particular, 
the Group operates a Save As You Earn 
(“SAYE”) share scheme, which is open to 
eligible employees, where employees are 
encouraged to save a fixed monthly sum 
for a period of three years.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption policies
As the laws governing business dealings 
become ever more complex we need to 
ensure the judgements and decisions we 
make are taken with both the knowledge 
and application of the highest ethical 
principles. In October 2015, we updated 
and re-issued our Code of Business 
Conduct and Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
policies to continue to ensure that we 
operate in an open, fair and honest manner 
in all of our business dealings. We have 
also implemented our Trade Associations 
Policy to help support employees in their 
dealings with fellow employees, customers, 
suppliers, regulators and colleagues in

My background is in refractory ceramics 
and the heavy clay manufacturing 
industries. I joined Ibstock in 2004 
to run the special and bespoke brick 
making unit at the Chesterton factory 
before becoming the Process Manager 
for the main plant. 
I have always been impressed by the 
depth of knowledge and expertise at 
every level within the business as well 
as the willingness to listen to new ideas 
and involve people. For example, I was 
heavily involved in the development of 
the new Chesterton factory from its 
initial design and development, through 
the build and commissioning stages. 
Being part of the team has been very 
rewarding, especially now that the 
Chesterton factory is in full production.

CO 2 reduction, the generation of electricity 
from landfill gas and the recycling of raw 
materials such as process water to 
minimise waste and cost.
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data has 
been collected from the majority of locations 
operated or controlled by the Group, with 
some estimations used for the US subsidiary 
entity’s locations and immaterial UK 
subsidiaries. UK Government conversion 
factors and EUETS verified emissions have 
been used. Emission sources falling outside 
the Group’s operational control and other 
Scope 3 emissions have not been collated 
and reported.
The Group has used CO 2 per tonne of 
production as its intensity ratio as this is 
the most appropriate and relevant factor 
associated with our activities and should 
provide an appropriate basis on which 
to compare trends over time.

The results provided for Greenhouse

provision of information for the 12 months 
provides a clearer baseline for our reporting 
in this area in future years. As this is our 
first Annual reporting, no comparative 
information is provided.
Innovation
Research and development
The Group continually seeks to improve 
the quality of its existing products and 
processes, as well as to introduce new 
products through innovation and 
investments in new technology. The 
Group’s innovation efforts are primarily 
pursued at each of the Group’s four 
primary operating businesses.
Examples of innovative products developed 
include: the Ibstock Brickshield insulation 
product and the extended range of 
Fireborn; Glen-Gery’s thintech brick 
cladding system that uses a mounting 
system for thin brick; Forticrete’s Gemini 
tile and the new large format tile; and 
Supreme’s anti-theft device added to 
protect the cables secured within its rail 
cable troughs and a lightweight cable 
trough to ease manual handling. 
Furthermore, at the Group level, innovation 
is pursued through collaborative projects 
among the businesses. Ibstock Brick 
developed a clay rainscreen cladding. The 
Group recognised the same product could 
be used by Forticrete to produce a polished 
concrete rainscreen as an alternative to the 
clay rainscreen and developed this product 
in the alternative material.
The Group has a strong track record of 
award winning products, including:
 • Brick Development Association (“BDA”) 
Awards – Ibstock Brick has a 10-year 
track record of award wins having been 
in over 70 (more than half) of the award 
winning categories and six of the 
“supreme” award winners;
 • Queen’s Award for Enterprise – awarded in 
2001 for Forticrete’s Gemini roof tile, which 
was also awarded Millennium Products 
status by the Design Council; and
 • Brick in Architecture Awards – Glen-Gery 
has won numerous awards across a broad 
range of categories in the last five years.

Oversight, direction and governance
 
Risk arises from the operations of, 
and strategic decisions taken by, 
every business. Our approach to risk 
management is not to eliminate risk entirely, 
but rather provide the structural means 
to identify, prioritise and manage the 
risks involved in our activities.
The Board of Directors is ultimately 
responsible for the Group’s risk 
management process and internal control 
systems. The Board has considered the 
nature and extent of risks it is willing to 
take in pursuit of the Group’s strategic 
objectives. It has assessed the Group’s 
risk appetite, which is set to balance 
opportunities for business development 
and growth in areas of potentially higher 
risk, whilst maintaining our reputation 
and high levels of customer satisfaction.
The Group’s risk management process 
incorporates both top-down and  
bottom-up elements to the identification, 
evaluation and management of risks. 
The Audit Committee supports the Board 
in monitoring the risk exposures and is 
responsible for reviewing the effectiveness 
of our risk management and internal 
control systems.
Risk matrices are maintained and reviewed 
by each subsidiary entity within the Group. 
These matrices are the result of input 
and challenge undertaken by the senior 
managers within the entity and the Group’s 
Executive Directors. At a Group level, the 
Board reviews these matrices and the 
analysis of potential exposures which exist 
within them. Risks are continually evaluated 
using consistent measurement criteria. 
Internal Audit supports the Audit Committee 
in evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of our risk strategies and 
the internal controls implemented by 
management.
The structure of our Group risk 
management process is illustrated below:
As the Group’s component subsidiaries 
formed part of the CRH plc Group for 
several years prior to their disposal, they 
fell under the Sarbanes Oxley regime of 
internal control over financial reporting. 
These processes and controls have been 
maintained following the divestment from 
CRH plc, and the Directors believe this 
stands the new Group in good stead.
However, following the listing of the Group 
in October 2015, the newly formed Audit 
Committee requested a third party review 
of the Group’s Internal Audit function and 
the internal control processes. This 
independent “health-check” of the Group’s 
risk management is due to be completed 
in the first half of 2016. 
The Directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Group – including those that would threaten 
its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity.

IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 32
1. Economic conditions
Description Mitigation
The Group’s business could be materially impacted by changes 
in the macroeconomic environment in the UK and the US.
Specifically, demand for the Group’s products is strongly correlated 
with residential construction and renovation activities and non-
residential construction, together with the supply chain’s attitude  
to stock levels, which are cyclical.
The Group analyses construction statistics for the past five years 
and, using independent forecasts of construction statistics, 
forecasts demand for the next five years with the aim of 
anticipating market movements. 
The Group has historically flexed capacity and its cost base where 
possible during economic downturns to allow more of the Group’s 
manufacturing plants to remain open and viable, maintaining  
skills, development and training. The Group believes that this has 
maintained employee morale and high levels of customer service 
through the last economic downturn. It also allows the Group  
to respond more rapidly to increases in demand and keep 
customers satisfied. 
The Group’s RMI and specification product ranges diversify 
end-use exposure and provide greater resilience in light of 
changing market demand in any of its end-use markets.
2. Government action and policy
Description Mitigation
The Group has an exposure to both UK or US political 
developments. Material reductions in Government spending 
could have a material effect on demand for the Group’s products 
– reducing sales and affecting the Group’s financial results.
The Group analyses construction statistics for the past five  
years and, using independent forecasts of construction statistics, 
forecasts demand for the next five years with the aim of 
anticipating market movements. 
The change in climate post 2015’s UK General Election and 
Autumn Budget are favourable to housing, as well as recent 
changes to developing Brown Field land and the 200,000 
affordable homes the Government is targeting to be built by 2020. 
These measures, in addition to the National Planning Policy 
Framework (“NPPF”) and Help to Buy scheme, show the 
Government’s current commitment to house building. However, 
the Group recognises the risk which can result from political 
changes or economic uncertainty.
RMI and new housing demands are, to a certain extent, counter-
cyclical to each other, providing some balance to the portfolio of 
offerings for the Group.
3. Government regulation and standards relating to the manufacture and use of building products
Description Mitigation
The Group’s production, manufacturing and distribution activities 
are subject to health and safety risks.
The Group is subject to environmental, health and safety laws 
and regulations and these may change. These laws and 
regulations could cause the Group to make modifications to how 
it manufactures and prices its products. They could also require 
that the Group make significant capital investments or otherwise 
increase its costs or could result in liabilities.
Failure of the Group to comply with the relevant regulations 
could result in the Group being liable to fines or a suspension 
of operations, which would impact the Group’s financial results.
The health and wellbeing of our employees is fundamental to 
our business. We have stringent Health and Safety policies and 
monitor compliance regularly. 
We have also invested considerable resources in employee 
training across our manufacturing processes. We have invested 
heavily in safe systems and facilities to protect our employees.
The Group actively monitors for any legislative changes which 
it may need to comply with.

IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE 33
4. Customer relationships and reputation
Description Mitigation
The Group receives a significant portion of its revenue from key 
customers and the loss of any such customer could result in a 
significant loss of revenue and cash flow. Further, the Group does 
not have long-term contracts with its customers and the Group’s 
revenue could be reduced if its customers switch some or all of 
their business with the Group to other suppliers.
The Group has a service-led ethos with many top customer 
relationships lasting over 40 years. The Group’s customer focus is 
supported by a commitment to quality, service and consistency.
The Group’s sales and production teams are highly integrated to 
ensure that production aligns with customers’ needs. Sales teams 
receive in-depth technical training and are assisted by a design 
support service team as well as targeted marketing materials to 
assist with specification and selection. 
All four of the Group’s primary businesses have their own sales 
teams aligned by customer group and region in order to focus on 
key decision-makers and customers. Key account management is 
supervised at a senior level where long-term relationships benefit 
from the continuity of senior management who have the ability to 
liaise across the Group’s businesses.
The Group has a broad spread of customers and no single 
customer comprised more than 10% of the total Group revenue.
5. Business disruption
Description Mitigation
A material disruption at one of the Group’s manufacturing facilities 
or quarries, or at one of the Group’s suppliers’ facilities, could 
prevent the Group from meeting customer demand.
The Group depends on efficient and uninterrupted operations of its 
information and communication technology, and any disruption to 
or interruptions in these operations could have a material adverse 
effect on the Group’s operations and financial performance.
Additionally, the Group is exposed to the impact of unexpected  
or prolonged periods of bad weather, which could adversely  
affect construction activity and, as a result, demand for the 
Group’s products. 
The Group has the ability to transfer some of its production  
across its network of plants and is able to engage subcontractors 
to reduce the impact of certain production disruptions. 
In relation to supplier disruption or failure, further third party 
suppliers have been identified who can maintain service in the 
event of a disruption.
In relation to IT, a major incident action plan has been developed 
and the Group maintains data backups and a comprehensive 
disaster recovery plan.
Although weather conditions are completely beyond the Group’s 
control, in both the UK and US in 2015 adverse weather did not 
impact on trading in the context of the full year. Management  
do not underestimate the potential impact that future prolonged 
periods of bad weather could have. The Group’s wide 
geographical spread allows it to manage its production facilities  
to mitigate the impact of such disruption. 
6. Recruitment and retention of key personnel
Description Mitigation
The Group is dependent on qualified personnel in key positions 
and employees having special technical knowledge and skills.  
Any loss of such personnel without timely replacement could 
significantly disrupt business operations.
We ensure that we recognise the changing labour markets,  
and packages for key and senior staff remain competitive.
The Group believes that it is essential to protect and develop the 
management team, where appropriate ensuring that the team is 
structured in a way which best takes advantage of the available 
skills and robustly identifies the team and structure for the future. 
Extensive succession plans are in place, which is key to ensuring  
a managed transfer of roles and responsibilities.
Apprenticeship schemes are in operation with a yearly intake 
across the business (engineering and technical based). High 
potential individuals are identified with development plans 
formulated. External recruits are brought in where any skill  
gaps are identified and to enhance the talent pool.

7. Input prices
Description Mitigation
The Group’s business may be affected by volatility in extraction 
expenses and raw material costs. Risks exist around our ability to 
pass on increased costs through price increases to our customers.
The Group’s business may also be affected by volatility in energy 
costs or disruptions in energy supplies.
Significant changes in the cost or availability of transportation 
could affect the Group’s results.
Significant input costs are under constant review, with continuous 
monitoring of raw material costs, energy prices and haulage 
expenses, with the aim of achieving the best possible prices and 
assuring stability of supply.
As competitors of the Group are likely to experience similar levels 
of input price increases, we aim to have appropriate pricing policies 
to remain competitive within our markets and pass on significant 
increases in input costs to our customers wherever possible.
8. Product quality
Description Mitigation
The nature of the Group’s business may expose it to warranty 
claims and to claims for product liability, construction defects, 
project delay, property damage, personal injury and other 
damages. Any damage to the Group’s brands, including through 
actual or alleged issues with its products, could harm our 
business, reputation and the Group’s financial results.
The Group operates comprehensive quality control procedures 
across its sites. 
The Group’s Technical teams carry out regular testing of all of our 
products to provide full technical data on our product range. 
9. Financial risk management 
Description Mitigation
In addition to the input cost risks outlined above, the Group is 
subject to the following other financial risks:
 • Foreign exchange risk – As the Group has operations in the UK 
and the US, exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact the 
Group’s results. 
 • Credit risk – Through its customers, the Group is exposed to a 
counterparty risk that accounts receivable will not be settled 
leading to a financial loss to the Group.
 • Liquidity risk – Insufficient funds could result in the Group being 
unable to fund its operations. 
 • Interest rate risk – Movements in interest rates could adversely 
impact the Group and result in higher financing payments to 
service debt. 
 • Fo reign exchange risk – The Group undertakes very limited 
foreign exchange transactions, with the UK and US businesses 
selling domestically with largely local input costs. Management 
considers foreign exchange hedging strategies where 
significant exposures may arise.
 • Cr edit risk – Customer credit risk is managed by each 
subsidiary subject to the Group’s policy relating to customer 
credit risk management. The Group principally manages credit 
risk through management of customer credit limits. The credit 
limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness 
of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity. 
These limits are initially determined when the customer account 
is first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter. 
 • Li quidity risk – The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has 
sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet any foreseeable 
peak in borrowing requirements and liabilities when they 
become due. In September 2015, the Group entered into 
specific facilities of £240 million for a five-year term. 
 • In terest rate risk – The Group finances its operations through a 
mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings. The Group’s 
bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are in Sterling 
and at floating rates. No interest rate derivative contracts have 
been entered into at the period end.
10. Pension obligations
Description Mitigation
The Group has obligations to its employees relating to retirement 
and other obligations and any changes in assumptions or in interest 
rate levels could have adverse effects on its financial position.
The Company plays an active role in the pension scheme – 
nominating up to half of the Trustees and the Group Chief Financial 
Officer attends and chairs Trustee meetings. The defined benefit 
scheme is closed to new members. The Pension Trustees and 
their external advisers, as well as the internal pensions team, have 
significant expertise in the area and provide good quality oversight. 
An agreed Statement of Investment Principles is operated to 
provide appropriate security, achieve sufficient long-term growth 
and achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. 
N.B. A trend direction of the significant risks and uncertainties is not provided since the 2015 Annual Report & Accounts is the first reporting of Ibstock plc.
IBSTOCK_11_Risks_DRF2.indd   34 12/04/2016   13:06 OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Viability Statement
Background
The Directors, in preparing for the  
Group’s Initial Public Offering, undertook 
a comprehensive assessment of its viability 
as a business – rigorously assessing its 
markets, the strength of its business model 
and the potential risks that could impact 
its ongoing success. This process involved 
carefully reviewing and assessing extensive 
evidence, from both internal and external 
sources, to evaluate the prospects for 
Ibstock over a long-term horizon. It involved 
stress testing the Group’s business model 
to develop an appropriate valuation of the 
business. The success of the IPO provides 
confirmatory evidence that the market 
considers that Ibstock will continue as 
a viable business in the longer term. 
The knowledge and evidence gained from 
the IPO process is now embedded in the 
ongoing governance of the business.
Assessment
The extensive work carried out in 
preparation for the IPO, therefore, has 
informed the Directors’ assessment of  
the longer-term viability of the business.  
In addition, the Directors, as part of 
their year end review for the preparation 
of this Annual Report, have assessed 
the business model, strategy, market 
conditions, business planning, risks and  
the liquidity and solvency of the Group.
The Group has a strong position in the 
markets in which it operates as noted  
on pages 16 to 17 and its strategy (see 
pages 22 and 23) is aimed at continuing 
to strengthen its position in those markets 
and create value for its shareholders. 
Ibstock’s global operations (see pages 
36 and 37) exposes it to a number of 
risks and its principal risks and uncertainties 
are noted on pages 32 to 34. The Directors 
continually review those risks and determine 
the appropriate controls and further actions. 
They have further reviewed the impact within 
the context of the Group’s viability. The 
Group has limited exposure to interest rate 
risk and foreign exchange rate risk as 
described on pages 38 to 41. 
Lookout period
In determining the lookout period to assess 
the prospects of the Group, the Directors 
decided that three years was the appropriate 
period over which to assess longer-term 
viability. The nature of the building products 
business is that it is particularly sensitive 
to the level of economic activity, which is 
influenced by factors outside of the Group’s 
control, such as demographic trends, the 
state of the housing market, mortgage 
availability, mortgage interest rates and 
changes in household income, inflation and 
Government policy. Based on the evidence 
available, the Directors believe that it is 
reasonable to expect continued growth, and 
consider that a three-year period provides  
the most appropriate horizon over which 
to assess viability. The Directors have also 
considered the financing the Group has in 
place, which is agreed for a period in excess 
of the lookout period used. Refinancing is 
therefore not considered a significant factor 
in this current assessment, but is monitored 
on a continuous basis. 
Stress testing
During the challenging market conditions of 
the recent past, the Group performed well, 
remaining cash positive and implementing 
a number of mitigating actions that allowed 
it to remain viable. These mitigating actions 
remain available to the Directors today.
The budget has been stress tested  
against a severe and prolonged reduction 
in demand for its products, on the basis  
of reduced house building activity and 
therefore reduced volume of product  
sold, as well as a benign environment  
of prolonged price stagnation on sales. 
These scenarios reflect the previous 
challenging market conditions of the 
2008/09 downturn, a period over which  
UK construction output fell 13% (Source: 
Office of National Statistics, Construction 
Products Association) with sharp 
reductions also in the US market. These 
scenarios have been modelled alongside 
input cost inflation outside of the Group’s 
control, notably for energy costs. 
Assumptions
In determining the viability of the Group, 
the Board made the following assumptions:
 • The economic climate in the geographies 
in which the Group operates remains 
in line with a broad consensus of 
external forecasts;
 • Th ere is no material change in the legal 
and regulatory frameworks with which 
the Group complies;
 • Th ere are no material changes in 
construction methods used in the 
markets in which the Group operates;
 • Th e Group’s risk mitigation strategies 
continue to be effective; and
 • Th e Group’s past record of successfully 
mitigating significant construction 
industry declines can be replicated.
Conclusion
In summary, the Directors reasonably 
expect, based on the evidence available, 
that the Group will continue in operation 
and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the three-year period of their assessment.

Commentary in this report refers to 
the presentation of results for the year 
to 31 December 2015. 
United Kingdom
The UK business, which accounts for 
c81% of the Group, has performed strongly 
in 2015 with an increase in revenue of 
9.0% to £336m. Adjusted EBITDA in the 
UK has increased to £99.0m (a 71.0% 
increase) in the year to 31 December 2015. 
This improvement in revenue and 
profitability primarily reflects a stronger 
pricing environment for clay bricks and 
good pricing for other products. Despite 
the release and reduction of brick stocks 
by some housebuilders, total UK industry 
brick demand continued to exceed 
reported annual domestic production 
during the year. All UK businesses 
performed very well operationally, working 
on major projects and innovation whilst also 
delivering good customer service survey 
results in busy markets. This was achieved 
whilst also managing the additional work 
arising from the IPO.
Clay products
UK clay products has delivered strong 
growth in revenue of 13% in 2015 driven 
principally by increases in the levels of 
UK housebuilding. This increase has 
been supported by Help to Buy, improved 
mortgage availability, some improvements 
in local authority planning response and 
strong demand for new homes.
During 2015, brick availability concerns 
eased due to the release of inventory 
from housebuilders who had heavily 
stocked in 2014, increased UK brick 
production and the continued availability 
of imported bricks from continental Europe. 
As domestic supply improved during the 
year, imported brick volumes began to fall 
from annualised peaks seen in the second 
quarter of 2015.
As noted in “Our markets” on pages 16 
and 17, further growth in housebuilding 
volumes are forecast in 2016, again driven 
by Help to Buy, the Help to Buy ISA, the 
recently introduced Help to Buy London, 
which offers up to 40% deposit, and the 
ever growing gap between housebuilding 
rates and the requirement for new homes.
Growth is also forecast in Public Non-
housing, notably in Education, Health, 
Commercial and Repairs, Maintenance & 
Improvement (“RMI”), all of which have a 
significant influence on UK brick usage.
A number of improvement capital 
projects are underway within our UK 
clay operations which are focused 
on improving operational efficiency, 
production volume and reducing our 
cost base. In addition, the construction 
of our new factory at Ibstock in 
Leicestershire has now commenced. 
This investment will provide the most 
modern, efficient and flexible stock 
brick factory in the UK.
IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 36
How we have 
performed
IBSTOCK_12_How_we_performed_DRF2.indd   36 12/04/2016   13:05 The new factory at Ibstock will commission 
in the second half of 2017 and is a major 
statement of Ibstock plc’s ongoing 
commitment to the UK brick industry and to 
servicing the future product requirements of 
its customer base. The new factory will have 
a capacity of c100 million bricks per annum 
servicing the Housing, Public Non-housing, 
Commercial and RMI markets. 
UK clay products continues to develop its 
product and service package across all of 
its market segments and remains focused 
on maintaining and developing its unrivalled 
relationships with its customers.
Concrete products
UK concrete product revenues in 2015 
were 1.5% lower than 2014 with increased 
revenue in new build housing related 
products – including roof tiles – outweighed 
by lower activity in fencing related products 
and rail products – where projects have been 
delayed. Revenue into the UK fencing sector 
in 2014 had been boosted by unusual 
weather conditions in the first half of that year.
The revenue of aesthetic concrete products 
targeted at the private residential and private 
domestic repair and maintenance markets 
increased in 2015 driven by an increase in 
demand from the private residential market 
which reflected the same positive trends in 
private housebuilding seen in our UK clay 
operations. As a result, sales of our award 
winning Gemini roof tile, roofing accessories 
and natural stone substitute products saw 
continued growth in 2015.
A major capital project has commenced 
in the concrete roof tile business which 
will provide a new tile line at our Leighton 
Buzzard facility to broaden our existing 
concrete tile range. The design phase of the 
project is complete with the manufacturing, 
installation and commissioning phase 
scheduled for the second half of 2016 
ahead of a formal launch of the new 
product range from the beginning of 2017.
The outlook for our new housing market 
concrete products look positive for 2016 
underpinned by the continued demand 
for new housing. 
Sales of concrete fencing products, 
which are primarily focused on the private 
domestic repair and maintenance sector, 
reduced in the year to 31 December 2015. 
This was largely due to 2014 comparatives 
that included exceptional sales in the first 
half of that year as a result of sustained 
gale force wind conditions which boosted 
fencing sales for that year. There has been 
no change in the underlying market position 
of the UK concrete business in the concrete 
fencing segment which was strengthened 
during the year by a two-year sole supply 
deal with the UK’s largest independent 
merchants buying group. In addition, 
there is continued focus on maintaining 
competitive position in these product 
areas by reducing manufacturing costs 
with further mechanisation of the 
production process and commercial focus 
on opportunities to broaden the core 
product range and maximise the sales of 
core products to established customers. 
Concrete rail product sales declined during 
the year as a result of the slow release 
of projects following the introduction of 
Network Rail’s Control Period 5 in 2014 and 
subsequent internal reorganisations within 
Network Rail. It is anticipated there will be an 
increase in activity in these product areas as 
Network Rail enters year three of its five-year 
control period cycle with the overall aggregate 
spend across the whole five-year control 
period expected to remain unchanged 
despite the current delays to projects.
The outlook across the UK concrete 
businesses remains positive with strong 
support for growth expected from new build 
housing volumes, the benefits of new concrete 
tile products in 2016 and the continued 
optimisation of existing strong market positions 
in concrete fencing and the rail sector.
United States
Clay products
The US business, which accounts for c19% 
of the Group, performed strongly in 2015 
with an increase in revenue of 9.5% to $117m. 
Adjusted EBITDA in the US has increased to 
$12m (a 12.7% improvement) in the year to 
31 December 2015 reflecting a combination 
of rising volumes and higher average prices 
which include the benefit from a more 
favourable product mix. With both residential 
and non-residential markets in the North East 
and Mid West showing growth, Glen-Gery’s 
balanced exposure across these markets 
drove the favourable mix.
Profitability improvement also reflects a 
renewed focus on selling the complete 
product bundle of manufactured and 
sourced products embracing an 
“engineered wall solutions” product and 
service portfolio to the residential and 
architecturally specified commercial 
channels. These efforts were enabled 
in many key markets by the combined 
strength of existing independent and 
Group owned distribution capabilities. 
Prudent steps taken in the last economic 
downturn to contain costs and right-size 
the organisation are now also being 
reflected in improved operational 
efficiencies and profit performance as 
revenues and volumes continue to recover. 
With the continued gradual recovery in 
the new residential construction sector, 
US clay products has been aided by a 
healthy improvement in sales to the 
architecturally specified commercial 
construction sector where revenues and 
margins are more favourable. These mix 
and margin gains are expected to continue 
in 2016 with continued architecturally 
specified commercial construction growth 
in the education, retail and office sectors 
together with the benefits of renewed 
growth in single family and multi-unit housing 
in our core geographic trading regions.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
IBSTOCK_12_How_we_performed_DRF2.indd   37 12/04/2016   13:05  
Group turnover 
grew by 10.6% to 
reach £412.8 million 
(2014: £373.2 million) 
for the full year. 
Statutory overview
Statutory revenue was £358.3 million 
and statutory profit before tax was 
£94.7 million in the period from 28 November 
2014 to 31 December 2015. This represents 
the time from incorporation of Ibstock plc and 
Figgs Topco Limited – its predecessor entity.
The Group acquired the trading entities 
of Ibstock Building Products Limited in the 
UK and Glen-Gery Corporation in the US, 
and their respective subsidiaries on 26 
February 2015, hence only 10 months of 
trading performance is included in the 
statutory results.
Due to the unusual nature of the statutory 
financial statements period, set out 
above, I have described in the following 
analysis the year ended 31 December 2015 
with a comparative. This assumes that the 
acquisition had taken place at the beginning 
of 2015. I believe this provides shareholders 
with clearer information on the results of 
the operating entities and their relative 
performance in 2015.
Unless stated otherwise, commentary 
in this report refers to the presentation of 
results for the year to 31 December 2015, 
as explained above. A reconciliation to 
the statutory information is shown in 
Table 1, opposite.
Turnover
Group turnover grew by 10.6% to reach 
£412.8 million (2014: £373.2 million). On a 
constant currency basis, turnover growth 
was 9.1%.
Adjusted EBITDA
Management measure the Group’s 
operating performance using adjusted 
EBITDA, which represents Earnings 
Before Interest, Taxation, Depreciation 
and Amortisation and exceptional items 
incurred in the period.

Chief Financial 
Officer’s Report
IBSTOCK_13_CFO_Report_DRF2.indd   38 12/04/2016   13:05 After taking account of exceptional items 
relating to the costs of the acquisition of 
Ibstock Limited in the UK and Glen-Gery 
in the US and their subsidiary companies, 
the resulting negative goodwill, and the 
costs of the IPO transaction in October 
2015 and losses on disposal of property, 
plant and equipment (“PP&E”) also treated 
as exceptional items. Adjusted EBITDA 
improved by 64.7% from £65.0 million in 
2014 to £107.0 million in the year ending 
31 December 2015.
United Kingdom
Revenue of clay and concrete products 
in the UK, which represents 81% of Group 
revenue, increased by 9% for the 2015 
full year compared to 2014. The growth in 
revenue in 2015 primarily reflects the stronger 
pricing environment for clay bricks. 
UK clay product revenue increased by 
13.0% on the equivalent period in 2014 
to £253.3 million (2014: £224.2 million), 
whilst concrete revenue of £82.9 million 
in 2015 showed a small decrease of 1.5%. 
Increased revenues in new build housing 
related products (including roof tiles) were 
offset by lower activity in fencing and rail 
related products. After considering the 
impacts of exceptional storms in 2014 and 
the delayed expected sales for Network 
Rail contracts, management believes that 
UK concrete product revenues performed 
more strongly than 2014, 
In the UK, adjusted EBITDA increased 
by 71.0% to £99.0 million in 2015 from 
£57.9 million in 2014. This increase was 
driven by the strong pricing growth in clay 
products, noted above, higher utilisation of 
capacity across both our clay and concrete 
product manufacturing sites and reductions 
in energy prices during the year.
United States
Revenue in the US increased by 9.5% in 
constant currency to £77.0 million in the 
year to 31 December 2015. This growth 
reflects a combination of rising volumes, 
and higher average selling prices in the year. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased by 12.7% 
to £8.0 million (2014: £7.1 million) as a 
result of the lower energy costs incurred 
in the year and a favourable product mix.
 
Cash flow and net debt
Cash generated from operations during the 
year ended 31 December 2015, excluding 
the impact of the exceptional operating 
items, are shown in Table 2 on page 40.
Net working capital balance at 
31 December 2015 of £48.0 million 
compared with £35.2 million at 
31 December 2014. This increase in 
working capital was as a result of 
rebuilding the inventories held, principally 
in the UK, following the exceptional 
inventory reduction in 2013 required to 
service increased customer demand. 
Net working capital at the year end 
traditionally tends to be at the lowest 
position as industry activity slows in 
advance of the Christmas holiday period. 
Our pre-exceptional net interest charge 
increased in 2015 due to the facilities 
entered into during the year, as set 
out below. 
Net debt (term loan less cash) of 
£144.7 million at the year end was below 
management expectations as a result of 
timing differences. The initial senior facility 
taken on 25 February 2015 of £250 million 
(LIBOR floor of 1% plus a margin of 8%) 
was replaced at the time of the IPO in 
October 2015 with a senior facility of 
£200 million. Interest on the new five-year 
term loan is payable at LIBOR plus a 
margin of between 125bps and 250bps 
– the margin dependent on the Group’s 
leverage ratio. The Group also holds a 
committed Revolving Credit Facility 
(“RCF”) of £40 million. The RCF has 
remained undrawn since the IPO.
The Group is subject to financial covenants. 
At 31 December 2015, there was significant 
headroom on both requirements. See Table 
3 on page 40.
Exchange rates
The Group is exposed to movements in 
exchange rates when translating the results 
of the US operations from US Dollars to UK 
Sterling. Sterling appreciated against the 
Dollar during 2015. The impact of this was 
a £0.6 million benefit to EBITDA in 2015.
The following commentary relates 
to our statutory performance for 
the period.
Exceptional items
In line with our accounting policy for 
exceptional items, we have excluded 
certain items from our adjusted results.
The acquisition of the operating entities 
in February 2015 resulted in a significant 
distortion to the normal trading results. 
Negative goodwill of £124.2 million, 
together with acquisition related 
expenses (£10.4 million), as described 
below, have been classified as 
exceptional in the period.
In October 2015, Ibstock plc floated

Other infrequent events, such as the 
loss on disposal of PP&E in the period 
of £1.4 million, have been treated as 
exceptional. Exceptional items are analysed 
fully in Note 4 to the financial statements.
Acquisition 
On 26 February 2015, as part of the 
technical accounting of the Group’s entities, 
the Group acquired Ibstock Group Limited 
in the UK and Glen-Gery Corporation in 
the US along with their subsidiaries for 
consideration of £378.0 million. The 
acquisition resulted in £124.2 million of 
negative goodwill, which has been credited 
to the income statement in the period. On 
acquisition, intangible assets representing 
brands and customer contracts and 
relationships were recognised, valued at 
£45.4 million and £87.6 million, respectively. 
Further details on the acquisition are 
included in Note 24 to the financial 
statements. 
Finance costs
Finance costs for the period ended 
31 December 2015 of £69.4 million are as 
a result of the acquisition in February 2015, 
along with the subsequent refinancing at the 
time of the IPO. Included within the costs 
are exceptional finance costs of £39.9 million 
arising on the repayment of the initial senior 
facility. Our expected normalised interest 
charges are c£5.5 million per annum.
Taxation
The Group has recognised a tax credit 
of £6.9 million on Group pre-tax profits of 
£94.7 million resulting in an effective tax 
rate of -7.25% compared to the standard 
rate of UK corporation tax of 20.25%. 
Negative goodwill, other exceptional items 
and the impact of future tax rate changes 
on the deferred tax provision all had a 
significant impact on the effective tax  
rate in Table 4 opposite.

2015 2014
Statutory basic EPS 35.2p n/a
Adjusted basic EPS 16.2p n/a
The movement in statutory basic EPS is 
distorted by the significant exceptional 
non-trading items occurring during 2015, 
as set out above.
 
Our adjusted EPS metric removes the 
impact of exceptional non-trading items 
relating to the acquisition, subsequent 
IPO costs and other exceptional items. 
Additionally, the fair value uplifts resulting 
from our acquisition accounting have 
been removed from the adjusted EPS 
calculations. The adjusted EPS figures 
have been included to provide a clearer 
guide as to the underlying earnings 
performance of the Group. 
Dividend
A final dividend of 4.4 pence per share 
is being recommended for payment on 
3 June 2016 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 6 May 2016. 
The ex-dividend date will be 5 May 2016.
Our dividend policy is based on a pay-out 
ratio of 40-50% of adjusted profit after 
taxation over a business cycle. The 
Directors intend that the Company will 
pay an interim dividend and a final dividend 
in respect of each financial year in the 
approximate proportions of one-third 
and two-thirds, respectively, of the 
annual dividend, to be announced at the 
time of the announcement of the interim 
and final results. 
Pensions
In the UK, the Group operates a defined 
benefit scheme, which is closed to new 
members, together with a number of defined 
contribution schemes. At 31 December 2015, 
the defined benefit scheme was in an 
actuarial accounting surplus position of 
£17.4 million (against pension liabilities at 
the year end date of £551 million), and 
reflected the one-off contribution of 
£60 million paid during 2015. A further 
£9.0 million liability in respect of 
equalisation has been recognised 
reducing the surplus to £8.4 million (an 
asset due from CRH plc for £9.0 million 
is included separately within trade and 
other receivables). Within the financial 
statements, we have restricted the surplus 
position to £0.3 million based on our 
application of interpretation guidance 
on the related accounting standard. 
Within our US segment, certain 
employees are members of two multi-
employer post-employment schemes. 
At 31 December 2015, a liability of 
£8.0 million has been recognised in 
relation to these schemes. 
Further details are provided in Note 19 
to the financial statements. 
Subsequent events
With the exception of the proposed dividend, 
noted above, there have been no events 
subsequent to 31 December 2015, which 
management believe require adjustment 
or disclosure.
Going concern
The Group continues to meet its day to 
day working capital and other funding 
requirements through a combination of 
long-term funding and cash deposits. The 
Group’s banking facilities are a £200 million 
five-year loan and a £40 million committed 
RCF (undrawn at 31 December 2015). 
Both the term loan and the RCF expire 
in October 2020.
Risks and uncertainties 
The Board continually assesses and 
monitors the key risks impacting our 
business. Whilst the list is not intended to 
be exhaustive, and some risks are outside 
of the Group’s control, the principal risks 
and uncertainties that could have a material 
impact on the Group’s performance are set 
out in detail in our Risk management report 
on pages 30 to 34.

Corporate 
Governance 
Statement
Chairman’s introduction
My responsibility as 
Chairman is to ensure that 
the Board operates effectively 
and efficiently and that it 
continues to uphold the 
high standard of corporate 
governance required for 
the long-term success 
of the Company.
Ibstock plc successfully floated on the London Stock Exchange 
on 27 October 2015 and I am pleased to present this, the first 
Corporate Governance Statement as a listed company, 
to our shareholders. 
This Statement explains key features of the Company’s governance 
structure and compliance with the version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in September 2014 by the Financial 
Reporting Council (“the Governance Code”). This Statement also 
includes items required by the Listing Rules and the Disclosure 
Rules and Transparency Rules (“DTR”). A copy of the Governance 
Code is available on the Financial Reporting Council website at 
www.frc.org.uk.
It is the Board’s intention to be fully compliant with the 
Governance Code. Although the Company was not fully compliant 
on Admission, significant progress is being made to ensure 
compliance and much has been achieved in a relatively short 
time frame. Whilst we have explained why we have not thus far 
complied with certain provisions of the Governance Code, we 
have also set out the actions that have or are taking place to 
work towards full compliance during 2016.
While other sections of the Annual Report cover our financial and 
operational achievements during the period, this section describes 
the effective leadership of the Board and how it endeavours to 
promote the highest standards of corporate governance 
throughout the Group.
My responsibility as Chairman is to ensure that the Board operates 
effectively and efficiently and that it upholds the high standards of 
corporate governance required for the long-term success of the 
Company. I believe the achievement of good governance is based 
on the appropriate level of oversight, good communication, a focus 
on risks, a commitment to transparency and ensuring a culture of 
continuous improvement in standards and performance across 
the business.
In future, the Board will revisit its level of oversight and the 
monitoring of risks over a variety of areas including strategy, 
acquisitions and disposals, capital expenditure on new projects, 
finance, people and sustainability matters. The Board aims to 
ensure that good governance extends beyond the Boardroom 
and is continually borne in mind in the successful delivery of the 
Group’s strategic priorities over both the short and long term.

Governance 
Code provision Description Comments
B.1.2 Except for smaller companies at 
least half the board, excluding 
the chairman, should comprise 
non-executive directors 
determined by the board 
to be independent.
The Governance Code recommends that, in the case of a FTSE 350 company, 
at least half the Board of Directors, excluding the Chairman, should comprise 
Non-Executive Directors determined by the Board to be independent for the 
purposes of the Governance Code. 
On Admission, the Board comprised six members, including the Non-Executive 
Chairman, who was independent on appointment, the Senior Independent Director, 
two Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors, Michel Plantevin and 
Matthias Boyer Chammard who are not considered to be independent for the 
purposes of the Governance Code as a result of being nominated to the Board 
by Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. Accordingly, the Company has not complied with the 
recommendation of the Governance Code in respect of composition of the Board.
Actions taken to achieve compliance:
The Company was not compliant on Admission, but took swift action and two 
independent Non-Executive Directors were appointed in February 2016. The process 
to identify an additional independent Non-Executive Director is ongoing and following 
appointment the Company expects to be fully compliant with the Governance Code.
B.2.1 There should be a nomination 
committee which should 
lead the process for board 
appointments and make 
recommendations to the board. 
A majority of members of the 
nomination committee should 
be independent non-executive 
directors. 
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Jamie Pike and the other members are 
Jonathan Nicholls, Michel Plantevin, Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella. As at the 
year-end the Company had not complied with the recommendations of the 
Governance Code in respect of the number of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Action taken to achieve compliance:
Since the year end Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella became members of the 
Committee and the Company has now complied with the recommendations of 
the Governance Code in this respect.
B.6 The board should undertake 
a formal and rigorous 
annual evaluation of its own 
performance and that of its 
committees and individual 
directors.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
The Board and its Committees are newly formed and sufficient time has not 
passed to conduct a meaningful Board evaluation process. Evaluation of the 
Board’s performance will be a key issue for the attention of the Board and its 
Committees during the next 12 months.
B.6.1 The board should state in the 
annual report how performance 
evaluation of the board, its 
committees and its individual 
directors has been conducted.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
The Board has established a timetable of Board and Committee meetings. The Board 
and its Committees have also scheduled meetings at which the performance and 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees will be evaluated. The Board is committed 
to conducting an externally facilitated evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its 
Committees within a three-year time frame, as envisaged by the Governance Code.
B.6.3 The non-executive directors, 
led by the senior independent 
director, should be responsible 
for performance evaluation of the 
chairman, taking into account the 
views of executive directors.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
This review will be performed by the Senior Independent Director during 2016.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 
The purpose of the Governance Code is to facilitate effective, 
entrepreneurial and prudent management that can deliver the 
long-term success of the Company. The main principles of the 
Governance Code set out standards of practice for the Board in 
relation to leadership, effectiveness, accountability, remuneration 
and its relations with shareholders. The Company was incorporated 
on 3 September 2015 and admitted to the premium listing segment 
of the Official List and to trading on the main market of the London 
Stock Exchange on 27 October 2015 (“Admission”). The Governance 
Code applied from Admission and the Company undertook a 
significant amount of work in preparation for this and continues 
to work towards full compliance. 
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. We have made significant progress since Admission 
and except as described in the table below, as of the date of 
this Annual Report, the Company complies and intends to continue 
to comply with the Governance Code. As envisaged by the 
Governance Code, the Board has established Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration committees. If the need should arise, the 
Board may establish additional committees, as appropriate.

Governance 
Code provision Description Comments
C.2.3 The board should monitor the 
company’s risk management 
and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carry out 
a review of their effectiveness, 
and report on that review in the 
annual report. The monitoring 
and review should cover all 
material controls, including 
financial, operational and 
compliance controls.
Immediately prior to Admission the Board approved the thorough and detailed review 
of material internal controls in relation to financial, operational and compliance matters, 
that had been conducted during the IPO process. The Directors are comfortable that 
for the period covered by the Annual Report & Accounts that the controls continued to 
operate effectively. However, the Board did not conduct a formal review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk management and internal controls prior 
to 31 December 2015 and hence was not compliant with the recommendations of 
the Governance Code in this respect.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
In preparing the Annual Report & Accounts the Board identified the principal 
risks faced by the Group and has set out ways in which they may be mitigated and 
managed. The Audit Committee will monitor these controls throughout the year 
and report to the Board accordingly. The Board intends to conduct a review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s system of risk management and internal control in 2016, 
in accordance with the FRC’s guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting.
C.3.1 The board should establish 
an audit committee of at 
least three independent 
non-executive directors. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by Jonathan Nicholls and its other members are 
Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella. The Governance Code recommends that, in the 
case of FTSE 350 companies, the Audit and Risk Committee comprises at least three 
Non-Executive Directors, independent for the purposes of the Governance Code, 
and that one such member has recent and relevant financial experience. Jonathan 
Nicholls has recent and relevant financial experience. 
As at the year-end the Company had not complied with the recommendations of the 
Governance Code in respect of the number of independent Non-Executive Directors. 
During the period between Admission and the year-end Jamie Pike was a member 
of the Committee.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
Since the year-end Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella became members of the 
Committee. Having been a member since Admission, Jamie Pike stepped down 
from the Committee on 24 February 2016.
As of the date of this Annual Report the Company is compliant with the 
recommendations of the Governance Code in this respect. 
D.2.1 The board should establish 
a remuneration committee 
of at least three independent 
non-executive directors. 
In addition, the Company 
Chairman may also be a 
member of, but not chair of, 
the committee if he or she 
was considered independent 
on appointment as Chairman.
The Governance Code recommends that all members of the Remuneration Committee 
be Non-Executive Directors, independent for the purposes of the Governance Code.
Having been a member at Admission, Wayne Sheppard stepped down from the 
Committee on 24 February 2016.
During the period between Admission and the appointment of Lynn Minella, 
the Committee was chaired by Jamie Pike.
Action taken to achieve compliance:
As of the date of this Annual Report the Company is compliant with the 
recommendations of the Governance Code in this respect. 
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Lynn Minella and its other members 
are Jonathan Nicholls, Jamie Pike and Tracey Graham.
The Listing Rules require that we state how the “Main Principles” 
set out in the Governance Code have been applied. The required 
detail in line with the specific provisions of the Governance Code 
is set out in this Corporate Governance Statement.
Share Dealing Code
The Company has adopted a code of securities dealings in relation 
to the Ordinary Shares which is based on, and is at least as rigorous 
as, the model code as published in the Listing Rules. The code 
adopted applies to the Directors, Persons Discharging Managerial 
Responsibilities and relevant employees of the Group.

Relationship with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of creating a clear flow of 
communication with all of the Company stakeholders including 
shareholders, particularly with regard to business developments 
and financial results. The Board aims to communicate on a regular 
basis and at present the Company utilises news releases, investor 
presentations and Company publications and will expand 
communication channels where necessary.
All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual General 
Meeting (the “AGM”), at which they will have the opportunity to 
meet and put questions to the Board. Details of the resolutions to 
be proposed at the AGM to be held on 26 May 2016 at 2:00 p.m. 
at the Mercure Leicester The Grand Hotel, Granby Street, Leicester 
LE1 6ES can be found in the Notice of Meeting, which, together 
with explanatory notes on the resolutions to be proposed and full 
details of the deadlines for exercising voting rights is contained 
in a circular which will be circulated to all shareholders at least 
20 working days before such meeting together with this Report. 
This document will also be available on the Ibstock plc website 
(www.ibstockplc.com/investors). Results of voting at the AGM will 
be announced to the London Stock Exchange and will be published 
on our website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
In line with the Governance Code, the Board has appointed 
Jonathan Nicholls as Senior Independent Director (“SID”). 
Jonathan is available to shareholders throughout the year if they 
have concerns that contact through the normal channels of the 
Chairman or other Executive Directors have failed to resolve or 
for which such channels of communication are inappropriate.
The SID has met with the majority shareholders, Diamond (BC) 
S.à r.l., on a regular basis through their representatives on the 
Board of Directors.
Leadership
Board composition
The Governance Code recommends that the board of directors 
of a UK premium listed company includes an appropriate 
combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors, with 
independent Non-Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) 
comprising at least half the board. As at 31 December 2015, the 
Board comprised a Non-Executive Chairman, one independent 
Non-Executive Director, two non-independent Non-Executive 
Directors and two Executive Directors. The Company considers 
that Jamie Pike was independent on appointment and regards 
Jonathan Nicholls as independent for the purposes of the 
Governance Code.
In February 2016, Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella were appointed 
as Non-Executive Directors, whom the Board regards as 
independent for the purposes of the Governance Code. 
Appointment of Non-Executive Directors and observer 
by the controlling shareholder
On 22 October 2015, the Company entered into a Relationship 
Agreement with Diamond (BC) S.à r.l. (the “controlling shareholder”), 
under the terms of which the controlling shareholder has a right 
to nominate for appointment two Directors (each a “Shareholder 
Director”) to the Board of the Company whilst its and its associates’ 
shareholding in the Company is 25% or more; and to nominate 
for appointment one Shareholder Director to the Board of the 
Company whilst its and its associates’ shareholding in the 
Company is 10% or more. If the controlling shareholder’s 
shareholding in the Company is reduced to less than 25%, but is 
10% or more and two Shareholder Directors are appointed to the 
Board of the Company, the controlling shareholder will, if requested 
by the Board, procure that one of its nominated Directors resigns 
from the Board. If the controlling shareholder and its associates’ 
shareholding in the Company is reduced to less than 10%, the 
controlling shareholder will, if requested by the Board, procure 
that all of its remaining nominated Directors resign from the Board. 
In addition, for as long as the controlling shareholder and its 
associates’ shareholding in the Company is 10% or more, the 
controlling shareholder shall also be entitled to appoint one 
Shareholder Director as a member of the Nomination Committee 
and, if invited by the Chairman of the relevant committee to send 
a Shareholder Director as an observer to meetings of the 
Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
The Board confirms that, during the period from 22 October 2015 
until the date of this report:
 • the Company has complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement;
 • so f ar as the Company is aware, the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement have been complied 
with by the controlling shareholder and its associates; and
 • so f ar as the Company is aware, the procurement obligation 
included in the Relationship Agreement has been complied 
with by the controlling shareholder.

standards, commercial strategy and annual budgets.

determining Directors’ remuneration.
 • Ap proval of the Group’s health and safety and sustainability 
and environmental policies.
 • En suring a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders based 
on the mutual understanding of objectives.
Matters not specifically reserved for the Board, including the day 
to day management of the Group, are delegated to the Executive 
Directors. To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors 
receive appropriate and timely information. 
Board Committees
As envisaged by the Governance Code, the Board has established 
three principal Committees of the Board: an Audit Committee, 
a Nomination Committee and a Remuneration Committee. Each 
Committee has formally delegated duties and responsibilities set out 
in its written terms of reference. If the need should arise, the Board 
may establish additional committees, to consider specific issues, as 
appropriate. In line with each of the Committees’ terms of reference, 
only members of the relevant Committee have the right to attend 
and vote at its meetings. Committee meetings are also attended 
by the Company Secretary, who acts as the secretary to each of 
the Committees. When appropriate, non-members on the Board, 
together with the Executive Directors may be invited to attend all 
or any part of any Committee meeting. The matters reserved for 
the Board and the terms of reference for each of the Board 
Committees are available on the Company’s corporate website, 
at www.ibstockplc.com/investors. Details of each of the Board-
appointed Committees and their activities during the year are set 
out in the separate Committee Reports on pages 52 to 78, which are 
incorporated into the Corporate Governance Statement by reference. 
The Chairman of each Committee reports the outcome of the 
meetings to the Board. Details of Committee memberships are 
included in the Directors’ biographies on pages 42 and 43.
Diversity
We fully support the aims, objectives and recommendations 
outlined in Lord Davies’ Report “Women on Boards” and are 
aware of the need to increase the number of women on our Board 
and in senior positions throughout the Group. However, we do 
not consider that it is in the best interests of the Company and its 
shareholders to set prescriptive targets for gender on the Board 
and we will continue to make appointments based on merit, 
against objective criteria to ensure we appoint the best individual 
for each role. Across our business of approximately 2,700 employees, 
c13.3% are female. Following the appointment of Tracey Graham 
and Lynn Minella in February 2016, 25% of the Board are women.
Decision-making and Directors’ conflicts of interest
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have 
or may have interests that conflict with those of the Company, unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Board. This includes potential 
conflicts that may arise when a Director takes up a position with 
another company. The Company’s Articles of Association, which 
are in line with the Companies Act 2006, allow the Board to 
authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose 
limits or conditions, as appropriate, when giving any authorisation. 
Any decision of the Board to authorise a conflict of interest is only 
effective if it is agreed without the conflicted Directors voting or 
without their votes being counted. In making such a decision, the 
Directors must act in a way they consider in good faith will be 
most likely to promote the success of the Company.
The Company has established a procedure for the appropriate 
authorisation to be sought prior to the appointment of any new 
Director, or prior to a new conflict arising and for the regular review 
of actual or potential conflicts of interest. An Interests Register 
records any authorised potential conflicts and will be reviewed 
by the Board on a regular basis to ensure that the procedure is 
working effectively.
Board induction and development
On appointment, Non-Executive Directors, who are expected 
to provide a time commitment to the Company of at least 25 days 
a year and to recognise the need for availability in the event of 
a crisis, are provided with a detailed induction programme. The 
induction programme covers the Company’s operations, including 
social, ethical and environmental matters, the Group’s principal 
risks and internal controls in place to manage those risks, meetings 
with senior management and tours of the Group’s main properties. 
The Directors may, at the Company’s expense, take independent 
professional advice and are encouraged to continually update 
their professional skills and knowledge of the business. Senior 
managers and external advisers present to the Board during the 
year on a range of subjects and the Directors also individually 
attend seminars or conferences associated with their expertise. 
The level and nature of training by the Directors will be reviewed 
by the Chairman at least annually.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Effectiveness
Division of responsibilities 
Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer
For the Board to remain effective, the Governance Code requires 
a clear division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive Officer. These positions are held by Jamie Pike 
as Chairman and Wayne Sheppard as Chief Executive Officer. The 
roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer are set out and are available to view on the Company’s 
corporate website at www.ibstockplc.com/investors.
The Chairman reports to the Board and is the guardian of 
the Board’s decision-making processes. He is responsible for 
leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness on all 
aspects of its role. The Chairman also promotes a culture of 
openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of 
Non-Executive Directors in particular and ensuring constructive 
relations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The 
Chairman is responsible for ensuring that the Directors receive 
accurate, timely and clear information and that there is effective 
communication with shareholders.
The Chief Executive Officer, assisted by senior management, is 
responsible for proposing and developing the Company’s strategy 
and commercial objectives for consideration by the Board, and 
for implementing the decisions of the Board into the day to day 
functions of the business.
The Chief Financial Officer
The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the financial reporting 
and management of the Group. In addition to the finance, audit, 
tax and treasury functions, he is also jointly responsible with the 
Chief Executive Officer for the Group’s M&A strategy, and 
investor relations. 
The Senior Independent Director
The Senior Independent Director is available for shareholders to 
voice any concerns which may not be appropriate for discussion 
through the normal channels of Chairman, Chief Executive Officer 
or Chief Financial Officer. The Senior Independent Director also 
leads the Chairman’s appraisal, serves as an intermediary for 
the other Directors with the Chairman as necessary and acts 
as a sounding board for the Chairman as required.
Non-Executive Directors
At the date of this report, Independent Non-Executive Directors 
comprise 42% of the Board, excluding the Chairman. The Board 
believes that these Non-Executive Directors, Jonathan Nicholls, 
Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella, possess strong independent 
character and judgement and bring a wide range of business 
experience in some areas related to and in other areas 
complementary to the activities of the Group. 
Directors’ insurance cover and indemnity
The Company maintains, at its expense, a Directors’ and 
Officers’ liability insurance policy to afford an indemnity in certain 
circumstances for the benefit of Group personnel including, 
as recommended by the Governance Code, the Directors. 
This insurance policy does not provide cover where the 
Director or Officer has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. 
The Company has also provided an indemnity for its Directors to 
the extent permitted by the law in respect of liabilities incurred as a 
result of their office. The indemnity would not provide any coverage 
to the extent that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly.
Board evaluation
As the Company has listed relatively recently, and as outlined in 
our compliance statement above, a formal and rigorous Board 
evaluation process, as required by the Governance Code, has 
not yet been undertaken. However, an internal review of the 
effectiveness of the Board and its Committees will be undertaken 
during the forthcoming year and a formal independent evaluation of 
the Board and its Committees will be conducted at an appropriate 
stage in the Board’s development, but nevertheless within three 
years, as recommended by the Governance Code. Going forward, 
the Chairman will meet with the independent Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the Executive Directors bi-annually 
and the Senior Independent Director will meet with the independent 
Non-Executive Directors annually, in the absence of the Chairman, 
to appraise his performance.
Development and advice
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board, also 
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. 
Independent external legal and professional advice can also be 
taken when necessary to do so. Furthermore, each Committee of 
the Board has access to sufficient and tailored resources to carry 
out its duties. A personalised induction and subsequent training 
programme is provided to new members of the Board and 
its Committees.
Meetings and attendance
The Board intends to meet approximately eight times a year and 
may meet at other times as required or otherwise at the request of 
one or more of the Directors. Where urgent decisions are required 
between meetings on matters specifically reserved for the Board, 
there is a process in place to facilitate discussion and decision-
making. The Directors regularly communicate and exchange 
information irrespective of the timing of meetings.
The number of meetings of the Board and the attendance by the 
Directors during the period between Admission and the year-end 
is disclosed in the following table:

Corporate Governance  
Statement 
continued
The Board aims to hold at least two Board meetings each year at 
Group business locations, both in the UK and the US, to enable 
Board members to gain a deeper understanding of the business. 
This also provides senior managers from across the Group with 
the opportunity to present to the Board as well as to meet the 
Directors on more informal occasions. 
Since the year-end the Board, Audit Committee, Remuneration 
Committee and Nomination Committee each met on one occasion. 
The meetings were attended by all those eligible to attend.
External directorships
Any external appointments or other significant commitments of 
the Directors require the prior approval of the Board. The external 
commitments of the Board are set out in their biographies on 
pages 42 and 43. The Board is content with the level of external 
directorships of its Chairman and independent Non-Executive 
Directors as these do not impact on the time that any Director 
devotes to the Company and we believe that this experience 
only enhances the capability of the Board. None of the Executive 
Directors hold external directorships save for Wayne Sheppard, 
who is Principal of the Construction Products Association, a 
Director of the British Ceramic Confederation, and a Director 
of the Brick Development Association.
Accountability
Internal controls
The Board remains ultimately accountable for a clear number of 
areas that are contained in its “Matters Reserved for the Board”, 
including responsibility for the effectiveness of internal control and 
risk management. The Board as a whole discuss, challenge and 
give approval on the financial statements. Details of the internal 
controls of the Company (including a description of the main 
features of its internal control and risk management arrangements 
in relation to the financial reporting process) and the manner in 
which the Board and its committees assess the effectiveness of 
these controls are set out as part of the Audit Committee Report 
on pages 53 to 55. 
The Group’s internal control is based on assessment of risk and 
a framework of control procedures to manage risks and to monitor 
compliance with procedures. The internal control systems are 
designed to meet the Group’s particular needs and the risks 
to which it is exposed and, by their nature, can provide only 
reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material loss to 
the Group or material misstatement in the financial accounts.
The Group has a process for the identification, evaluation and 
management of significant business risks. The Board has during 
the period identified and evaluated the key risks and has ensured 
that effective controls and procedures are in place to manage 
these risks.
The Executive Directors meet regularly with representatives from 
the businesses to address financial, human resource, legal, risk 
management and other control issues. During the period the 
Board has performed a review of the effectiveness of internal 
control and the management of risks as part of the IPO. 
In relation to the Board’s responsibility to approve the financial 
statements the Board sets out its Directors’ Responsibility 
Statement at the end of this section. The Board also retains its 
responsibility to approve the annual budget. Monitoring of the 
annual budget, following approval, is carried out through regular 
updates against budget circulated as part of the Chief Financial 
Officer’s report to the Board. In addition, the Board reviews all 
significant capital expenditure requests separately, after a general 
approval for the quantum of the capital expenditure budget has 
been granted. Measures such as these maintain adequate levels 
of control and scrutiny over the budget and capital expenditure 
at Board level. The Board recognises that its committees are 
only empowered to make recommendations to the Board for 
their approval, unless a specific authorisation to approve certain 
matters is granted. To facilitate information flows, a verbal 
update is given by the Chairman of the relevant committee in 
the subsequent Board meeting following a committee meeting.
The Board intends to conduct a review of the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of risk management and internal control in 2016, 
in accordance with the FRC’s guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting.
Fair, balanced and understandable – a matter for the 
whole Board
As part of its considerations as to whether the 2015 Annual Report 
& Accounts are fair, balanced and understandable, and provide 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy, the Board 
takes into account the following:
 • th e Chairman and Chief Executive provide input to and agree 
on the overall messages and tone of the Annual Report at an 
early stage;
 • in dividual sections of the Annual Report and financial statements 
are drafted by appropriate senior management with regular 
review meetings to ensure consistency of the whole document;
 • de tailed reviews of appropriate draft sections of the Annual 
Report & Accounts are undertaken by the Executive Directors;
 • a fi nal draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee and the auditors 
on a timely basis to allow sufficient consideration and is 
discussed with the Chief Financial Officer and senior 
management prior to consideration by the Board; and
 • th e Chief Financial Officer, in his February Board paper, includes 
a checklist of areas that the Board should take into consideration 
in considering the fairness, consistency and balance of the final 
draft of the Annual Report and financial statements, including 
whether the Board considers that there are any omissions 
in information.
The Statement of Going Concern and the Viability Statement 
appear on page 80.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards), including FRS 
102, The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the United 
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and applicable law. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the Accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to: 
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
 • state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the financial statements; and 
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard No.1 requires Directors to: 
 • properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position 
and financial performance; and 
 • ma ke an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern and prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and 
Company’s transactions and to disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Group and Company and 
to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors are of the opinion that the Annual Report & 
Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable 
and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. 
Directors’ Responsibility Statement 
The Directors who were in office as at 31 December 2015 and 
whose names and functions are given on pages 42 and 43 
confirm that to the best of their knowledge: 
 • th e financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of 
the Group and Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole; and  
 • th e Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group and Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
This Responsibility Statement was approved by the Board of 
Directors on 10 March 2016 and is signed on its behalf by:

Nomination 
Committee 
Report
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to present to you the report of the Nomination 
Committee (the “Committee”) for the financial period ended 
31 December 2015.
Committee membership
Although the Committee was not compliant with the 
recommendations of the Governance Code on Admission, 
following the appointment of Tracey Graham and Lynn Minella 
as independent Non-Executive Directors and members of the 
Committee on 3 February 2016, the Committee is now compliant.
The members of the Nomination Committee during the period 
ended 31 December 2015 were as follows: myself as Chairman, 
Jonathan Nicholls, the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, 
and Michel Plantevin. 
The current members of the Committee are myself as Chairman, 
Jonathan Nicholls, Tracey Graham, Lynn Minella (all of whom are 
independent Non-Executive Directors) and Michel Plantevin.
Responsibilities
The key responsibilities of the Committee are as follows:
 • De velop and maintain a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for making recommendations to the Board on 
appointments, structure, size and composition of the Board;
 • Succession planning for Directors and other senior managers;
 • Ev aluate the balance of skills, diversity, knowledge and 
experience of the Board;
 • Pr epare a description of the role and capabilities required for 
a particular appointment and lead the recruitment process;
 • Id entify and nominate, for the approval of the Board, candidates 
to fill Board and senior management vacancies as and when 
they arise;
 • Review the time commitment required from Non-Executive 
Directors and to evaluate the membership and performance 
of the Board and its Committees; and
 • Recommend the re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors 
and re-election of Directors.
Activities of the Committee up to the date of this report
The Committee did not meet between Admission and the year-end.
The following matters were considered by the Committee after the 
year-end to:
 • Adopt the Committee’s Terms of Reference;
 • Re commend the appointment of Tracey Graham and Lynn 
Minella as Non-Executive Directors. Egon Zehnder, the external 
search firm, which has no other connection to the Company, 
worked with me to devise a long list of candidates. A short 
list was then compiled and the Committee, together with the 
Executive Directors, met with these candidates and was able 
to formulate its recommendation to the Board; and
 • Review succession planning for the Board.
Succession planning and Board diversity
The composition of the Board is constantly under review with 
the aim of ensuring that it has the depth and breadth of skills 
to discharge its responsibilities effectively.
 
The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Board is well 
balanced and appropriate for the needs of the business and 
the achievement of its strategy, comprising Directors who are 
appropriately experienced and are independent of character and 
judgement. Before recommending new candidates to the Board, 
the Nomination Committee takes account of the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and diversity of psychological type, 
background and gender. However, all Board appointments will 
always be made on merit. Additional information is included in 
the Corporate Governance Statement on page 48.
Ensuring the Directors’ independence and commitment 
to their roles
In making recommendations to the Board on Non-Executive 
Director appointments, the Nomination Committee specifically 
considers the expected time commitment of the proposed 
Non-Executive Director and other commitments they already have. 
Agreement of the Board is also required before a Director may 
accept any additional commitments to ensure possible conflicts 
of interest are identified and that they will continue to have 
sufficient time available to devote to the Company. Any other 
conflicts of interest are also considered at each Board meeting.
Committee effectiveness
The effectiveness of the Committee will be reviewed on an annual 
basis by both the Board and the Committee. It is anticipated that 
the first review will take place in November 2016, at which time the 
Committee will have been in existence for more than one year.

Audit 
Committee 
Report
Dear Shareholder,
Welcome to the first Report of the Audit Committee (the 
“Committee”). The Committee reviews and makes recommendations 
to the Board on the Group’s financial reporting, internal control and 
risk management systems and the independence and effectiveness 
of the external auditors. The Committee provides independent 
monitoring, guidance and challenge to Executive Management in 
these areas. Through this process the Committee’s aim is to ensure 
high standards of corporate and regulatory reporting, an appropriate 
control environment, risk management and compliance. The 
Committee believes that excellence in these areas enhances 
the effectiveness and reduces the risks to the business.
The Committee is appointed by the Board. The Committee will 
continue to keep its activities under review to ensure that it 
complies with any changes in the regulatory environment. 
In October 2015, Ibstock plc was admitted to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority 
and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. 
Prior to the Group’s flotation the Directors performed a review 
which did not highlight the requirement for any significant changes 
to the Group’s processes and procedures.
I shall be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer 
any questions shareholders may have regarding the work of 
the Committee.
Audit Committee and advisers
From Admission until February 2016, the Committee comprised 
Jamie Pike and myself. During February 2016, Tracey Graham 
and Lynn Minella were appointed to the Board as Non-Executive 
Directors and also became members of the Committee. Following 
their appointment, Jamie Pike stood down from the Committee 
on 24 February 2016. 
The Audit Committee provides a forum for reporting and 
discussion with the Group’s external auditors in respect of the 
Group’s half year and period end results and meetings are also 
attended by certain Executive Directors and senior managers 
by invitation.
The Committee met formally on one occasion prior to the period end. 
However, I have maintained a regular dialogue with the Chief Financial 
Officer and external auditor since Admission.
The Committee met in February 2016 to consider, amongst other 
matters, the Annual Report & Accounts. The Committee intends to 
meet at least four times per year going forward, in alignment with 
the financial reporting timetable.
Purpose and aim 
The purpose of the Committee is to make recommendations on 
the reporting, control, risk management and compliance aspects 
of the Directors’ and the Group’s responsibilities, providing 
independent monitoring, guidance and challenge to Executive 
Management in these areas. 
Key responsibilities include:
 • To e nsure the consistent application of, and any changes to, 
significant accounting policies across the Group;
 • To monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Group;
 • To monitor and challenge the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal financial controls, as well as the internal control and 
risk management systems; 
 • To monitor the effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing 
procedures; 
 • To evaluate the effectiveness of the Group’s Internal Audit function; 
 • To m ake recommendations to the Board on the appointment, 
independence and effectiveness of the Group’s external auditor 
and to negotiate and agree their remuneration; and
 • To develop and implement the Group’s non-audit services policy.
The Audit Committee’s Terms of Reference are available on the 
Company’s website (www.ibstockplc.com/investors).
Accounting and key areas of judgement
A key factor in the integrity of financial statements is ensuring that 
suitable accounting policies are adopted and applied consistently on 
a year on year basis. The Committee commenced this process at 
the December 2015 meeting and intends to use the Audit Planning 
meetings in May and November each year to consider proposed 
accounting treatments for major transactions, significant reporting 
judgements and key assumptions related to those judgements.
Audit Committee activities during the period
At the meeting held in December 2015 the Committee:
Undertook a year-end planning update, which included:
 • Me eting with the external auditors to review their proposals for 
the audit of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2015;
 • Review of:
 – significant accounting, reporting and judgement matters 
 – the going concern assessment approach – see page 80
 – the Group’s approach to producing a viability statement 
over a three-year period
 – developments in corporate governance and reporting 
requirements and proposed disclosure in the 2015 Annual 
Report in relation to the UK Corporate Governance Code
 – areas of potential fraud and mitigating controls in place
 – whistleblowing policy – see page 55
 • Ag reement of 2015 audit fee; and
 • Approval of the policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor for the provision of non-audit services.
Following the year-end the Committee met in February 2016 at 
which it:
Undertook a review of the Annual Report & Accounts, which included:
 • Co nfirmation that the Annual Report was fair, balanced, 
understandable and provided the necessary information required 
by shareholders to assess performance, position, business 
model and strategy. The Committee recommended that the 
Board approve the Annual Report & Accounts on this basis. 
The names and functions of the Directors who were in office 
as at 31 December 2015 are given on pages 42 and 43.

Audit Committee Report
continued
 – Classification of non-underlying items  
The principal items recognised as exceptional are costs related 
to the acquisition during the period and the subsequent IPO, 
and negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of the operating 
companies. The Committee considered both the nature and 
the quantum of those items disclosed as exceptional within 
the 2015 financial statements. Management demonstrated 
that the treatment was in line with current practice and existing 
guidance issued by the FRC. The Committee reviewed 
management’s analysis of the classification and assessment 
of items’ nature and received input from the external auditor 
to confirm that such accounting treatment is consistent with 
accounting guidance. The Committee concluded that treatment 
of these items as exceptional was in line with the Group’s 
accounting policy, and was appropriately disclosed.
 – IFRS first time reporting  
The 2015 Annual Report & Accounts is the Group’s first 
publication since its listing in October 2015. As a result, 
the Committee considered, and satisfied itself, with due 
input from management and the external auditor, that the 
appropriate accounting policies were in place and that 
adequate disclosure had been included in the 
consolidated financial statements.
 • Other activities:
 – Explanation of the assessment of effectiveness of the 
external audit process.
 – Recommendation to the Board on the reappointment and 
remuneration of the external auditor. 
 – Consideration and recommendation to the Board to 
approve the Viability Statement. The Committee reviewed and 
challenged management’s underlying assertions (e.g. look out 
period, assumptions and consistency with the IPO forecasts).
 – Management confirmed to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any misstatements, either material or immaterial, in 
the documents and information underpinning their assessment.
After reviewing the reports from management and consulting 
where necessary with the external auditors the Committee is 
satisfied that the financial statements appropriately address the 
critical judgements and key estimates, both in respect of the 
amounts reported and the disclosures. The Committee is also 
satisfied that the processes used for determining the value of 
the assets and liabilities have been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and are fairly stated.
Fair, balanced and understandable
It is the Board’s responsibility to determine whether the 2015 
Annual Report and financial statements are fair, balanced 
and understandable. The Committee’s role in that process 
is covered on page 50.
Internal controls and risk management
The Audit Committee supports the Board’s assessment of 
principal risks and the Board’s review of the Group’s internal 
financial controls, as well as the internal controls and risk 
management processes.
Internal audit 
The Group has a focused internal audit function which performs 
a rolling programme of key control reviews. The Committee 
acknowledges the importance of an effective internal audit function 
and has commissioned RSM UK Group LLP to undertake a 
“health-check” of the Group’s current Internal Audit arrangements 
and the wider control environment. A report on the findings is 
expected to be received in May 2016 and the Committee will 
act upon those recommendations as it considers appropriate.
Reported to the Board on how the Committee had discharged its 
responsibilities, which included:
 • Significant risk areas considered:
 – Appropriate treatment of customer rebates linked to 
revenue recognition 
The Group has a number of contracts with its customers 
containing volume rebate clauses based on revenue earned in 
the period. Given the material nature of the Group’s rebates, the 
Committee requested that management review its accounting 
practices in this area which confirmed the nature of the basis 
of the calculation (with reference to contractual agreements) 
and the controls in place to record the rebate and settle in 
cash, and input from the external auditor, the Committee was 
satisfied that accounting balances at 31 December 2015 were 
appropriately recorded.
 – Pension accounting 
The Group has a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK and 
post-retirement obligations in its US operations. Judgement is 
taken by management around the assumptions used, including 
the impact of sensitivities to these assumptions, by its actuary to 
calculate the pension scheme assets and liabilities under IAS 19(R). 
The Committee considered the basis of the actuarial calculation 
and the assumptions used. In the UK scheme, an actuarial surplus 
has been restricted to £0.3 million based on the application of 
accounting guidance. Management presented a paper to the 
Committee setting out the basis of its treatment in this area and 
wider pension accounting judgements and the Committee agreed 
with the conclusions reached by management. The Committee 
also agreed the recording of the £8.0 million liability in respect 
of the US pension.
 – Acquisition accounting 
The significant business combination that occurred during 
February 2015 required complex accounting and disclosure 
within the financial statements. The Committee considered the 
appropriateness of the judgements taken by management in 
arriving at the Group’s acquired fair value balance sheet. The 
Committee considered the independent valuations received by 
management in support of the assets and liabilities recognised, 
together with management’s own assessments, and received 
input from the external auditor as to the adequacy of the 
resulting accounting and related disclosures. The Committee 
agreed with the judgements reached by management.
 • Ot her key areas of consideration:
 – Carrying value of non-current assets 
The Group holds significant asset values in the form of mineral 
reserves, land and buildings, and property, plant and equipment. 
The Committee considered the processes adopted by 
management in assessing whether, in their judgement, any 
indicators of impairment existed. The Committee reviewed 
management’s conclusions in this area and concurred with 
management’s judgement that no indicators of impairment 
existed at the balance sheet date and, as such, no detailed 
impairment testing was required.
 – Provisions and contingencies 
The Group holds a number of provisions and contingent 
liabilities as at the period end date. The Committee reviewed 
the judgements made by management in this area, and 
agreed that the proposed quantum of the provisions was 
appropriate and that contingent liabilities had been 
suitably disclosed.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
The external audit, review of its effectiveness, non-audit 
services and auditor reappointment 
The Committee advises the Board on the appointment of the 
external auditors and their effectiveness, independence and 
objectivity, and discusses the nature and results of the audit 
with the external auditors. As part of the review of the effectiveness 
of the external audit process, a formal evaluation process 
incorporating views from the Committee and relevant members of 
management will be considered by the Committee and feedback 
will be provided to the external auditors. These reviews 
are expected to include:
 • the effectiveness of the external audit firm;
 • quality controls;
 • the audit team;
 • audit fee;
 • audit communications and effectiveness;
 • governance and independence;
 • ethical standards; and
 • po tential impairment of independence by non-audit fee income.
The Committee also considers the effectiveness of management 
in the external audit process in respect of the timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgement with input from 
the external auditors as appropriate; and the timely provision of 
the draft half year results announcement and Annual Report 
& Accounts for review by the auditors and the Committee.
Having undertaken its review, in the opinion of the Committee, 
it is content with the relationship it has with the external auditors 
and the Committee is satisfied that they are independent and 
effective. The Committee has, therefore, recommended to the 
Board that Ernst and Young LLP (“EY”) be reappointed as auditor 
at the 2016 Annual General Meeting. There are no contractual 
obligations restricting the Company’s choice of external auditor.
Following the sale by CRH plc, the Group has retained the existing 
external auditors and therefore EY have been the Company’s external 
auditors since it’s incorporation in September 2015. In accordance 
with the recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
CMA order and EU Audit Directive, it is the Group’s intention to 
put the audit out to tender at least once every 10 years.
The Committee has written terms of reference which have 
been published on the Company’s corporate website at 
www.ibstockplc.com/investors and have been summarised within 
this report. In addition, the Committee intends to formalise an 
annual plan in 2016 to address the key areas for review, the reports 
from which will highlight to the Board any required developments 
in its risk management systems.
In addition to the review of the formal management letter from the 
external auditors which outlines how points raised by them have 
been addressed by management, feedback is sought from the 
external auditors on the conduct of members of the finance team 
during the audit process. In addition, I have met with the lead 
audit partner outside the formal Committee process and will 
do so during the year on a regular basis. 
The external auditors are responsible for the annual statutory 
audits of the Group’s subsidiaries and other services which the 
Committee believe they are best placed to provide.
EY provided reporting accountant services in relation to the IPO. 
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor are set in 
Note 5 to the financial statements. Since Admission the auditors 
have not undertaken any new assignments outside the scope of 
the statutory audit. EY has provided tax compliance services in 
respect of the US business, which will cease in 2016. With this 
exception, and in line with good practice, EY does not provide 
taxation services for the Group. Such services are currently 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Following the IPO, a non-audit services policy has been developed 
to clearly set out the non-audit services that may be provided by 
the external auditor. Under the policy, prior approval is required by 
the Committee for any non-statutory assignments where the fee 
would exceed £100,000, or where such an assignment would take 
the cumulative total of non-audit fees paid to the external auditors 
over 70% of that year’s statutory audit fees. However, when 
appropriate, a detailed calculation will be performed to ensure that 
the Group is compliant with the European Union’s New Statutory 
Audit Framework, which applies to financial years beginning on 
or after 17 June 2016.
Fraud, whistleblowing and the Bribery Act
The Committee monitors any reported incidents under its 
whistleblowing policy. This policy is included in the Employee 
Handbook and sets out the procedure for employees to raise 
legitimate concerns about any wrongdoing in financial reporting 
or other matters such as:
 • something that could be unlawful;
 • a mi scarriage of justice;
 • a da nger to the health and safety of any individual;
 • da mage to the environment; or
 • improper conduct.
There were no concerns notified to the Group that required the 
attention of the Committee during the period under review and up 
to the date of this report. The Committee also reviews the Group’s 
procedure for detecting fraud and the systems and controls in 
place to prevent a breach of anti-bribery legislation. The Group 
is committed to a zero-tolerance position with regard to bribery. 
Anti-bribery guidance and training is provided to certain employees 
applying what the Group has determined to be a risk-based and 
proportionate approach. The Group maintains a record of all 
employees who have received this guidance and training.
The Committee considers that it has acted in accordance with 
its Terms of Reference and has ensured the independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness of the external and internal auditors. 
The Company has complied since Admission up to the date of 
this report with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services 
for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of 
Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee 
Responsibilities Order 2014).

Our core principles of remuneration
 • To e nsure senior executives are attracted, retained and 
motivated to drive the next stage of development in the 
Company post-IPO; 
 • To i ncentivise the management team in extending the 
Company’s position in the building products industry; and
 • To deliver long-term sustainable growth.
Company highlights for the 2015 financial period
2015 was a transitional year for the Group as a result of the 
public listing of the Company on 27 October. Extensive work 
was undertaken by the senior management team in preparation 
for the IPO to ensure its success. 
Throughout the transition and post IPO, the CEO, the CFO and 
the senior management team have continued to drive the Group’s 
strategy to extend its position in the building products industry and 
to be its customers’ partner of choice by providing consistent high 
quality, reliable and innovative products with a constant focus on 
strong customer service and value. 
The effectiveness of the senior management team in implementing 
this strategy has been substantiated in the level of satisfaction of 
the Company’s KPIs. A number of the Company’s KPIs (Adjusted 
EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow) and operational goals 
were reflected in the bonus targets for 2015. Full details of the 
strategy and KPIs are contained on pages 22 to 25. For 2015 
maximum bonuses were earned by the Executive Directors.
Remuneration Committee decisions and activity 
following the IPO
The Group’s Remuneration Policies and practices were reviewed 
extensively in preparation for the IPO to ensure appropriate 
remuneration arrangements were in place to support Company 
strategy following the listing of the Company.
The Remuneration Policies and practices that were outlined in the 
prospectus at the time of the Company’s listing in October 2015 
have been largely maintained. However, we have taken the 
opportunity to review all the key components of remuneration 
since the IPO to ensure that the proposed Remuneration Policy is 
fit-for-purpose as a listed Company and aligns with the Company’s 
strategic objectives and shareholder expectations. 
In addition, we have undertaken the following activity as a 
Remuneration Committee:
 • determined the Committee’s Terms of Reference;
 • fo rmulated the Company’s Remuneration Policy as a listed 
company; and
 • completed the Company’s first Remuneration Report as a 
listed company.
We shared our Policy with our top shareholders and the main 
shareholder bodies in March prior to its formal publication. 
It was a valuable opportunity to receive feedback on our 
Remuneration Policy.
Dear Shareholder,
As the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to 
present the report of the Board covering the Remuneration Policy 
(the “Policy”) and practice for the first time as a listed company. 
Work on the Policy was started following the initial share offering 
on 27 October 2015. In February of 2016, I was appointed to the 
Board and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. Tracey 
Graham was also appointed to the Committee in February. Since 
then, the Committee has reviewed and built on the remuneration 
work done by the Board in the lead up to the IPO and published in 
the prospectus. Having been a member at the time of Admission, 
Mr Sheppard stepped down from the Committee in February. 
Our goal is to have a Remuneration Policy which supports the 
Group’s goals to extend its position in the building products 
industry and to deliver long-term sustainable growth. In our new 
Remuneration Policy, we are striving to incentivise and motivate the 
leadership team to implement the Company’s strategic goals and 
to also ensure they are aligned with shareholder expectations. This 
has guided our thinking and actions in our work. This report lays 
out the core principles of our Remuneration Policy and our practice 
over the past year. In our Policy description we have worked to 
provide the transparency and clarity to enable our shareholders 
to understand the intent of our remuneration.

Two resolutions will be put to shareholders at the AGM.
We will first seek approval for the Remuneration Policy 
Report (Part A: pages 61 to 73). This outlines the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors effective from the 
2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The vote is binding on the 
Remuneration Committee and has a duration of up to three years.
The second is seeking approval for the Annual Report on 
Remuneration (Part B: pages 74 to 78). It details decisions and 
actions taken by the Committee based on the performance of the 
Company and remuneration consequences. This section of the 
report is subject to an annual advisory vote.
Our goal has been to be thoughtful and clear in the layout of 
both parts of the report and I look forward to your support on both 
resolutions.
I welcome any feedback from the Company’s shareholders.

2016 financial year: 
Our proposed Remuneration Policy for implementation in 2016
On the IPO, the remuneration arrangements for the Group were updated to reflect the Group’s new public status and to align with Group 
strategy as it transitioned into a listed environment as a FTSE 250 company, as outlined in the IPO prospectus.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed and considered the key components of remuneration since the IPO to ensure that the 
proposed Remuneration Policy is fit-for-purpose and aligned with the expectations of a listed Company.
Our proposed Remuneration Policy (summarised below) has been designed to align remuneration of our Executive Directors with Group 
strategy and to drive continued success within a remuneration framework that meets the shareholder and governance expectations of 
a FTSE 250 company.
       Key elements and time period
Overview of Remuneration Policy for 2016 Year +1 +2 +3 +4 +5
Base salary
For 2016 base salaries for the CEO and CFO will be £425,000 
and £290,000 respectively. The Executive Directors’ Service 
Agreements specify that a base salary review will take place 
with effect from 1 January 2016 and each anniversary 
thereafter. Both Executive Directors declined a January 2016 
review and any further review until 1 January 2017.
Pension
The maximum contribution into the defined contribution plan 
or a salary supplement in lieu of pension will be 20% of gross 
basic salary.
Benefits
Standard benefits will be provided. See Remuneration Policy 
for further details.
Annual and 
Deferred Bonus 
Plan (“ABP”)
Cash

The Committee can determine the proportion of the bonus 
earned under the ABP provided as an award of deferred 
shares.
For 2016 the maximum bonus opportunity will be 125% of 
salary for the CEO and CFO. 
The performance conditions and their weightings for the 
2016 annual bonus are as follows:

• Adjusted Operating Cash Flow (20%);
• ROCE (20%);
• NPS (Net Promotor Score) (10%);
• LTAs (Lost Time Accidents) (10%); and

growth and comparative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) 
assessed over a three-year performance period.
• For the achievement of threshold performance, 25% of 
the element will vest with straight line vesting in between 
to maximum performance.
• In 2016 the maximum annual LTIP award of 100% of 
salary will be awarded to the CEO and CFO.
• The Committee is in the process of determining the targets 
in respect of the above performance conditions for the first 
LTIP grant at the date of this report. The detail of the 
performance targets will be disclosed at the date of grant.
The Committee proposes to implement the policy for the 2016 financial year, subject to shareholder approval at our 2016 AGM. Further 
details of the Remuneration Policy and how our proposed Remuneration Policy aligns to Group strategy is set out in the following section.

Part A – Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Introduction
In accordance with the remuneration reporting regulations, the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) as set out below will become 
formally effective at the AGM on 26 May 2016 on the basis of shareholder approval and will apply for the period of three years from the 
date of approval.
The Company’s core principles of remuneration are:
 • to e nsure top executives are attracted, retained and motivated to drive the Company in its next stage of development post-IPO; 
 • to i ncentivise management in extending the Company’s position in the building products industry; and
 • to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
The Committee will review annually all elements of the remuneration including the base salary, annual bonus levels, proportion of bonus 
to be deferred in shares and the annual and long-term incentive performance conditions for the Executive Directors and the selected 
members of the senior management team drawing on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking 
into consideration:
 • our business strategy;
 • ov erall Ibstock performance; 
 • market conditions;
 • vi ews of key stakeholders of the business;
 • corporate governance considerations; and
 • changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
Our Remuneration Policy and its link to our Group strategy
The Group’s strategy is laid out on pages 22 to 23. 
Ensuring the alignment of the proposed Remuneration Policy to the Company strategy was key for the Remuneration Committee in 
developing the proposed Policy below. The key elements of the Company’s strategy and how its successful implementation is linked 
to the Company’s remuneration are set out in the following table.

Element of 
remuneration
How it supports the Company’s short 
and long-term strategic objectives Operation Maximum opportunity 
Base salary Provides a base level of remuneration 
to support recruitment and retention of 
Executive Directors with the necessary 
experience and expertise to deliver the 
Group’s strategy.
An Executive Director’s base salary 
is set on appointment and reviewed 
annually or when there is a change 
in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level 
of salary, the Committee considers:
 • remuneration practices within 
the Group;
 • th e general performance of 
the Group;
 • sa laries within the ranges paid by 
the companies in the comparator 
group used for remuneration 
benchmarking;
 • an y change in scope, role and 
responsibilities; and
 • the economic environment.
Individuals who are recruited or 
promoted to the Board may, on 
occasion, have their salaries set 
below the targeted policy level until 
they become established in their role. 
In such cases subsequent increases 
in salary may be higher than the 
general rises for employees until 
the target positioning is achieved.
The Committee ensures that 
maximum salary levels are 
positioned in line with companies 
of a similar size to Ibstock, validated 
against companies operating in a 
similar sector.
The companies in the comparator 
group are organisations in the FTSE 
250 excluding financial services, real 
estate and equity investment trusts.
The Committee intends to review the 
comparator groups each year and 
may add or remove companies from 
the group as it considers appropriate. 
Any changes to the comparator 
group will be in the section headed 
Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy, in the following financial year.
In general, salary increases for 
Executive Directors will be in line 
with the increase for employees.
The Company will set out in the 
section headed Implementation of 
Remuneration Policy, in the following 
financial year, the salaries for that 
year for each of the Executive 
Directors (see page 60).
Benefits Provides a benefits package in line 
with practice relative to its comparator 
group to enable the Company to 
recruit and retain Executive Directors 
with the experience and expertise to 
deliver the Group’s strategy.
The Executive Directors receive a 
company car or car allowance, private 
health cover, death in service cover 
and income protection.
The Committee recognises the need 
to maintain suitable flexibility in the 
benefits provided to ensure it is able to 
support the objective of attracting and 
retaining personnel in order to deliver 
the Group strategy. Additional benefits 
may therefore be offered such as 
relocation allowances on recruitment.
The maximum will be set at the cost 
of providing the benefits described.
See description of benefits in the 
previous column.

Pensions Provides a pension provision in line 
with practice relative to its comparator 
group to enable the Company to 
recruit and retain Executive Directors 
with the experience and expertise to 
deliver the Group’s strategy.
The Company operates a defined 
benefit (DB) pension scheme, which is 
closed to new members and a defined 
contribution (DC) scheme in the UK. 
Where the Executive Director is in 
the DB scheme, they are entitled to 
receive, in addition, annually a cash 
lump sum payment equal to 20% of 
the difference between the pensions 
earnings cap and actual salary. 
In the event that any Executive Director 
ceases to be a member of the Ibstock 
Pension Scheme (defined benefit 
scheme) they will be entitled to receive 
a maximum employer contribution into 
the defined contribution scheme or a 
salary supplement in lieu of pension 
of 20% of his basic salary per annum.
The maximum contribution into the 
defined contribution plan or a salary 
supplement in lieu of pension will be 
20% of gross basic salary.
The Company will set out in the 
section headed Implementation 
of Remuneration Policy, in the 
following financial year the pension 
contributions for that year for 
each of the Executive Directors 
(see pages 60 and 75).

Annual and 
Deferred 
Bonus Plan 
(“ABP”)
The ABP provides a 
significant incentive to the 
Executive Directors linked 
to achievement in delivering 
goals that are closely aligned 
with the Company’s strategy 
and the creation of value 
for shareholders.
In particular, the ABP 
supports the Company’s 
objectives allowing the 
setting of annual targets 
based on the businesses’ 
strategy at the time, 
meaning that a wider range 
of performance metrics can 
be used that are relevant 
and achievable.
The Committee has 
discretion to defer part of 
the annual bonus earned in 
shares under the ABP. The 
advantage of deferral is:
 • increased alignment 
between Executives 
and shareholders created 
through deferral and 
the increased equity 
stake of management 
in the Company; and
 • am ounts deferred in 
shares are subject to 
a Director’s continuing 
employment, which 
provides an effective 
lock-in.
The maximum bonus (including 
any part of the bonus deferred 
into an ABP Award) deliverable 
under the ABP will not exceed 
125% of a participant’s annual 
base salary.
The Board will determine 
the bonus to be delivered 
following the end of the 
relevant financial year.
The Company will set out in the 
section headed Implementation 
of Remuneration Policy, in the 
following financial year, the 
nature of the targets and their 
weighting for each year (see 
page 60).
Details of the performance 
conditions, targets and their 
level of satisfaction for the year 
being reported on will be set 
out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. 
The Committee can determine 
that part of the bonus earned 
under the ABP is provided as 
an award of deferred shares.
The maximum value of 
deferred shares is 50% 
of the bonus earned.
The main terms of these 
awards are:
 • minimum deferral period 
of three years, during which 
no performance conditions 
will apply; and
 • th e participant’s continued 
employment at the end of 
the deferral period.
The Committee may award 
dividend equivalents on those 
shares to plan participants to 
the extent that they vest.
The Committee has 
the discretion to apply a 
holding period of two years 
post-vesting for deferred 
bonus shares.
Percentage of bonus 
maximum earned for 
levels of performance:
 • Threshold: 0%
 • On-target: 50%
 • Maximum: 100%
The annual bonus will 
be paid in cash and 
deferred shares.
An award under the ABP is 
subject to satisfying financial 
and strategic/operational 
performance/personal 
performance conditions and 
targets measured over a 
period of one financial year.
A minimum of 50% of the 
targets shall be financial. 
The Board will determine 
the bonus to be delivered 
following the end of the 
relevant financial year.
The Committee is of the opinion 
that given the commercial 
sensitivity arising in relation to 
the detailed financial targets 
used for the annual bonus, 
disclosing precise targets for 
the ABP in advance would not 
be in shareholder interests. 
Actual targets, performance 
achieved and awards made 
will be published at the end of 
the performance periods so 
shareholders can fully assess 
the basis for any pay-outs 
under the annual bonus.
In exceptional circumstances 
the Committee retains the 
discretion to:
 • change the performance 
measures and targets and 
the weighting attached to the 
performance measures and 
targets part-way through a 
performance year if there is a 
significant and material event 
which causes the Committee 
to believe the original 
measures, weightings 
and targets are no longer 
appropriate; and
 • ma ke downward or upward 
movements to the amount 
of bonus earned resulting 
from the application of the 
performance measures, 
if the Committee believe 
that the bonus outcomes 
are not a fair and accurate 
reflection of business 
performance.
Any adjustments or 
discretion applied by the 
Committee will be fully 
disclosed in the following 
year’s Remuneration Report.
The ABP contains clawback 
and malus provisions.

Long-Term 
Incentive 
Plan
(“LTIP”)
The purpose of the LTIP is 
to incentivise and reward 
Executive Directors in relation 
to long-term performance 
and achievement of 
Group Strategy. 
This will better align 
Executive Directors’ interests 
with the long-term interests 
of the Group and act as a 
retention mechanism. 
The use of comparative 
TSR measures the success 
of the implementation of 
the Company’s strategy in 
delivering an above market 
level of return.
The use of Adjusted EPS 
ensures Executive Directors 
are focused on long-term 
financial performance to 
ensure this flows through 
to long-term sustainable 
Adjusted EPS growth.
Awards are granted annually to 
Executive Directors in the form 
of a conditional share award, 
nil cost option or restricted 
share award. 
Details of the performance 
conditions for grants made 
in the year will be set out 
in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration and for 
future grants in the section 
headed Implementation of 
Remuneration Policy, in the 
future financial year (see 
page 60).
These will vest at the end of a 
three-year period subject to:
 • th e Executive Director’s 
continued employment at 
the date of vesting; and
 • sa tisfaction of the 
performance conditions.
The Committee may award 
dividend equivalents on awards 
to the extent that these vest.
The Committee has the 
discretion to apply a holding 
period of two years post-
vesting for the LTIP.
Normal maximum 
value of 100% of salary 
p.a. based on the 
market value at the 
date of grant set in 
accordance with the 
rules of the LTIP.
In exceptional 
circumstances the 
Committee may 
grant an award with 
a maximum of 150% 
of salary.
25% of the award 
will vest for threshold 
performance.
100% of the award 
will vest for maximum 
performance. There 
is straight line vesting 
between these points.
The performance conditions 
for the 2016 LTIP awards are 
Adjusted EPS growth and 
comparative TSR.
The Committee may change 
the balance of the measures, 
or use different measures 
for subsequent awards, 
as appropriate.
No material change will 
be made to the type of 
performance conditions without 
prior shareholder consultation.
In exceptional circumstances 
the Committee retains the 
discretion to:
 • vary, substitute or waive the 
performance conditions 
applying to LTIP Awards if the 
Board considers it appropriate 
and that the new performance 
conditions are deemed 
reasonable and are not 
materially less difficult to satisfy 
than the original conditions;
 • make downward or upward 
movements in the vesting of 
the LTIP resulting from the 
application of the performance 
measures if the Committee 
believe that the outcomes are 
not a fair and accurate reflection 
of business performance.
The LTIP contains clawback  
and malus provisions.
Share 
Incentive 
Plan (“SIP”)
The SIP is an all-employee 
share ownership plan 
which has been designed 
to encourage all employees 
to become shareholders in 
the Company and thereby 
align their interests 
with shareholders.
The Company operates a 
SIP in which the Executive 
Directors are eligible to 
participate (which is in line with 
HMRC legislation and is open 
to all eligible staff).
The Executive Directors shall 
be entitled to participate in any 
other all employee arrangement 
implemented by the Company.

The Company in accordance 
with the legislation may 
impose objective conditions 
on participation in the SIP 
for employees.

been designed to enable 
UK employees to acquire

Minimum 
shareholding 
requirement
The Committee has adopted formal shareholding guidelines that will encourage the Executive Directors to build up over 
a five-year period and then subsequently hold a shareholding equivalent to a percentage of base salary. Adherence to 
these guidelines is a condition of continued participation in the equity incentive arrangements. This policy ensures that 
the interests of Executive Directors and those of shareholders are closely aligned. 
The following table sets out the minimum shareholding requirements:

The charts below set out the single figure of each Executive Director based on whether the elements remain “at risk”. For example:
 • pa yment is subject to continuing employment for a period (deferred shares and LTIP awards);
 • pe rformance conditions have still to be satisfied (LTIP awards); or
 • el ements are subject to clawback or malus for a period, over which the Company can recover sums paid or withhold vesting; further 
details of what triggers clawback or malus are set out below.
Figures have been calculated based on on-target performance (fixed elements plus 50% of maximum annual bonus and 50% of the

Malus and clawback
The ABP and the LTIP include best practice malus and clawback provisions.
Malus is the adjustment of unpaid bonus and deferred share awards under the ABP and outstanding LTIP awards as a result of the 
occurrence of one or more circumstances listed below. The adjustment may result in the value being reduced to nil.
Clawback is the recovery of payments or vested awards under the ABP and vested LTIP awards as a result of the occurrence of one or 
more circumstances listed below. Clawback may apply to all or part of a participant’s award and may be effected, among other means, 
by requiring the transfer of shares, payment of cash or reduction of awards or bonuses.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
The circumstances in which malus and clawback could apply are as follows:
 • di scovery of a material misstatement resulting in an adjustment in the audited accounts of the Group or any Group company;
 • th e assessment of any performance condition or condition in respect of an ABP and LTIP Award was based on error, or inaccurate 
or misleading information;
 • th e discovery that any information used to determine the cash payment under the ABP or the number of shares subject to an ABP 
or LTIP Award was based on error, or inaccurate or misleading information;
 • action or conduct of a participant which amounts to fraud or gross misconduct; or 
 • ev ents or the behaviour of a participant have led to the censure of a Group company by a regulatory authority or have had a significant 
detrimental impact on the reputation of any Group company provided that the Board is satisfied that the relevant participant was 
responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to the participant.

Malus Up to the date of payment of a cash bonus To the end of the 3-year deferral period To the end of the 3-year vesting period
Clawback 3 years post the bonus determination n/a 2 years post-vesting
The Committee believes that the rules of the plans provide sufficient powers to enforce malus and clawback where required.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of policy as set out in this report.
The Committee may also exercise operational and administrative discretions under relevant plan rules approved by shareholders as set 
out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to amend policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it 
would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate to seek or await shareholder approval.
It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to Admission will be honoured, even if satisfaction of 
such commitments is made post the Company’s first AGM following Admission and may be inconsistent with policy. 
Recruitment policy
The Company’s principle is that the remuneration of any new recruit will be assessed in line with the same principles as for the Executive 
Directors, as set out in the Remuneration Policy table above. The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it 
considers necessary to secure a preferred candidate with the appropriate calibre and experience needed for the role. In setting the 
remuneration for new recruits, the Committee will have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced 
short-term or long-term incentive payments as well as giving consideration for the appropriateness of any performance measures 
associated with an award.
The Company’s detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new Directors is summarised in the table below:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy
Salary, benefits and pension These will be set in line with the policy for existing Executive Directors.
Annual bonus Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 125% of salary.
LTIP Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing Executive 
Directors and will not exceed 100% of salary in normal circumstances and 150% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances.
Maximum variable 
remuneration
The maximum variable remuneration which may be granted in normal circumstances is 225% 
of salary (275% of salary if the maximum LTIP grant is made).
“Buyout” of incentives 
forfeited on cessation 
of employment
Where the Committee determines that the individual circumstances of recruitment justifies the 
provision of a buyout, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of 
an Executive Director’s previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following:
 • the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the Executive Director’s 
cessation of employment;
 • th e performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of 
them being satisfied; and 
 • an y other terms and conditions having a material effect on their value (“lapsed value”).
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the 
Company’s incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout 
within the terms of the Company’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.

Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there 
would be no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, 
prevailing elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration 
of the person concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the Remuneration Report for the relevant financial year.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new Non-Executive Directors is to apply the policy which applies to 
current Non-Executive Directors.
Payment for loss of office
The Committee will honour Executive Directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses. 
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There 
is no agreement between the Company and its Executive Directors or employees, providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that occurs because of a takeover bid. 
The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing 
legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in 
connection with the termination of an Executive Director’s office or employment.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Statement of considerations of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The Remuneration Policy for all employees is determined in terms of best practice and ensuring that the Company is able to attract and 
retain the best people. This principle is followed in the development of our Policy. 
The remuneration strategy of the Company has been designed to ensure all employees share in its success through performance-related 
remuneration and share ownership. On IPO a number of new remuneration arrangements were introduced; the LTIP for Executive 
Directors and other selected members of the senior management team and a Share Option Plan for selected Senior Managers. Awards 
under both these Plans will provide alignment between senior leaders and our shareholders based on overall corporate performance of 
the business. 
For all employees, the Company has adopted an SAYE Scheme and Share Incentive Plan (with local equivalents in other jurisdictions 
intended). Under the new Plans, all employees will have the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company subject to certain restrictions. 
The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements nor have employees been consulted directly on the Policy. 
In setting the Remuneration Policy for Directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Company are taken into account, 
including any base salary increases awarded. 
The Committee is provided with data on the remuneration structure for management level tiers below the Executive Directors, and uses 
this information to ensure consistency of approach throughout the Company.

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping Remuneration Policy 
and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting the remuneration strategy and the Committee commits 
to consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its Remuneration Policy.
The Committee consulted with the Company’s key shareholders along with the Investment Association (IA) and the Institutional 
Shareholder Services (ISS) on the proposed Policy set out in this report.

Comparison of overall performance and pay
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the Company’s shares since listing compared with the FTSE 250 index. The graph 
shows the Total Shareholder Return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of 
dividend income. 
The Committee considers that the FTSE 250 is the appropriate index because the Company has been a member of this since listing.  
This graph has been calculated in accordance with the Regulations. It should be noted that the Company listed on 27 October 2015  
and therefore only has a listed share price for the period of 27 October 2015 to 31 December 2015.

The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the Chief Executive Officer over the period 26 February 2015 to 31 December 
2015 valued using the methodology applied to the single total figure of remuneration. 
The Committee does not believe that the remuneration payable in its earlier years as a private company bears any comparative value to 
that which will be paid post-IPO, therefore the Remuneration Committee has chosen to disclose remuneration only for the 2015 financial 
period. In the 2016 Remuneration Report comparative information will be provided.

consults with key shareholders in respect of Remuneration Policy 
and the introduction of new incentive arrangements. 
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the 
Company’s website, www.ibstockplc.com/investors, and from the 
Company Secretary at the registered office. 
Our main responsibilities are: 
 • To d etermine and agree with the Board the broad Remuneration 
Policy for the Executive Directors and other selected members 
of the senior management team;
 • To review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the 
Remuneration Policy; and
 • To review any major changes in employee benefit structures 
throughout the Company or Group and to administer all aspects 
of any share scheme.
The Committee receives assistance from the Group HR Director 
and Company Secretary, who will attend meetings by invitation, 
except when issues relating to their own remuneration are being 
discussed. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
attend by invitation on occasions. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
Following a selection process carried out by the Board prior to 
the IPO of the Company, the Committee has engaged the services 
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) as independent 
remuneration adviser.
During the financial period, PwC advised the Committee on all 
aspects of the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and 
selected members of the senior management team. PwC also 
provided the Company with tax and accountancy advice during 
the period, including support of the IPO. The Committee is 
satisfied that no conflict of interest exists or existed in the 
provision of these services.
PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure 
objective and independent advice is given to remuneration 
committees. Fixed fees of £12,000 (2014: none) were provided to 
PwC during the period in respect of remuneration advice received.
Statement of voting at general meeting 
The 2016 AGM will be the first AGM of the Company and 
therefore there is no historic voting information.

Significant agreements (change of control)
The Company is required to disclose any significant agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid.
The Company has committed debt facilities all of which are 
directly or indirectly subject to change of control provisions, 
albeit the facilities do not necessarily require mandatory 
prepayment on a change of control.
In the event of a takeover or other change of control (usually 
excluding an internal reorganisation), outstanding awards under 
the Group’s share plans vest and become exercisable, to the 
extent any performance conditions (if applicable) have been met, 
and subject to time pro-rating (if applicable), in accordance with 
the rules of the plans. In certain circumstances, the Board may 
decide (with the agreement of the acquiring company) that awards 
will instead be cancelled in exchange for equivalent awards over 
shares in the acquiring company.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 36 to 37. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Directors’ Report on pages 79 to 80. 
In addition, Note 21 to the financial statements includes the 
Company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its 
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and 
has reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result 
it believes its trading performance will demonstrate continued 
improvement in the coming periods, and that liquidity will 
remain strong.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for a period of 
at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements. The Board has concluded that the going concern 
basis of accounting of its financial statements is appropriate.

Our assessment of risk of material misstatement 
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express 
any opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition 
(£358.3m stated net of 
rebates for the period) and 
accounting for customer 
rebates
Refer to the Audit Committee 
Report (page 53); Accounting 
policies Note 1; and Note 3 
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
Revenue recognition is a 
significant audit risk across 
all entities within the Group. 
Specifically there is a risk 
of inappropriate revenue 
recognition if revenue is 
recorded within the wrong 
accounting period, if bill and 
hold transactions (Glen-Gery 
only) are recognised 
prematurely or if 
customer rebates are 
incorrectly recorded.
We identified and assessed key controls over the revenue process (i.e., 
that deliveries are recorded as revenue which are then collected into cash) 
for Ibstock Brick, Forticrete and Glen-Gery and concluded the controls to 
be effective. We relied on these controls in our audit approach. We walked 
through the controls at Supreme to confirm they were designed and 
operating effectively although we undertook a substantive audit as this 
approach was deemed to be more efficient.
We substantively tested revenue throughout the period by selecting a sample 
of transactions, including bill and hold transactions at Glen-Gery to ensure 
they met the IFRS revenue recognition criteria, and traced them to source 
documentation to ensure they were appropriately recorded.
We inspected the financial impact of transactions around the period end and 
tested a sample of these to ensure they were recorded in the correct period.
We set expectations of revenue recorded for the period by assessing 
market expectations (e.g., by using data from the UK Construction Products 
Association), the budgets of the trading entities and other factors such as 
contracted changes in sales price and customer rebate agreements in the 
period. We investigated and corroborated any variances from our expectations.
We selected a sample of customer rebate contracts for significant customers, 
inspected the terms, confirmed the sales data on which the rebate is based 
and recalculated the rebate.
To assess the completeness of rebates, we considered aged debtors, post 
period end credit notes and reviewed journal postings recorded for evidence 
of any unrecorded amounts. We also made enquiries of management as to 
the existence of any other rebate arrangements.
We used computer aided audit techniques to review journals for the period to 
identify for any manual journals resulting in an inappropriate posting to revenue. 
We reviewed significant manual journals for movements in revenue and rebates 
around the acquisition date and period end.
Our audit procedures 
did not identify any 
differences regarding 
revenue recognition or 
accounting for rebates.
Our journals testing did 
not identify any manual 
adjustments to revenue 
or inappropriate 
adjustments to rebates. 
Accounting for pension 
liabilities (£550.5m as at 
31 December 2015)
Refer to the Audit Committee 
Report (page 53); Accounting 
policies Note 1; and Note 19 
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
As at the period end, the Ibstock 
Defined Benefit Pension Scheme 
had a net surplus of £8.4m 
(restricted to £0.3m) with assets 
of £558.9m offset by liabilities of 
£550.5m. The liability component 
is sensitive to small movements 
in the input parameter 
assumptions which could 
materially change the valuation. 
We evaluated the output of the actuary used by management by giving due 
consideration to their competence, experience and independence. 
We involved our pension advisory experts to assist us in evaluating the validity 
of the input assumptions including in respect of the discount rate, inflation rate 
and mortality assumptions. The assumptions have been assessed with respect 
to appropriateness of methodologies, market data and consistency with 
actuarial practice, scheme profile and market developments.
Our analysis produced a ‘heat map’ of the various assumptions benchmarked 
against market data which we used to evaluate whether the assumptions were 
within an acceptable range.
We checked participant data to underlying information sources such as the 
payroll system.
We tested the calculation of the recoverable surplus, as prepared by the 
actuary (management’s expert) in accordance with IFRIC 14, by independently 
modelling the calculation including corroborating the data inputs. 
The actuarial 
assumptions used in 
the valuation of the 
period end liabilities are 
considered to be within 
an acceptable range. 
The valuation 
of pension scheme 
liabilities and related 
disclosures (including 
sensitivities) are 
appropriate.
The surplus 
recognised is 
calculated in 
accordance 
with IFRIC 14.

Risk Our response to the risk
What we concluded to 
the Audit Committee
Acquisition accounting
Refer to the Audit Committee 
Report (page 53); Accounting 
policies Note 1; and Note 24 
of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements.
During the period a significant 
business combination occurred 
with the acquisition of the 
trading entities prior to the 
Group’s initial public offering 
(‘IPO’). The fair values of assets 
and liabilities acquired were 
assessed by management as 
provisional at the time of the 
IPO in October 2015. 
For the period ended 
31 December 2015 these 
have been finalised, resulting 
in negative goodwill of £124.2m 
credited to the income 
statement on acquisition 
(26 February 2015). Due to the 
size and nature of the business 
combination, we consider 
acquisition accounting to be 
an area with a higher risk of 
misstatement. 
In conjunction with our valuation experts we performed an assessment of 
the fair value of assets and liabilities identified at acquisition. We discussed 
the approach to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities with 
management (and their experts) to understand and corroborate their rationale 
for estimates and judgements used in the calculations. We performed 
sensitivity testing on these inputs. We ensured the methodology used by 
management was in line with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Where management sought to rely on external expert opinions for the fair value 
recorded we assessed the competence, methodology and independence of 
the experts and understood how the reports have been used by management 
in finalising the balances recorded.
We corroborated key inputs into the recording of the fair value of intangible 
assets and property, plant and equipment (e.g., rate of return factors, growth 
rates, discount rate) and provisions and contingencies (e.g., likelihood of 
occurrence of claims and timing and magnitude of provisions).
Where assets and liabilities acquired have been recorded at existing book 
value, we considered management’s process to ensure the original carrying 
value is equal to fair value. 
We discussed with management the changes recorded as part of finalising 
the fair values and corroborated the assumptions used in determining the 
revised fair values.
We evaluated the disclosure of the business combination and of the 
exceptional costs to ensure the presentation is in accordance with IFRS and, 
in respect of exceptional items, whether it followed the guidance provided by 
the FRC. 
We concur with the 
fair values recorded 
including the 
adjustments 
processed to the 
provisional amounts 
recorded in the IPO 
prospectus. We are 
satisfied that these 
updated amounts 
appropriately reflect 
the existence and 
valuation of liabilities 
at the acquisition date.
The disclosures 
in relation to the 
acquisition accounting 
in the consolidated 
financial statements 
are appropriate.
The scope of our audit 
Tailoring the scope
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for 
each entity within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take 
into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide controls and changes in the business 
environment when assessing the level of work to be performed at each entity.
The Group operates from four trading entities, three in the UK and one in the US. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the 
Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, 
we performed an audit of the complete financial information (‘full scope’) of the Ibstock Brick, Forticrete, Supreme (all located in the UK) 
and Glen-Gery (located in the US) trading components. 
We also performed full scope procedures on the Figgs head office entities, comprising various holding companies in the Group structure 
(together the ‘Figgs companies’) because of the acquisition and IPO related transactions recorded in these entities within the period. 
As all components were designated full scope in the current period this provides 100% coverage of the Group’s Revenue, EBITDA before 
exceptional items, Profit before tax and Total assets.
Involvement with component teams 
In establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the 
components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating 
under our instruction. Of the full scope components, audit procedures were performed on Ibstock Brick by the primary team and three 
by component teams, being Forticrete, Supreme and Glen-Gery. We determined the appropriate level of primary team involvement in 
the work of the component team to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group as a whole.
A team planning event was held at which senior audit team members of the primary team and component teams each attended to 
discuss the key risks and audit approach.
As part of the closing audit procedures, the senior statutory auditor visited the component team in the US. This visit involved discussing 
the audit approach with the component team including issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers on risk areas, 
meeting with local management, visiting local manufacturing operations and attending the closing meeting. 
The primary team interacted regularly with each of the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed 
key working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. A member of the primary team attended the 
closing meeting of each of the in scope component audits. 
These procedures together with the additional procedures performed at Group level gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on 
the consolidated financial statements.

Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit 
and in forming our audit opinion.
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the 
economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our 
audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.0 million, which is 2% of EBITDA before exceptional items. EBITDA before exceptional 
items for the period is £102.3m as per Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe this is the most appropriate measure to 
demonstrate the underlying operating and profit performance of the Group. This was the metric used in the marketing material for the IPO 
process and is the metric management use in their presentations to stakeholders.
During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and there was no change in the final materiality from our original 
assessment at planning.
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the 
probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that 
performance materiality was 50% of our planning materiality, being £1.0m. We have set performance materiality at this percentage as 
these are the Group’s first listed accounts under IFRS.
Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. 
In the current period, performance materiality allocated to components was: 
 • Ibstock Brick   £850,000
 •Forticrete  £300,000
 •Supreme  £450,000
 •Glen-Gery  £450,000
 • Figgs companies £200,000
Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £100,000, which is set 
at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 51, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards 
require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone

ISAs (UK and 
Ireland) reporting
We are required to give a statement as to whether we have anything material to add or to 
draw attention to in relation to:

its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the annual report that describe those risks and explain how they are 
being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their 
identification of any material uncertainties to the entity’s ability to continue to do so over

and
• the directors’ explanation in the annual report as to how they have assessed the 
prospects of the entity, over what period they have done so and why they consider that 
period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the entity will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures 
drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have no exceptions

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Authorisation of financial statements
The consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc, which 
has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, for the 
period ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue 
in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 March 
2016. The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board 
by W Sheppard and K Sims.
Ibstock plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in England 
whose shares are publicly traded.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Ibstock plc for the 
period from 28 November 2014 to 31 December 2015 have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and as 
applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006.
Ibstock plc was incorporated on 3 September 2015 to serve as 
a holding company for the purposes of listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. Ibstock plc was admitted to public trading on 
27 October 2015. 
On 26 February 2015, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Figgs Topco 
Limited acquired all of the shares of Ibstock Group Limited and 
Glen-Gery Corporation from CRH plc. Ibstock plc acquired Figgs 
Topco Limited and its subsidiaries in a share for share exchange 
prior to admission to public trading and as a result replaced Figgs 
Topco as the ultimate holding company in the group structure; this 
resulted in no ultimate change in control of the acquired companies. 
Under predecessor accounting, the results of Ibstock plc have been 
adjusted as if the entity had always been merged with Figgs Topco 
Limited, which was the holding company of other subsidiaries prior 
to the introduction of Ibstock plc into the group structure as the 
ultimate holding company. The consolidated financial statements 
of Ibstock plc (‘the Group’) therefore comprise the results of Figgs 
Topco Limited and its subsidiary companies from its incorporation 
on 28 November 2014. This represents the first period of account 
following the incorporation of Ibstock plc, and as such no 
comparative figures are presented.
Its subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. 
The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has 
rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and 
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the 
entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from 
the date that control ceases. Therefore, the financial statements 
include the results of the operating companies which were 
acquired by Figgs Topco Limited on 26 February 2015 (see 
Note 24), from that date.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling 
and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand (£’000) except 
where otherwise indicated. The significant accounting policies are 
set out below.
Basis of consolidation and acquisition accounting
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements 
of Ibstock plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2015. The 
financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting 
period as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies. 
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profit 
and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated 
in full. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group 
obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which 
the Group no longer retains control. Details of all the subsidiaries of the 
Group are given in Note 28.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is 
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
value at acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred 
over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred is less than 
the fair value of the net assets acquired, negative goodwill arises 
and is recognised directly in the income statement.
An estimation of the fair value is made for contingent consideration 
in accordance with IFRS 3 at the time of a business combination. 
Where there is a contractual obligation to settle the liability in cash 
based on events outside the Company’s control this is accounted 
for as a financial liability and subsequent changes to the fair value 
of contingent consideration recognised as a financial liability are 
recognised in the income statement. Otherwise contingent 
consideration is accounted for as a credit to equity within other 
reserves and is not subsequently adjusted.
Acquisition expenses of £9,392,000 have been taken to the 
consolidated income statement during the year and recognised 
in administrative expenses.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
business review on pages 36 to 37 . The financial position of the 
company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the Directors’ Report on pages 79 to 80. In addition, Note 
21 to the financial statements include the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and has 
reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result it believes 
its trading performance will demonstrate continued improvement in 
the coming periods, and that liquidity will remain strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Group and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given 
the continued strong liquidity of the Group, the Board has 
concluded that the going concern basis of accounting of its 
financial statements is appropriate.
In addition, see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on page 35.
IFRS 1 – First time adoption
These consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2015, are the first set of financial statements the 
Group has prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the 
European Union. As Ibstock plc and its subsidiary Figgs Topco 
Limited have not previously prepared financial statements, no 
transition exemptions or exceptions have been applied and no 
reconciliations are presented.

Notes to the  
financial statements 
continued
New standards, amendments and interpretations not 
yet adopted
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 
1 January 2015, and have not been applied in preparing these 
consolidated financial statements. None of these is expected to 
have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 
of the Group, except the following set out below:
IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. 
The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the 
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement 
of financial instruments, including impairment of financial assets and 
hedge accounting. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement 
model and establishes three primary measurement categories for 
financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive 
income (‘OCI’) and fair value through profit and loss (‘P&L ’). The basis 
of classification depends on the entity’s business model and the 
contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments 
in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through 
profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes 
in fair value in OCI with no subsequent reclassification of cumulative 
gains and losses to profit or loss. There is now a new expected credit 
losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in 
IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification 
and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit 
risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge 
effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. 
It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and 
hedging instrument and for the ‘hedged ratio’ to be the same as the 
one management actually use for risk management purposes. 
Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to 
that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Early 
adoption is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group is 
assessing the impact of IFRS 9.
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity’s contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good 
or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard 
is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 
and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. 
The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15. 
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ sets out the principles for the recognition, 
measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both 
parties to a contract, i.e., the customer (‘lessee’) and the supplier 
(‘lessor’). IFRS 16 requires lessees to recognise a lease liability 
reflecting future lease payments and a ‘right of use asset’ for 
virtually all lease contracts. IFRS 16 is effective from 1 January 
2019. A company can choose to apply IFRS 16 before that date 
but only if it also applies IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers’. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 16.
There are no other IFRSs, Annual improvements or IFRIC 
interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected 
to have a material impact on the Group.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. 
The chief operating decision-maker (CODM), who is responsible for 
allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the Executive Directors of the 
Group. The CODM reviews the key profit measure, ‘Adjusted 
EBITDA’ disaggregated by the UK and US based on geographical 
location and the organisational structure of the Group. No 
aggregation of segments has been applied. 
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s 
entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling (£), 
which is the Group’s presentation currency.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations 
(i.e., subsidiaries with a functional currency that is not Sterling) are 
translated into Sterling at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
reporting date and their results are translated at the actual rates 
prevailing at the date of the transactions (or average rates, with a 
reasonable approximation) and the effect of fair value adjustment 
on the assets and liabilities are treated as part of the assets and 
liabilities of a foreign operation. The currency translation differences 
are recorded in the currency translation reserve within other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the currency 
translation reserve.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such 
transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other 
comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying 
net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate 
to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the 
income statement within net finance costs. All other foreign exchange 
gains and losses are presented in the income statement.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are expensed as incurred, except for borrowing 
costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
production of a qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial 
period of time to get ready for its intended use, in which case they are 
capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing 
costs commences when expenditures for the asset and borrowing 
costs are being incurred and the activities to prepare the asset for its 
intended use are in progress. Borrowing costs are capitalised up to 
the date when the project is completed and ready for its intended use.
There were no borrowing costs capitalised during the period.
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at the cost to the Group 
less depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment 
includes directly attributable costs. 
Depreciation is provided on the cost of all other assets (except 
assets in the course of construction and land), so as to write off the 
cost, less residual value, on a straight line basis over the expected 
useful economic life of the assets concerned, as follows:
Asset classification  Useful life
Land    Not depreciated
Freehold buildings   20 – 50 years
Plant, machinery and equipment 5 – 40 years
Mineral reserves    Amortised on a usage basis
IBSTOCK_23_Notes_1_to_9_DRF2.indd   92 12/04/2016   12:56 IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 93
OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for mineral 
deposits with economic potential and is not capitalised. Evaluation 
expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other 
projects that have been identified as having economic potential and 
in obtaining permissions to extract clay. Capitalisation of evaluation 
expenditure within ‘Mineral reserves’ commences when there is a 
high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project 
is commercially viable, i.e, the project will provide a satisfactory return 
relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable 
that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Mineral reserves may be declared for an undeveloped project 
before its commercial viability has been fully determined. 
Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period 
between declaration of reserves and approval to extract clay as 
further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case 
to maximise the project’s returns.
The carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure are 
reviewed for impairment by management. Mineral reserves are 
amortised on a usage basis.
Useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date and revised where expectations are significantly different from 
previous estimates. In such cases, the depreciation charge for 
current and future periods is adjusted accordingly. 
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets
Separately acquired brands and non-contractual customer 
relationships are shown at historical cost. Brands and customer 
relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the 
straight line method to allocate the cost of brands and customer 
relationships over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Asset classification  Useful life
Brands    10 – 50 years
Customer relationships  10 – 20 years
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis 
of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific 
software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful 
lives of three to five years. 
For further details see Note 11.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation such as 
brands and non-contractual customer relationships and property, 
plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the 
amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an 
asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. For the 
purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the 
lowest levels for which there are largely independent cash inflows 
(cash-generating units). Prior impairments of non-financial assets 
(other than goodwill) are reviewed for possible reversal at each 
reporting date.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its 
present location and condition. Raw materials, consumables and 
goods for resale are recognised on an average cost basis, while 
work in progress and finished goods are held at direct cost and an 
appropriate proportion of production overheads. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Financial assets
Classification
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: 
at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables. 
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial 
assets were acquired. Management determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial 
assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this 
category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the 
short term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading 
unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category 
are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 
12 months, otherwise they are classified as non-current.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
They are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 
12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified 
as non-current assets. The Group’s loans and receivables comprise 
‘trade and other receivables’ and ‘cash and cash equivalents’ in the 
balance sheet (Notes 14 and 15, respectively).
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on 
the trade-date – the date on which the Group commits to purchase 
or sell the asset. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction 
costs are expensed in the income statement. Financial assets are 
derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the 
investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group 
has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently 
carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried 
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise 
sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. 
If collection is expected in one year or less, they are classified as 
current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount 
reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable 
right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention 
to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be 
contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal 
course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or 
bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty.
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents includes 
cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and 
bank overdrafts (if any). In the consolidated balance sheets, bank 
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Trade payables 
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that 
have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if 
payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating 
cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as 
non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
IBSTOCK_23_Notes_1_to_9_DRF2.indd   93 12/04/2016   12:56 IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 94
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of directly 
attributable transaction costs incurred. All other costs are expensed 
as incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost; 
any difference between the fair value initially recognised and the 
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the 
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. The 
effective interest method takes into account estimations of future 
cash flows associated with the instrument. Management are 
required to re-assess these estimates at each reporting date and 
where the expectations of the nature and timing of cash flows 
change a one-off adjustment is required to alter the carrying value 
of the instrument in accordance with those new expectations.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has 
an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after the balance sheet date.
Finance cost on borrowings is treated as an expense in the income 
statement, with the exception of interest costs incurred on the 
financing of major projects, which are capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment.
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some 
or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred 
until the draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it 
is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is 
capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and amortised over 
the period of the facility to which it relates.
An exchange of debt instruments with substantially different terms 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a 
substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability 
is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial 
liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Employee benefits 
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including 
both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the 
Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group 
has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions 
if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees 
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior 
periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a 
defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit 
that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one 
or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined 
benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan 
assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The 
present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by 
discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of 
high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency 
in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
continued
Where defined benefit schemes have a surplus, the surplus is not 
recognised if future economic benefits are not available to the entity 
in the form of a reduction in the future contributions or a cash refund.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in 
the income statement in employee benefit expense, except where 
included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined 
benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current 
year, benefit changes curtailments and settlements.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net 
interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of 
plan assets. This cost is included in interest expense in the 
income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience 
adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged 
or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which 
they arise.
A reimbursement asset has been recognised representing an 
indemnity receivable from a former parent undertaking which will 
be directly contributed to the pension scheme. A related liability 
for any additional pension liabilities that may arise as a result of 
the equalisation of pension benefits has been recognised within 
post-employment benefit obligations (see Note 19). 
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
Group recognises contributions payable to defined contribution plans 
in exchange for employee services in employee benefit expense. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; 
and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not 
recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood 
that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by 
considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is 
recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any 
one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. 
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate 
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the 
provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
The restoration provision is to fund future obligations at a number of 
sites that the Group is associated with and where the Group has any 
constructive obligation to restore once it has fully utilised the site. 
Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease basis 
and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely committed 
cash outflow. The restructuring provision covers current and former 
employees who have ceased working on grounds of ill health and is a 
liability payable to their normal retirement date. Other provisions relate 
to provisions for sites used for landfill and for onerous contracts to 
cover the exposure that the Group has for both current property 
leases where the rent being paid is significantly higher than the current 
market rents and also vacant properties. All of these provisions are 
discounted on an annual basis.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Revenue 
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable for 
goods and services supplied by the Group, exclusive of local 
sales tax and trade discounts and after eliminating sales within 
the Group. All of revenue is attributable to the principal activities 
of the Group being the manufacture and sale of concrete 
products, clay facing bricks and associated special shaped 
and fabricated clay products.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, which is usually 
on despatch of goods. For ‘bill and hold’ sales, in which delivery 
is delayed at the buyer’s request but the buyer takes title and 
accepts billing, revenue is recognised when the buyer takes title, 
provided: (a) it is probable that delivery will be made; (b) the item is 
on hand, identified and ready for delivery to the buyer at the time 
the sale is recognised; (c) the buyer specifically acknowledges the 
deferred delivery instructions; and (d) the usual payment terms 
apply. Revenue is not recognised when there is simply an intention 
to acquire or manufacture the goods in time for delivery.
Customer rebates 
Provisions for rebates to customers are based upon the terms of 
individual contracts and are recorded in the same period as the 
related sales as a deduction from revenue. The Group estimates 
the provision for customer rebates based on the terms of each 
agreement at the time the revenue is recognised.
Other income
Other income is attributable to rental income from properties, landfill 
and gas activity. Other expenses represents associated expenses. 
This is not deemed to be a principal activity of the Group.
Research and development
Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, 
except that development expenditure incurred on an individual 
project is carried forward when its future recoverability can 
reasonably be regarded as assured. Any expenditure carried 
forward is amortised in line with the expected future sales from the 
related project. Research and development costs capitalised are 
not material.
Exceptional items
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income 
statement, those material items of income and expense which, 
because of the nature and the expected infrequency of the events 
giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the financial period, so as to assess better trends 
in financial performance. Further detail on exceptional items are 
given within Note 4.
The Directors believe that the adjusted EBITDA and earnings per 
share measures provide useful information for shareholders. 
These measures are consistent with how the underlying business 
performance is measured internally. The adjusted EBITDA is not a 
recognised profit measure under IFRS and may not be directly 
comparable with adjusted profit measures used by other companies. 
The adjustments made to profit are described within Note 4.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and 
deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except for 
tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or recoverable on the 
taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any 
adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts included 
in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not 
recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; 
deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business 
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
The amount of deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date 
and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not subject to discounting.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which 
the temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements, except for deferred tax liabilities where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by 
the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary 
differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates 
and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the 
temporary difference will reverse in the future and there is sufficient 
taxable profit available against which the temporary difference can 
be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities where these have been levied by the same tax authority 
on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within 
the Group where there is an intention to settle the balances on a 
net basis.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of 
ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any 
incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the income 
statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Mandatorily redeemable 
preference shares are classified as liabilities. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options 
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock shareholders are recognised 
in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are approved in general meeting, or when paid in the 
case of an interim dividend.
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (for example 
options or shares) of the Group. The fair value of the employee 
services received in exchange for the grant of the equity 
instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to 
be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the 
instruments granted:
 • including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
 • ex cluding the impact of any service and non-market 
performance vesting conditions (for example, profitability, sales 
growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a 
specified time period); and
 • including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save or holding shares for a 
specific period of time).
IBSTOCK_23_Notes_1_to_9_DRF2.indd   95 12/04/2016   12:56 IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 96
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its 
estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to 
vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service 
conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity. In addition, in some circumstances 
employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and 
therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes 
of recognising the expense during the period between service 
commencement period and grant date.
For the equity-settled share based payment transactions, the fair 
value of the share instruments granted is derived from established 
option pricing models. Further details on share based payments 
are set out in Note 25. 
2. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. 
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. 
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements 
and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
Estimates
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed by 
management on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period 
affected. The areas involving significant risk resulting in a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are as follows:
Residual values and asset lives
Management has applied judgement in selecting the depreciation 
rates applied to depreciate property, plant and equipment, to 
depreciate tangible fixed assets over their useful economic lives. 
Following the acquisition of the operating companies, property, 
plant and equipment values were recognised at fair value and 
useful economic lives assessed at that date. These were derived 
from the operation of comparable equipment. The carrying value 
of property, plant and equipment, and a table showing the useful 
economic lives of these assets is disclosed in Note 12.
Taxation
The Group is subject to tax in the different tax jurisdictions in which 
it operates. During the ordinary course of business, there are 
transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination 
may be uncertain. The calculation of the Group’s total tax charge 
therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement. 
The Group’s tax liabilities are based on estimates of whether additional 
taxes will be due and tax assets are recognised on the basis of 
probable future recoverability. This requires management to exercise 
judgement based on their interpretation of country specific tax laws 
and the likelihood of settlement of tax liabilities or recoverability of tax 
assets. To the extent that the final outcome differs from the estimates 
made, tax adjustments may be required which could have a material 
impact on the Group’s total tax charge and profit for the period in 
which such a determination is made.
Notes to the  
financial statements 
continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and 
the amount has been reliably estimated. Where there are a number 
of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required 
in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations 
as a whole. 
Provisions are established by the Group based on the 
management’s assessment of relevant information and advice 
available at the time of preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Outcomes are uncertain and dependent on future 
events and are reviewed regularly. Where outcomes differ from 
management’s expectations, differences from the amount 
initially provided will impact profit or loss in the period the 
outcome is determined. 
The Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising 
from PP&E dilapidation and restorations, provisions for the 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, product warranties, 
landfill and onerous lease property provisions. Further details 
of specific estimates used in arriving at these provisions are 
provided in Note 17.
Business combinations
When the Group completes a business combination, the fair values 
of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible 
assets and contingent liabilities, are recognised at their fair value. 
The determination of the fair values of acquired assets and 
liabilities is based, to a considerable extent, on management’s 
judgement. In estimating fair value, particularly in relation to 
identifiable intangible assets, management is required to estimate 
the useful economic life of each asset and the future cash flows 
expected to arise from each asset and to apply a suitable discount 
rate. The carrying value of intangible assets is disclosed in Note 11.
Additionally, management has made judgements and estimations 
in relation to the expected ultimate payments which will occur, and 
their timings, in respect of contingent consideration and liabilities 
arising on the business combination in the period. Contingent 
consideration and related assumptions are disclosed in Note 24. 
Mineral reserves
Upon acquisition by Figgs Topco Limited on 26 February 2015, 
mineral reserves were recorded at their fair value. The 
determination of the mineral reserves requires significant 
judgements and estimates to be applied, and these are reviewed 
regularly and updated.
Factors such as the availability of geological and extraction data, 
material performance and both the assessment of compliance with, 
and likelihood of extensions to, planning permissions, all impact 
upon the determination of the Group’s estimates of its mineral 
reserves. Management’s valuations are based on the expected 
future usage of reserves using production data, information from 
in-house geologists and input from external consultants. 
Mineral reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment 
of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the 
consolidated financial statements. Estimates of mineral reserves 
are also used to calculate depreciation charges for the Group’s 
mineral reserves. The impact of changes in minerals is dealt with 
prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the 
asset over the expected future production.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Judgements
Judgements are made by management in the process of applying 
the Group’s accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 
Impairment of intangible and non-current assets 
Determining whether intangible and other non-current assets 
are impaired requires judgement and estimation. The Group 
periodically reviews intangible and non-current assets, for possible 
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in 
management’s judgement, that the carrying amount of an asset 
may not be recoverable. Such indicating events would include 
a significant planned restructuring, a major change in market 
conditions or technology, expectations of future operating 
losses, or negative cash flows. 
The Group did not record any impairment charges during the 
period ended 31 December 2015 as management’s judgement, 
based on a rigorous assessment, was that there were no 
indicators of impairment.
Non-GAAP items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements 
where management believes it is necessary to do so to provide 
further understanding of the financial performance of the Group. 
The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the 
income statement, those material items of income and expense 
which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the 
events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow 
shareholders to understand better elements of financial 
performance in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with 
future periods and to assess trends in financial performance.
Management has considered the materiality, infrequency and 
nature of the cost associated with the Group’s Initial Public Offering 
in October 2015 against the requirements and guidance provided 
by IAS 1, Group accounting policies and recent press releases 
from the FRC. Management judged that classifying the scale and 
nature of the transaction and the related expense as an exceptional 
item in the income statement provides the best guidance as to the 
underlying profitability trends within the Group and to present the 
results of the Group in accordance with the policy above. 
Exceptional items are disclosed in Note 4.
Borrowing costs
During the period ended 31 December 2015, the Group 
raised significant funds during refinancing the Group’s debt. 
In establishing borrowing costs, using the effective interest rate 
method, management is required to exercise judgement over 
the period in which the debt will be utilised and repaid. Currently, 
management considers that debt will be held to maturity and 
transaction costs of raising debt are included in the effective 
interest rate over those periods. The amount of transaction 
costs included in debt are disclosed in Note 7.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group’s accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes 
requires management to make judgements as to the nature of 
benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the 
classification of each scheme. For defined benefit schemes, 
management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions 
about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future 
remuneration changes, employee attrition rates, administration 
costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, life expectancy and 
expected remaining periods of service of employees. 
In relation to the Group’s post-employment obligations in the US, 
management make estimations relating to employee numbers, 
inflation rates, discount rates and future contribution rates.
These assumptions are based on the environment in the respective 
country. The assumptions used may vary from year to year, which 
would affect future net income and net assets. Any differences 
between these assumptions and the actual outcome also affect 
future net income and net assets. In making these estimates and 
assumptions, management considers advice provided by external 
advisers, such as actuaries. These assumptions are subject to 
periodic review. 
In the current period, management made a specific judgement 
in relation to the application of International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee guidance IFRIC 14 and its applicability 
to Ibstock plc. This judgement concerns the Group’s ability to 
recognise the actuarial surplus on the UK defined benefit pension 
scheme. In applying this interpretation, the Group restricted its 
pension surplus as at 31 December 2015 from £8,368,000 to 
£331,000 in recognition of the minimum funding requirements 
after management. Management has recognised the Barber 
equalisation liability of £9,000,000 together with a separate 
reimbursement asset from CRH plc of £9,000,000, which is held 
within trade and other receivables. 
Additionally, management has exercised judgement in the 
treatment of the multi-employer US pension as a defined 
contribution scheme during the current year.
Note 19 describes the assumptions used together with an analysis 
of the sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Deal costs
Deal costs of £5.0m were offset against the share premium 
of £99.5m created on the issue of shares during the period. 
Management has exercised judgement in assessing the allocation 
of deal costs incurred between equity and the current period 
income statement.

Total exceptional items 82,673 
Acquisition costs
Exceptional cost of sales
In accordance with IFRS, the inventory value was uplifted to fair value at the date of the acquisition, and this adjustment increased cost 
of sales in the post-acquisition period. The £15,977,000 cost incurred for the utilisation of the fair value uplift adjustment on inventory is 
considered an exceptional cost of sale as it is a non-cash and non-recurring item. The inventory fair value uplift has fully unwound as at 
31 December 2015.
Transaction costs
Professional fees and other costs directly of £9,392,000 have been classified as exceptional in the current period. These costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition transaction which occurred in February 2015 have been classified as exceptional due to their material 
nature and as they are not expected to recur. 
Retention and compensation payments
Other adjusting items of £986,000 in the period to December 2015 relate to retention bonuses due to key staff members which were 
committed to as part of our acquisition by Bain and the settlement of ‘B’ shares held by management.
IPO costs
Transaction costs
Costs of £12,497,000 have been incurred during the process of our Initial Public Offering. This represents professional fees, management 
fees incurred prior to our listing and other transaction costs. Due to the non-recurring and material nature of such costs, they have been 
classified as exceptional in the current period. 
Compensation and retention payments 
Upon the successful IPO of the Group, senior management were provided with bonuses (£540,000) and share options (£723,000), which 
vested immediately under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) scheme. Since the bonus and cost of the award are fully recognised in the 
period, are not expected to recur and are intrinsically linked to the IPO transaction, they have been treated as exceptional in the current 
period. See Note 25c (i) for further details of the award. All other employee share schemes have been treated as recurring costs. 
Negative goodwill
For further details of how negative goodwill of £124,191,000 was generated on the business combination, see Note 24.
All exceptional items have been settled in cash, other than certain deal costs, share based payments, negative goodwill and the cost of sales 
adjustment that are non-cash in nature due to being items that are either equity settled, or items arising solely from fair value accounting in the 
Group accounts. 
Tax on exceptional items
Apart from the following items, exceptional items are taxable or deductible in full in the current period. 
(i) Negative goodwill of £124,191,000 is non-taxable and therefore does not impact the reported tax credit for the period
(ii)  Acquisition costs of £7,039,000 and IPO transaction costs of £11,769,000 have been treated as non-tax deductible and increase the 
current tax charge by £3,808,000
(iii) A deferred tax asset of £150,000 has been recognised in respect of IPO-related share based payments totalling £723,000.
Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment is non-tax deductible.
Exceptional finance costs detailed in Note 7 are tax deductible in full in the current period.

The shareholder loan notes, preference shares, old bank borrowings and revolving credit facility, each taken out on acquisition of the 
trading group in February 2015, were financial instruments held at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost 
method is based upon expected cash flows of each instrument. 
(i)  The loan notes attracted interest of 12% per annum on the principal plus any unpaid interest. Interest is payable on a quarterly basis. 
The notes are repayable at par on maturity in February 2021 or earlier at the option of the Company. The par value of the shareholder 
loan notes was £51.8m. In October 2015 the shareholder loan note and accrued interest were repaid, the consideration being in the 
form of B preference shares and deferred shares. These newly issued shares were subsequently converted into ordinary and deferred 
shares as part of capital reorganisation that took place immediately prior to the IPO.
  The 43,250,000 £0.001 preference shares bore a 12% annual fixed yield, compounding quarterly on 31 March, 30 June, 
30 September and 31 December. On any redemption of these shares, the Articles of the Company provided that all arrears and 
accruals (if any) of the dividend should be paid. There was no fixed date of repayment; the shares could be redeemed at par at any 
time at the agreement of both the Company and the holder, or the shares are mandatorily redeemable at par on a triggering event, 
including the sale of the business. There was no premium payable on the redemption and the preference shares carried no votes 
at general meetings. In October 2015 the preference shares were converted into ordinary and deferred shares as part of a capital 
reorganisation that took place immediately prior to the IPO.
(ii)  The old revolving credit facility (RCF) provided available funding of £40m until it was repaid and extinguished in October 2015. 
Interest was charged at an annual rate of margin plus LIBOR (floored at 1%); the margin ranged from 2.75% – 3.50% dependent on 
the prevailing earnings of the Group on a rolling 12 months basis. Interest was payable at either one, two, three or six-monthly 
intervals, as appropriate. A commitment fee was payable on the undrawn element of the facility based on 35% of applicable margin. 
In October 2015 the old RCF was repaid.
  The revolving credit facility was repaid and extinguished earlier than previously planned in October 2015 leading to an acceleration of 
transaction costs and an exceptional loss on early settlement of £1,877,000.
(iii)  The bank borrowings are a financial instrument classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and held at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. The amortised cost method is based upon expected cash flows of each instrument. Where the expectations of the 
nature and timing of cash flows change a one-off adjustment is required to adjust the carrying value of the financial instrument to 
reflect actual and revised estimated cash flows.
  The old bank borrowings attracted interest of 8% plus LIBOR (floored at 1%) per annum, payable six monthly. The borrowings were 
repayable at par in February 2021. A voluntary early repayment exit charge of £38,045,000 was levied based on the nature and timing 
of the settlement. The initial drawdown value of the borrowings was £250m in February 2015. 
  On 30 June 2015 management revised the estimated lives and maturity dates for the securitised debt to October 2015 (previously to 
March 2018) after considering plans for an expected refinancing and associated ‘make whole’ premium, resulting in an exceptional 
finance charge. On repayment of this debt in October 2015 this facility was extinguished.
  A new bank borrowing facility was entered into in September 2015 with new lenders and was first drawn in October as disclosed 
in Note 18. This financial instrument is also classified as ‘other financial liabilities’ and held at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
For further details on these facilities, see Note 18.

Negative goodwill arising on acquisition (25,584) (27.01)%
Rate change on deferred tax provision (5,095) (5.38)%
Total taxation expense/(credit) (6,869) (7.25)%
The tax credit for the period includes a deferred tax credit of £738,000 relating to the recognition of US state tax losses acquired as part of the 
business combination. These tax losses were not recognised at the acquisition date due to the historic tax loss position of the US business. 
The US business has reported a taxable profit for the period and is expected to remain profitable in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax 
benefit has been recognised accordingly. 
There are no income tax consequences for the Company in respect of dividends declared prior to the date of authorisation of these financial 
statements and for which a liability has not been recognised. 
The Group expects its effective tax rate in the future to be affected by the geographical mix of profits and the different tax rates that will apply 
to those profits, the use of brought forward tax losses, the outcome of any future tax audits as well as the impact of changes in tax law.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK from 21% to 20% effective from 1 April 2015 was substantively enacted on 2 July 
2013. The further reductions to 19% effective from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015 
and the impact of these tax rate changes are reflected in these financial statements accordingly.

The replacement cost of inventories is not considered to be materially different from the above values.
Inventory values were uplifted to fair value at the date of the acquisition, and the unwind adjustment increased cost of sales in the 
post-acquisition period (see Note 4 for further details). All of the fair value uplift has now unwound.
At 31 December 2015, a provision of £2,670,000 is held against the inventory balance.

been fully utilised. The key estimates associated with calculating the provision relate to the cost per acre to perform the necessary 
remediation work as at the reporting date together with determining the year of retirement. Estimates are updated annually based on 
the total estimated available reserves and the expected extraction rates. Whilst a significant element of the total provision will reverse in 
the medium term (two to 10 years), the majority of the legal and constructive obligations applicable to mineral-bearing land will unwind 
over a 30-year timeframe. In discounting the related obligations, expected future cash outflows have been determined with due regard 
to extraction status and anticipated remaining life.
(ii)  Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Group’s best estimate of the likely 
committed cash outflows.
(iii)  The restructuring provision covers current and former employees who have ceased working on grounds of ill health and is a liability 
payable to their normal retirement date. 
(iv)  Other provisions relate to provisions for the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), product warranties, landfill and onerous 
contracts. The SERP is a defined contribution retirement plan in respect of basic salary entitlements for executive directors. The 
product warranties are based on the estimate of the cost of fulfilling customer warranty claims. The estimate is derived principally from 
historical data appropriately adjusted for specific risk factors. Under the Group’s standard sales terms, the Group repairs or replace 
items that fail to perform satisfactorily for one year from the date of delivery to the customer. It is expected that the most of this 
expenditure will be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date. The landfill provision relates to the restoration of the associated 
sites and environmental remediation required by legislation. The onerous contract provision provides cover for the exposure that the 
Group has for both current property leases where the rent being paid is significantly higher than the current market rents and vacant 
properties at acquisition. 
Amounts arising on acquisition of the trading business include contingent liabilities to reflect present obligations that existed at the date of 
acquisition. This includes certain legal claims in the UK of £1,100,000 which have been included in Other. For further details see Note 24.
The Group holds insurance performance bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company in respect of the Group’s maintenance and 
remediation obligations in respect of sites from which materials are being extracted. The bonds are typically in favour of the Department 
of Environmental Protection within the relevant jurisdictions. At 31 December 2015 the value of the bonds amounted to £1,230,000. 
The maximum term on the bonds outstanding at that date is September 2016. The bonds are typically renewed on an annual basis at 
comparable levels.
Bank of America has provided a letter of credit of £50,000 on behalf of the Group to the National Union Fire Insurance Company. 
This letter of credit renews on an annual basis.

A £240m facilities agreement covering the following financial instruments was entered into as part strategic planning for the Initial Public 
Offering in October 2015:
(i) New bank borrowings
A five-year £200m facility was entered into in September 2015 and first drawn in October with mandatory repayments of £15m due on the 
1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th anniversary dates subject to the Company’s right to elect not to make one of the repayment instalments due during 
the term of the loan. The borrowings attracted interest of between 1.25% and 2.50% depending on leverage ratio (defined as consolidated 
total net debt as a proportion of consolidated EBITDA) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per annum, payable either three or six 
monthly at the option of the Group. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn element of the facility based on 35% of applicable margin.
(ii) New revolving credit facility (‘New RCF’)
A New RCF for £40m over five years was entered into in September 2015. The borrowings attract interest of between 1.25% and 2.50% 
depending on leverage ratio (defined as above) plus LIBOR (or EURIBOR for any loan in Euro) per annum, payable either one, three or six 
monthly at the option of the Company. Throughout the period and as at 31 December 2015 the New RCF was undrawn.
The carrying value of financial liabilities have been assessed as materially in line with their fair values.

The Group participates in the Ibstock Pension Scheme (the ‘Scheme’), a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK. The Scheme has  
four participating employers – Ibstock Brick Limited, Forticrete Limited, Anderton Concrete Products Limited, Figgs Bidco Limited (from 
26 February 2015) and Tyrone Brick Limited (up to 26 February 2015). The Scheme is funded by payment of contributions to a separate 
trustee administered fund. The Scheme is a revalued earnings plan and provides benefits to its members based on their length of 
membership in the Scheme and their average salary over that period.
The Scheme is administered by trustees who employ independent fund managers for the investment of the pension scheme assets. 
These assets are kept entirely separate from those of the Group.
Total annual contributions to the Scheme are based on independent actuarial advice, and are gauged to fund future pension liabilities 
(including projected increases in earnings and pensions) in respect of service up to the balance sheet date. The Scheme is subject to 
independent actuarial valuation at least every three years using the projected unit method.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
The valuation used as at 31 December 2015 has been based on the initial results of the 30 November 2014 valuation.
This Scheme has a surplus that is not fully recognised on the basis that future economic benefits are not unconditionally available to 
the Group in the form of a reduction in the future contributions or a cash refund. 
Given the contribution plan adopted, the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 
£17,368,000 available on a reduction of future contributions is £331,000. As a result the Group has not recognised the full IAS 19 surplus 
on the balance sheet and has restricted the full actuarial surplus by £17,037,000 in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks that are inherent in such plans and arrangements. 
There are, however, no unusual, entity-specific or plan-specific risks, and no significant concentrations of risk. The risks can be 
summarised as follows:
 • asset value volatility, with the associated impact on the assets held in connection with the funding of pension obligations and the 
related cash flows;
 • ch anges in bond yields, with any reduction resulting in an increase in the present value of pension obligations, mitigated by an increase 
in the value of plan assets;
 • ri sk of volatility in inflation rates as pension obligations are generally linked to inflation; and
 • li fe expectancy, as pension benefits are provided for the life of beneficiaries and their dependents.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
The Group continued to contribute 16.0% of pensionable salaries to the Scheme during the period reported. A payment schedule has 
been agreed with the Trustees of the Ibstock Pension Scheme so that the Scheme’s deficit can be eliminated. This includes the Group 
continuing to contribute 16% of pensionable salaries to the Scheme as well as a further £7.0m per annum until May 2021. The weighted 
average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 19 years.
At the 31 December 2015 balance sheet date, a reimbursement asset is recorded which will be directly contributed to the Scheme. Refer 
to Note 14 ‘Trade and other receivables’.
The principal assumptions used by the actuary in his calculations were:
31 December 
2015 
Per annum
Discount rate 3.85%
RPI inflation 3.10%
CPI inflation 2.10%
Rate of increase in salary 3.10%
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60%
  
Mortality assumptions: life expectancy from age 65
For a male currently aged 65 22.9 years
For a female currently aged 65 25.5 years 
For a male currently aged 40 25.3 years
For a female currently aged 40 28.0 years
The post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for expected increases to life expectancy. The life expectancies quoted for members 
currently aged 40 assume that they retire at age 65 (i.e., 25 years after the balance sheet date).
The principal financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation. The discount 
rate is based on the market yields on high-quality corporate bonds of appropriate currency and term to the defined benefit obligations. 
The obligations are primarily in Sterling and have a maturity of some 19 years. If the real discount rate increased/decreased by 0.25%,  
the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by approximately 4%. 
The impact on the defined benefit obligation to changes in the financial and demographic assumptions is shown below:
 
31 December 
2015 
£’000
0.25% increase in discount rate 24,327 
0.25% decrease in discount rate (26,091)
0.25% increase in salary growth rate (16,370)
0.25% decrease in salary growth rate 15,547 
0.25% increase in pension growth rate (19,588)
0.25% decrease in pension growth rate 16,467 
0.25% increase in inflation rate 19,588
0.25% decrease in inflation rate (16,467)
One-year increase in life expectancy (20,130)
One-year decrease in life expectancy 20,159
A special contribution of £60m was paid in the pre-acquisition period. Refer to Note 24 for further details.
(b) Multi-employer scheme
The Group participates in two multi-employer defined benefit pension schemes, being Aluminium, Brick and Glass Workers International 
Union (‘AB&GW’) and National Integrated Group Pension Plan (‘NIGPP’), which are both held in the United States. As the Group is unable 
to identify its share of the assets and liabilities for these schemes as insufficient information is available on which to calculate this split (as 
confirmed with the schemes actuaries), they are accounted for on a defined contribution basis. The charge for the period to December 2015 
is £390,000. The Group is not liable for any other contributing entities within either scheme. For exit from the schemes by the Group at the 
most recent actuarial valuation, it was estimated that the withdrawal liability for the schemes equalled £13,981,000 and £1,281,000 for the 
AB&GW and NIGPP, respectively, although management currently do not have any plans on withdrawing from either scheme. 
The minimum contribution requirements for the AB&GW scheme are based on a minimum monthly charge per active employee, with 
the minimum contribution requirements for the NIGPP scheme being based on a minimum charge per hour worked. The expected 
contributions to the plan for the next annual reporting period, being the year ending December 2016, is £450,000. In respect of the 
AB&GW scheme, based on the total contributions made in 2015 to the multi-employer schemes, the level of participation the Group made 
compared to other participating entities was 86% and the Group has 71% of all members (active, deferred and retired). In respect of the 
NIGPP scheme, based on the proportion of the withdrawal liability against total plan liabilities, the level of participation the Group made 
compared to other participating entities was less than 1%.
IBSTOCK_24_Notes_10_to_21_DRF2.indd   111 12/04/2016   12:55 IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 112
The AB&GW plan has a deficit as at 31 December 2014 of £5,901,000. The contribution rates agreed to be paid by the Group include an 
element of rehabilitation funding with respect to the total plan deficit. For this scheme, the arrangements gives rise to a present obligation 
and as such a liability has been recognised of £8,007,000 (26 February 2015: £7,538,000) for future committed contribution amounts as 
at 31 December 2015, with an associated recognised deferred tax asset of £3,052,000. This has been calculated by discounting the 
future cash flows, which accrete at 7% per annum in line with the rehabilitation funding plan as set by the scheme Trustees, at a rate 
commensurate with the time value of money using a 20-year US treasury rate given the duration of the rehabilitation funding plan runs 
to 2034. This calculation is based on management’s estimated number of employees in future years. The Trustees meet annually to 
reassess the funding contribution increase – this has been set at the 7% rate since 2012. Based on the contribution rates and total 
withdrawal liability for the NIGPP plan, management have determined any present obligation arising from the plan is immaterial.
(c) Defined contribution plan
The Group operates defined contribution schemes under the Ibstock pension scheme, the Supreme Concrete Limited pension scheme, 
the Anderton Concrete pension scheme and the Supreme Concrete Group Personal Plan. Contributions by both employees and Group 
companies are held in externally invested, externally administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no 
further obligations in relation to the scheme. The total cost charged to income in relation to the defined contribution scheme in the period 
was £1,374,000.

All financial assets are classified as loans and receivables.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, credit sales and deposits with banks and is managed on a Group basis. This risk 
arises from transactions with banks, such as those involving cash and cash equivalents and deposits. To reduce the credit risk, the 
Group has concentrated its main activities with a Group of banks that have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, 
individual risk limits are set based on its ﬁnancial position, credit ratings, past experience and other factors. The utilisation of credit limits 
is regularly monitored.
The Group has significant sales contracts with a number of ‘blue-chip’ companies and accordingly the Directors believe there is a limited 
exposure to credit risk, but this is actively monitored at Board level. The Group’s policy on credit risk requires appropriate credit checks 
on potential customers before sales commence.

Market risk
Market risk is defined as the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market 
prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk, being currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk. In the post-IPO period the 
Group’s interest rate risk arises principally from the revolving credit facility and bank borrowings which attract floating rate interest, see Note 
18. The Group manages its interest rate risk by using a floating rate debt with varying repayment terms. The Group also does not trade in 
derivative financial instruments and so is not considered to be exposed to other price risk. The exposure to currency risk is considered low.

The Group has negligible risk to currency fluctuations as the majority of assets and liabilities are held in the same functional currency.
Liquidity risk
The Group has generated sufficient cash from operations to meet its working capital requirements and finance its investing activities. 
The Group manages liquidity risk by entering into committed bank borrowing facilities to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available, 
and monitoring cash flow forecasts to ensure the Group has adequate borrowing facilities.

Fair value hierarchy
IFRS 13 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reflects 
the significance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels:
Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2  Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, 
as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices). 
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).
All of the Group’s fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 2 except for contingent consideration which has been 
categorised as Level 3. There were no transfers between levels during the period.
Financial instruments in Level 3
The Group’s financial instruments that are categorised under Level 3 are contingent consideration and the techniques used to value are 
provided in Note 24.
The following table presents the changes in Level 3 instruments for the period ended 31 December 2015.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital, defined as net funds, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or borrow additional debt.
Following the issue of the new banking facilities in September 2015 the Group must comply with two covenants each quarter from 
30 June 2016. The covenants are certain ratios of interest cover and leverage, which are monitored on a regular basis by the Board. 
At the period end date, management believes significant headroom exists on both covenant conditions.
Immediately prior to and following the Group’s admission to the London Stock Exchange, a capital reorganisation took place. Further 
details are provided in Note 22.

Following the capital reduction, the issued share capital of the Company consists of 405,500,000 ordinary shares of £0.01 each.
23. Reserves
Currency translation reserve
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries.
Other reserves
Other reserves relate to contingent consideration arising on acquisition where there is no contractual obligation to settle the liability in 
cash based on events outside the Group’s control.
Merger reserve
The merger reserve of £369,119,000 arose on the acquisition of Figgs Topco Limited by Ibstock plc and is the difference between the 
share capital and share premium of Figgs Topco Limited and the nominal value of the investment and preference shares in Figgs Topco 
Limited acquired by the Company. Further details are provided in Note 1.
24. Business combinations
On 26 February 2015, Figgs Topco Limited acquired 100% of the voting shares of Ibstock Group Limited and its subsidiaries, and 
Glen-Gery Corporation and its subsidiaries (together ‘the acquired operations’). The entities acquired specialise in the manufacture of clay 
and concrete building products. The acquisition of these entities establishes the Group as a leading building products manufacturer in the 
UK and in the North East and Mid West regions of the US.
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed:
The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired operations as at the date of acquisition were:
Fair value

Customer contracts and relationships 87,600

Property, plant and equipment 349,947

Total identifiable net assets at fair value 502,153 
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition immediately recognised within the income statement (124,191)
Purchase consideration transferred 377,962 
The fair value of the trade and other receivables amounts to £80,408,000, which equates to a net amount of trade receivables. The gross 
amount due under contracts is £80,903,000 of which £495,000 is expected to be uncollectable.
The full analysis of the deferred tax arising on business combination is set out in Note 20.
The consideration paid in association with the purchase of the Ibstock Group of companies was based on a multiple of earnings and not an 
assessment of the fair value of the assets of the business. As there is considerable value associated with intangible assets that only arise in the 
consolidated financial statements, and our tangible assets reflect the current market demand for building products and production capacity, 
the fair value of the acquired net assets are in excess of the consideration paid, and therefore negative goodwill has arisen, which has been 
immediately taken to the income statement. There are no expected taxation consequences in relation to the negative goodwill recognised.
IBSTOCK_25_Notes_22_to_31_DRF2.indd   117 12/04/2016   12:54 IBSTOCK PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2015 118
Provisions and contingent liabilities at fair value of £7,000,000 were recognised at the acquisition date resulting from various legal claims 
in the UK of £1,100,000, UK property risks of £3,300,000 and an environmental claim of £2,600,000 in the US. These fair values were 
provisional pending the receipt of final valuations of the potential liabilities. As at 31 December 2015, a final external valuation of the UK 
property risks has been received and the fair value increased from £3,300,000 to £7,850,000, and an internal valuation exercise identified 
increased US property risks of £151,000. Subsequent to the acquisition date, management has also received external legal advice that 
no liability in relation to the US environmental claim is required – resulting in a reduction in contingent liabilities of £2,600,000. Additionally, 
management identified a £2,151,000 liability in respect of employee compensation previously recognised as a post-acquisition 
exceptional period cost. The related deferred taxation liability uplift of these final fair value adjustments is £210,000. As at the reporting 
date, all other fair values were determined to remain as originally determined at the acquisition date.
Purchase consideration £’000
Initial cash consideration 312,853
Pension contribution 60,000
Contingent land proceeds 1,109
Contingent pension tax benefit 4,000
Total consideration 377,962
As part of the acquisition, the Group agreed to make a one-off contribution of £60,000,000 to the Ibstock Brick Limited pension scheme 
on completion of the transaction. As the transaction was conditional on the contribution being made the payment cannot be separated 
from the business combination and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 3, is treated as part of the acquirer’s consideration paid for the 
business. The post-employment benefit obligation includes this £60,000,000 contribution.
Additionally, in accordance with the Share Sale Agreement (SSA), half of any tax relief, over a contracted amount, received by the 
acquired business as a result of the one-off pension payment, shall be payable to the seller. The fair value of the future obligation was 
estimated at £4,000,000, with a range being nil to £4,000,000.
As part of the purchase agreement with the previous owner of the acquired operations, half of all proceeds above a contracted amount, 
received by the acquired business on the sale of certain land assets in the future, shall be payable to the seller. Sale of land assets is in 
the control of the Group and accordingly is recognised in equity. Contingent consideration was recognised in relation to this, based on 
management’s best estimate of £1,109,000 from an estimated range of nil to £3,800,000.
Transaction costs in relation to the acquisition of £9,392,000 were expensed and are included within administrative expenses.
From the date of acquisition, the acquired operations contributed £358,331,000 of revenue and £96,004,000 to profit before taxation of 
the Group. If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the financial statement period, revenue would have been £438,435,000 
and profit before taxation of the Group would have been £80,383,000. To provide the users of the accounts with a comparable view of 
performance, we have analysed below the performance of the acquired entities from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015. The 
information for this period has been adjusted to include the impact of the fair value exercise and new financing structure as if it had been 
in place since the start of the period. The period ending 31 December 2014 has been included as comparative information, but has not 
been updated for the impact of the fair value exercise or financing structure following the acquisition.

25. Share incentive plans
(a) Old scheme arrangements held by subsidiaries on acquisition
The acquisition of the trading entities of the Group on the 26 February 2015 triggered a modification to certain existing share incentive 
plans. The schemes in place became cash settled on acquisition and the respective liabilities of these awards have been accounted 
within the fair value of net assets acquired.
(b) Management equity arrangements issued on acquisition
Ordinary B shares options
On 26 February 2015 certain members of management were issued with 80,000 ordinary B shares in Figgs Topco Limited for a 
consideration of £7.55 per share. See Note 22 for details of the share reorganisation which took place in the period. 
B shareholders are entitled to a certain percentage of any proceeds received in the event of a sale of the business. The percentage 
receivable is dependent on the level of return on investment made by the ultimate parent and can range from 0% to 12.5%.
Holders of vested B shares are entitled to receive the proceeds as set out above, holders of unvested B shares are only entitled to ever 
receive the original equity cost paid by management for the shares at grant. Provided that the holder remains in employment a proportion 
of the shares vest on each anniversary from grant until the fifth anniversary when all awards will have vested. All unvested awards will 
automatically vest on an exit event.
Number of 
awards
At the beginning of the period –
Granted 80,000

The fair value of the awards at the date of grant has been measured using a binomial option pricing model which takes into account a 
number of possible outcomes and weights the likelihood of each.

These options vested in full on IPO and the total charge for the period relating to the management equity issued on acquisition 
is £434,000.

(c) New employee arrangements issued on IPO
Following the IPO of the Group on 27 October 2015, the Group entered into a new share incentive plans; the Ibstock plc Long Term 
Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’), the Ibstock plc Annual and Deferred Bonus Plan (the ‘ABP’) and the Ibstock plc Share Option Plan (the ‘SOP’). 
In addition, the Group has also established three all-employee share incentive plans, the Ibstock plc Share Incentive Plan (the ‘SIP’) and 
the Ibstock plc Sharesave Plan (the ‘SAYE’). The LTIP, ABP and SOP are, together, the ‘Discretionary Plans’, and the Discretionary Plans, 
the SIP and the SAYE, together, the ‘New Plans’.
The Group recognised total expense in the consolidated statement of income of £765,000 relating to the new employee arrangements 
issued on IPO during the period.
(i) LTIP
The Group has introduced a LTIP during the period for key management at the discretion of the Board and this has been approved by the 
shareholders at the General Meeting. Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options. As part of the IPO 
process, 337,665 number of shares were issued and immediately vested. The full loss of £723,000 has been treated as exceptional in the 
current period.
(ii) SOP
The Group has introduced a Share Option Plan during the period for all eligible employees at the discretion of the Board and this has 
been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Awards under the scheme have a specified exercise price with an 
employment condition of three years. The total number of awards issued under this scheme during the period equalled 848,312. 
(iii) SAYE
In order to participate in the Sharesave Plan, an employee must enter into a linked savings contract with a bank or building society to 
make contributions from salary on a monthly basis over a three or five-year period. A participant who enters into a savings agreement is 
granted an option to acquire ordinary shares under the Sharesave Plan at a specified exercise price. The total number of awards issued 
under this scheme during the period equalled 3,416,496.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the LTIP, SOP and SAYE awards during the period are detailed below:

In assessing the expected volatility level, due to Ibstock plc’s short share price history, volatility of similar listed companies have been 
used as a proxy.
The following post-IPO awards were issued and the number of awards granted during the period is yet to be determined.
(iv) ABP
The ABP incorporates the Company’s executive bonus scheme as well as a mechanism for the deferral of bonus into awards over 
ordinary shares. The ABP will operate in respect of the annual bonus earned for the financial period with a mandatory maturity of 50% 
of the annual bonus deferred into shares, with the first deferred awards over ordinary shares under the ABP to be made in 2016. The awards 
will have a £nil exercise price with an employment condition of three years.
(v) SIP
The Company introduced a Share Incentive Plan on flotation. All employees were entitled to apply for free shares up to a value of £800 
depending on their period of service, although the offer was declined by the Executive Directors. The number of shares issued is yet to be 
determined however is considered to be wholly immaterial in the current period.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
All subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated financial statements. The proportion of the voting rights in the subsidiary 
undertakings held directly by the Parent Company do not differ from the proportion of ordinary shares held. The Parent Company does 
not have any shareholdings in the preference shares of subsidiary undertakings included in the Group.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group held a 100% beneficial interest in the ordinary shares of Figgs Topco Limited, which it acquired as 
part of the reorganisation prior to admission onto the official list of the London Stock Exchange, which took place on 27 October 2015 
(see Note 1). Legal ownership of the Figgs Topco Limited’s share capital has transferred to Ibstock plc on 9 February 2016.

Purchase of services:
Bain Capital Partners LLC 8,995 
Diamond (BC) S.à r.l owned a majority shareholding of the Group prior to completion of the IPO transaction. Diamond (BC) S.à r.l, a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Bain Capital Partners LLC, was therefore the immediate parent of the Group and Bain Capital Partners LLC was the 
ultimate parent and ultimate controlling party of the Group prior to the IPO transaction. On 27 October 2015, its shareholding reduced 
to 53.03% and on 4 November 2015, its shareholding reduced to 47.03% following the exercise of an over-allotment option in respect of 
24,330,000 ordinary shares. 
Subsequent to 4 November 2015 and as at 31 December 2015 the Board of Directors of the Company, consider, based on the facts and 
circumstances, that Diamond (BC) S.à r.l has significant influence over, but does not control the Group. 
The shareholder loan notes held by the Group during the period (Note 7) which were owed to Diamond (BC) S.à r.l , a subsidiary of Bain 
Capital Partners LLC, were converted to ordinary shares. The preference shares held by Diamond (BC) S.à r.l and converted to ordinary 
shares are disclosed in Note 22. There are no balances with Bain Capital Partners LLC at the period end date.
During the period Figgs Topco Limited issued 10,000,000 ‘A’ shares to Diamond (BC) S.à r.l (wholly owned by Bain Partners LLC). 
Additionally, Ibstock plc issued 50,000 ordinary shares on incorporation to Diamond (BC) S.à r.l (wholly owned by Bain Partners LLC). 
‘A’ shares were converted as part of the Group reorganisation during the year. See Note 22.
Transactions with related parties during the period also include management subscriptions for shares of £0.6m, see Note 25 and the 
Directors’ remuneration report on pages 56 to 78.
See Note 6 for details of key management personnel remuneration.
During the period, an interest free loan totalling £346,000 was outstanding from a UK director of a UK subsidiary company that was 
provided for relocation purposes. This has been paid back to the Group before year end.
30. Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities were provided for on acquisition in line with IFRS 3. See Note 24 for further details. There are no further contingent 
liabilities as at 31 December 2015.
31. Post balance sheet events
The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 31 December 2015 of 4.4 pence per ordinary share 
which will distribute an estimated £17,800,000 of shareholders funds. It will be paid on 3 June 2016 to those shareholders who are on the 
register at 6 May 2016 subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Since the balance sheet date no further subsequent events requiring further disclosure or adjustments to these financial statements have 
been identified.

Notes to the 
Company financial 
statements
1. General background
Ibstock plc was incorporated on 3 September 2015 to serve as 
a holding company for the purposes of listing on the London 
Stock Exchange. Ibstock plc was admitted to public trading on 
27 October 2015. These financial statements form the Company’s 
first period of accounts and the first period as ultimate holding 
company for the Group following its acquisition of Figgs Topco 
Limited and the Group subsidiary companies.
Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting 
standards, the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the 
United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland (‘FRS102’) and the 
Companies Act 2006.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, 
under the historical cost convention.
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain 
key estimates and assumptions. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying Company 
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of 
judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed.
The Company has not disclosed the information required by 
regulation 5(1)(b) of the Companies (Disclosure of Auditors 
Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements) Regulations 
2008 as the Group accounts of the Company are required to 
comply with regulation 5(1)(b) as if the undertakings included in 
the consolidation were a single group.
Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the business review on pages 36 to 37. The financial position 
of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Directors’ Report on pages 79 to 80.
The Company regularly reviews market and financial forecasts, and has 
reviewed its trading prospects in its key markets. As a result it believes 
its trading performance will demonstrate continued improvement in the 
coming periods, and that liquidity will remain strong.
The Board has reviewed the latest forecasts of the Company and 
considered the obligations of the financing arrangements. Given 
the continued strong liquidity of the Company the Board has 
concluded that a going concern basis of preparation of its financial 
statements is appropriate.
In addition, see the Group’s Viability Statement set out on page 35.
FRS 102 – First time adoption
These financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2015 
are the first set of financial statements the Company has prepared 
in accordance with FRS 102. As the Company has not previously 
prepared financial statements, no transition exemptions or exceptions 
have been applied and no reconciliations are presented.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost stated at the historical 
value at the time of investment less any provisions for impairment and 
net of merger and Group reconstruction relief available.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share based 
compensation plans on behalf of the Group. The fair value of the 
employee services received under such plans is capitalised as an 
investment in the Company’s subsidiary. The amount to be 
recognised over the vesting period is determined by reference to the 
fair value of share based payments.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Ibstock’s shareholders are recognised in 
the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the final 
dividends are approved in the annual general meeting, or when 
paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Financial instruments
(i) Objectives and policies
The Company, in common with its Group subsidiaries, must 
comply with the Group’s finance guidelines that set out the 
principles and framework for managing Group-wide finances. 
Further information on the Group’s policies and procedures is 
available in the Group financial statements. The Company does 
not enter into speculative treasury arrangements.
(ii) Price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk
Foreign exchange risk management
The Company primarily trades in Sterling and therefore exposure 
to foreign exchange risk is regarded as low.
Credit risk management
For the Company this risk arises from cash and cash equivalents 
and deposits with banks. This is managed on a Group basis and 
there are a number of initiatives underway to mitigate this risk. 
These include concentrating activities with a group of banks that 
have strong, independently verified credit ratings. For each bank, 
individual risk limits are set based on its financial position, credit 
ratings, past experience and other factors.
Liquidity planning, trends and risks 
The Company has sufficient committed borrowing facilities to meet 
planned liquidity needs with headroom, through facilities provided 
by the Group.
The Company has adopted IAS 39 for ‘recognition and 
measurement of financial instruments’.
(iii) Financial assets
Financial assets, including preference shares, trade and other 
receivables, loans to fellow Group companies and cash and bank 
balances, are initially recognised at fair value.
Such assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
(iv) Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities, including trade and other payables and loans 
from fellow Group companies, are initially recognised at fair value.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, 
using the effective interest rate method in accordance with IAS 39.

OVERVIEW STRATEGY & PERFORMANCE OTHER INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE
Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Company’s accounting 
policies. It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Due to the 
inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and 
estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
Estimates 
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed by 
management on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the 
period in which the estimates are revised and in any future period 
affected. The areas involving significant risk resulting in a material 
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within 
the next financial year are as follows:
Taxation
During the ordinary course of business, there are transactions 
and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination may be 
uncertain. The calculation of the tax charge therefore necessarily 
involves a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax liabilities are 
based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due and tax 
assets are recognised on the basis of probable future recoverability. 
This requires management to exercise judgement based on their 
interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of settlement of tax 
liabilities or recoverability of tax assets. To the extent that the final 
outcome differs from the estimates made, tax adjustments may be 
required which could have a material impact on the tax charge and 
profit for the period in which such a determination is made.
Judgements
Judgements are made by management in the process of applying 
the Company’s accounting policies that have the most significant 
effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of non-current assets 
Determining whether non-current assets are impaired requires 
judgement and estimation. The Company periodically reviews 
non-current assets, for possible impairment when events or 
changes in circumstances indicate, in management’s judgement, 
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Such 
indicating events would include a significant planned restructuring, 
a major change in market conditions or technology, expectations 
of future operating losses, or negative cash flows. 
The Company did not record any impairment charges during the 
period ended 31 December 2015 as management’s judgement, 
based on a rigorous assessment, was that there were no indicators 
of impairment.
Deal costs
Deal costs of £5.0m were offset against the share premium  
of £99.5m created on the issue of shares during the period. 
Management has exercised judgement in assessing the allocation 
of deal costs incurred between equity and the current period 
income statement.
2. Result for the financial period
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented 
in these financial statements. The Parent Company’s loss after tax 
for the financial period was £11,530,000.
Taxation
Taxation expense for the period comprises current and deferred 
tax recognised in the reporting period. Tax is recognised in the 
profit and loss account, except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. 
In this case tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income 
or directly in equity respectively.
(i) Current tax
Current tax is the amount of income tax payable in respect of the 
taxable profit for the year or prior years. Tax is calculated on the 
basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the period end.
 
Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns 
with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is 
subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate 
on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
(ii) Deferred tax
Deferred tax arises from timing differences that are differences 
between taxable profits and total comprehensive income as stated 
in the financial statements. These timing differences arise from 
the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in 
periods different from those in which they are recognised in 
financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences at the 
reporting date. Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax 
assets are only recognised when it is probable that they will be 
recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other 
future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the period end and that are 
expected to apply to the reversal of the timing differences.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new ordinary shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, from the proceeds.
Related parties
The Group discloses transactions with related parties which 
are not wholly owned within the same Group. Where appropriate, 
transactions of a similar nature are aggregated unless, in the opinion 
of the Directors, separate disclosure is necessary to understand the 
effect of the transactions on the Group financial statements.
Foreign currency
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (‘the functional currency’). The financial statements are 
presented in Sterling (£), which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.

9. Share based payments
Following the IPO of the Group on 27 October 2015, the Company entered into new share incentive plans including the Ibstock plc Long 
Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’) for key management which was approved by the Board at Annual General Meeting. Awards under the 
LTIP scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced share options and, as part of the IPO process, 337,665 number of shares were issued 
on 4 December 2015 and immediately vested. The shares have been valued using a binomial model, with a price of £2.14 at grant date 
and a fair value of £2.14. The full share based payment charge relating to the LTIP of £723,000 has been capitalised in the current period. 
The Company capitalised a total charge of £765,000 relating to the new employee arrangements issued on IPO during the period. As the 
numbers of shares or options granted or outstanding under other plans and the related charge to the Company are not significant, no further 
disclosures are included within these Company financial statements. See Note 25 of the Group financial statements for further information.

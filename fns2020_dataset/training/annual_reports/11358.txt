Company information 3 Annual report 2013
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the annual report and accounts of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
for the year ended 31 December 2013. This was a busy and positive year. Significantly, Nostra Terra
passed the operational breakeven point, before central costs, depletion, depreciation and
amortisation, for the first time in the company’s history. We also maintained our strategy of carefully
considered growth and significantly increased both production and revenue.  
Exploration and production
In the year we made several sensibly judged investments in existing and new fields. More details
can be found in the Chief Executive’s review on page 4. We continued to build a diverse and
balanced portfolio and extended our geographical footprint in line with our stated strategy of
finding new hydrocarbon reserves in ‘old fields’. Our portfolio is being structured to provide a
spread of strong and reliable long-term revenues, and in 2013 we added to its depth.
Financial highlights
I am delighted to report that in 2013 our revenues grew to £851,000 from £352,000 in 2012 –
an increase of 142%. During the period we completed a single placing, raising £750,000 at a
small discount of just 10%, a fantastic result given the extremely difficult conditions in the UK
corporate market at the time. Furthermore, our protracted litigation with Richfield finally reached
a successful conclusion, giving us cash to invest without further dilution to shareholders. More
recently we also secured a US$25 million credit facility with the highly regarded Texas Capital Bank.
This extends our ability to quicken the pace of growth and also gives us the strength and agility to
take advantage of the right opportunities when they present themselves.
Summary
Nostra Terra made considerable progress throughout 2013, thanks in large part to the exemplary
efforts of our executive directors, Matt Lofgran and Alden McCall, who I thank. I also want to
acknowledge Nostra Terra’s shareholders for their enduring loyalty to our company.
Sir Adrian Blennerhassett
Chairman
22 May 2014
Chairman’s statement 4 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Chief Executive’s review
Nostra Terra is a UK-based oil and gas producer with interests in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado and
Kansas. We aim to increase shareholder value by using advanced technology to find new
hydrocarbon reserves in already established fields. Our strategy is to put a diverse portfolio of
interests in place in low-risk geographies that will consistently grow production and revenues. To
this end, 2013 saw the company make steady progress. We extended our portfolio; we significantly
increased the volume of production; and we finally settled a long-running legal action. The year
placed Nostra Terra in a very strong cash position and has set us up for further more accelerated
growth in 2014.
Extending our portfolio
In 2012 we acquired a 20% interest in the Chisholm Trail Prospect in Oklahoma, assessing it as
low-risk and moderate-return. This is exactly what it has turned out to be. Our investments here
were consistently successful in 2013, yielding excellent results and justifying our decision to
concentrate resources on Chisholm Trail. 
Revenues from the first four wells helped us pass the landmark of operational breakeven, before
central costs, in January 2013. In particular well CT4 more than doubled our expectations. We
decided to exploit the Chisholm Trail opportunity further by partnering in additional wells and in
mid-year we acquired additional acreage, giving us access to 21 new potential drilling locations. 
Subsequently we’ve made investments in a further 11 wells to date, bringing the total up to 15
wells. The three new wells that are producing already – CT7, CT8 and CT9 – have increased our
total daily production by 57%. 
Chisholm Trail continues to allow room for growth and we expect it to yield further significant
increases to our net production. It already supplies an extremely valuable revenue stream that
supports our ability to pursue other opportunities. Moreover the strength of activity and results
have de-risked the Hunton Limestone formation where the Chisholm Trail Prospect is located, and
this helped us attract new investment (see Financials below). 
In March 2013, we identified an opportunity in Texas with similar potential to Chisholm Trail, and
purchased a 5% working interest (“WI”) in the High Plains Prospect. This Prospect covers 66 square
miles, and is operated by Brown and Borelli, a highly experienced and respected firm. 
We subsequently increased our interest to 20% following re-entry of a previously drilled well in
the prospect. Work is now ongoing to integrate detailed subsurface mapping and 3D seismic data
that will prioritize the prospect areas for drilling. We have assessed High Plains as being more risky
than Chisholm Trail, but with the potential for higher rewards. In fact the dependable revenue
streams from Chisholm Trail mean we are more comfortably positioned to enter into higher-risk
opportunities to strengthen our portfolio. Meanwhile, the geophysical results indicate that High
Plains might provide the opportunity to build a healthy pipeline of drilling locations for some years
to come. 
Net production in 2013
With the expansion of our portfolio, net production to Nostra Terra has risen as detailed in the
following table.  5 Annual report 2013
Financials 
As the chairman said, in 2013 Nostra Terra’s revenue grew considerably to £851,000 in 2013,
against £352,000 in 2012, due to greatly increased production volumes. This represents an increase
of 142%. Gross profit (before depletion, depreciation and amortisation) increased to £551,000,
against £192,000 in 2012.  
In respect of capital, Nostra Terra raised £750,000 before expenses by way of a placing of
187,500,000 new ordinary shares of 0.1p each with existing and new investors. 
I am very pleased to report that the legal action against Richfield Oil and Gas Company was finally
resolved in Nostra Terra’s favour and the monies owing to us were paid. In all we received over
US$1.6 million. Richfield has also voluntarily dismissed all counterclaims against Nostra Terra. 
After the balance sheet date we also secured a US$25 million credit facility with Texas Capital 
Bank, which includes provisions to increase the borrowing base as additional wells are brought 
on production. We agreed an initial borrowing base of US$500,000 which has increased to 
$1.1 million following a stabilisation of production rates, as announced on 7 May 2014. This strong
credit line will give us the ability to quicken the pace of growth through non-dilutive funds. 
An exciting future
We achieved a great deal in 2013. We made careful decisions to expand our interests in the
lucrative Chisholm Trail Prospect and diversify into High Plains, broadening our production base.
We increased revenue, with our focus now on free cash flow so that we can support more rapid
growth in 2014 and beyond. 
In the background we have also been building up our operational capabilities to prepare Nostra
Terra for a transition towards operating more of our own prospects. We have an exciting future as
we look to take much larger steps in growing production and reserves. A very solid foundation
has been built from which to accelerate growth.
It only remains for me to thank all Nostra Terra’s shareholders for their continuing loyal support. 
I look forward to giving you regular good news about our company in the months ahead.

Strategic report
The directors now present their strategic report with the financial statements of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
(“the company”) and its subsidiaries (collectively “the group”) for the year ended 31 December 2013.
Principal activity
The group’s principal activity is the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources in the US mid-continent.
Review of business, future developments, trading outlook and future strategy
The results for the year and financial position of the company and the group are shown in the financial statements on
pages 16 to 25, and are noted in the Chairman’s statement on page 3 and the Chief Executive’s review on pages 4 and 5.
Key performance indicators
At this stage in the company’s development, the directors regularly monitor key performance indicators associated with
managing liquid resources, namely: cash flows and bank balances; general administrative expenses, which are tightly
controlled; and the level of production. The directors also monitor the increase in net production which in 2013 rose to
17,673 BOE (2012: 6,268) as noted on page 5.
Key risks and uncertainties
The key risk in exploration and production is the technical risk of not finding hydrocarbons when an exploration well is
drilled. While the US mid-continent is a proven hydrocarbon region and is seeing resurgence through the application of
new drilling and well completion technologies, there are environmental and economic risks, as there are in any
hydrocarbon region. Further information relating to risk can be found at note 19 to these accounts.

The group may purchase and maintain, for any director or officer, insurance against any liability. The group maintains

Financial instruments
The group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. The group is exposed to foreign
currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pounds sterling (£). The group

foreign currency risk, given the nature of its business. 10 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Listing
The company’s ordinary shares have traded on London’s Alternative Investment Market since 20 July 2007. Shore Capital

Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors consider that the group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities in respect of the Strategic report, the Directors’ report
and the Financial Statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)
as adopted for use in the European Union. The financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss of the group for that year. In preparing these
financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company
will continue in business; and
• follow IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the company and the group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act
2006) of which the group’s auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken
as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the group’s auditors
are aware of that information.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution that Jeffreys Henry LLP be reappointed as
auditors of the company will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
On behalf of the board:
M B Lofgran
Director
22 May 2014
Directors’ report continued 11 Annual report 2013
Corporate governance report
The directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance, commensurate with the group’s size and
shareholders’ interests. As the group grows, policies and procedures that reflect the FRC’s UK Corporate Governance
Code will be developed. So far as is practicable and appropriate, the directors will take steps to comply with the UK
Corporate Governance Code.
The board of Directors
The board comprises two executive directors and two non-executive directors. It meets at least four times a year, as
issues arise which require board attention. The board has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for decision.
The directors are responsible for:
• management structure and appointments;
• consideration of strategy and policy;
• approval of major capital investments and transactions; and
• significant financing matters.
The board has Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, the roles and responsibilities of which are discussed
below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises A M Blennerhassett as Chairman, and S V Oakes. Both have considerable and relevant
financial experience.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference agreed by the board and meets at least twice a year. The committee provides
an opportunity for reporting by the company’s auditors, and is responsible for:
• monitoring, in discussion with the auditors, the integrity of the financial statements and announcements of the
company;
• reviewing the company’s internal financial controls and risk management systems; and
• reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence, and the objectivity and effectiveness of the audit
process, taking into consideration relevant UK and other professional and regulatory requirements.
The Audit Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the board to be put to shareholders for their
approval in general meeting in relation to the appointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors and to
approve the external auditors’ remuneration and terms of engagement. Other responsibilities include considering annually
whether there is a need for an internal audit function and making a recommendation to the board, and reviewing
arrangements by which the group’s staff will be able to raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial
reporting or other matters related to the group. 12 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Remuneration and Nomination Committees
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees, which meet at least twice a year, consist of A M Blennerhassett as
Chairman and S V Oakes. Based on the terms of reference approved by the board, the Remuneration Committee is
responsible for:
• determining and agreeing with the board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive
Officer, the Chairman and other members it is designated to consider;
• setting the remuneration for all executive directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary;
• recommending and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior management;
• determining targets for any performance-related pay schemes operated by the group;
• determining the policy and scope of pension arrangements for each executive director; and
• ensuring that contractual terms on termination and any payments made are fair to the individual and the company.
The Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of service of executive directors. This includes
agreeing the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman and, within
the terms of the agreed policy, recommending the total individual remuneration package of each executive director
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options. 
The Nomination Committee is responsible for ensuring all director appointments are considered by the Committee before
their formal recommendation to the board for approval.
Relations with shareholders
Communications with shareholders are very important and are given a priority. The company maintains a website,
www.ntog.co.uk, to improve information flow to shareholders and potential investors. It contains information about
the company’s activities, and annual and interim reports. Shareholders are welcome to make enquiries on any matters
relating to the business and to their shareholdings. The company encourages shareholders to attend the Annual Meeting,
at which they will be given the opportunity to put questions to the chairman and other members of the board.
Internal financial control
The board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the company’s system of internal controls and for reviewing
their effectiveness. They are designed to safeguard the company’s assets and to ensure the reliability of the financial
information for both internal use and external publication. The controls that include inter alia financial, operational and
compliance matters and management are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities
will be detected or that risk of failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. The board has considered the need
for an internal audit function but because of the size and nature of its operations does not consider it necessary at this
time.

Notes to the ﬁnancial statements

GENERAL INFORMATION
Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales and quoted on the AIM market
of the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered office is disclosed on the company information page of
this annual report. The principal activity of the group is described in the directors’ report. 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the group is a going concern. When assessing the
foreseeable future, the directors have looked at a period of 12 months from the date of approval of this report. 
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position
are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s report and Directors report. In addition, note 19 to the financial statements
includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives;
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonable possible changes in trading performance, show that
the group should be able to operate within the level of its current cash resources. In addition, the group has entered
into a US$25 million credit facility (current borrowing base US$1.1 million and anticipated to increase) in 2014, a 
£5 million financing agreement (expandable to £10 million), and a US$1 million promissory note (expandable to 
US$3 million) with Yorkville Advisors.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company and group have adequate resources
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC
interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements
have been prepared under the historical cost convention. 
New and amended standards adopted by the company
• There are no IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time in this financial period that would be
expected to have a material impact on the group.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective 
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for
the financial year beginning 1 January 2013 and have not been early adopted:
• IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments: classification and measurement’, as issued reflects the first phase of the IASB work on
the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. In subsequent phases, the IASB will
address classification and measurement of financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition. The adoption of
the first phase of IFRS 9 might have an effect on the classification and measurement of the company’s assets. At this
juncture it is difficult for the company to comprehend the impact on its financial position and performance.
• IAS 28, ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ – effective 1 January 2014 – supersedes IAS 28 ‘Investments
in Associates’ and prescribes the accounting for investments in associates and sets out the requirements for the
application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. The Standard
defines ‘significant influence’ and provides guidance on how the equity method of accounting is to be applied
(including exemptions from applying the equity method in some cases). It also prescribes how investments in associates
and joint ventures should be tested for impairment.
There are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material
impact on the group. 27 Annual report 2013
Basis of consolidation
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary. The consolidated financial
statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the group”) as if they formed a single entity.
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method. In
the statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially
recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date. The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. They are deconsolidated from the date
control ceases.
Subsidiaries
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. The cost of an
acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed
at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and
contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date,
irrespective of the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the group’s
share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value
of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies
of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Associates
An associate undertaking (“associate”) is an enterprise over whose financial and operating policies the group has the
power to exercise significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the group. The equity
method of accounting for associates is adopted in the group financial statements, such that they include the group’s
share of operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest, taxation and net assets of associates (“the equity method”).
In applying the equity method, account is taken of the group’s share of accumulated retained earnings and movements
in reserves from the effective date on which an enterprise becomes an associate and up to the effective date of disposal.
The share of associated retained earnings and reserves is generally determined from the associate’s latest interim or final
financial statements. Where the group’s share of losses of an associate exceeds the carrying amount of the associate,
the associate is carried at nil. Additional losses are only recognised to the extent that the group has incurred obligations
or made payments outside the course of ordinary business on behalf of the associate.
Joint Activity Agreement
The group’s interest in the Joint Activity Agreement (“JAA”) (see note 10) is accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The group combines its share of the JAA’s individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line
by line basis with similar items in the group’s financial statements. The group recognises the portion of gains and losses
on the sale of assets by the group to JAA that is attributable to the other ventures. The group does not recognise its
share of profits or losses from JAA that result from the group’s purchase of assets from JAA until it resells the assets to
an independent party. However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a
reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss. 28 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group’s share of the net identifiable
assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included
in ‘intangible assets’. Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an
entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those
cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in
which the goodwill arose. The group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each country in which it operates.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually
for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount
by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest
levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than
goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Property, plant and equipment
Tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditure that is
directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.   
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the
item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and
maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is
provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life: 
Plant and machinery – over 7 years
The assets’ residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet
date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount
is greater than its estimated recoverable value.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
within other (losses) or gains in the income statement. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other
reserves are transferred to retained earnings.
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment value.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of hydrocarbons and services in
the ordinary course of the group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts
and after eliminating sales within the group. Revenue is recognised when the oil and gas produced is despatched and
received by the customers. 29 Annual report 2013
Functional currency translation
(i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the group are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency), which is mainly United States Dollars (US$). The
financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the group’s presentation currency.
ii)    Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the presentational currency using exchange rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and
from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all group entities (none of which has the currency of a hyper-inflationary
economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the
presentation currency as follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that 
balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average
is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in
which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of
borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity.
When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of
the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. The tax currently payable is based on
the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differed from net profit as reported in the income statement because it
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are
never taxable or deductible. The entity’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred income tax
is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business
combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income
tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date
and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is
settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised. 30 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc
Notes to the ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Operating leases
Rental leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified
as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged
to the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.  
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence
that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default
or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised
in the income statement over the year of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the
liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Financial Instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables,
cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for instruments not at fair value through
profit or loss, any directly attributable transactions costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition,
non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
A financial instrument is recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised if the group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if
the group transfers the financial assets to another party without retaining control or substantially all risks and rewards
of the asset. Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for at trade date, i.e. the date that the
group commits itself to purchase or sell the asset. Financial liabilities are derecognised if the group’s obligations specified
in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled. 
Fair values 
The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables
of the group at the balance sheet date approximated their fair values, due to the relatively short-term nature of these
financial instruments.
The company provides financial guarantees to licensed banks for credit facilities extended to a subsidiary company. The
fair value of such financial guarantees is not expected to be significantly different as the probability of the subsidiary
company defaulting on the credit lines is remote. 31 Annual report 2013
Share-based compensation
The fair value of the employee and suppliers services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as
an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting year is determined by reference to the fair value of the
options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth
targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to
vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It
recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and
share premium when the options are exercised.
The fair value of share-based payments recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is measured by use of the
Black Scholes model, which takes into account conditions attached to the vesting and exercise of the equity instruments.
The expected life used in the model is adjusted; based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-
transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share price volatility percentage factor used in
the calculation is based on management’s best estimate of future share price behaviour and is selected based on past
experience, future expectations and benchmarks against peer companies in the industry.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of
tax, from the proceeds.
Oil and gas assets 
The group applies the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas assets and has adopted IFRS 6 Exploration
for and evaluation of mineral resources.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) assets
Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially
capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination. Expenditure incurred
during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established
or the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs
Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement
as they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation (“E&E”) costs
Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets. Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, together with the
directly related costs of technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised
as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities (such as the group’s drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant and
equipment used by the company’s exploration function) are classified as property, plant and equipment. However, to
the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that
consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset. Such intangible costs include directly attributable
overheads, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost
of other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities. 32 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities
Intangible E&E assets relating to each exploration licence/prospect are carried forward until the existence (or otherwise)
of commercial reserves has been determined, subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment.
If commercial reserves are discovered the carrying value, after any impairment loss of the relevant E&E assets, is then
reclassified as development and production assets. If, however, commercial reserves are not found, the capitalised costs
are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
Development and production assets
Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of
developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures
incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets,
directly attributable overheads and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depletion, amortisation and impairment of oil and gas assets
All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production
basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the
end of the period plus the production in the period, on a field-by-field basis. Costs used in the unit of production
calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs to access
the related commercial reserves. Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are
dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in an oil and gas asset, the
recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future
cash flows based on management’s expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs. Any impairment identified
is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation. Where conditions giving rise to impairment
subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of
any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
Commercial reserves
Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of
crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a
specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered
commercially producible. 33 Annual report 2013
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the group to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below:
a) Impairment of investments
Costs of investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined
based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates for each cash
generating unit.
b) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is
determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
c) Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its
recoverable value. This assessment involves judgment as to (i) the likely future commerciality of the asset and when
such commerciality should be determined, and (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining to the asset in question,
and the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value. 
d) Share-based payments
Note 1 sets out the group’s accounting policy on share-based payments, specifically in relation to the share options
and warrants that the Company has granted. The key assumptions underlying the fair value of such share-based
payments are discussed in note 22. The fair value amounts used by the group have been derived by external
consultants using standard recognised valuation techniques. 34 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

2. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
In the opinion of the directors, the group has one class of business, being the exploitation of hydrocarbon resources.
The group’s primary reporting format is determined by geographical segment according to the location of the
hydrocarbon assets. The group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8 in the year are as follows:
United Kingdom being the head office.
Ukraine: a 25 per cent profit share in the onshore Oktyabrskoe oil field.
US Mid-Continent properties at year end included the following:
(i) Kansas: 100% working interest in the Bloom property located within the Chase-Silica Field;
(ii) Texas: 1% working interest in the Vintage Hills Prospect Unit located within the Giddings Field; 3% working interest
in the Nesbitt Prospect Unit located within the Woodlawn Field;
(iii) Colorado: 16.25% working interest in the Verde Prospect Unit;
(iv) Oklahoma: 30% working interest in the Bale Creek Prospect Unit. 
The chief operating decision maker’s internal report is based on the location of the oil properties as disclosed below. 35 Annual report 2013

8. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue during the year. For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares
in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The group had two classes of dilutive
potential ordinary shares, being those share options granted to employees and suppliers where the exercise price is less
than the average market price of the group’s ordinary shares during the year, and warrants granted to directors and one
former adviser.

The group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the intangible assets may be impaired, by
considering the net present value of discounted cash flows forecasts. If an indication exists an impairment review is
carried out by reference to available engineering information. At the year end, the directors are of the opinion that an
impairment of £85,953 should be provided.  42 Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc

19. RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, capital
risk and credit risk. The group’s activities also expose it to non-financial risks: market, legal and environment risk. The
group’s overall risk management programme focuses on unpredictability and seeks to minimise the potential adverse
effects on the group’s financial performance. The board, on a regular basis, reviews key risks and, where appropriate,
actions are taken to mitigate the key risks identified.
Capital risk
The group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to
provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce
the cost of capital.
Market risk
The group also faces risks in conducting operations in US mid-continent, which include but are not limited to:
• Fluctuations in the global economy could disrupt the group’s ability to operate its business in the US Mid-Continent
and could discourage foreign and local investment and spending, which could adversely affect its production.
Environmental risks
The group faces environmental risks in conducting operations in the US Mid-Continent which include but are not 
limited to:
• If the group is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, it could be exposed to additional
costs, which might hinder the group’s ability to operate its business.
Credit risk 
The group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables. The group’s credit risk is
primarily attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for
doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss which, based on previous
experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
Foreign currency risk
The group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency risk. 
The group reports its results in Pounds Sterling. A significant share of the exploration and development costs and the
local operating costs are in United States Dollars. Any change in the relative exchange rates between Pounds Sterling,
and United States Dollars could positively or negatively affect the group’s results. 
The group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency
other than Pounds Sterling. The group maintains a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by
matching foreign currency income with foreign currency costs.
The group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange risk
resulting from cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the
time being. 49 Annual report 2013

Volatility of crude oil prices
A material part of the group’s revenue will be derived from the sale of oil that it expects to produce. A substantial or
extended decline in prices for crude oil and refined products could adversely affect the group’s revenues, cash flows,
profitability and ability to finance its planned capital expenditure. The movement of crude oil prices is shown below:
2013 2012
Per barrel – US$ 105.48 101.17
Per barrel –£ 63.84 62.57
Liquidity risk
The group expects to fund its exploration and development programme, as well as its administrative and operating
expenses throughout 2014, principally using existing working capital and expected proceeds from the sale of future
crude oil production. The group had a bank balance of approximately £371,000 at 31 December 2013.

22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
The estimated fair value of the warrants issued during the year was calculated by applying the Black-Scholes option
pricing model. Expected volatility was originally stated at 30%. This has been revised to 50% because the volatility over
the past year has been used rather than the past 5 years. The directors consider this is more appropriate due to a
significant share price drop in 2008 which is attributable to a one-off event where work stopped during the opening of
a well in Ukraine. The assumptions used in the calculation were as follows;
23. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND GUARANTEES
The group has no contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims arising from the ordinary course of business and it is not
anticipated that any material liabilities will arise from contingent liabilities other than those provided for.
24. ULTIMATE CONTROLLING PARTY
The company is quoted on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange. At the date of the annual report there was
no one controlling party.
25. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD
On 3 February 2014 Nostra Terra entered into a US$25 million credit facility (“Facility’) with Texas Capital Bank (“Bank”).
The new Facility contains both a three year Revolving Credit Facility and a Standby Letter of Credit Facility with an initial
nominal limit of US$25 million. Interest is charged on monies drawn down at the current rate of 4.25% (determined 
by the higher of either: the sum of the Wall Street Journal Rate plus 1% or 4.25%). The current borrowing base is
US$1.1 million.

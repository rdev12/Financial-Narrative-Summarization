Overview
Bovis	Homes	has	made	excellent	progress	
during	2012	with	a	significant	increase	in	
profit	and	a	material	improvement	in	returns	
for	shareholders.
The Group has successfully deployed a growth strategy for the 
last four years following the housing market downturn. This is 
delivering significant benefits to the Group, despite operating 
in a tough economic climate and experiencing a difficult 
mortgage market.
The Board is, however, confident of future growth based on 
the excellent investments already made and on the assumption 
of an ongoing stable housing market. Future growth in 
shareholder returns is therefore not reliant on a housing 
market recovery.
The economic backdrop remains challenging and the housing 
market continues to face constraints on activity, primarily due 
to the restricted availability of mortgage finance especially for 
first time buyers struggling to raise the necessary deposit to 
allow them to participate in the market. Consumer confidence 
remains fragile after the negative impacts from the Euro crisis, 
UK corporate failures and recessionary GDP concerns. As a 
result, house prices remain subdued with nominal house  
price stability. 
Against this external backdrop, the performance of Bovis 
Homes has been very strong. The Group is now benefiting 
from the compound positive effects of stronger volumes, 
higher average sales price and significantly improving  
profit margins. This in turn is providing a strong impetus  
to both profits and shareholder returns.
Financial performance
The Group delivered a 68% increase in profits before taxation 
to £54.1 million and increased return on capital employed by 
2.7 ppts to 7.7% in 2012. Revenue increased by 17% and the 
operating margin improved from 10.0% in 2011 to 13.4%  
in 2012. These results demonstrate clearly the growth in  
the business. The Group continues to be well capitalised with 
a strong balance sheet with net cash at the end of 2012 of 
£18.8 million.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share for the year have grown by 75%  
to 30.7p. Consistent with the intention to increase dividends 
progressively as earnings per share increase, the Board will  
be recommending a final dividend of 6.0p per share, which, 
when combined with the 2012 interim dividend of 3.0p, totals 
9.0p for the year, an increase of 80% on the 2011 dividend.  
The final dividend will be payable on 24 May 2013 to 
shareholders on the register on 2 April 2013. It is the  
Board’s intention to continue to pursue this progressive 
dividend approach.
Future prospects
The Group invested strongly during 2012 in consented land 
to support future growth in sales outlets. The prime nature 
of these new sales outlets is expected to further increase the 
Group’s average sales price, profit margins and returns.
People
The Board of directors has been delighted with the 
commitment and skill shown by all of the Group’s employees 
in delivering the growth during 2012 and, on behalf of the 
Board, I would like to thank them all. The Board would also 
like to extend its thanks to its subcontractors and suppliers.
Corporate governance
Bovis Homes is committed to high standards of corporate 
governance, including those related to the role and 
effectiveness of the Board and compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Details are set out in the 
corporate governance section on pages 31 to 37.
Corporate responsibility
I am pleased to report the good progress against the targets 
laid out within our Corporate Social Responsibility report, 
in particular the improvements in our health and safety 
performance, a critical area where the Group will continue 
to target improvements. This progress has once again been 
recognised by the Group’s inclusion in the independently 
assessed FTSE4Good Index. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 7
The Group has achieved excellent progress in 2012 with 
improved profitability and in positioning the Group for growth
The Board
It is with confidence in the progress achieved by Bovis Homes  
that I have decided to retire as non-executive Chairman at the  
end of November 2013, having been Chairman for five and a  
half years. It has been a pleasure and a privilege to chair the Board 
during what has been a challenging period for the industry. I have 
been fortunate in the calibre of both the executive team and the 
non-executive directors and I would like to thank them for their 
collective support during my Chairmanship. I would also like to 
thank shareholders for their confidence in the Group and for  
their support.
Summary
Bovis Homes is well positioned to grow and drive enhanced 
shareholder returns over the coming years, based on stable housing 
market conditions. The business has delivered an excellent result in 
2012 and has invested well to provide a strong base for delivering 
continuing improvements in 2013 and beyond.

Strategy
Bovis	Homes	has	made	significant	progress	
in	2012,	delivering	a	strong	improvement	
in	revenue,	profits	and	return	on	capital	
employed	against	a	backdrop	of	challenging,	
but	stable,	market	conditions.	
The Group has continued to acquire high quality consented 
land and has consequently grown active sales outlets, leading 
to higher volumes, increased average sales price and higher 
profit margins. Having delivered an improvement in the 
efficiency of capital employed, both by managing working 
capital tightly and through the sale of selected land parcels, 
the Group has increased its capital turn. The combination of 
improved profitability and increased capital turn has delivered a 
strong improvement in the Group’s return on capital employed.
Bovis Homes aims to be a quality housebuilder delivering  
high returns generated from a strong land bank, much  
of it strategically sourced, and a quality product sold at a 
premium price. In order to deliver improved returns, the 
following clear strategic objectives for 2012 were set out  
and have been delivered:
• Increase operating profits
• Build future margin potential in the land bank
• Improve efficiency of capital employed
Additionally the Group has demonstrated significant progress 
against the following objectives:
• Deliver strong health, safety and environmental standards
• Deliver a strong customer service experience
Increase operating profits
Operating profit increased in the year by 56% to £56.8 million, 
as a result of the compound positive effect of an increased 
volume of legal completions at a higher average sales price with 
an improved margin. 
Volume growth was driven from the increased number of active 
sales outlets in 2012. The average number of active sales outlets 
grew to 82 from 73 in the prior year and the Group finished 
2012 with 90 active sales outlets.
The increase in active sales outlets contributed to the delivery of 
2,355 legal completions during 2012, 15% ahead of the previous 
year (2011: 2,045). The Group legally completed 1,854 private 
homes (2011: 1,624), an increase of 14%. Legal completions of 
social homes increased by 19% to 501 (2011: 421), representing 
21% of total volume (2011: 21%).
In addition to increased volume, the Group’s average sales  
price increased by 5% to £170,700 in 2012 (2011: £162,400).  
For private homes, the average sales price in 2012 was  
5% higher at £188,700 (2011: £180,100), in line with  
Group expectations. This uplift was almost entirely due to the 
mix of homes legally completed as the Group increased the 
proportion of family homes sold in the south of England.
Gross profit margin (excluding land sales) increased to 22.6% 
in 2012 from 20.8% in 2011, resulting from the increased 
contribution from legal completions on stronger margin sites 
acquired post the housing market downturn.
As a result of the compound positive effect of volume growth, 
higher average sales price and improved gross profit margin, 
gross profit (excluding land sales) increased by 33% to  
£92.1 million (2011: £69.5 million). Combined with land sales 
profits of £4.8 million (2011: £2.7 million) and with overheads 
well controlled, the significant growth in operating profit to 
£56.8 million (2011: £36.4 million) was achieved at an operating 
margin of 13.4% (2011: 10.0%).
Build future margin potential in the land bank
During 2012, the Group invested in 3,501 plots of consented 
land, of which 2,651 consented plots on 18 sites were added 
to the consented land bank at a cost of £161 million  
(2011: 2,552 consented plots at a cost of £134 million). 
Approximately 86% of these plots are located in the south  
of England, where the housing market continues to show 
greater robustness. The plots added have an estimated future 
revenue of £561 million and an estimated future gross profit 
potential of £146 million, based on current sales prices and 
current build costs, and are expected to deliver a gross margin 
of over 25%. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 9
Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
The remaining 850 consented plots were contracted during  
2012 and were awaiting satisfaction of legal conditions as at  
31 December 2012. Of these, three sites containing 408 consented 
plots have been added to the land bank during the first eight 
weeks of 2013. The balance of these consented plots are expected 
to be added to the land bank in early 2013.
The consented land bank amounted to 13,776 plots as at  
31 December 2012, marginally above the 13,723 plots held  
at 31 December 2011, with plots added being roughly equivalent 
to legal completions combined with plots sold through land sales. 
The Group estimates that the gross profit potential on the plots 
within the consented land bank at the 2012 year end, based on 
current sales prices and current build costs, was £600 million 
with a gross margin of 22.7% (31 December 2011: gross profit 
potential of £524 million with a gross margin of 21.4%).  
The increase during 2012 of £76 million arose from the land 
additions (£146 million) less utilisation from home sales  
(£84 million) and land sales (£12 million). The balancing positive 
value of £26 million reflects other profit enhancing, added value 
changes delivered by the Group, including improvements in 
planning, enhanced sales prices and cost efficiencies.
Of the 13,776 plots, 74% are located in the south of England 
(2011: 72%). At the year end, the consented land bank included 
7,368 consented plots (54% of total), which have been acquired 
since the housing market downturn (2011: 5,797, 42% of total). 
The average consented land plot cost was £42,100 at the start of 
2012 and increased over the year to £45,800, as a result of  
a lower number of written down plots held in the land bank  
(13% of land plots versus 17% at the start of the year) and the 
addition of new prime southern traditional housing sites where  
the average plot cost is higher.
The strategic land bank at 31 December 2012 stood at  
19,318 potential plots as compared to 18,749 potential plots  
at 31 December 2011. The Group continues to invest in new  
strategic land assets and has strong visibility on the potential to 
convert a number of sizeable strategic land holdings into  
consented opportunities during 2013 and 2014.
Improve efficiency of capital employed
The Group has controlled the size and value of the consented land 
bank during 2012, with a similar number of consented plots in the 
land bank at the start and end of the year. This has been achieved, 
at the same time as increasing the level of legal completions and 
operating from a higher number of active sales outlets, being 90 
outlets at 31 December 2012 compared to 80 outlets a year earlier.
The Group has tightly controlled work in progress, with the 
number of units of production held at the end of 2012 reduced to 
918 units (2011: 949). The overall value of work in progress has 
increased to £172.7 million from £166.5 million. Work in progress 
turn increased to 2.5 times in 2012 from 2.2 in 2011, marking a 
further positive step in improving capital efficiency.
Overall capital turn has increased to 0.6 in 2012, up from 0.5 in 
2011 and 0.4 in 2010. With the investment undertaken to date 
and the strength of the ongoing land pipeline, the output capacity 
of the business is expected to increase, which, on the basis of 
stable market conditions, should improve capital turn further in 
2013 and beyond.
Improve returns 
During 2012 Bovis Homes has delivered on the three strategic 
objectives set out above, which has resulted in a significant 
increase in return on capital employed to 7.7% in 2012 from  
5% in 2011. 
The Group strongly believes that, based on stable market 
conditions, return on capital employed will improve further in 
2013, driven by the compound positive effect on profit of higher 
volume, increase in average sales price and improved profit margin. 
Whilst future output capacity will grow, capital employed will 
remain tightly controlled.
Deliver strong health, safety and  
environmental standards
The Group is committed to delivering strong health and safety 
standards for its employees, subcontractors and other site visitors. 
It maintains a high level of organisational focus on its health and 
safety regime through comprehensive staff training, clear and 
accountable management processes and through regular and 
transparent reporting of performance. 
This is overseen, firstly, through the operational line, which takes 
day to day accountability for this area and, secondly, via a Group-
wide oversight committee with nominated regional directors 
responsible for safety, run by the Group Director of Health and 
Safety and chaired by a senior Group manager. The Group also 
seeks to ensure that all of its employees and subcontractors 
who operate at or visit sites carry a CSCS card, indicating its 
commitment to a fully trained workforce. 
Notwithstanding the increase in the Group’s build activity during 
2012, the Group’s NHBC risk score for the year was 0.61, 
which compares favourably to the industry peer group average. 
Additionally, the risk incident rate was 23.
During the last 12 months the Group has continued to focus 
efforts on the key areas of significant risk, being working at 
heights, PPE and slips, trips and falls in order to raise awareness in 
these areas. Whilst the Group’s health and safety performance is 
relatively strong versus external benchmarks, the Group cannot  
be complacent. Health and Safety will remain a key area of focus 
for regional and Group management. 10		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Strategy
Chief Executive’s report 
The Group continues to regard sustainable development as 
critical to the long term creation of value for its shareholders. 
The housebuilding industry has an important role to play both 
in mitigating the impact of its building activities on the local 
environment and in the evolution of building techniques  
and advances, which reduce the carbon usage from new  
build developments.
During 2012, the Group has significantly increased the 
focus on waste in order to drive down the quantity of waste 
produced in building a home. The quantity of active waste 
generated per home in 2012 was reduced by 24% to 3.1 
tonnes and the amount sent to landfill was reduced by 42%.
The Group works with a range of external stakeholders to 
agree and carry out development in a mutually acceptable 
manner, thereby ensuring that its developments take place in 
a way which mitigates the impact on the local environment, 
thereby balancing the needs of local communities for new 
housing with the requirement to avoid environmental damage.
Looking forward, the Group is focusing on ways to ensure 
that its products conform to good environmental standards, 
including both to EcoHomes standards and to emerging 
standards under the Code for Sustainable Homes.  
Reflecting the existing contribution that the Group makes  
to the communities and environments in which it operates,  
the Group is proud to say that it is a member of the 
FTSE4Good index.
Further details of the Group’s efforts and achievements during 
2012 in regards to Corporate Social Responsibility will be 
published in a separate report, available from the Company’s 
website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk).
Deliver a strong customer service experience 
for Bovis Homes customers
The Group continues to invest in delivering its customer 
charter, which sets the expectations in relation to the quality 
of the product it delivers and the manner in which the sales 
transaction is serviced. The Group has been recognised 
independently by the achievement of a five star builder rating 
by the Home Builder Federation. Additionally, the Group is 
pleased to see the key internal scoring metrics of ‘recommend 
a friend’ and ‘purchase another Bovis home’ continuing to 
generate strong satisfaction scores during 2012 of 94% and 
92% respectively.
The focus of the Group’s customer communication has 
remained digitally based during 2012, with the Group using 
the power of the internet to directly market its products to 
consumers, utilising internally generated mailing lists as well as 
via intermediaries such as rightmove and Zoopla. Over 70% of 
customer enquires originate via the web.
The sales structure has evolved into a blended solution of both 
hubs and standalone sites, based upon geographic, product 
and competitor criteria. This ensures that the sales resource is 
deployed in the most appropriate manner. IT connectivity is 
provided to all of the sales operations, enabling efficient and 
effective customer communication and the utilisation of an 
integrated CRM system. The selling process is supported by the 
Group’s bespoke prospect management system, which delivers 
on-site technology whilst integrating the Group’s prospect 
database with brochure fulfilment.
Market conditions
Overall market conditions were challenging but stable  
during 2012. Sales prices were generally stable with some 
regional variations. A continuing lack of availability during the 
year of high loan to value mortgage products constrained 
market activity for new build homes. This was particularly  
an issue for first time buyers, who, since the financial crisis, 
have had to provide a higher level of deposit for their  
home purchase than had historically been the case.  
Monthly mortgage approval levels were stable throughout 
2012, but at significantly lower levels than historically would 
have been viewed as “normal” market activity.
With a backdrop of continuing economic and employment 
uncertainty, trading conditions in 2013 are expected to remain 
similar to 2012. Although the market remains challenging and 
customer confidence and commitment levels remain subdued, 
the Group currently believes that the pricing environment will 
be broadly stable during 2013.
A range of Government initiatives are beginning to provide 
impetus to the housing market and in particular the new 
build market. The Government’s NewBuy scheme has been in 
operation for nearly one year and, after a period of awareness 
building and reductions in interest rates attaching to lenders’ 
NewBuy mortgage products, NewBuy activity is increasing.  
The Government’s FirstBuy scheme has entered its second 
phase of delivery with allocations awarded to housebuilders for 
use in 2013 and early 2014. This will provide further support 
for first time buyers in obtaining finance from lenders. 
Strategy Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 11
Strategy delivery is on track with further growth in 
returns supported by land investment
Whilst not a housing initiative, the Government’s Funding for 
Lending Scheme is providing assistance to banks in the form of 
more cost effective finance, which in turn will support these banks 
in lending mortgages at higher loan to value ratios and at cheaper 
rates of interest. The positive effect of the Funding for Lending 
Scheme has not yet been evidenced in published mortgage 
approval statistics, but there is a growing consensus that such a 
positive effect will be seen in mortgage approval data over the 
coming months. Increased mortgage approvals will support an 
improvement in housing transactions, including activity in the new 
homes market.
Current trading
The Group entered 2013 with a forward sales order position of 
778 homes, a 37% improvement on the 568 homes brought 
forward at the start of 2012.
The Group has delivered 350 private reservations in the first eight 
weeks of 2013 (2012: 320), an increase of 9%. Operating from 
an average of 90 active sales outlets during this period (2012: 83), 
the Group has achieved a sales rate per site per week of 0.49, 
in line with the comparable period in 2012. Sales rates in recent 
weeks have exceeded 0.5 sales per site, indicating an encouraging 
start to the spring selling season and providing confidence that 
the Group is on target to deliver its anticipated volumes in 2013. 
Encouragingly, NewBuy has contributed circa 10% of 2013 private 
reservations to date. 
Sales prices achieved to date have been in line with Group 
expectations, with an increase in the average private sales price 
to circa £200,000, driven by the improving mix with more family 
homes in southern England.
As at 22 February 2013, the Group held 1,198 net sales for 
legal completion in 2013, as compared to 926 net sales at the 
same point in 2012, an increase of 29%. Of these, private sales 
amounted to 599 homes (2012: 550) and social housing sales 
amounted to 599 homes (2012: 376).
Outlook
As a result of the strong consented investment in land in recent 
years, the Group expects to continue to increase its number of 
active sales outlets during 2013 from the opening position of 90 
active sales outlets. Given the focus on acquiring land in the south 
of England, it is anticipated that more than 70% of the active sales 
outlets at the end of 2013 will be in southern locations versus 
two thirds at the start of 2013. As the Group opens more new 
sales outlets than it closes, absolute weekly reservation levels are 
expected to increase.
The Group anticipates that during 2013 it will take the opportunity 
to invest significantly in promoting a number of strategic land 
holdings where there is strong visibility of achieving planning 
during 2013 or 2014, a number of which were discussed  
at the Group’s Analyst and Investor Presentation held on  
24 October 2012. The Group estimates the cost of promoting 
strategic land during 2013 will, therefore, be circa £3.5 million 
higher than in 2012. This significant investment for future value 
generation will impact the profits deliverable in 2013 and will 
constrain the rate of growth in housing gross margin in 2013, 
compared to 2012, but will support further growth thereafter.
The continued growth in active sales outlets should enable the 
Group to deliver increased volumes, at a higher average sales 
price with improved margins. With a clear focus on controlling the 
capital employed of the Group through rigorous management of 
the landbank and tight control of work in progress, on the basis of 
stable market conditions, the Group will deliver strongly increasing 
returns on capital employed in 2013, with the expectation of 
continuing progress for the foreseeable future.

Housing market overview
UK Housing market in the medium term
The total UK housing stock is estimated to be just over  
26 million homes. The average activity level over the long term 
within this market has resulted in circa 1.1 million transactions 
per annum. Post 2007 the housing market suffered a significant 
fall in activity levels to between 800,000 and 900,000 
transactions, down from circa 1.6 million transactions  
during 2007. This contraction in activity was due to a large 
reduction in demand, driven by the lack of availability of 
mortgage finance, as banks delevered in the aftermath of 
the financial crisis. The fall in activity has been accompanied 
by a fall in the average sales price of homes from a peak 
of £199,600 in August 2007 to a low point of £154,700 in 
April 2009 (according to Halifax), a fall of 22%. Adjusted for 
inflation, the real decrease has been greater.
Underlying demand from household formation, based on the 
Government’s latest estimates released in November 2010, 
suggested that English households were expected to grow 
by 232,000 per year through to 2033. In terms of new build 
supply, the number of new home completions in England as 
reported by the Government for 2011/12 reached 117,870, an 
increase of 6% from 2010/11. Housing starts according to the 
Government were 103,750 in 2010/11, up from 88,690  
in 2009/10. Therefore the mismatch between longer term 
demand and supply appears to be growing.
UK Housing market in the short term
Pricing
In the last 12 months, pricing has remained relatively stable 
with the three key indices recording limited falls. This follows 
a similar picture during 2011 with some gains and some losses 
recorded, depending on the index. Pricing is driven by the 
factors affecting demand and supply within the overall  
housing market.
Demand
Although demand is affected by a range of factors, including 
affordability, confidence in the future direction of house prices 
and confidence over future employment prospects, the key 
demand determinant over the last four years has been the 
availability of mortgage finance. 
The number of monthly mortgage approvals has been relatively 
stable over the last 36 months during which time the level 
has fluctuated primarily in the range of 45,000 to 55,000 
approvals per month. The availability of mortgage finance has 
been particularly constrained for customers requiring higher 
loan to value mortgages and this has especially affected first 
time buyers. The higher deposit level requirements of lending 
institutions are being driven by the capital adequacy rules 
relating to mortgages contained within Basel II, aligned to 
more conservative credit scoring procedures by banks,  
which has led to many purchasers not being able to access 
mortgage finance. The average deposits of first time buyers 
have grown from 10% prior to the banking crisis to above 
20% now.

The UK housing market remains constrained by the 
availability of mortgage finance
One of the key deliverables within the Government’s strategy laid 
out in “Laying the Foundations: A Housing Strategy for England” 
is support for a new build indemnity scheme led by the Home 
Builders Federation and Council of Mortgage Lenders to provide 
up to 95% loan to value mortgages for new build properties in 
England, backed by a housebuilder indemnity fund. The NewBuy 
scheme launched during 2012, exclusively available on new  
build properties. Bovis Homes believes that NewBuy provides a long 
term, sustainable 95% LTV proposition for the UK housing market. 
Although the uptake was initially below the Group’s expectations, 
particularly given low customer awareness and the banks’ pricing 
of the product, the offering has become significantly more 
attractive to consumers as rates have begun to reduce.
Supply
The RICS data shows that, in the overall housing market in the  
last 2 years, the quantities of buyers and vendors has been 
relatively balanced. Additionally, given the historical levels of 
interest rates and thus mortgage payment levels, repossessions 
are running at low levels, with repossessions in the third quarter 
of 2012 being the lowest in a single quarter since 2007. This has 
meant that there have been limited forced sellers in the market.
Residential land
Movements in the price of residential land in the UK are directly 
driven by changes in residential house prices. This is due to the fact 
that the price that any developer is willing to pay for residential 
land is determined by the revenues and costs that the developer 
can expect on a piece of land at any point. Therefore, changes 
in residential house prices usually result in a movement between 
two and three times greater in residential land prices. With the 
significant fall in house prices in 2008, the price of residential land 
reduced throughout 2008 and into 2009. Since July 2009, the 
price of residential land has remained relatively stable.
 
 
This residential land price index is no longer published by the 
Government, but the Group’s experience of residential land prices 
remaining stable is backed up by Savill’s view of the market.
The National Planning Policy Framework (“NPPF”) is likely to 
increase the supply of residential land over the medium term. 
Rather than decreasing prices of residential land, this is expected  
to increase the speed with which developers can expand their 
outlet numbers, as long as they have the strength of balance sheet 
to invest.
Competitors
The Group continues to view the main competition for Bovis 
Homes as the second hand market. In a normal year, the Group 
would expect around 90% of residential transactions to be second 
hand, with pricing in the new build sector being set by reference to 
that market. The de-stocking by the housebuilders in 2008, 2009 
and to an extent 2010 led to new build contributing a greater 
proportion of residential transactions. This is partially due to the 
fact that housebuilders have been providing finance by way of 
shared equity products to home buyers, which has enabled certain 
buyers to acquire homes with lower levels of equity in the new 
build market compared to the second hand market. Given the 
ongoing low level of transactions, continuing customer support 
through shared equity schemes by housebuilders (including the 
Government backed FirstBuy scheme) and the positive, growing 
impact on the new build sector of the NewBuy scheme, the greater 
contribution from new homes is expected to continue in 2012.

Driving returns
The Group’s key drivers of 
returns will evolve as output 
capacity increases 
2013
• Market land purchases
•   Increasing number of 
operational sales outlets
•  Replacing written down sites 
with full margin sites
•  Improved asset turn of work 
in progress
•  Controlling build costs
•  Overhead control
Beyond 2013
•  Further increase in output capacity
•  Further improvements in 
profit margins
•  Increased strategic land contribution
•  Effective management of land bank 
relative to legal completions
•   Increasing sales prices due to 
changing product mix
• Overhead control
With the Group’s decision to reduce investment in 
land prior to the peak of the previous house price 
cycle, a reducing number of active sales outlets 
caused business activity to fall during 2009 and 
2010 with a consequential impact on the Group’s 
return on capital employed.
With the enhanced land investments since Q4 
2009, the business recommenced output growth 
during 2011 with further growth in 2012 and 
expected in 2013. Subject to market conditions 
remaining stable, this will lead to growth in 
returns, with an aspiration to achieve double digit 
ROCE in the near term.

Risk and uncertainties
As the activities of the Group evolve, the nature of the risks on which it is focused evolve. For instance, as the Group has acquired land 
successfully, the operational risk shifts to the progression of these sites into the build and sales phase, with the challenges of gaining 
detailed planning and of operationally gearing up the Group to increase build and sales activity. However, it is important to recognise 
that whilst conditions may have improved, profound uncertainties remain with regard to the UK economy which do suggest that 
appropriate levels of caution should be maintained.
Risk Description Mitigations
Economic environment
Persistent	economic	
recession	and	
government	austerity	
measures
Continued uncertainty in the 
global economy and the impact of 
government measures to reduce  
the budget deficit adversely affects 
consumer confidence and demand 
for new homes. Consequential 
impact is falling revenues, profits 
and potentially asset carrying values.
•  Close monitoring of lead indicators in the housing market notably the 
numbers of visitors to our sales outlets, sales rates and ASP. 
• Work in progress levels are matched to sales levels. 
•  Land acquisition is focused in the south of England, where the economy 
is expected to remain robust.
•  A cautious gearing position with a conservatively structured balance 
sheet is retained.
Mortgage finance
Limited	Mortgage	
availability	to	new	
home	buyers
The availability of mortgage finance, 
particularly deposit requirements 
for first time buyers, is fundamental 
to customer demand. Further 
restrictions on mortgages granted 
could reduce demand for homes 
and therefore revenues and profits.
•  Investing in land more suited to traditional homes, with reduced focus 
on the first time buyer.
•  Providing a range of purchase assistance schemes to our customers. 
•  Continually innovating to find additional ways to assist customers to 
purchase a home.
Land procurement
Insufficient	
investment	in	land	
to	support	business	
strategy
Expansion of the business and  
the delivery of the Group’s strategy 
to improve shareholder returns  
from the development of land is 
curtailed, with existing activity  
levels compromised.
•  Clearly defined strategy and geographical focus.
•  Rigorous due diligence for land acquisition to preserve defined 
hurdle rates.
•  Regular review the pipeline of new land purchases.
•  Investment in procurement and promotion of strategic 
land opportunities.
People
An	inability	to	attract,	
develop	or	retain	
good	people
The loss of key staff or the failure to 
attract, develop and retain suitable 
talent may inhibit the Group’s ability 
to achieve its strategy.
•  A reward system that motivates achievement of performance targets.
•  Development programme individually tailored for our employees.
•  Graduate and apprenticeship schemes.
Health, safety and environment
Unsafe	practices	
within	our	
construction	
activities	causing	
injury	or	death	to	
our	stakeholders	
and	damage	to	
communities	
A loss of trust in the ability of Bovis 
Homes to build homes safely and in 
an environmentally responsible way. 
Adversely affecting the reputation 
and financial health of the business.
•  A consultative committee reviews performance and regulatory 
requirements for health, safety and environmental matters.
•  Monitoring health, safety and environmental performance against a 
standard of excellence.
•  A requirement for regular training for all staff and site based personnel.
Planning and regulations
Non	compliance	to	
changes	in	legislation	
and	industry	
regulations
Increased costs and significant delays 
in production.
•  Land acquisition costs appropriately reflect latest and impending building 
regulations that cannot be mitigated.
•  Close monitoring of changes in planning policy by experienced team.
•  New building techniques and advances continue to be investigated, in 
response to the code for sustainable homes. The availability of mortgage finance and customer deposit 
requirements are the key issues currently facing the Group

Revenue
During 2012, the Group generated total revenue of  
£425.5 million, an increase of 17% on the previous  
year (2011: £364.8 million). Housing revenue in 2012  
was £402.0 million, 21% ahead of the prior year  
(2011: £332.1 million) and other income was £5.7 million 
(2011: £2.7 million). Three land sales were achieved in 2012, 
with a total revenue of £17.8 million (2011: four land sales 
with £30.0 million of recognised revenue).
Operating profit
The Group delivered an operating profit for the year ended  
31 December 2012 of £56.8 million at an operating margin of 
13.4%, as compared to £36.4 million in the previous year, at 
an operating margin of 10.0%.
Gross margin (excluding land sales) increased to 22.6% in 
2012 from 20.8% in 2011, with the gross margin (excluding 
land sales) in H2 2012 increasing to 23.6% from 21.2% in 
H2 2011. The gross margin benefited from the increased 
contribution from legal completions on sites acquired post 
the housing market downturn. Subject to stable market 
conditions continuing, with an increasing proportion of legal 
completions coming from sites acquired since the housing 
market downturn, the gross margin achieved in 2012 should 
improve further in 2013, even after absorbing the incremental 
investment in strategic land promotion costs. 
The profit on land sales was £4.8 million, a margin of 27.0% 
(2011: £2.7 million at a margin of 9.0%), which resulted in a 
total gross profit of £96.9 million at a gross margin of 22.8%, 
compared with £72.2 million and 19.8% in 2011.
Overheads, including all sales and marketing costs, increased 
in 2012 by 11.7%, as the Group invested early to support 
the large number of land assets acquired and the increased 
number of sales outlets. The overheads to revenue (excluding 
land sales) ratio improved to 9.9% in 2012 from 10.7%  
in 2011.
Profit before tax and earnings per share
Profit before tax increased by 69% to £54.1 million, 
comprising operating profit of £56.8 million, net financing 
charges of £2.9 million and a profit from joint ventures of  
£0.2 million. This compares to £32.1 million of profit before 
tax in 2011, comprising £36.4 million of operating profit,  
£4.5 million of net financing charges and a profit from joint 
venture of £0.2 million. Basic earnings per share for the year 
improved by 75% to 30.7p compared to 17.5p in 2011.
Financing
The Group incurred net financing charges of £2.9 million 
during 2012 (2011: £4.5 million). With an average net debt 
position of £12 million during 2012 (2011: average net cash 
£5 million), net bank charges for 2012 were £2.6 million 
(2011: £2.8 million), which included the amortisation of 
arrangement fees (£0.8 million) and interest and fee charges 
(£1.8 million). The Group incurred a £3.1 million finance 
charge (2011: charge of £4.3 million), reflecting the difference 
between the cost and the nominal price of land bought on 
deferred terms which is charged to the income statement over 
the life of the deferral of the consideration payable. The Group 
benefited from a £0.7 million (2011: £0.6 million) net pension 
financing credit during 2012, as a result of the expected return 
on scheme assets being in excess of the interest on the  
scheme obligations. With the changes in pension accounting, 
this credit will not recur in 2013. The Group also benefited 
from a finance credit of £1.7 million (2011: £1.6 million) 
arising from the unwinding of the discount on its available for 
sale financial assets during 2012. There were £0.4 million of 
other financing credits during the year (2011: £0.4 million of 
other credits). Taxation
The Group has recognised a tax charge of £13.3 million on profit 
before tax of £54.1 million at an effective tax rate of 24.5%  
(2011: tax charge of £8.8 million at an effective rate of 27.5%). 
The effective rate is in line with the statutory corporation tax rate 
of 24.5%. The Group has recognised a current tax liability of  
£5.9 million in its closing balance sheet as at 31 December 2012 
(2011: current tax liability of £4.0 million).
Dividends
In the light of the ongoing material improvement in the 
performance of the Group and the Board’s confidence in the 
continued delivery of Group’s strategy, the Board has proposed a 
2012 final dividend of 6.0p per share. This dividend will be paid on 
24 May 2013 to holders of ordinary shares on the register at the 
close of business on 2 April 2013. The dividend reinvestment plan, 
introduced in 2012, gives shareholders the opportunity to reinvest 
their dividends.
Combined with the interim dividend paid of 3.0p, the dividend 
for the full year totals 9.0p compared to a total of 5.0p paid in 
2011, an increase of 80%. The Board expects to grow dividends 
progressively as earnings per share increase.
Net assets
Net assets per share as at 31 December 2012 was 567p as 
compared to 545p at 31 December 2011.
Net assets were £758.8 million as at 31 December 2012,  
£30.2 million higher than at the start of the year. Inventories 
increased during the year by £65.8 million to £863.6 million, 
mainly due to an increase of £51.9 million in the value of 
residential land, as the Group invested in land ahead of usage 
during 2012. Other movements in inventories relate to an increase 
in part exchange properties of £7.8 million and an increase in work 
in progress of £6.2 million. Trade and other receivables reduced 
by £12.6 million, primarily as a result of a reduction in debtors 
related to land sales of £9.1 million. Available for sale financial 
assets held as current assets of £7.2 million (2011: Nil) related to 
units held in an investment fund into which the Group sold show 
home properties. Trade and other payables totalling £249.3 million 
(2011: £248.1 million) comprised land creditors of £123.8 million 
(2011: £128.8 million) and trade and other creditors of  
£125.5 million (2011: £119.3 million). Net cash reduced by  
£32.0 million.
Pensions
Taking into account the latest estimates provided by the Group’s 
actuarial advisors, the Group’s pension scheme had a deficit of 
£3.2 million at 31 December 2012, a deterioration of £0.8 million 
on the opening deficit of £2.4 million at 31 December 2011. 
Scheme assets grew over the year to £85.2 million from £76.7 
million and the scheme liabilities increased to £88.4 million from 
£79.1 million. The increase in liabilities was primarily a result of a 
fall in bond yields. Scheme assets benefited from a £2.8 million 
special cash contribution made by the Group into the scheme in 
July 2012.
Net cash and cash flow
Having started the year with a net cash balance of £50.8 million,  
the Group generated an operating cash inflow pre land expenditure 
of £130 million (2011: £114 million), demonstrating the strong 
underlying cash generation from the Group’s existing assets.  
Net cash payments in 2012 for land investment were £139 million 
(2011: £96 million). Non-trading cash outflow was £23 million.  
As at 31 December 2012 the Group’s net cash balance was  
£18.8 million with £24.4 million of cash in hand, offset by  
£5.2 million of loans received from the Government and  
£0.4 million representing the fair value of an interest rate swap. 
At the 31 December 2012, the Group had in place a £150 million 
syndicated facility, which was committed to September 2013.  
On 30 January 2013, the Group announced the replacement of 
this facility with a £125 million committed revolving credit facility, 
expiring in March 2017 and a three year term loan of £25 million.

Financial review
Financial risk and liquidity
The Group largely sees three categories of financial risk: 
interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Currency risk is 
not a consideration as the Group trades exclusively in the UK.
With regard to interest rate risk, the Group from time to time  
will enter into hedge instruments to ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to excessive fluctuations in floating rate borrowings is 
adequately hedged. The Group does not have a defined policy 
for interest rate hedging.
Credit risk is largely mitigated by the fact that the Group’s 
sales are generally made on completion of a legal contract at 
which point monies are received in return for transfer of title. 
During 2012, the Group continued to make a number of sales 
with the provision of a shared equity investment by the Group 
as a key part of the Group’s sales incentive packages, either 
via the Government ‘FirstBuy’ scheme or via the Group’s own 
‘Jumpstart’ scheme. This has led to an increase in the size of 
the Group’s long term receivable Available for Sale Financial 
Asset balance which at 31 December 2012 was £43.9 million 
versus £38.7 million at 31 December 2011. Whilst this  
does represent an increase in credit risk in total, each  
individual credit exposure is small given the high number of 
counter parties. On average, individual shared equity exposure 
amounts to £20,000 (2011: £23,000).
Details of the Group’s financing arrangements are included on 
page 27. The Group regards this new facility as adequate in 
terms of both flexibility and liquidity to cover its medium term 
cash flow needs.

Bovis Homes made strong progress in 2012, delivering  
significant profit improvement and substantial land investment. 
This has been achieved in broadly stable but challenging market 
conditions and I am pleased with the progress that has been 
made in pursuit of the Group’s growth strategy, which is driving 
our profitability and enhancing shareholder returns. 
Once again, I am pleased to introduce the Corporate Governance 
Report, prepared and approved by the Board. Its performance is 
supported by our high standards of corporate governance and I 
confirm that your Company was compliant with the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, published in June 2010, 
and remains so today. 
Leadership and effectiveness of the Board are the responsibilities 
of the Chairman and 2012 saw the full range of Board activities 
from review and challenge of strategy, including our Strategy 
Day, to presentations from regional management, site visits 
and review of succession planning for both our non-executive 
directors and executives. The balance of non-executive and 
executive directors worked well and the non-executive directors 
provided constructive challenge in open debate and assisted  
in developing strategy and proposals put forward by the 
executive directors. Board meetings were held in all of the 
operating regions during the year and included open discussion 
with management teams on their local market conditions, new 
sales outlets and progress with their objectives. 
There were no changes in our corporate governance best 
practice during 2012 but we have taken steps to comply early,  
in many respects, with the version of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code published in September 2012. We conducted 
our first external independent evaluation of the Board’s 
performance towards the end of 2011 and, during 2012, the 
Board reviewed an action plan and timetable at every Board 
meeting to ensure that we progressively addressed the areas 
identified for improvement, which were not fundamental  
in nature. The actions we have taken are explained more fully  
on page 33 of this Annual Report.
During the year, we reviewed our policy on diversity, without 
making any changes to the published version, which states that 
we will always make appointments to the Board based on merit, 
so that we have the right individuals in place. 
Once again, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Board for 
their collective support and strong individual contributions during 
the year, as we look forward to the challenges that lie ahead. 
We value our dialogue with all our shareholders, whether in 
meetings and presentations during the year or at our AGM. 
I have again written to major shareholders advising of my 
availability to hold discussions with them at their request.  
Our 2013 AGM will be held on 16 May 2013 and you will find 
the Notice at the end of this Annual Report. I look forward to 
meeting shareholders who are able to attend our AGM and to 
answering questions on any matters covered by the resolutions 
to be put to the meeting.

Corporate governance report
Introduction
The Company is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance as a contributor to the long term success 
of the business. It recognises that trust and engagement must 
exist between companies and investors and that appropriate 
boardroom behaviours are an essential component of 
governance best practice. To support its high governance 
standards and demonstrate that it takes them seriously, the 
Company has put a corporate governance framework in place, 
which fits the context of the business. This framework is 
described in the governance policy guidelines in the annex to 
this report on page 37.
This report sets out the Company’s compliance with the 
2010 UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (publicly available at www.frc.org.uk) and 
also describes how the governance framework is applied.  
The Code is supplemented by the Revised Turnbull Guidance 
to enable listed companies to comply with Listing Rule 9.8.6 
(5) and (6). The Board has reviewed the 2012 Code and taken 
steps to bring its approach into line early where it was thought 
right to do so. 
The Board is pleased to report that the Company has, 
throughout 2012, complied with and applied the provisions  
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, as set out below.
Information on share capital is provided on pages 58 and 59.
Board membership
Throughout the year and up to the date of this report, the 
Board comprised the Chairman, who is non-executive, three 
independent non-executives and two executive directors. 
Biographical details are set out on page 30 and their dates of 
appointment and attendance at Board meetings in 2012 are  
shown below.

The Board benefits from a broad range of expertise and 
experience and has a strong blend of skills and qualities,  
which allowed it to perform effectively and to a high level 
during 2012. There was no change to Board membership 
during the year and up to the date of this report.
Three non-executive directors have been determined by the 
Board as being independent in character and judgement with 
no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect, or 
could appear to affect, the director’s judgement. 
In accordance with the Code, all the directors will be offering 
themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. The Board 
strongly supports all the individual director’s re-elections, 
taking account of the balance of skills and expertise and the 
performance of the Board as a whole. 
All the directors have service agreements or contracts and the 
details of their terms are set out in the Remuneration Report 
on page 49. A further one year term was approved by the 
Board for John Warren on 16 January 2013. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and as permitted 
by the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has 
authorised and subsequently reviewed a number of potential 
conflicts of interest regarding the directors. The Board is 
satisfied that powers to authorise potential conflicts are 
operating effectively.
Board meetings
The Board generally meets eight times a year and at each 
meeting receives regular reports covering, for example,  
health and safety, customer satisfaction, current trading, 
operations and finance. At particular points in the year, the 
Board reviews strategy, budgets, forecasts, risks, financial 
statements and succession planning. The Board also 
reviews other topics, such as the market environment, land 
acquisitions, land sales, investor and analyst feedback, and 
technical and regulatory developments.  
Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 33
	
The Board receives a comprehensive pack a week in advance of 
each meeting plus any other information required to enable it to 
discharge its duties. Meetings are conducted in an atmosphere 
of open discussion, which enables the non-executive directors to 
challenge and test the strategy, policy and proposals put forward 
by the executive directors. 
In a typical year, half of all Board meetings are held in London  
and the balance in the regions, providing the opportunity to meet 
and assess local management teams and receive presentations 
from them. The Board also meets the Group Executive Committee 
(the senior management below the Board) at several points in  
the year. 
The annual strategy day is valued by the Board as providing  
the opportunity for an in-depth review of the immediate and 
longer term strategy for the Group, often supported by  
external contributions. 
The Chairman also holds meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executives present. 
Board performance evaluation
The Board undertook an internal formal evaluation of its own 
performance towards the end of 2012. This started with a 
questionnaire designed to capture views on progress and outcomes 
since the 2011 external performance evaluation and to assess 
performance and ongoing effectiveness across key areas. It was 
followed by an interview process, conducted by the Chairman, 
with the directors and Company Secretary to explore and develop 
the views expressed. 
A report was then presented to the Board and discussed.  
The overall conclusion was positive and the Board continues to 
operate effectively, with meetings being held in an atmosphere 
of open discussion and challenge, which facilitates debate 
and decision making. A common sense of purpose and strong 
communication amongst its members was maintained  
during 2012. The broad range of expertise and experience  
amongst the non-executive directors is a key strength and  
the diversity of backgrounds was thought reasonable.  
Future succession planning will include wider consideration of 
Board diversity, whilst looking to maintain the strengths the  
Board looks for. 
Areas for focus during 2013 were identified and, whilst not 
fundamental in nature, they are the subject of an action plan and 
are expected to add value. An overview is provided below.
The Board undertook the first external independent performance 
evaluation towards the end of 2011. This was conducted by 
Independent Audit (who have no other connection with the 
Company) using a document review, followed by an interview 
process. The Board determined the priority action items to  
be addressed during 2012 and monitored progress at every  
Board meeting. The Board’s focus on longer term strategy 
was increased, broader scenario stress testing was carried out, 
discussions were held on succession planning, and competitor 
business models and alternatives were considered. Risk reporting 
was improved and an increased focus on risk management was 
monitored. Presentations, discussion and site visits took place with 
senior management below the Board in each region.
Individual director assessments were carried out by the Chairman 
towards the end of 2012, using a discussion and interview process 
which covered overall understanding of the business, effectiveness 
of contribution and challenge, communications, time commitments 
and training and development. The outcomes showed that all 
the directors are contributing effectively and are demonstrating 
commitment to their roles.
Focus areas Objectives for 2013

Corporate governance report
The performance evaluation of the Chairman was led 
by the Senior Independent Director, with input from all 
other members of the Board. Directors felt that the last 
year continued the positive development of the Board’s 
effectiveness under the Chairman’s leadership in particular the 
planning of meetings, the management of Board agendas, 
and broad effective contribution by directors. The Chairman 
was considered to foster an environment of open debate 
and constructive challenge and to have maintained good 
professional relationships both with other members of the 
Board and relevant external stakeholders. 
It was also confirmed that the Board continued to benefit  
from having retained the Chairman’s in depth knowledge 
of the sector gained during his executive career with the 
Company, his continued participation in industry thinking, 
and his interaction with principal shareholders on matters of 
corporate governance.
Board committees
The Board is supported by standing Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and their memberships, roles and 
activities are set out in separate reports: Audit Committee  
on pages 54 and 55, Nomination Committee on pages 56  
and 57, and Remuneration Committee on pages 39 to 52.  
Each Committee reports to and has terms of reference 
approved by the Board and the minutes of Committee 
meetings are circulated to and reviewed by the Board. 
The Audit Committee is chaired by John Warren, the 
Remuneration Committee is chaired by Colin Holmes and the 
Nomination Committee is chaired by Malcolm Harris. 
The Board completed a performance evaluation of its 
Committees during 2012 and it was concluded that they were 
contributing and functioning effectively and all were achieving 
their respective remits.
Governance supporting the business
The Board aims to meet governance best practice where it fits 
our business and here some of the detail is set out.
Amongst matters reserved for the Board are leadership of 
the Group, approval of strategy and budgets, oversight of 
operations and performance, capital structure, financial 
reporting, internal controls and approval of major expenditure 
and transactions. 
The Board has approved a written division of responsibilities 
between the non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive 
and the role of the non-executive Deputy Chairman has 
been similarly defined. The Chairman is primarily responsible 
for the effective working of the Board, taking a leading 
role in determining its composition and structure, and also 
ensuring that effective communications are maintained 
with shareholders. The Chief Executive is responsible for the 
operational management of the Group, developing strategic 
operating plans and presenting them to the Board and for the 
implementation of strategy agreed by the Board. The Deputy 
Chairman supports the Chairman in ensuring that the Board is 
effective and constructive relations are maintained, in addition 
to acting as the Senior Independent Director, in which capacity 
he leads the annual performance evaluation of the Chairman 
and provides an additional point of contact for shareholders.

Board and committee structure
The Group’s Board and Committee structure, which maintains short and effective reporting lines, is as follows: Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 35
The Company’s Management Paper is subject to regular Board 
review and contains appropriate controls, authorities and procedures 
across the range of the Group’s activities and includes the authorities 
and decision making delegated by the Board to management.
The advice and services of the Group Company Secretary are 
available to the directors and all directors have access to the 
Company’s professional advisers and can seek independent 
professional advice at the Company’s expense. It is confirmed that 
no such advice was sought during the year.
Training is made available to directors when required and the 
Chairman ensures that directors continually update and refresh 
their knowledge and skills and familiarity with the Company,  
as appropriate to their role on the Board and on Board 
Committees. During 2012 the directors received regulatory  
and technical updates.
The Company has an insurance policy in place which insures 
directors against certain liabilities, including legal costs.
Shareholder engagement
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme, 
which allows the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director to 
regularly engage with our major shareholders. In addition to one-
to-one meetings through the year, the Company holds a series of 
presentations and meetings following the announcement of the 
final and half-yearly results. These presentations are made publicly 
available so that all shareholders can access them on the Group’s 
website at www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk. Towards the end of 
2012, the Company held an analyst and investor presentation 
focused on progress in delivering its strategy, during which the 
Company showcased site case studies presented by the Regional 
Managing Directors, which were well received. The Board reviews 
feedback on investor relations meetings and presentations, 
including the matters communicated and discussed and this has 
been positive and helpful. 
The Board also values other channels to obtain shareholders’ views 
and the Chairman, being responsible for ensuring that all directors 
are aware of any issues or concerns that major shareholders may 
have, writes to them annually advising his availability to meet and 
hold discussions on any matter. In addition, the Deputy Chairman 
(also the Senior Independent Director) is accessible to shareholders. 
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman and the other non-executive 
directors regularly attend the annual analyst and investor 
presentation, giving major shareholders the opportunity to put 
their views and hold discussion with them. 
All shareholders are invited to attend the Company’s AGM,  
which this year will be held on 16 May 2013. The full Board, 
including all Committee chairmen, attends and it values this 
meeting as a means of communicating with private investors 
and encourages their participation. All shareholders have the 
opportunity to exercise their right to vote and appoint proxies, 
if they are unable to attend, and to facilitate this we provide 
an electronic voting facility. Those attending the AGM have the 
opportunity to ask questions relevant to the business of the 
meeting and hear the views of other shareholders before voting. 
After the meeting the results of voting on all resolutions are 
published on the Group’s website.
Risk management and internal control
The Code states that a board is responsible for determining the 
nature and extent of the significant risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives. The Board has agreed that 
this important principle should form part of its consideration of 
strategy and all major decisions. The Board also has responsibility 
for maintaining sound risk management and internal control 
systems and, whilst their monitoring and review forms part of the 
work undertaken by the Audit Committee, the Board is ultimately 
responsible for the management of risk. Risk is a regular agenda 
item, which allows all directors to review the quality of risk 
management processes, risk mitigation and the risk appetite. 
The Board has complied with Principle C.2 of the Code by 
establishing a continuous process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks that are considered significant by the Company, 
in accordance with the Revised Turnbull Guidance. This process has 
been in place for the period under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Accounts and includes 
compliance with provision C.2.1. It is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risk and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Monitoring is based principally on reviewing reports from Internal 
Audit and from management and covers all controls, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management processes. The Board operates a robust process of 
risk reporting and has clear procedures for identification and 
monitoring of key risks.
The Audit Committee reviews the system of internal control  
and risk management systems annually and reports its findings 
to the Board. It receives reports from the internal and external 
auditors and management which assess the effectiveness of 
internal control and risk management and make recommendations 
for improvements. 36		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Governance

Corporate governance report
Risk assessment
As the activities of the Group evolve, the nature of the risks on 
which it focuses evolve. A key part of the system of internal 
control is the maintenance of the risk analysis and matrix, 
compiled using the risk universe as the basis of identification 
and a process of evaluation that distils the impact of key risks, 
mitigation measures and residual risk for Board review, leading 
to assessment of changing risk tolerance and, ultimately, the 
risk appetite. During 2012, a full risk review and an interim 
risk review took place. In setting its approach, the Board aims 
to ensure that the Company is neither prevented from taking 
opportunities nor exposed to unreasonable risk.
Control framework 
The Group maintains a control environment, which is regularly 
reviewed by the Board. As new procedures and working 
practices are adopted, risk factors are reviewed and internal 
controls embedded into systems. The principal elements of 
the control environment include regular board meetings, the 
regional structure, defined operating controls and authorisation 
limits, an Internal Audit function and a comprehensive financial 
reporting system.
There are a number of elements of the Group’s internal control 
and risk management systems that are specifically related to 
the Group’s financial reporting process.
Firstly, there is a well understood management structure which 
allows for clear accountability and an appropriately granular 
level of financial control. This structure is underpinned by 
documented authority levels for business transactions laid out 
in the Group’s Management Paper. The process of financial 
reporting is further supported by process documents for both 
internal management reporting and external Group reporting 
which stipulates amongst other things reporting timetables and 
contents of key management reports.
The Group maintains computer systems that record financial 
transactions and whose effectiveness is reviewed by the 
Internal Audit function on a regular basis. Any findings arising 
from these exercises are reported to the Audit Committee.
Control over cash expenditure which lies at the heart of any 
financial reporting process is key. The Group maintains tight 
control in this area through a centralised Group payment 
function, regularly maintained authorisation documents and 
segregation of authorisation accountability.
The Group maintains a regular weekly and monthly financial 
reporting cycle, allowing management to assess the financial 
progress of the Group, and this is further supported by a 
formal budget and forecast process which ensures that  
there is a robust and relatively recent financial forecast in  
place at all times against which to assess performance. 
Together with this financial reporting, the Group requires  
its regional management teams to report key business  
issues as part of a monthly regional reporting pack on a 
standardised basis.
Finally, there is a process of accounts preparation which 
ensures that there is an audit trail between the output from 
the Group’s financial reporting system and the Group’s 
financial statements as they are prepared for reporting.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operation for the foreseeable future. These enquiries consist 
of the production and review of detailed financial forecasts 
covering the period January 2013 to December 2015.  
These forecasts take into account current market trends with 
reasonable judgements and estimates applied to arrive at 
future cash flow estimates. As part of this review, the Group 
has analysed its forecast covenant compliance over this period 
linked to its banking facility, arriving at an assessment of  
the headroom evident between the forecast covenant  
test outcomes and the outcomes necessary to achieve 
covenant compliance. The Group entered into a new banking 
arrangement on 29 January 2013. This arrangement provides a 
committed revolving credit facility with a limit of £125 million 
maturing in March 2017 and a three year term loan of  
£25 million. As at 31 December 2012, the Group had no 
drawings under its then current £150 million revolving credit 
facility, and held net cash of £19 million. 
The Group regards the combination of existing cash in hand 
and this new banking arrangement as adequate in terms 
of flexibility and liquidity for its needs. More details on the 
Group’s approach to financial risk management are laid out in 
note 21. For these reasons, the Group continues to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing its accounts.

Corporate governance policy guidelines
These guidelines have been adopted by the Board and provide 
guidance on how corporate governance principles are applied by 
the Company. 
1 Board membership and balance
The composition of the Board is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure 
that it remains appropriate for successfully directing the business 
activities of the Group. Consideration is given to boardroom diversity 
and the mix of experience, skills, ability and vision of executive and 
non-executive directors by the Nomination Committee. The Nomination 
Committee and the Board give regular consideration to planning for 
succession to Board and senior management positions, ensuring that 
appropriate management development measures are in place. The Board 
currently comprises the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman (also the Senior 
Independent Director), two further independent non-executive directors 
and two executive directors.
2 Board selection
The Board receives recommendations on the appointment of directors 
from the Nomination Committee, following an evaluation of the balance 
of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity available on the Board.  
This Board committee comprises the independent non-executive 
directors, the Chairman and the Chief Executive and meets as required  
to consider proposed changes to Board membership.
3 Non-executive director independence
The non-executive directors are independent in character and judgement 
and free from any business or other relationship which could affect or 
appear to affect the exercise of their independent judgement on matters 
under consideration by the Board. The receipt of fair remuneration and 
being a shareholder is not considered to prejudice independence or 
prevent a non-executive director from acting independently.
4 Chairman and Chief Executive
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and there is a 
clear division of responsibilities between the two roles which has been 
set out in writing and approved by the Board. It is normal practice for the 
role of Chairman to be a non-executive position. The role of the Deputy 
Chairman has also been set out in writing and approved by the Board.
5 Number of directors 
An appropriate balance between executive and non-executive  
directors is maintained and the size of the Board is set as necessary to 
achieve this. The number of non-executive directors is decided so as to 
provide the diversity of skills, ability, vision and experience necessary 
for a sound independent contribution to the Board and the successful 
management of the Group’s business. By way of guidance, at least half 
the Board, excluding the Chairman, should comprise independent  
non-executive directors. 
6 Length of appointment
Executive directors are employed on service contracts with notice 
periods which do not exceed one year. Non-executive directors’ service 
agreements set the length of their appointments at periods of up to 
three years and their notice periods up to twelve months. Their total 
length of appointment would not normally exceed nine years.  
The renewal of service agreements after two three year terms is subject 
to rigorous review and based on annual re-appointment thereafter. 
Under the Articles of Association, all directors are subject to retirement 
by rotation at least once in every three years at the Annual General 
Meeting. New directors appointed by the Board must be re-appointed by 
shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting.
7 Director training
On appointment, new directors are given a comprehensive induction 
to the Group’s business activities, strategy and methods of operating, 
policies, procedures and management structure. As necessary,  
directors receive training to complement their roles on the Board  
and Board Committees.
8 Director remuneration
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the 
policy for executive remuneration and remuneration for the Chairman, 
each of the executive directors and senior management in accordance 
with its terms of reference. The Remuneration Committee comprises  
the independent non-executive directors and meets as required.  
External remuneration advice appropriate to the size and position of  
the Company is sought when required. Non-executive director 
remuneration, excluding that of the Chairman, is determined by the 
Board without their participation.
9 Financial information and internal control 
The review of submissions for Board approval in respect of the Group’s 
annual report and accounts, half-yearly financial report, preliminary 
statement, interim management statements and other public financial 
information is the responsibility of the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee reviews the Group’s system of internal control and oversees 
compliance therewith. The Audit Committee comprises the independent 
non-executive directors.
10 Supply of information
Senior management are responsible for providing the Board with 
appropriate, complete and timely information relevant to the Board’s 
discharge of its responsibilities, the monitoring of the performance of 
business activities, including significant variances, and progress with the 
implementation of strategies. Directors have reasonable access to senior 
management to enable them to make further enquiries as they consider 
in their judgement appropriate. 
11 Board procedures and authorities
The Chairman and Chief Executive determine the agenda for each 
Board meeting and papers are circulated in advance so that matters 
can be properly considered by the directors. A schedule of matters 
reserved to the Board for decision is in place and detailed authorities 
and associated procedures have been established for individual directors 
in the performance of their duties. The Board undertakes annual 
performance evaluations and a formal external performance evaluation 
every third year.
12 Relations with shareholders
The Board as a whole accepts responsibility for ensuring that a 
satisfactory dialogue is maintained with shareholders. The aim is  
to ensure that this dialogue is based on a mutual understanding of 
objectives. Investors are encouraged to attend the Annual General 
Meeting and to vote and participate.
13 Corporate policies
The Board ensures that corporate policies and procedures on ethical 
and corporate social responsibility matters, including sustainability, 
health and safety and the environment are maintained, monitored and 
reviewed on a regular basis.

Crown Park 
Chester, Cheshire Overview
The Chairman and Chief Executive have described in their 
statements how 2012 has been a further year of strong profit 
growth for Bovis Homes. Revenue increased and all metrics 
improved, with basic earnings per share rising by 75% and 
Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) adding 2.7% to  
reach 7.7%. The Group enters 2013 well positioned to further 
improve future returns through the compound effect of growing 
legal completions, the rise in the average sales price on new 
outlets and the increase in the operating margin. Additionally the 
future performance of the Group is being shaped by the ongoing 
acquisition of high quality consented and strategic land.
Remuneration policy
This progress is underpinned by our remuneration policy, which is 
considered to be working well and fully aligned with the Group’s 
strategy. As a result, the policy remains unchanged in the period 
under review and to date and no changes are planned for 2013. 
The principal aim of our remuneration policy is to align  
executive remuneration with the interests of our shareholders  
in order to drive the creation of long term shareholder value.  
The Committee is committed to setting remuneration at a level 
which is deemed fair, and which rewards performance.
Whilst recognising its primary duty to shareholders and the 
Company the Committee is mindful of the high level of public 
and political scrutiny around executive remuneration.  
We are committed to a remuneration structure which does 
not guarantee reward through excessive levels of fixed pay or 
through inappropriate incentives, but one that rewards genuine, 
sustainable performance in line with shareholder interests.
Remuneration in 2012
As discussed in last year’s report we have moved to make returns 
a greater focus of the business and its remuneration structure. 
These changes help ensure full alignment between management 
actions and the interests of investors and reflect feedback 
received from shareholders. 
During 2012, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) was introduced 
as one of the performance measures for the annual bonus plan 
and ROCE as one of the measures in the Long Term Incentive 
Plan. I am pleased to report that management have embraced 
these targets and the increase in ROIC to 8.0% reflects this. 
Indeed, the 2012 annual bonus has seen maximum payout 
achieved against this particular performance measure. 
Turning to the total annual bonus for 2012, I am delighted to 
say that strong performance against the financial and operational 
targets resulted in 84.2% of maximum being awarded, a similar 
level to that achieved for 2011. Profit before tax increased 
by 69%, there was strong focus on cash flow and customer 
satisfaction, and, of course, we saw the improvement in ROIC 
referred to above.
Regarding the Long Term Incentive Plan awards granted in 2010, 
50% will vest, due to the earnings per share (“EPS”) performance 
condition being met in full. This illustrates the strong EPS out-
performance of the Group over the past three financial years, 
against stretching targets, with absolute cumulative EPS having 
reached 58.8 pence. However, the total shareholder return 
(“TSR”) half of the award will lapse, with the performance of 
the Group being overshadowed by the recovery of others in the 
comparator group who started the three year performance period 
in relatively weaker positions.
Changes in remuneration policy for 2013
As mentioned above, the Remuneration Committee has 
reviewed its remuneration approach and concluded that it is 
serving the Group well, with no revisions envisaged for 2013. 
The Committee has also looked at the overall contribution 
of both the Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director 
and, at the end of 2012, decided that increases to their base 
salaries of 4.65% and 3.84% were appropriate. These changes 
came into effect from the start of 2013, with the Committee 
being confident that they were fully justified and commercially 
appropriate for the Group.
I would like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on the 
Committee for their support and valuable input during the year. 
I do hope you find that this report clearly explains the 
remuneration approach adopted at Bovis Homes Group PLC, and 
enables you to appreciate how it underpins the business growth 
and returns strategy. The Committee appreciates the dialogue 
and feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your 
support at the AGM on 16 May 2013.
Colin	Holmes
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce the 2012 Directors’ Remuneration 
Report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved 
by the Board. Over the last year the Group made strong progress 
in delivering its growth strategy, with significant increases in 
profit and returns, coupled with further substantial investments 
in high quality residential land. The achievement of these results 
in 2012 and, indeed, the long term goals of the Group, are 
underpinned by the Committee’s remuneration policy, which is 
set out in this report.

Remuneration report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. The report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board 
has complied with the principles and provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code published in June 2010  
(‘the Code’) relating to remuneration matters. The report 
will be presented at the AGM on 16 May 2013 for advisory 
approval and shareholders will be able to ask questions on  
the report at the AGM.
The report is divided into two parts. 
•  The first part sets out our remuneration policy and the 
governance structures which underpin this policy. This part  
is not required to be audited. 
•  The second part contains the remuneration tables that 
have been audited in accordance with the relevant  
statutory requirements. 
Unaudited information
The Remuneration Committee 
The following table details the members of the Remuneration 
Committee, their date of appointment, their role, and the 
number of meetings the Committee had during the year and 
their respective attendance:

Colin Holmes 01/12/2006 Chairman 5/5
Alastair Lyons 01/10/2008 Member 5/5
John Warren 01/03/2006 Member 5/5
All members of the Committee are independent and have 
no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in 
the matters to be decided, and no day-to-day involvement in 
running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages 
(including incentive plans and their performance criteria) and 
any changes to service contracts of the Chairman, executive 
directors and other designated senior executives including the 
Company Secretary. 
The Board determines the fees and overall remuneration of  
the non-executive directors without the non-executive 
directors’ participation.
No director or senior executive is involved in any decisions as  
to his or her own remuneration. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-
centre/corporate-governance).
Advisers to the Committee
During the year, the Committee took advice from Deloitte 
LLP, its appointed advisers since August 2009. Deloitte provide 
independent advice to the Committee on all aspects of 
executive remuneration. Deloitte attend Remuneration 
Committee meetings when invited by the Chairman of  
the Committee. Deloitte has also provided VAT advice to the 
Company during 2012. Deloitte are a founder member of 
the Remuneration Consultants Group and have signed the 
voluntary Code of Practice for remuneration consultants. 
The Committee always starts its meetings without executive 
management present. Thereafter the Committee may and 
does call upon Malcolm Harris (Chairman) and David Ritchie 
(Chief Executive) to assist in its discussions and deliberations 
on matters not pertaining to their own remuneration, service 
agreement or terms and conditions of employment. They were 
invited to attend all Committee meetings during the year.  
The Committee is also supported by Martin Palmer  
(Company Secretary), who acts as secretary to the Committee. 
No person was present during any part of a meeting when 
their own remuneration was being discussed. 
Principles of the remuneration policy
The Committee’s remuneration policy is designed to provide 
a market competitive, performance-related package which 
supports and facilitates the delivery of the Company’s strategy 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. The key 
principles of the remuneration policy are:
•  to ensure that individual rewards and incentives fairly reflect 
the performance of the individual, the Company and the 
interests of shareholders;
•  to provide a market competitive reward to attract, retain 
and incentivise executives of the calibre needed to deliver  
on the Company’s strategy and to create long-term 
shareholder value;  Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 41
•  the total package should include a significant variable element 
which is aligned to the performance of the Company, both in the 
short term and over the longer-term;
•  the package should be linked to the Company’s strategic goals, 
and how success against these goals is measured;
•  executives should build up shareholdings in the Company, 
principally through the vesting of long term incentive awards;
•  the policy should uphold the key principles of best practice on 
executive remuneration; and
•  remuneration should be designed to promote the long-term 
success of the Company and should not reward excessive risk 
taking and should not reward failure.
In setting the remuneration arrangements for the executives 
and senior management, the Committee considers the pay and 
conditions of the employees throughout the Group.
Competitive positioning
When considering how to position the remuneration packages for 
the executive directors, the Committee considers market data from 
UK listed companies of a similar size and complexity, as well as 
specific practice in the housebuilding sector. This data is provided 
by Deloitte, as independent advisers to the Committee.
The Committee positions salaries and incentive opportunities 
at what would be considered a market competitive level, whilst 
not seeking to “match the median”. As explained above the 
aim is that the arrangements should motivate management to 
deliver stretching performance in the interests of shareholders. 
Outperformance for shareholders should be recognised with 
superior reward.
Summary of remuneration policy
Balance between fixed and variable pay
The charts below show the balance between the fixed and variable 
components of the remuneration packages for both executive 
directors at “target” and “maximum” performance, illustrating

The salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 
2013 are as follows:

2013 base salary
% increase  
from 2012
David Ritchie CEO £450,000 4.65%
Jonathan Hill GFD £270,000 3.84%
 
In setting executive director salaries the Committee is always 
mindful of the need to avoid excessive and unjustified reward. 
Changes are only approved if full justification exists.
The increase for the CEO, David Ritchie, of 4.65% is warranted 
given his continued outstanding leadership and contribution to  
the Group. This is reflected in the strong profit improvement 
delivered by the Company in 2012 and the excellent positioning 
of the Group for 2013 following a difficult period for the house 
building industry.
The Committee decided that given his performance and increasing 
contribution to the Group, an increase of 3.84% would be made 
to the salary of Jonathan Hill, the GFD. 
An allowance of just over 3% of salary roll was provided for 
general staff increases. 
The Committee intends to review salaries of the executive 
directors on an annual basis, taking into account Group and 
individual performance, market conditions, and the remuneration 
arrangements of the senior management and the allowance for 
salary increase for the wider workforce.
In addition to base salary and pension the Group provides the 
executive directors with the following benefits: health insurance, 
membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Car Scheme for 
Employees and death in service assurance.
Pensions
David Ritchie is a senior executive member of the Bovis Homes 
Pension Scheme (“BHPS”). This is a contributory funded, defined 
benefit scheme, approved by HMRC. He receives a pension 
allowance of 20% of salary and some or all of this allowance can 
be used in relation to his membership of the BHPS, to the extent  
that it remains beneficial in light of new pension legislation.  
The balance is paid as a non-bonusable and non-pensionable  
salary supplement.
Jonathan Hill is a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal 
Pension Plan. The Plan is a contracted-in defined contribution 
arrangement. The Company’s contribution for Jonathan Hill is  
15% of his basic salary. 
There are no special early retirement or early termination provisions 
for executive directors.
Variable remuneration
Annual bonus
Policy, strategy and key changes
The purpose of the annual bonus is to drive and reward 
performance against stretching annual financial and non-financial 
goals which are consistent with the longer-term strategic aims of 
the business.
The bonus will normally be paid in cash. However, before paying 
cash bonuses, the Remuneration Committee reviews the proposed 
position regarding dividends. If no dividend is proposed, the 
Committee may choose to exercise its discretion to pay part, or 
all, of the bonus in ordinary shares, with the right to receive such 
shares normally deferred for two years.
The overall principles applying to the mix of performance  
measures are:
•  At least 70% of the bonus will be based on financial measures, 
with the balance being based on non-financial measures.
•  The financial criteria are likely to include one or more of profit 
before tax, cash flow and a capital return measure.
•  The non-financial measures are metrics that are currently 
considered key to the performance of the business.
The Committee believe that these metrics are strongly aligned 
to the Group’s business strategy and the creation of long-term 
shareholder value. The exact calibration of the bonus for the 
coming year, and the alignment of each measure with the business 
strategy is shown below.
Following a review of how reward is delivered and what reward 
is delivered for under the annual bonus scheme, it was concluded 
that the annual bonus scheme continues to measure key elements 
of performance that are in line with the Company’s stated strategy 
over the shorter term and so no changes are to be made for 2013 
in terms of either performance measures or quantum.

Assessment for the year ending 31 December 2012
The maximum opportunity for executive directors for the year ending  
31 December 2012 was 100% of salary. A breakdown of the  
performance against the measurement criteria is shown below. Bovis Homes Group  
Long Term Incentive Plan 2010
Policy, strategy and key changes
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of the  
overall remuneration package for executive directors should be 
linked to the delivery of shareholder value and performance  
against key financial metrics over the long term. The Long  
Term Incentive Plan therefore seeks to align the interests of 
management and shareholders and to place a significant amount 
of the total remuneration package at risk dependent on  
long-term performance.
Long term incentive awards are made in the form of performance 
shares or nil-cost options under the Bovis Homes Group Long 
Term Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 
2010 Annual General Meeting. Each award is made subject to 
the achievement of performance criteria as set out below and will 
ordinarily vest after three years. There is no cost to the participant 
and dividend equivalents will normally be paid on vesting shares.
During 2012 a ROCE target was introduced. No changes are 
proposed for 2013. 
Approach for awards in the year ending 31/12/2013
Key features of the long term incentive arrangements for 
executive directors for 2013 are as follows:
•  Award sizes remain at 100% of salary for 
executive directors.
•  One-third of the award will be subject to relative 
TSR performance against a bespoke housebuilder 
comparator index.
•  One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
cumulative EPS.
•  One-third of the award will be subject to stretching 
ROCE performance targets.
Performance conditions
Total Shareholder Return (one-third of total award)
One-third of the 2013 award will vest according to the  
Company’s TSR performance over a three year period against  
a bespoke unweighted index of housebuilding comparators.  
TSR performance relative to an unweighted index has been 
chosen as a performance measure as the Committee believe 
that this aligns reward with the delivery of superior market 
performance over the long term. The target for maximum vesting 
of outperformance of the index by 10% per annum is historically 
equal to at least upper quartile performance, and is thus deemed 
appropriately stretching.
Where TSR performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points. 
TSR will be calculated using a three month averaging period at  
the start and end of the period to smooth the impact of share 
price volatility on vesting.

Historical LTIP awards
The table below summarises the historical long term incentive awards made to the executive directors. 
Earnings per share (one-third of total award)
The Committee decided to use cumulative EPS targets for  
the 2013 awards.
In setting minimum and maximum absolute EPS targets for the 
2013 awards, the Remuneration Committee has considered 
data providing visibility over the three year performance  
period, including internal forecasts and analysts’ forecasts. 
Use of a cumulative three year EPS target, first used for the 
2010 awards, was again considered appropriate, given the 
ongoing uncertain environment. 
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set absolute 
minimum and maximum EPS targets of 130p and 165p per 
share to be measured on a cumulative basis over the three  
year performance period. 
Where EPS performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points. Where EPS falls below  
the minimum, none of the shares in the award judged by 
reference to EPS can be realised.

In setting minimum and maximum absolute ROCE targets  
for the 2013 awards, the Remuneration Committee has  
again considered data providing visibility over the three  
year performance period, including internal forecasts and 
analysts’ forecasts. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee 
has set absolute minimum and maximum ROCE targets for the 
2013 awards of 11.5% and 14.5%, to be measured in the third 
year of the performance period (2015).
Where ROCE performance is between target and maximum 
performance levels, the level of vesting shall be determined  
pro-rata between the two points.

2010 LTIP award
The LTIP awarded in 2010 will vest to the extent of 50% on 
9 March 2013. Half of the award was measured against EPS 
performance, whilst the other half of the award was measured 
against TSR performance against an index.
The threshold EPS target was 35p, and maximum target was 50p 
measured on a cumulative three year basis. Absolute cumulative EPS 
over the 3 year performance period was 58.8p. Therefore, all of the 
part of the award based on EPS will vest.
The threshold TSR target was performance equal to the index, 
and the maximum target was performance equal to 10% annual 
outperformance of the index. Actual TSR was below the median of 
the index, and therefore none of the award based on TSR will vest.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
2009 Bonus Replacement Share Plan
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Bonus Replacement Share Plan was 
approved at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and was designed to 
encourage and reward participants for delivering business recovery 
that resulted in the creation of shareholder value.
The Plan was operated in 2009 only as an alternative to entitlement 
for consideration for annual cash bonus. The performance condition  
was linked to an average share price target to be measured at the 
end of the performace period. The average market value of a share 
was below that required for any of the awards to vest and the 
Committee confirmed that all awards had lapsed in full.
Bovis Homes Group PLC  
Executive Share Option Scheme
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was 
established in 1997 and expired in 2007, with the granting of 
options being suspended in 2004. 
Shareholding guidelines
Guidelines exist for executive directors in respect of ownership 
of Bovis Homes’ shares. The Board expects executive directors 
benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or 
exercise of share options to retain 100% of the net value derived 
from the exercise as shares, after settling all costs and income tax 
due, until such time as the executive director holds shares with an 
historic cost equal to their basic annual salary. This is an increase 
from 50% of the net value derived last year and is intended to 
further align executives with the long term interests of shareholders.
Directors’ interests
The directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are 
shown below. All interests are beneficial.
There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any 
of the directors between 31 December 2012 and 22 February 
2013 other than the normal monthly investment in partnership 
shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors’ interests in share options and awards under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on page 51. There were  
no changes in the holdings of share options and awards under 
the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2012 and  
22 February 2013.  48		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Governance

Total Shareholder Return performance graph*
* This graph illustrates five year TSR performance and therefore does not represent the period under 
which the Long Term Incentive Plan is measured.
As required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the above 
graph shows the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share 
held in Bovis Homes Group PLC over the last five financial 
years, compared to the FTSE 250 index and the median of the 
FTSE 250 housebuilders over the same period. 
As a constituent of the FTSE 250, the Committee considers 
both these indices to be relevant benchmarks for comparison 
purposes. 
The middle market price of the Company’s shares at  
31 December 2012 was £5.75 (2011: £4.39). During the  
year ended 31 December 2012 the share price recorded a 
middle market low of £3.99 and a high of £5.75. As at  
the date of publication of this report the share price stood  
at £6.72.
Remuneration of senior management and 
other below board employees 
In addition to its responsibility for executive directors, the 
Committee is also involved in the consideration of the 
remuneration arrangements for the senior management team, 
in conjunction with the Chief Executive. 
The Committee believes that it is highly important that the 
remuneration of the senior management is aligned with that  
of the executive directors in order that the most senior 
individuals in the Company are driven to achieve the same 
overall strategic goals, but also that these individuals are 
rewarded for the performance of areas under their control  
and influence. A summary of the senior management 
remuneration is shown below.
Element of remuneration Alignment with strategy and remuneration arrangements of executive directors
Base	salary Set at market competitive levels taking into account the size and scope of the role, and the 
experience and past performance of the incumbent.
Annual	bonus Targets are similar to those for executive directors in order to create alignment, and include 
Group and divisional profitability, cash flow, land acquisition, ROIC and customer service targets.
Long	Term	Incentive	Plan Senior management employees participate in the long-term incentive plan, with the same 
targets as the executive directors. The Committee believes that this drives cohesive behaviour 
and the creation of long-term shareholder value. 
Total	Direct	Remuneration The Committee believes that, as for executive directors, a significant proportion of the total 
remuneration package for senior management should be variable and subject to performance.
In setting the level of pay, both fixed and variable, the Committee considers both 
competitiveness against the external market and the internal relativities in relation to the level of 
pay for executive directors, and the level of pay of the wider management and wider workforce.
Pensions Senior management are eligible to participate in either the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme or the 
defined contribution Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan. The Committee is mindful of the 
same taxation considerations for senior management as it is for the executive directors.

All of the share options granted by the Company were granted at  
the market price prevailing on the date of grant, with the exception 
of Save As You Earn options which were granted at a 10% discount 
to the market price on the prevailing date of grant. There was  
no payment required to secure the grant of any share options.  
There was no change in the terms and conditions of any outstanding 
options granted under either the Executive Share Option Scheme 
(‘Exec’) or the Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE’) during the  
financial year.
Share options held in the Save As You Earn Option Scheme, which 
are not subject to performance conditions, may under normal 
circumstances be exercised during the six months after maturity of 
the savings contract.
In respect of the executive director serving at 31 December 2012 
holding Executive Share Options, no share options were held under 
an HMRC approved scheme. 
During the year, awards of 134,436 shares were made to 
executive directors at up to 100% of basic salary, exercisable

Audit Committee report
Introduction
The Audit Committee provides independent monitoring, 
guidance and challenge to executive management with  
the aim of ensuring high standards of reporting, controls  
and compliance. In doing so, it performs an important function 
for the Board and in providing assurance for shareholders.  
The Committee’s role covers the four connected areas of 
financial reporting, risk, internal control and oversight of 
external and internal audit. 
Committee membership and meetings
All members of the Committee are independent non- 
executive directors. John Warren, who chairs the Committee, 
is a qualified accountant and a previous group finance 
director who has past experience in chairing audit committees 
and fulfils the requirement for recent and relevant financial 
experience. Alastair Lyons and Colin Holmes are also  
qualified accountants and have broad business and  
operational experience and chair audit committees of 
listed companies. This combination provides a high level 
of financial expertise to fulfil the duties of the Committee. 
Recommendations on Committee membership are made to the 
Board by the Nomination Committee and it is also reviewed as 
part of the Committee’s performance evaluation. There were 
no changes to Committee membership during the year.

The Committee met three times in 2012 and an overview of 
the main activities is provided below. Detailed papers and 
information were received sufficiently in advance of meetings 
to allow proper consideration of matters for discussion. 
The Company Chairman, Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director attend meetings by invitation and were present at all 
meetings in 2012. The external auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, and 
the Internal Audit Director were also in attendance at  
all meetings. 
The Committee also met with the external auditors and 
Internal Audit, without executive management, following 
review of the 2011 financial statements, the final audit and 
the 2011 Internal Audit report and no matters of concern were 
raised in this discussion. John Warren also met privately with 
both the audit engagement partner of the external auditors 
and the Internal Audit Director during the year. The Committee 
is supported by Martin Palmer (Group Company Secretary), 
who acts as secretary to the Committee.
Responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to oversee and 
monitor: the integrity of the financial statements, including 
reviewing the findings of the external auditors; the effectiveness 
of systems for internal control, financial reporting and risk 
management; the effectiveness of Internal Audit; the external 
audit process, including the appointment of the external 
auditor, their fees, independence and objectivity; and the 
nature and scope of the external audit and its effectiveness. 
The Committee is also responsible for the policy on the 
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit 
services, taking into account relevant ethical guidance. External 
legal or other independent professional advice can be obtained 
at the Company’s expense and this facility was not utilised 
during the year.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-
centre/corporate-governance).
Main activities during the year
The Committee followed a programme structured around the 
annual reporting cycle and reports from Internal Audit, the 
external auditors and management. The key financial reporting 
focus was, as usual, on the integrity of the preliminary results, 
the Annual Report, the half-yearly results and the half-yearly 
financial report, all published under IFRS. As part of the 
review process, the Company’s key accounting judgements 
were considered, together with an assessment of subjective 
areas, and the Committee satisfied itself that the Annual 
Report presented a true and fair view. Matters informing 
the assessment of going concern were considered, as 
described on page 36. Presentations for analysts following the 
announcement of the final and half-yearly results also received 
scrutiny before submission to the Board. Submissions from the 
external auditors relating to the 2011 final audit, the 2012 
interim review and the audit strategy for the 2012 final audit 
were discussed and assessed, and the results and effectiveness 
of the 2011 final audit were reviewed by assessing delivery 
and content against the audit plan, discussing and challenging 
conclusions and audit judgements and obtaining feedback 
from those involved.  Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 55
The Committee reviewed the system of internal control and risk 
management systems and reported its findings to the Board that 
there were no material control weaknesses. Reports from Internal 
Audit were considered and the content, conclusions and results 
were challenged and tested and progress with the actions agreed 
with management were reviewed. The focus of the Internal 
Audit programme for 2013 and the resources that would be 
needed were also reviewed. A review was also completed of the 
Committee’s terms of reference and the Company’s whistleblowing 
policy and arrangements.
External auditors
During the year, the Committee reviewed the independence 
and objectivity of the external auditors, which was confirmed in 
an independence letter containing information on procedures 
providing safeguards established by the external auditor. 
Regulation, professional requirements and ethical standards are 
taken into account, together with consideration of all relationships 
between the Company and the external auditors and their staff. 
Relations with the external auditors are managed through a series 
of meetings and regular discussions and we ensure a high quality 
audit by challenging the key areas of the external auditor’s work. 
The relationship is kept under review and, following adopted 
practice, the audit engagement partner rotated on completion of 
the 2011 final audit after five years in the post.
Our 2013 AGM Notice contains a resolution for the re-appointment 
of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors to the Company. In making this 
recommendation, the Committee took into account, amongst 
other matters, the independence and objectivity of KPMG  
Audit Plc, their continuing effectiveness and cost. The external 
auditors have been in post since flotation in 1997 and there are  
no contractual restrictions on the choice of external auditor.  
The 2013 AGM Notice also contains a resolution to give the 
directors authority to determine the auditors’ remuneration,  
which provides a practical flexibility to the Committee. 
The Committee keeps under review its policy which requires the 
Committee to approve all non-audit services proposed to be 
undertaken by the external auditors, with the exception of  
tax advisory and compliance work undertaken in the ordinary 
course of business and audit related services, which are treated as 
pre-approved. When an approval request is made, the Committee 
will have due regard to the nature of the non-audit service, 
whether the external auditor is a suitable supplier, whether there 
is likely to be any threat to independence and objectivity in the 
conduct of the audit, and the related fee level, both separately and 
relative to the audit fee. For an analysis of fees paid to the external 
auditors, see note 5 on page 74. The non-audit services provided 
during the year related to tax advisory and compliance work. 
Provision of these services is not considered to impair the external 
auditor’s independence or objectivity.
Internal audit function
The Internal Audit function follows an approved audit programme 
using a risk based methodology and the Committee has approved 
its remit. Reporting to the Committee includes summaries of all 
completed and ongoing audit assignments, allowing members 
of the Committee to question the Internal Audit Director. 
Progress against the annual audit programme is reviewed and 
management’s response and speed of action in respect of issues 
raised is monitored. The effectiveness, workload and adequacy of 
resources of the Internal Audit function is kept under review using 
a planning, reporting and review regime. The freedom, scope and 
access allowed to Internal Audit in performing their duties during 
the year were confirmed as unrestricted and the Internal Audit 
Director has direct access to the Chairman of the Committee. 
An external formal review of the effectiveness of the Internal Audit 
function was completed towards the end of 2012 and the overall 
outcome was positive, with opportunities being identified to add 
value and support business growth.
Performance evaluation
The Committee commenced a performance evaluation towards the 
end of 2012, using a discussion and interview process designed to 
produce an objective assessment of the Committee’s performance 
and audit effectiveness. The Committee was found to be effective 
and continued to be well run, with the level of accounting 
and financial expertise providing strong challenge. It was also 
concluded that the Committee had appropriate terms of reference 
and had fulfilled its remit in 2012 and that the audit process 
continued to be effective.

and nominating candidates for Board appointment and assists 
the Board in its oversight of succession planning for both 
directors and senior executives.

The Committee met four times in 2012 and an overview 
of the main activities is provided below. Papers were 
received sufficiently in advance of meetings to allow proper 
consideration of matters for discussion. The Committee is 
supported by Martin Palmer (Group Company Secretary),  
who acts as secretary to the Committee.
Responsibilities and terms of reference
The Committee’s main responsibilities are to regularly  
review the structure, size and composition of the Board 
(including skills, knowledge, experience and diversity) and 
make recommendations to the Board on any changes needed. 
It gives full consideration to succession planning for directors 
and senior executives, taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company and the skills and expertise 
needed in the future. 
The leadership of the Company is kept under review and  
the Committee leads the process for Board appointments, 
which are conducted on merit, against objective criteria 
(including diversity), using the services of an appropriate 
external search consultant. The Committee makes 
recommendations to the Board, including the re-appointment 
of non-executive directors, the proposed re-election of 
directors at the AGM, and membership of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. It also reviews the results of the 
Board performance evaluation that relate to the composition 
of the Board. External legal or other independent professional 
advice can be obtained at the Company’s expense and this 
facility was not utilised during the year.
The Committee’s terms of reference are available on the 
Company’s website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk/investor-
centre/corporate-governance).
Main activities during the year
During the year, the Committee reviewed the structure, size 
and composition of the Board and concluded that the present 
Board balance and composition remained appropriate, but 
would be kept under review. Succession planning for the non-
executive directors was considered looking forward to 2015, 
including the phasing of new appointments to allow a period 
of overlap before experienced incumbents depart. Planning for 
executive director and senior management succession was  
also discussed.
The Committee recommended that all the directors stand 
for re-election at the 2012 AGM in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, having considered the matter 
on a case by case basis. The Nomination Committee report 
was approved for inclusion in the 2011 Annual Report and 
the Commitee’s terms of reference were reviewed without 
ammendment. The Committee also reviewed the results of the 
2011 external Board performance evaluation relating to Board 
composition and to ensure all directors have sufficient time to 
devote to their duties.  
A policy on the renewal of non-executive directors’ service 
contracts is in place so that renewal following the conclusion 
of a second three year term is recommended to the Board 
based on annual re-appointment, subject to satisfactory 
performance and there being no requirement to re-balance 
the Board. Service contracts for John Warren and Colin Holmes 
were recommended to the Board for renewal for further 
one year terms, following consideration of their respective 
contributions, performance and commitment to their roles. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 57
The principle of boardroom diversity is strongly supported and  
the Committee reviewed the diversity policy, published in 
September 2011, without amendment. The policy sets out that 
appointments to the Board will always be based on merit so that 
the Board has the right individuals in place and that diversity is 
seen as an important consideration as part of the objective  
criteria used to assess candidates to achieve a balanced board.  
The Committee will continue to consider boardroom diversity in 
future succession planning.
Performance evaluation
The Committee completed a performance evaluation towards  
the end of 2012 and a report was presented to the Committee 
and discussed. The Committee was found to be effective and it 
was concluded that it had appropriate terms of reference and had 
fulfilled its remit in 2012.

Directors’ report
The directors have pleasure in submitting the annual report of 
the Company and its subsidiaries to the shareholders, together 
with the audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Principal activities and business review
The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiary 
undertakings has remained housebuilding in the UK.  
The information that fulfils the requirements of the business 
review commences on page 8 and provides a full review of the 
Group’s performance and prospects.
Information on the risks to which the performance of the 
business is subject, including key social, environmental and 
ethical risks, is provided on page 22. These risks are regularly 
reviewed by the Board and controls and mitigation processes 
put in place as explained in the report on corporate governance.
Key financial performance indicators include pre tax profit, 
earnings per share, operating margin, return on capital 
employed, consented and strategic land bank, volume of legal 
completions and net assets. Other key performance indicators 
are also monitored including those relating to health and 
safety, customer satisfaction and corporate social responsibility. 
Key performance indicators are set out on pages 20 and 21.
Results and dividends
The Group made a profit after taxation of £40.9 million  
(2011: £23.3 million). An interim dividend of 3.0p (2011: 1.5p) 
net per share was paid on 23 November 2012. The Board 
proposes to pay, subject to shareholder approval at the 2013 
Annual General Meeting, a final dividend of 6.0p  
(2011: final dividend of 3.5p) net per share in respect of the 
2012 financial year on 24 May 2013 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 2 April 2013. On this 
basis, the total dividend for 2012 will be 9.0p (2011: 5.0p). 
The dividend reinvestment plan, introduced in 2012, gives 
shareholders the opportunity to reinvest their dividends.
Directors
Details of the directors are shown on page 30.
Details of directors’ emoluments, pension rights, service 
contracts and directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company are included in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 39 to 52.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all the 
directors will retire at the Annual General Meeting, to be held 
on Thursday 16 May 2013, and being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-appointment.
Powers of the directors
Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, UK legislation 
and any directions given by special resolution, the business of 
the Company is managed by the Board, which may exercise 
all the powers of the Company. The directors have been 
authorised to allot and issue ordinary shares and to make 
market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares and these 
powers may be exercised under authority of resolutions of the 
Company passed at its Annual General Meeting. The rules in 
relation to the appointment and replacement of directors are 
set out in the Company’s Articles of Association.
Share capital
At the date of this report the Company’s issued share capital 
comprised a single class of share capital which is divided 
into ordinary shares of 50 pence. As at 22 February 2012, 
133,815,751 ordinary shares of 50 pence each have been 
issued, are fully paid up and are quoted on the London  
Stock Exchange.
The rights and obligations attaching to the Company’s ordinary 
shares are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association, 
copies of which can be obtained from Companies House 
in the UK or by writing to the Group Company Secretary. 
In particular, subject to applicable statutes, shares may be 
issued with such rights or restrictions as the Company may by 
ordinary resolution determine, or (if there is no such resolution 
or so far as it does not make specific provision) as the Board 
may determine. Shareholders are entitled to attend, speak 
and vote at general meetings of the Company, to appoint 
one or more proxies and, if they are corporations, to appoint 
corporate representatives. 
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company 
every shareholder present in person or by proxy and entitled to 
vote has one vote and on a poll every shareholder present in 
person or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote for every 
ordinary share held. Further details regarding voting, including 
the deadlines for voting, at the Annual General Meeting can 
be found in the notes to the Notice of the Annual General 
Meeting at the back of this annual report and accounts.  
No shareholder is, unless the Board decides otherwise, entitled 
to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general 
meeting or to exercise any other shareholder rights if he or any 
person with an interest in shares has been sent a notice under 
section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and has failed to 
supply the Company with the requisite information within the 
prescribed period. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 59
Shareholders may receive a dividend and on a liquidation may 
share in the assets of the Company. None of the ordinary shares 
of the Company, including those held by the Company’s share 
schemes, carry any special rights with regard to control of  
the Company. Employees participating in the Bovis Homes Group 
Share Incentive Plan may direct the trustee to exercise voting rights 
on their behalf at any general meeting.
The instrument of transfer of a certificated share may be in any 
usual form or in any other form which the Board may approve. 
The Board may refuse to register any instrument of transfer of a 
certificated share which is not fully paid, provided that the refusal 
does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking 
place on an open and proper basis. 
The Board may also refuse to register a transfer of a certificated 
share unless the instrument of transfer: (i) is lodged, duly stamped 
(if stampable), at the registered office of the Company or any 
other place decided by the Board accompanied by the certificate 
for the share to which it relates and such other evidence as the 
Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor 
to make the transfer; (ii) is in respect of only one class of shares; 
and (iii) is in favour of not more than four transferees. Transfers of 
uncertificated shares must be carried out using the relevant system 
and the Board can refuse to register a transfer of an uncertificated 
share in accordance with the regulations governing the operation 
of the relevant system and with UK legislation. There are no other 
limitations on the holding of ordinary shares in the Company and 
the Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities 
or on voting rights.

Directors’ report
Corporate governance
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. Details relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code are given in the 
Corporate Governance report on pages 31 to 37.
Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the directors, 
to the extent permitted by law and the Company’s Articles 
of Association, in respect of all losses arising out of or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties  
and responsibilities, as directors of the Company or any of  
its subsidiaries.
Employees
The Group’s employment policies do not discriminate between 
employees, or potential employees, on the grounds of sex, 
sexual orientation, age, colour, creed, ethnic origin or religious 
belief. It is Group policy to give full and fair consideration 
to the employment needs of disabled persons (and persons 
who become disabled whilst employed by the Group) where 
requirements may be adequately covered by these persons  
and to comply with any current legislation with regard to 
disabled persons.
The Group has a human capital strategy focused on the  
key areas of leadership and management development, 
employee development, recruitment and retention, and 
employee engagement. This strategy is aligned with the 
Group’s business strategy and objectives, matching  
resources to future requirements.
It is the policy of the Group to train and develop employees  
to ensure they are equipped to undertake the tasks for  
which they are employed, and to provide the opportunity 
for career development equally and without discrimination. 
Employees receive regular training in health, safety and 
environmental matters.
Information about the Group’s performance and other matters 
is provided regularly by a news magazine and electronic 
bulletins, by consultations at staff meetings and through 
elected employee representatives.
The Group operates both a defined benefit pension scheme 
and a defined contribution pension scheme.
The Company has a Share Incentive Plan, a Save As You Earn 
Share Option Scheme, a Share Option Plan, an Executive Share 
Option Scheme (expired), and a Long Term Incentive Plan to 
motivate employees and encourage strong involvement with 
the Group. See note 20 to the accounts for details of the  
share schemes.
Corporate social responsibility
The Group, in carrying out its business activities, is pursuing 
its commitment to sustainable development and transparent 
corporate conduct in social and ethical matters, corporate 
governance, health and safety and the environment.  
The Group’s corporate social responsibility policy commitments  
focus on sustainable development, the environment, health 
and safety, research and development, human resources, 
an ethical code of conduct and stakeholder engagement. 
The Group Executive Committee co-ordinates developments 
in this area and an established process of risk identification 
and management is embedded in all activities, regardless of 
whether risk is classed as strategic, operational, financial, or 
compliance-related, legal, environmental, social or connected 
to reputation. The Health, Safety and Environmental 
Consultative Committee monitors and maintains the high 
health and safety and environmental standards expected from 
offices and sites.
The Board addresses risk in its own decision making and 
takes regular account of the significance of sustainability, 
environmental, social and ethical matters through consideration 
of relevant information and data in Board reports and other 
documentation provided. Ultimate responsibility rests with the 
Board and induction and training in this area is supported.
Further details of risks and policies and procedures for their 
management are included in the Group’s Corporate Social 
Responsibility report dated 22 February 2013, which includes 
key targets and performance data. A copy of the report is 
available on the Group’s website www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk 
and on request to the Group Company Secretary
Donations
The Group made charitable donations in the year amounting 
to £911 (2011: £4,950). No political donations were made in 
either year by the Group or Company.

The Group‘s payment policy in respect of all suppliers is to 
settle agreed outstanding accounts in accordance with terms 
and conditions agreed with suppliers when placing orders.
The Group’s creditor days relating to trade creditors at the  
year end in respect of goods and services supplied in the 
normal course of trade amounted to 53 days (2011: 54 days). 
The calculation excludes land purchase creditors.
The aggregate amount owed to trade creditors by the 
Company was £nil throughout 2011 and 2012. Bovis	Homes	Group	PLC		 |		 61
Significant agreements
During the period under review and until 30 January 2013, 
the Group was party to a syndicated facility agreement with its 
relationship banking group relating to the provision of a  
£150 million revolving loan facility. Since 30 January 2013, the 
Group has been a party to a syndicated facility agreement with its 
relationship banking group relating to the provision of a  
£125 million revolving loan facility and an agreement relating to 
a three year bi-lateral term loan of £25 million. In the event of 
a change of control, provisions in the agreements would allow 
lenders to withdraw the facility. At 31 December 2012, the  
Group had no borrowing positions under the then current  
banking arrangement.
All of the Group’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Under these provisions, a change of control 
would be a vesting event, allowing exercise of outstanding options 
and awards, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions  
as required.
There are a number of commercial contracts that could alter in the 
event of a change of control. None is considered to be material in 
terms of their potential impact on the Group in this event.
Annual General Meeting
Notice of the 2013 Annual General Meeting to be held on 
Thursday 16 May 2013 is set out on pages 95 to 97.  
Members wishing to vote should return forms of proxy to the 
Company’s Registrar not less than 48 hours before the time 
for holding the meeting. Shareholders with internet access may 
register their voting instructions via the internet by going to  
www.eproxyappointment.com.
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all the 
directors will stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
During 2012, the Board reviewed its composition and succession 
planning arrangements. As a result, it is proposed that the 
Articles of Association be amended at this year’s Annual General 
Meeting to increase the overall limit on the remuneration of all 
non-executive directors. This will provide the Board with flexibility 
in succession planning and support a progressive and orderly 
refreshing of the Board, allowing new non-executive directors a 
period of induction before experienced incumbents depart.  
In addition, it will provide flexibility, in light of the growth of 
the Group, should the Board wish to appoint an additional non-
executive director. The Articles may only be amended by a special 
resolution of shareholders at a general meeting, unless expressly 
specified to the contrary therein.
As in prior years, it is proposed that a general meeting that is 
not an Annual General Meeting can be called on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice. This resolution is required as a result of 
the implementation of the Shareholder Rights Directive, which 
increased the notice period for general meetings of the Company 
to 21 days unless shareholders have approved the calling of 
meetings on 14 days’ notice. 
Ability to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice would only be 
utilised in limited circumstances and where it was to the advantage 
of shareholders as a whole.
At a meeting on 22 February 2013, the Board resolved that a 
resolution be submitted to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting proposing the renewal of the authority to enable the 
Company to purchase up to 10% of its own shares. At the 
present time, the directors have no wish to exercise the authority 
to purchase any of the shares of the Company, but consider that 
it is appropriate to have the flexibility to do so. Any shares so 
purchased would be cancelled.
The directors believe that all the resolutions proposed to be 
considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, 
unanimously recommend all shareholders to vote in favour of the 
resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of their own 
shares in the Company.
Auditors
Each person who is a director at the date of approval of this report 
confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• each director has taken all the steps that he ought to have 
taken as a director to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.
The auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, have indicated their willingness to 
continue in office and, in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006, resolutions concerning their re-appointment 
and remuneration will be placed before the Annual General Meeting.
Director’s responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report 
and the Group and Parent Company financial statements, in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company 
financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law, the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and 
of their profit or loss for that period. 62		 |		 Annual	report	and	accounts		 |		 Governance
Governance
Directors’ report
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
• for the Group and Parent Company financial statements, 
state whether they have been prepared in accordance  
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group 
and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent 
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to 
safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are 
also responsible for preparing a directors’ report, report on 
directors’ remuneration and report on corporate governance 
that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed  
on page 30 of this anual report confirm that, to the best of 
their knowledge:
a)  the Group and Parent Company financial statements in this 
report, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS 
as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretation and those parts of 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and of 
the Group taken as a whole; and
b)  the management report contained in this report includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the Group 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties they face.

Notes to the financial statements
Bovis Homes Group PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the 
year ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) and the Group’s interest in associates 
and joint ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 22 February 2013.
1. Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (adopted IFRS) and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). On publishing the 
Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the 
Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
2. Basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that 
affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis 
of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from 
these estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which  
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a 
significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 26.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.  The Directors reviewed detailed 
financial forecasts and covenant compliance covering the period to December 2013 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of £24.4 million and had total borrowings of £5.6 million. After the year end the 
Group has entered into a £125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three year term loan of £25 million. This financing 
arrangement replaced the Group’s previous £150 million committed revolving credit facility.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the Company’s year ended 31 December 2012. 
They have had no material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 7 – ‘Transfers of Financial Assets’. The Amendments require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, e,g, securitisations 
and should enable users to understand the possible effects of any risks that may remain with the transferor. The amendments also require additional 
disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around the end of a reporting period.
Amendment to IAS 12 – ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets’. The Amendment introduces an exception to the current measurement principles 
of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property. 
The exception also applies to investment properties acquired in a business combination accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
provided the acquirer subsequently measure these assets applying the fair value model.
The other standards and interpretations that are applicable for the first time in the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, 
have no effect on these financial statements.
3. Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made 
up to 31 December. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain 
benefits from its activities. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing 
whether the Group controls another entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date 
that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that 
significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over the financial and operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include 
the Group’s share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commenced 
until joint control ceases. 70  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial
Notes to the financial statements continued
4. Accounting policies
Revenue
Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-assed tax, rebated and discounts. Revenue does not include the value 
of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property. The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of 
these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred. Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion. Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point 
of unconditional exchange of contracts. For affordable housing sales in bulk, revenue is recognised upon practical completion.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an 
integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Lease incentives received are 
recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.
Net financing costs
Net finance costs comprise:
• interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis 
to the income statement using the effective interest method;
• interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method;
• imputed interest on available-for-sale financial assets, fair valued interest free loans and on deferred terms land payables; 
• pension finance costs or benefits being the net of interest costs on liabilities and expected return on assets linked to the Defined Benefit Scheme; and 
• gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the 
costs of that asset. Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets. The Group 
does not generally produce qualifying assets.
Taxation
Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the 
extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of  
previous years. Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense 
that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability or asset for current tax 
is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the 
temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the 
tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in 
the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts where deemed 
appropriate to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive 
or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  71
Notes to the financial statements continued
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.  
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Certain property that had been revalued to fair 
value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at 
the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Regular reviews of the carrying 
values of property are completed to assess any impairment in value. When impairment is identified, the asset’s recoverable amount is assessed and any 
shortfall is written off through the income statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value (which is reassessed annually) of assets over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is 
charged on property in respect of the value of the building. Land is not depreciated. The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows:
• Buildings  straight line over 50 years
• Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance
• Computer equipment straight line over 3 years
• Office equipment  25% reducing balance
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of 
the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment. Following the issue of IFRIC11 in 2007, the Parent Company accounts for the share-based 
payments granted to subsidiary employees as an increase in the cost of its investment in subsidiaries.
Listed investments are stated at fair value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a legal charge on the relevant property, categorised as an 
available for sale financial asset and are stated at fair value as described in note 13. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised 
directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using 
the ‘effective interest rate’ method, which are recognised directly in the income statement. Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be 
impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period. Given its materiality, this item is 
being disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those 
overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along 
with any expected overage. Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling 
the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost. Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and 
provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value. The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that 
the option contract has not been exercised at the review date. Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of 
any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option. The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise 
is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase 
contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost. Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these 
investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element. The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the 
likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the 
year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the 
Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 72  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial
Notes to the financial statements continued
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost. Finance charges 
are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument 
to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate. Government 
grants are included within deferred income. The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a 
market rate and the below market interest. The benefit is treated as a Government grant.
Kickstart
 The Group has been granted assistance for the development of a number of sites under the Homes and Communities Agency (‘HCA’) ‘Kickstart’ scheme. 
Where receipts under the Kickstart scheme relate to grants they are accounted for in accordance with the policy for government grants stated above. 
In addition the Group has received cash upon specific sites under the ‘Kickstart equity’ scheme which may be repayable in future periods, as the sites to 
which it relates are developed, along with the share of the profits or losses attributable to the HCA arising from the sites. This grant element is included 
within deferred income to the extent that it is currently estimated that future economic benefit will be derived and will be released to the income statement 
in line with sales from the relevant site. If part or all the equity schemes are expected to be repaid these are shown in other creditors.
Trade payables
Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which  
they relate. The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit 
term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific 
to the liability.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares held by ESOP trust
Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the 
Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Employee benefits
The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 (Revised): “Employee benefits”. In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net 
obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, 
such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets. The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the 
yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation 
is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method. The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the 
income statement; service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise. 
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2: “Share-based payments”.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.  
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account  
the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on  
the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the share-based payment is cancelled where 
the charge will be accelerated.
Segment reporting
As the Group’s main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either 
business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
Exceptional items
Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement. The Directors are  
of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Group’s underlying business performance.  
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, 
gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  73

Impact of standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2012, and have not been 
applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. Comments on specific new standards or amendments are as follows:
Amendment to IFRS7 ‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’. This amends the disclosure requirements in respect of financial instruments that are set-off in 
accordance with guidance in IAS32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’. The amendment applies to the Group from 1 January 2013 and is expected to 
impact upon the Group by requiring additional disclosures in the annual financial statements.
IFRS10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 to establish principles 
for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements when an entity controls one or more other entities. The Group is currently 
assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
IFRS11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 and requires that a party to a joint 
arrangement determines the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved by assessing its rights and obligations and accounts for those rights and 
obligations in accordance with that type of joint arrangement. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and 
financial position.
IFRS12 ‘Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 and requires the 
disclosure of information that enables users of financial statements to evaluate the nature of, and risks associated with, its interests in other entities and 
the effects of those interests on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard 
on the financial statements of the Group.
IFRS13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The new standard was issued in May 2011 and defines fair value, sets out 
in a single IFRS a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
IAS19 (Revised) ‘Employee Benefits’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. It principally revises existing accounting treatment for pensions and 
other post-employment benefits and termination benefits. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial 
position.
IAS27 (Revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’ will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the 
amendment on the financial statements of the Group.
IAS28 (Revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ will apply to the Group from 1 Janaury 2013. The Group is currently assessing the impact 
of the amendment on the financial statements of the Group.
Amendment to IAS32 will apply to the Group from 1 January 2014. This amendment provides guidance on the application of offsetting in financial 
statements. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and financial position.
Amendment to IFRS1 ‘Government Loans’ (Amendments to IFRS1) will apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. This amends IFRS1 ‘First-time Adoption 
of International Financial Reporting Standards’ to address how a first-time adopter would account for a Government loan with a below-market rate of 
interest when transitioning to IFRSs. This amendment is not expected to impact the Group.
IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ is likely to apply to the Group from 1 January 2013. The standard was reissued in October 2010 as the second step in the 
IASB project to replace IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. IFRS9 (2010) now includes new requirements for classifying and 
measuring financial assets and financial liabilities and the derecognition of financial instruments. The IASB is continuing the process of expanding IFRS9 
to add new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the standard on the Group’s results and 
financial position and will continue to assess the impact as the standard is revised by the IASB.
The Group has not early adopted any standard, amendment or interpretation. Of the above, IFRS9 ‘Financial Instruments’ and ‘Government Loans’ 
(Amendments to IFRS1) have not yet been endorsed by the EU.

The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014, and the December 2012 Autumn Statement 
announced a planned further reduction to 21% by 2014. A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% (effective from 1 April 2012) was substantively 
enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% (effective from 1 April 2012) and 23% (effective from 1 April 2013) were substantively enacted 
on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.  
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will reduce the company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the company’s deferred tax asset (which has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date).  
Non-current trade payables
The Group recognises differences between the fair value and nominal value of long term creditors relating to purchases of land for development and 
charges these differences as finance costs using the effective interest method. The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between 
fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost 
is charged on legal completion of the house sale. As at 31 December 2012, £10,423,000 (2011: £11,284,000) of finance costs had not received a  
tax deduction. The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to 
reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits
The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 (Revised): ‘Employee benefits’.  
This has generated a deficit of £3.2 million (2011: £2.4 million). As at 31 December 2012 a deferred tax asset of £729,000 (2011: £616,000)  
was recognised. 80  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Financial

Inventories to the value of £331.8 million were recognised as expenses in the year (2011: £298.7 million).
During 2012, a £0.8 million reversal of write downs was recognised as a reduction in the amount of inventories recognised as expenses in respect of units 
sold during the year (2011: £2.3 million).
The assessment of carrying value of inventory at the year end has resulted in a £34,000 release of inventory provision as at 31 December 2012  
(2011: no net release). There was a gross increase of £2.1 million in the provision and an off setting decrease of £2.1 million. Following this review,  
£79.3 million (2011: £114.4 million) of inventories were valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historic cost.
The Group charged £79,000 of loss on disposal of part exchange properties to cost of sales during the year (2011: £114,000 loss).

there has been no movement during the year. 
The carrying value of amounts due from subsidiary undertakings represents the Company’s maximum credit risk. The directors consider these amounts to 
be fully receivable at year end.

Available for sale financial assets - shared equity
Available for sale financial assets relate to legal completions where the Group has retained an interest through agreement to defer recovery of a 
percentage of the market value of the property, together with a legal charge to protect the Group’s position. The Group participates in three schemes.  
‘Jumpstart’ schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10. The ‘HomeBuy Direct’ and ‘FirstBuy’ 
schemes are operated together with the Government. Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at a base 
value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments. These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account 
the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.

Reserve for own shares held
The cost of the Company’s shares held in the ESOP trust by the Group is recorded as a reserve in equity. During the year ended 31 December 2012, there 
were no share purchases. No shares awarded under the Group’s long term incentive plan vested during 2012 and accordingly the balance of the own 
shares held reserve remained unchanged during the year. The Group has suspended all rights on shares held by the Group in the Company.

Interest free loan at fair value LIBOR +158 bps 2016 5,190 4,995
The interest free loan was obtained to facilitate large infrastructure investment at one of the Group’s sites in the South West. The amount available 
depends on the underlying investment undertaken with repayments of this facility reflecting expectations of cash inflow generation from sales at that site, 
the maximum facility available is £6 million. The nominal amount at 31 December was £5,400,000. This has been fair valued using an effective interest 
rate of LIBOR plus 158bps, creating an accounting movement of £498,000 which is accounted for as a government grant (see note 4), which decreases 
the loan position. Interest will effectively be charged on this fair valued position over the life of the facility so at relevant repayment dates the value in 
the accounts for the loan is reflective of the cash amounts to be repaid. The imputed interest charged in the period was £195,000, which increases the  
loan value. The long stop repayment date for this facility is 5 January 2016.
Details of facilities
Since the year end the Group has entered into a £125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three-year term loan of 
£25 million. This financing arrangement replaces the Group’s previous £150 million committed revolving credit facility. The facility syndicate comprises 
four existing relationship group banks, one of which is providing the term loan, and one new bank. The facility and the term loan include a covenant 
package, featuring three covenants tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement. The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is in 
line with the existing facility.

The Group’s interest rate derivative financial instruments represent the fair value change in respect of interest rate derivatives not deemed effective  
and thus whose movement has been recognised in the income statement. The Group had a £50 million zero-cost ‘cap and floor’ collar swap in place 
until March 2011. In August 2011, the Group entered into a £18.6 million interest rate swap whereby the Group pays a fixed interest rate of 1.505% 
and receives 1 month LIBOR.

The Group’s non-current liabilities largely relate to land purchased on extended payment terms. An ageing of land creditor repayments is provided in note 22. 
The Group’s other financial liabilities represent the fair value of a liability, based on the performance of the Lloyds Bank House Price Index from October 
2010 to March 2014. Note 21 highlights the sensitivity of this value to changes in the index. Deferred income includes £0.7 million of Government grants. 
This will be released to the income statement as the Group legally completes units on the related sites.
19. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2012 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of £40,857,000 
(2011: 23,266,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2012 of 133,294,726  
(2011: 132,860,480), calculated as follows:

Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 133,294,726 132,860,480
Diluted earnings per share
The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2012 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of £40,857,000  
(2011: £23,266,000) and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2012 of £133,432,911  
(2011: 132,944,264).
The average number of shares is diluted in reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period. This dilutive 
effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares 
and the share option exercise price. The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period. Only share 
options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

Government bonds, the overall redemption yield on corporate AA fixed interest bonds and the median expected rate of return on equities and cash as 
provided by the Group’s actuarial advisors where these are to be used for asset liability modelling, all as at the reporting date. These have then been 
weighted in proportion to the underlying actual current asset allocation to derive an overall expected rate of return.

The most recent formal actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2010. The results have been updated to 31 December 2012 by a qualified 
independent actuary. As part of this valuation exercise, the mortality assumptions for the scheme are now based on the CMI 2011 model with an uplift 
for future improvements in mortality in line with the medium cohort with a minimum improvement of 1.25%. These tables imply the following remaining 
life expectancy at age 65.

The last actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by the Actuary for the Scheme Trustees as at 30 June 2010. The Company are currently paying 
contributions that are based on the 2010 valuation. The Group estimates that the contribution in 2013 by the Group to the scheme will be in the region 
of £3.1 million (2012: £3.1 million actual). 
Share-based payments
The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997. The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share 
options on 5 May 2004. In accordance with scheme rules, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The last grant of 
executive share options took place on 18 March 2003 and the scheme expired in 2007.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, options were granted on a discretionary basis relative to executives’ seniority within the Group. The options 
can be exercised where the cumulative increase in annualised basic earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 
(2% per annum for share options granted before 2001) over three consecutive financial years. Assuming this condition is satisfied, options may, under 
normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
There is one historical grant of executive share options prior to 7 November 2002 where there remain exercisable share options unexercised at  
31 December 2011. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS1, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS2 have not been applied to these grants.
The Bovis Homes Group PLC 2007 Save as You Earn Share Option Scheme was established in 2007 and replaced the scheme established in 1997.  
Share options held in the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme are not subject to performance conditions and may under normal circumstances be 
exercised during the six months after maturity of the agreement. Save As You Earn share options are generally exercisable at an exercise price which 
includes a 10% discount to the market price of the shares at the date of grant.

A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and 
established on 10 May 2000. An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual 
General Meeting on 5 May 2004. One grants of awards under this plan were made in 2011 and two grants of awards were made during 2010. 
Details of the vesting conditions of these awards are laid out in the Report on directors’ remuneration which can be found on pages 39 to 52.

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated as the annualised average of the standard deviations of the daily historical continuously 
compounded returns one, two and three years back from the date of grant where applicable.
The Group introduced a Share Option Plan in 2007 designed to provide middle management with effective incentivisation. Executive directors of the

21. Financial risk management
Group
The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future 
development. In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide for returns for shareholders as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a  
trading business.
The Group’s capital comprises its shareholders’ equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs. A five year record of its capital 
employed is displayed on page 94 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has historically delivered both absolute 
growth in capital and a return on capital employed of over 20%, although not in the recent past following the market decline.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Group’s decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders’ equity and debt financing, the 
Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand. This is because the Group recognises that 
housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks. The Group would seek to manage its capital base through 
control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its 
capital structure.
Following the sharp market movements in 2008, the Group saw a fall in its capital employed, as inventory provisions have reduced the asset base of the 
Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders equity. This was partially reversed in 2009 following a successful equity placing.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk. 
The valuation of the Group’s available for sale financial assets and a financial liability are also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise 
to market price risk.
a. Interest rate risk
Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Group’s business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure 
to fluctuations in interest rates. The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Group’s policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Hedging
The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, 
denominated in sterling. The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on 
which management form judgements. These matters include management’s view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and 
other macro-economic factors looking ahead. These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision  
being made. Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making. At 31 December 2012, 
the Group had a £18.6 million interest rate swap relating to debt held within a joint venture. The Group pays a fixed interest rate of 1.505% and receives 
one month LIBOR. All costs are being taken directly through income. The fair value measurement of the Group’s derivative financial instruments include 
inputs which are based on observable market data.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis
The interest rate profile of the Group’s interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 16.
Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Group’s earnings, given that Group borrowings are 
variable in terms of interest rate. Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would 
decrease the Group’s profit before tax by approximately £116,000 (2011: increase profit by £308,000). Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  89
Notes to the financial statements continued 
b. Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales. There are 
certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales. The largest single amount outstanding 
at the year end was £5.9 million (2011: £10.0 million). The amount is secured against consented land. The Group retains these outstanding balances 
as trade and other receivables. The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables. 
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties. Average exposure per transaction is £20,000 (2011: £23,000), 
and a second charge is retained to protect the Group’s interests. The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Group’s exposure to  
credit risk. This is set out in note 13.
The Group’s trade and other receivables are secured against the following:
 2012 
£000
2011 
£000
Consented land 22,933 34,249
Second charge against property 45,553 40,429
Unsecured 49,276 43,414
 117,762 118,092
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction. This assessment is based upon management 
knowledge and experience. In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed 
of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company
The company’s exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk
The Group’s banking arrangements outlined in note 16 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow 
needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk. The Group’s approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance 
relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 36.
d. Housing market price risk
The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Group’s non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements 
applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are summarised below:

therefore the fair value measurement includes inputs which are necessarily not based on observable market data.
Other financial liabilities represent an estimated payment dependent on the growth of the Lloyds Bank House Price Index, from October 2010 to March 2014. 
This was carried at a fair value of £706,000 (2011: £1,243,000).

22. Financial instruments
Fair values
There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments:
Land purchased on extended payment terms
When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies 
based on this fair value assessment. Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.  
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance  
costs using the ‘effective interest’ rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the 
payment required.

Other financial liabilities
The Group determines the value dependent on management expectations of growth in the Lloyds Bank House Price Index. The liability is based on a future 
discounted cash flow for a nominal value tracking the index until March 2014. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  91
Notes to the financial statements continued 
Available for sale financial assets
The Group determines the fair value of its available for sale financial assets through estimation of the present value of expected future cash flows. Cash flows 
are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default. An instrument-specific 
market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
Fair value of quoted investments is based on the available price of those quoted investments at the balance sheet date.
Bank and other loans
Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows. Interest free loans are fair valued using an effective interest rate method. 
See note 16 for further details.
Interest rate swaps
At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables / payables
Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed 
to reflect the fair value. This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade 
with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into 
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:
 Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets;
 Level 2:  fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either 
directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 Level 3:  fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset/liability that are not based on observable 
market data (unobservable inputs).

With regard to the operating leases held by the Group as lessor, the Group recognised £556,000 of rental income in the income statement in 2012  
(2011: £547,000). 
24. Capital commitments 
The Group has made £nil of plant and equipment expenditure commitments (2011: £150,000).
25. Contingencies
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bonds and other agreements entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has 
guaranteed the performance of certain of these agreements entered into by its subsidiary companies. The Company had guaranteed the repayment  
of bank loans made to one of its subsidiaries under a syndicated loan facility agreement. There were no amounts outstanding under this agreement at 
31 December 2012 (31 December 2011: nil).
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers 
these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability 
until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
26. Accounting estimates and judgements
Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies and estimates and 
the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Land held for development and housing work in progress
The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. To assess the net realisable value of land held for development 
and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are 
combined as residential properties for sale and sold. Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories 
and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost. Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent 
to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a recoverable value. To the extent that the 
revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may  
be different. A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 22 February 2013 has been 
carried out, which has identified no net movement in the carrying value of the provision. These estimates were made by local management having regard 
to actual selling prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management. Should there be a future 
significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary. Further details on the carrying value of 
inventory is laid out in note 12.
Part exchange properties
The carrying values of part exchange properties are assessed based on external valuations completed on the properties. These valuations are based on 
the prevailing market conditions in the second hand housing market and to the extent that housing market pricing levels change, the achievable values 
of the part exchange properties may vary. Part exchange property values at the end of the financial year were based on up to date valuations and were 
based on realistic market expectations.
Pension assumptions
The Group has utilised a range of assumptions including a rate of return on assets, a discount rate and mortality assumptions having been advised by 
its actuary. To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change. A 50bps 
increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would reduce or increase the scheme’s liabilities by £7.2 million or £8.1 million, respectively.
Available for sale financial assets
The estimation of the fair value of available for sale financial assets requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment 
of the Group’s receivable, as well as to the choice of instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate used to determine a discount rate. Note 21 contains 
a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in the major judgement factor applied in the valuation of these instruments. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  93

27. Related party transactions
Transactions between fellow subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation, as have transactions between the Company 
and its subsidiaries during this period. 
Transactions between the Group, Company and key management personnel in the year ending 31 December 2012 were limited to those relating to 
remuneration, which are disclosed in the Report on director’s remuneration (which can be found on pages 39 to 52) and in note 6.
Transactions between the Group, Company and joint ventures are in note 10.

immediately preceding the day on which the Company agrees to buy the ordinary shares; and (b) the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the 
Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003 (in each case exclusive of expenses); and
 (iii)  the minimum price which may be paid for an ordinary share shall be 50 pence in each case exclusive of expenses.
 By Order of the Board
M T D Palmer 
Company Secretary
22 March 2013
Notes:
(i)  Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360 B(2) of the 2006 Act, the Company gives notice that 
only holders of ordinary shares entered on the register of members no later than 6.00pm on 14 May 2013 (or, in the event of any adjournment, on 
the date which is 48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting) will be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting and a member may vote in 
respect of the number of ordinary shares registered in the member’s name at that time. Changes to entries on the register after the relevant deadline 
shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
(ii)  A registered member of the Company may appoint one or more proxies in respect of some or all of their ordinary shares to exercise the member’s 
rights to attend, speak and vote at a meeting of the Company instead of the member. A registered member appointing multiple proxies must ensure 
that each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attaching to different shares and must specify on the form of proxy the number of shares in relation 
to which that proxy is appointed. A proxy form which may be used to make such appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this Notice. 
If you do not have a proxy form and believe that you should have one, or if you require additional forms, please contact the Company’s Registrar, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY. Members or their duly appointed proxies are requested to 
bring proof of identity with them to the meeting in order to confirm their identity for security reasons. A shareholder attending the meeting has 
the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting in accordance with section 319A of the 2006 Act. In certain 
circumstances prescribed by the same section, the Company need not answer a question.
(iii)  The form of proxy must be executed by or on behalf of the member making the appointment. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one 
or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares. A corporation may execute the form(s) of proxy either under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer, attorney 
or other authorised person. A member may appoint more than one proxy to attend and vote on the same occasion.
(iv)  A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
(v)   Participants of the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan may instruct the trustee to vote on their behalf on a poll. 
(vi)  The proxy form and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified copy of that power or authority 
must be received at the office of the Company’s Registrar, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY 
or received via the Computershare website, (www.eproxyappointment.com) (full details of the procedures are given in the notes to the proxy form 
enclosed with the report and accounts and on the website) not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. Completion of the proxy 
form, other such instrument or any CREST proxy instruction (as described in paragraph (vii) below) will not preclude a member from attending the 
Annual General Meeting and voting in person instead of his proxy or proxies. The Company will announce the level of proxy votes for and against each 
resolution and the number of abstentions once the resolution has been voted on by a show of hands, except where a poll is called. When announcing 
a decision on a poll, the Company will disclose the total number of votes in favour and against and the number of abstentions on the Company 
website (www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk) and through a Regulatory Information Service. If a member returns paper and electronic proxy instructions, 
those received last by the Registrar before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence. Members are advised to read the website terms 
and conditions of use carefully. 
(vii)  To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed or otherwise) via the CREST system, CREST messages 
must be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number 3RA50) not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. For this purpose, 
the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp generated by the CREST system) from which the issuer’s agent is 
able to retrieve the message. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the proxy by 
other means. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed voting service provider(s) 
should contact their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) for assistance with appointing proxies via CREST. For further information on CREST 
procedures, limitations and system timings please refer to the CREST manual. The Company may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

Notice of meeting continued
(viii)  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to 
the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal 
member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) 
such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
(ix)  Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated 
Person”) may have a right, under an agreement between him and the member by whom he was nominated, to be appointed (or to have someone 
else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise 
it, he may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the rights 
of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraph (ii) above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these 
paragraphs can only be exercised by members of the Company.
(x)   As at 4 March 2013 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s issued share capital consists of 133,890,366 
ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at 4 March 2013 are 133,890,366.
(xi)   Under section 527 of the 2006 Act, members meeting the relevant threshold requirements set out in that section may require the Company to publish 
on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of 
the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the last Annual General Meeting that the members propose to raise at the Annual General Meeting. The Company may not require the 
members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the 2006 Act. Where the Company 
is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 2006 Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later 
than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes 
any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the 2006 Act to publish on a website.
(xii)  Except as provided above, members who wish to communicate with the Company in relation to the Annual General Meeting should do so using 
the following means: (1) by writing to the Company Secretary at the registered office address; or (2) by writing to the Company’s Registrar, 
Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS99 6ZY. No other methods of communication will be accepted.  
In particular you may not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice of meeting or in any related documents (including the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Annual Report 2012 and the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
(xiii)  A copy of this Notice and other information required to be published in accordance with section 311A of the 2006 Act in advance of the Annual 
General Meeting can be found at www.bovishomesgroup.co.uk.
(xiv)  The following documents will be available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, during normal business hours, on any weekday (excluding 
public holidays) from the date of this Notice until the date of the Annual General Meeting and on that date they will be available for inspection at the 
place of the meeting from 11.30am until the conclusion of the meeting:
 (a) copies of the directors’ service contracts;
 (b)  copies of the terms and conditions of appointment for each non-executive director; 
 (c) the register of directors’ interests; and
 (d) a copy of the Company’s Articles of Association, together with a comparison document showing the change proposed to be made to the Articles
      of Association pursuant to Resolution 13. 
(xv)  Data protection statement: your personal data includes all data provided by you, or on your behalf, which relates to you as a shareholder, including 
your name and contact details, the votes you cast and your Reference Number (attributed to you by the Company). The Company determines the 
purposes for which and the manner in which your personal data is to be processed. The Company and any third party to which it discloses the data 
(including the Company’s Registrar) may process your personal data for the purposes of compiling and updating the Company’s records, fulfilling its 
legal obligations and processing the shareholder rights you exercise. 98  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Information
Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting
Item 1: Report and accounts
 The directors must present to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting the report of the directors and the accounts of the Company for the year 
ended 31 December 2012. The report of the directors, the accounts and the report of the Company’s auditors on the accounts and on those parts of the 
directors’ remuneration report that are capable of being audited are contained within the annual report and accounts.
Item 2: Directors’ remuneration
 Under section 439 of the 2006 Act the directors are required to present the report on directors’ remuneration in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, for the approval of the members. 
  The Report on directors’ remuneration can be found on pages 39 to 52 of the report and accounts. 
Item 3: Final dividend
 Subject to the declaration of the final dividend at the meeting, the dividend will be paid on 24 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 2 April 2013. 
Items 4 to 9: Re-appointment of directors
 The UK Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) requires FTSE 350 companies to put all directors forward for re-appointment by shareholders on an 
annual basis. The purpose of this requirement is to increase accountability to shareholders. Accordingly, all the directors of the Company will retire at the 
Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-appointment.
 The Code contains provisions dealing with the re-appointment of non-executive directors. In relation to the re-appointment of Alastair David Lyons, Colin 
Peter Holmes and John Anthony Warren as non-executive directors, the Chairman has confirmed following the formal performance evaluation conducted 
during 2012 that they continue to be effective in and demonstrate commitment to their roles, including commitment of time for Board and committee 
meetings. Alastair Lyons brings a broad range of business knowledge and skills to the Board, which include experience in financial services, the insurance 
industry and private equity. Colin Holmes has financial, commercial and operational experience over a considerable period in a retail environment, which 
adds a valuable dimension to the Board capabilities. John Warren provides detailed financial and accounting expertise and has previous experience in 
chairing audit committees. In respect of the re-appointment of Malcolm Robert Harris, the Senior Independent Director has confirmed following the 
Chairman’s formal performance evaluation in 2012 that he continues to be effective in and demonstrate commitment to his role as Chairman, including 
commitment of time for Board and Committee meetings. Malcolm Harris has in depth sector and industry knowledge and the Board benefits from his 
continued participation in industry thinking and engagement with shareholders.
 The Board strongly supports and recommends the re-appointment of the directors to shareholders.
 Biographical details of all the directors can be found on page 30 of this report and accounts.
Items 10 and 11: Re-appointment of auditors and auditors’ remuneration
 The auditors of a company must be re-appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 10 proposes the re-appointment of 
the Company’s existing auditors, KPMG Audit Plc, for a further year. Resolution 11 gives authority to the directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration.
Item 12: Authority to allot shares
 The authority given to your directors at last year’s Annual General Meeting under section 551 of the 2006 Act to allot shares expires on the 
date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, this resolution seeks to grant a new authority under section 551 to authorise 
the directors to allot shares in the Company or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company up to an 
aggregate nominal amount of £22,292,745 and also gives the Board authority to allot, in addition to these shares, further of the Company’s 
unissued shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £44,585,491 in connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing members by way of a 
rights issue (with exclusions to deal with fractional entitlements to shares and overseas shareholders to whom the rights issue cannot be made 
due to legal and practical problems). This is in accordance with the latest institutional guidelines published by the Association of British Insurers. 
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of the resolution).  
The directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
 The amount of £22,292,745 represents less than 33.3% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 4 March 2013 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). The amount of £44,585,491 represents less than 66.6% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital 
in issue as at 4 March 2013 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 
4 March 2013.
 The Board has no present intention to exercise this authority other than in connection with employee share schemes. It wishes to obtain the necessary 
authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made (should it be desirable and should suitable market conditions arise) at short notice and without 
the need to convene a general meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
 If the Board takes advantage of the additional authority to issue shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares in the Company 
representing more than 33.3% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue or for a rights issue where the monetary proceeds exceed 33.3% of 
the Company’s pre-issue market capitalisation, all members of the Board wishing to remain in office will stand for re-election at the next Annual General 
Meeting following the decision to make the relevant share issue. Bovis Homes Group PLC  |  99
Explanatory notes to the notice of meeting continued
Item 13: Amendment to the Articles of Association
 There are currently three independent non-executive directors, plus the Chairman serving on the Board. The composition of the Board and succession 
planning arrangements were reviewed in 2012 and they will continue to receive focus in 2013. To provide flexibility in succession planning and support 
a progressive and orderly refreshing of the Board, the Board proposes that the overall limit on fees that may be paid to all the non-executive directors be 
increased from £350,000 per annum to £500,000 per annum. It will also provide flexibility for the future, should the Board wish to appoint an additional 
non-executive director, as a result of the growth of the Group. Individual non-executive directors’ fees are reviewed every two years. 
Item 14: Notice of general meetings
 This resolution is required as a result of the implementation in 2009 of the Shareholder Rights Directive. The regulation implementing this Directive 
increased the notice period for general meetings under the 2006 Act to 21 days. The Company will be able to continue to call general meetings  
(other than an Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice as long as shareholders have approved the calling of meetings on 14 days’ notice. 
Resolution 14 seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar 
resolution will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic voting under the Directive before it can call a general 
meeting on 14 days’ notice. It is confirmed that ability to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice would only be utilised in limited circumstances and 
where the shorter notice period was to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Item 15: Disapplication of pre-emption rights
 Resolution 15 seeks authority for the directors to issue equity securities (as defined in the 2006 Act) in the Company for cash as if the pre-emption 
provisions of section 561 of the 2006 Act did not apply. Other than in connection with a rights issue or any other pre-emptive offers concerning equity 
securities, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to the issue of shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £3,347,259 
which represents approximately 5% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 4 March 2013 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this Notice). In accordance with the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles, the directors confirm their intention that no more than 
7.5% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) will be issued for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period.
 This resolution seeks a disapplication of the pre-emption rights on a rights issue so as to allow the directors to make exclusions or such other arrangements 
as may be appropriate to resolve legal or practical problems which, for example, might arise with overseas members.
 There are presently no plans to allot ordinary shares wholly for cash other than in connection with employee share schemes. Shares allotted under an 
employee share scheme are not subject to statutory pre-emption rights.
 The authority sought by resolution 15 will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting (or, if earlier, 15 months from the date of  
the resolution). The directors intend to seek renewal of this power at subsequent Annual General Meetings.
Item 16: Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution renews the authority granted at last year’s Annual General Meeting to enable the Company to make market purchases of up to 13,389,036  
of its own shares, representing approximately 10% of the Company’s total ordinary share capital in issue as at 4 March 2013 (being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of this Notice). Before exercising such authority, the directors would ensure that the Company was complying with the current 
relevant UK Listing Authority and ABI guidelines. No purchases would be made unless the directors believe that the effect would be to increase the earnings 
per share of the remaining shareholders and the directors consider the purchases to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders 
as a whole. Any shares so purchased would be cancelled. The directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s 
ordinary shares but would like to have the flexibility of considering such purchases in the future.
 Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) 
which may be paid for each ordinary share shall be the higher of: (a) an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for 
an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the 
Company agrees to buy the ordinary shares; and (b) an amount equal to the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an ordinary share and the 
highest current independent bid for an ordinary share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System (SETS). The minimum price (exclusive 
of expenses) would be 50 pence, being the nominal value of each ordinary share. The authority will only be valid until the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting in 2014.
 As at 4 March 2013 there were options over 753,775 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company which represent 0.56% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital at that date. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options would represent 0.62% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital.
The directors consider that all the resolutions to be put to the meeting promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders 
as a whole. Your Board will be voting in favour of them and unanimously recommends that you do so as well. 100  |  Annual report and accounts  |  Information

Form of Proxy - Annual General Meeting to be held on 16 May 2013
Kindly Note: This form is issued only to the addressee(s) and is specific to the unique
designated account printed hereon. This personalised form is not transferable between
different: (i) account holders; or (ii) uniquely designated accounts. The Company and
Computershare Investor Services PLC accept no liability for any instruction that does
not comply with these conditions.
Explanatory Notes:
1. Every holder has the right to appoint some other person(s) of their choice, who need not be a
shareholder, as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf
at the meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes. If you
wish to appoint a person other than the Chairman, please insert the name of your chosen proxy
holder in the space provided (see reverse). If the proxy is being appointed in relation to less than
your full voting entitlement, please enter in the box next to the proxy holder's name (see reverse)
the number of shares in relation to which they are authorised to act as your proxy. If returned without
an indication as to how the proxy shall vote on any particular matter, the proxy will exercise his
discretion as to whether, and if so how, he votes (or if this proxy form has been issued in respect of
a designated account for a shareholder, the proxy will exercise his discretion as to whether, and if
so how, he votes).
2. To appoint more than one proxy, an additional proxy form(s) may be obtained by contacting the
Registrar's helpline on 0870 889 3236 or you may photocopy this form. Please indicate in the box
next to the proxy holder's name (see reverse) the number of shares in relation to which they are
authorised to act as your proxy. Please also indicate by marking the box provided if the proxy
instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and should be returned
together in the same envelope.
3. The 'Vote Withheld' option overleaf is provided to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution.
However, it should be noted that a 'Vote Withheld' is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the
calculation of the proportion of the votes 'For' and 'Against' a resolution.
4. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person
or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the holders stand in the Register
of Members.
5. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360 B(2)
of the Companies Act 2006, entitlement to attend and vote at the meeting and the number of votes
which may be cast thereat will be determined by reference to the Register of Members of the Company
at close of business on the day which is two days before the day of the meeting. Changes to entries
on the Register of Members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any
person to attend and vote at the meeting.
6. To appoint one or more proxies or to give an instruction to a proxy (whether previously appointed
or otherwise) via the CREST system, CREST messages must be received by the issuer's agent (ID
number 3RA50) not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting. For this
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp generated
by the CREST system) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message. The Company
may treat as invalid a proxy appointment sent by CREST in the circumstances set out in Regulation
35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
7. The above is how your address appears on the Register of Members. If this information is incorrect
please ring the Registrar's helpline on 0870 889 3236 to request a change of address form or go to
www.investorcentre.co.uk to use the online Investor Centre service.
8. Any alterations made to this form should be initialled.
9. The completion and return of this form will not preclude a member from attending the meeting and
voting in person.
10. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this form, the notice of meeting or in any
related documents to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly
stated.
11. The notes to this form should be read in conjunction with the notes to the notice of meeting.

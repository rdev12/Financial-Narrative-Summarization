The improvement in trading performance,
together with a targeted capital investment
programme and tightly managed working
capital, has produced another significant
reduction in the Group’s net debt levels,
further strengthening our capital structure
and underpinning our ability to invest in the
Group’s longer term development.
The ongoing implementation of our
business plan has made good progress, and
is a key factor in the improvement in the
overall trading performance of the Group.
In particular, our management teams have
been strengthened; expected operational
efficiency improvements are being delivered;
our German business is being re-aligned; and
the deployment of our capital base is being
focused on those markets that offer greater
potential returns. It is these actions to
reshape the Group, driving greater efficiency
and the ability to leverage our strong market
positions, that the Board believes will enable
Lavendon to continue to drive increased
financial returns and generate substantial
shareholder value in the coming years.
In October 2011, we welcomed Don Kenny
as the Group’s new Chief Executive Officer
and he is providing further impetus in
leading the Group through this important
next stage of its development.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s return on capital employed
(ROCE), the key performance metric for the
Group, improved across the year, reaching
9.0% at the year-end, a significant increase
over the return of 6.6% at the previous year-
end. This calculation has been based on the
Group’s operating profits before exceptional
items for 2011 and the average of the
opening and closing capital employed for
the year of £306.1 million (2010: £338.4
million). Further improvements are targeted
in the coming 12 months as we look to
move the Group’s ROCE above our pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital of 11%
across the business cycle.
Operational and
capital efficiency programmes
The expected operational efficiency gains
are being delivered in line with our three-year
plan, supported by strengthened
management and changes, where necessary,
to our operating procedures and processes.
In 2011, we realised overall efficiency gains
in the order of £2.0 million, principally from
pricing improvements in the UK and
transportation efficiencies in Germany and
France. These benefits will continue to
accumulate throughout the coming year and
into 2013, augmented by actions being taken
to improve our procurement and planned
maintenance processes that have a longer
lead time to deliver significant benefits.
These programmes are a core focus of the
Board and we remain confident that our
overall annualised profit improvement target
of £5.0 million will be progressively achieved
through to the end of 2013.
The Group’s Spanish operation is now closed
and the rental fleet successfully redeployed
to the Group’s other markets, principally into
Belgium and France, with the remainder in
the process of being sold. Through this
redeployment of capital, the ability to
increase capital returns to an acceptable
level is improved, as the increase in fleet
scale in the receiving countries should
generate attractive incremental margins.
In Germany, actions are being taken to
address its sub-optimal returns. A process
began in 2011 to reduce its capital base
through the disposal of approximately 600
rental machines thereby removing a future
capital replacement requirement of around
£18 million from the business. This
adjustment to the fleet, when combined with
operational efficiency gains that will continue
to accrue in the coming year, should enable
the German business to deliver a substantial
improvement in its relative contribution to
the Group’s financial performance. We believe
that achieving a ‘step-change’ in the financial
returns made on the capital deployed in
Germany is a key factor in returning the
Group’s ROCE to above its cost of capital,
and this remains a major area of focus for
management in 2012.
“The Group’s financial performance in 2011 showed a
marked improvement over the previous year, in line
with the Board’s expectations, principally driven by
improved pricing together with rigorous operational
management and control of capital. Trading conditions
during the year were relatively stable across the Group’s
markets, although the economic outlook became
increasingly uncertain as the year progressed.”

2          Lavendon Group plc 2011 Financial results
The Group’s total revenues for the year
(excluding revenues from our discontinued
Spanish business) increased by 4% to £225.4
million (2010: £217.5 million), reflecting an
8% increase in rental revenues to £216.9
million (2010: £200.7 million) partly offset by
the anticipated decline in revenues from the
disposal of a smaller number of ex-rental
fleet machines.
Underlying operating profits for the year
increased by 21% to £30.0 million (2010:
£24.7 million), with margins improving to
13.3% (2010: 11.4%) as a result of the
growth in revenues and the operational
efficiency gains delivered during the year.
With underlying net interest costs reducing
to £8.1 million (2010: £11.4 million),
reflecting the decline in the Group’s net debt
levels over the past two years, underlying
profit before tax increased 65% to £21.9
million (2010: £13.3 million). This increase in
profitability combined with an effective
underlying tax rate of 25% (2010: 25%),
generated an underlying profit after tax of
£16.5 million (2010: £10.0 million) and a 65%
increase in underlying earnings per share to
10.03 pence (2010: 6.07 pence).
During the year, the Group incurred a total
post tax exceptional charge of £0.4 million
(2010: nil) on continuing operations.
This overall charge is the net effect of
exceptional operating costs of £4.8 million
(with an associated tax credit of £0.9 million)
relating to restructuring charges incurred
during the year, and following agreement
with the tax authorities on the treatment of
intra-group financing arrangements from
prior years, exceptional interest payable
and tax credits of £1.4 million and
£4.9 million respectively.
Amortisation charges in the year of £2.3
million  (2010: £2.3 million) include the
amortisation of the intangible assets
acquired on completion of the acquisition of
Blue Sky Access Limited in October 2011.
After the exceptional and amortisation
charges, the Group’s operating profit was
£22.9 million (2010: £22.4 million). The
Group’s profit before tax was £14.2 million
(2010: £10.9 million) and the Group’s profit
after tax was £15.2 million (2010: £8.3
million), with a resulting earnings per share
of 9.22 pence (2010: 5.05 pence).
As previously announced, the Group’s
Spanish operation was closed towards the
end of 2011, and its results for the year have
been reported as a ‘discontinued business’.
The loss for the year was £0.8 million (2010:
loss of £0.2 million), and an exceptional
charge of £5.0 million was incurred in closing
the business and transferring its rental fleet.
There would be no material difference to
the Group’s financial results for 2011 if
consistent exchange rates with 2010 were
used to convert the results of the Group’s
international operations.
Cash flow generation
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for
the year increased by 5% to £71.7 million
(2010: £68.2 million), with margins
improving to 31.8% (2010: 31.4%). Cash
generated from continuing and discontinued
operations, including the sale and purchase
of rental fleet assets and after movements
in working capital, was £56.9 million (2010:
£67.9 million). Net cash generated from
continuing and discontinued operations,
after payment of interest and tax was
£41.2 million (2010: £51.8 million).
Investment
A total of £16.9 million (2010: £14.7 million)
was selectively invested in the Group’s rental
fleet and operational infrastructure, partly
funded by the disposal of surplus and retired
assets that generated £6.2 million in cash
(2010: £14.0 million). This activity, after
reflecting movements in amounts owing to
equipment suppliers at the beginning and
end of the year, resulted in a net cash
outflow relating to capital expenditure of
£8.8 million (2010: £0.9 million). The Group
has made progress in optimising its rental
fleet mix, by removing under utilised
machines and replacing them with a smaller
number of higher yielding assets during the
year. This has facilitated a net reduction in
the Group’s fleet of around 1,000 machines
across the year to a total fleet of 20,000 at
the year end.
In October 2011, the Group acquired Blue
Sky Access Limited (“Blue Sky”) for a total
consideration of £7.1 million net of cash
acquired. Blue Sky designs and engineers
products to improve efficiency and safety
in the use of powered access equipment.
This acquisition is a further step in
delivering our strategy of creating key
points of differentiation between the
Group and our competitors in the
marketplace, and underpins our ability to
provide innovative solutions that increase
productivity and the safety of a customer’s
workforce. Of the total consideration,
£3.1 million (net of cash received) was paid
on completion and a further £2.5 million
will become payable over the next two
years. In addition to the total consideration,
further payments of up to £1.5 million
could become payable over the next four
years dependent on revenue generation.
Reduction in net debt
The strength of the Group’s operating cash
flows and modest levels of investment,
together with a small favourable foreign
exchange movement of £1.6 million on
Euro-denominated borrowings, enabled the
Group to reduce its net debt levels during
the year by £33.7 million to £106.6 million
(2010: £140.3 million). The corresponding
debt to equity ratio was 58% (2010: 78%),
with an improved net debt to pre-
exceptional EBITDA ratio of 1.49 times
(2010: 2.00 times). Whilst we plan to
increase our fleet investment in 2012, we
still expect to make a further reduction in
fleet size in the year as well as making further
progress in reducing the Group’s net debt
level. These plans will ensure our rental fleet
mix continues to improve and remains highly
competitive, but will also move the Group
towards a level of net debt that will be
maintained for the foreseeable future until
market conditions or investment
opportunities warrant the deployment of
additional capital.
Dividend
Following the Group’s improved financial
performance, and reflecting the Board’s
confidence in the strength of the Group’s
cash flows, a final dividend of 1.38 pence
per share is proposed, doubling the final
dividend for 2010 and making a total
dividend for the year of 1.75 pence (2010:
1.00 pence). The final dividend, if approved,
will be paid on 1 May 2012 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business of
9 March 2012.
The increase in dividend for the year reflects
the Board’s recognition that dividend
distributions are an important element in
delivering shareholder value. This is an area
that the Board will continue to keep under
review, to ensure that future distributions
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011     3 adequately reflect the Group’s earnings and
cash flows, as well as its investment needs
and funding requirements as we progress
through the cycle.
Refinancing
With effect from 29 February 2012, the
Group has agreed terms to replace its
existing bank facilities with new debt
facilities of £150 million, comprising a
£100 million revolving bank facility expiring
in July 2016 and a €60 million US private
placement expiring in July 2019. These new
facilities provide the Group with a robust
medium to long-term diversified financing
package, with significant liquidity, that will
support the development of the Group in
the coming years. The costs associated with
the completion of this refinancing,
approximately £2.9 million or 2% of the
new facilities, will be amortised over the
term of the facilities.
Board changes
On 30 June 2011, Kevin Appleton stepped
down as Chief Executive Officer after nine
years with the Group. I would like to offer
the sincere thanks of the Board to Kevin for
all that he achieved in increasing the scale
and quality of the business during that time.
With effect from 1 October 2011, we
welcomed Don Kenny to the Board as the
Group’s new Chief Executive Officer. Don
has a wealth of experience of improving
operating performance and growing
businesses successfully both in the UK and
internationally, and is ideally placed to lead
the Group through the next phase of its
development.
As previously announced, Tim Ross, who had
been a Non-Executive Director of the Group
since 2005, retired from the Board at the
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 20
April 2011. I would like to thank Tim for his
contribution to the Board.
Summary and outlook
We have made good progress in 2011 with
revenues, margins and returns on capital
employed improving in all our European
businesses. Revenues from our Middle East
operation returned to growth during the
year and, in the final quarter, started to
deliver year on year growth in profits on a
monthly basis.
Our net debt levels have again reduced
significantly during the year, leaving the
Group with a comfortable level of
borrowings and a healthy capital structure
that benefits from enhanced liquidity
following the refinancing of the Group with
new medium to long-term debt facilities.
Our future capital investment plans will be
funded from annual cash flows, and will
ensure our rental fleet remains highly
competitive while also enabling the Group
to continue to generate free cash.
As we move into 2012, we believe that the
progress we have made over the last twelve
months, together with our strong market
positions and geographic spread of
operations, provides a firm foundation from
which our return on capital employed can be
further enhanced. In particular, we recognise
that further improvement in the
performance of our German business will be
central to the Group moving towards the
inflexion point, whereby our overall returns
on capital will surpass our weighted average
cost of capital which remains the Group’s
key objective.
Trading since the year end has been in line
with the Board’s expectations, and whilst
mindful of the continuing uncertain
economic climate, the Board remains
confident of delivering another year of
progress in 2012 and substantial shareholder
value in the medium term.
Note: Underlying operating profits, profit before and after
tax are stated before amortisation charges, exceptional
items, movements in the fair value of financial derivatives

4          Lavendon Group plc 2011 Strategy and business objectives
We have seen a steady improvement in the
Group’s financial performance during 2011,
despite the continuation of an uncertain
economic climate in our main European
markets. This improvement, driven by
operational efficiency gains and leveraging
strong market positions, has enabled good
progress to be made towards our key
strategic objective of delivering superior
returns on capital employed (ROCE). We
believe that by achieving superior returns;
• substantial shareholder value will be created;
• additional growth capital will be
attracted when required; and
• the Group’s investment case will be
fundamentally differentiated against
available alternatives.
Our strategy will be delivered through
deploying capital into markets that offer
attractive margins and/or growth potential,
and ensuring our businesses operate with
sufficient scale and efficiency that strong
market positions are secured to support the
future growth of the Group.
The Board monitors progress against its
strategic goals by reference to key
performance indicators. The key
performance indicators for the period 2007
to 2011 are shown in the table below:

Definitions
1 Revenue = revenue from continuing businesses as per the Group
income statement. Revenues shown in the table have been
stated in accordance with IAS 16 (amendment) ‘Property, plant
and equipment’. This amendment requires proceeds derived
from the sale of rental assets to be included in revenue.
2 EBITDA margin = underlying EBITDA as a percentage of
revenue. Underlying EBITDA is defined as earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, exceptional items and
movements in the fair value of financial derivatives from
continuing businesses, where all figures are as per the Group
financial statements.
3 Underlying operating profit margin = underlying operating
profit as a percentage of revenue. Underlying operating profit
is defined as operating profit before amortisation charges,
exceptional items and movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives from continuing operations, where all figures are as
per the Group income statement.
4 Debt to underlying EBITDA ratio = the Group’s total net debt
divided by EBITDA. Net debt is as per the Group financial
statements, and EBITDA is as defined in definition 2 above plus
EBITDA from discontinued businesses.
5 Return on capital employed = operating profit from continuing
operations before exceptional items as a percentage of capital
employed. Operating profit before exceptional items as per the
Group income statement. Capital employed being the aggregate
of the average of the Group’s opening and closing net assets and
net debt, as per the Group financial statements.
6Employee turnover = number of employees leaving as a
percentage of total workforce on an annualised basis. All staff
departures are included within the calculation, including
restructures and redundancies. (Source: internal data).
The table demonstrates the improvement
in the Group’s financial performance in
2011, with revenues returning to year on
year growth and underlying EBITDA and
operating margins both increasing. This
enhanced trading performance produced
healthy operating cash flows, which after
settlement of interest, tax and investment
commitments, delivered a £33.7 million
reduction in the Group’s net debt levels.
The debt to underlying EBITDA ratio has
reduced to 1.49 times from 2.00 times at
the end of 2010, another important
indicator of the improving financial
strength of the Group. The Group is
planning to increase capital investment in
its rental fleet during 2012, but to a level
that should still enable the Group to
generate free cash and make further
progress in reducing debt levels.
Employee turnover has increased to 18%
from 15% in the prior year, with ‘normalised’
employee turnover, after removing the
impact of restructuring, increasing to 10%
from 8% in 2010. This increase is
disappointing given our on-going focus on
employee retention. We are looking into the
underlying causes to take the appropriate
measures to seek improvement in the
coming year, as we remain convinced that
having a stable and well motivated employee
base is an important factor in improving the
overall performance of the Group.
“The Group made good progress during 201 1 in
improving the financial performance of its operations.
As we move into 2012, we are encouraged by the
operational efficiency gains made to date and
the impact that these will have on the Group’s
operating leverage.”

by country
A summary of the revenues and operating
profit by each business unit is given below:
                                                                              Underlying

All figures shown in the above table relate
to continuing businesses and are before
amortisation charges and exceptional items.
We have structured the Group so that each
country of operation is viewed as a separate
reporting profit centre, supported by central
Group service functions. Each operation has
its own management team responsible for
delivering agreed performance targets.
The performance of each continuing
operation is summarised below, with all
financial figures being underlying numbers
quoted before amortisation charges,
exceptional items and movements in the fair
value of financial derivatives.
UK
Rental revenues in the UK increased by 7%
during the year to £108.4 million (2010:
£100.9 million), principally driven by a 5%
year on year pricing improvement and good
volume growth from the first eight months
of the year. Volumes peaked in September
and then declined towards the year-end as a
number of major projects completed. The
growth in rental revenues fully absorbed the
anticipated decline in sales of ex-rental fleet
machines (a smaller number of units were
available for sale in 2011), resulting in total
revenues for the year being stable at £112.3
million (2010: £112.1 million).
Although we saw some softening in demand
towards the end of the year as the major
projects completed, we believe our market
share has increased, particularly with major
users of powered access equipment in the
construction sector. This progress has been
made by increasingly being recognised as a
provider of value-added services and not
just a supplier of rental machines. We
strengthened this position during the year
with the acquisition of Blue Sky Access
Limited (“Blue Sky”), a company that designs
and engineers products to improve
efficiency and safety in the use of powered
access equipment. The acquisition of Blue
Sky provides an additional point of
differentiation between the Group and the
market place, and should facilitate further
market share gains going forward.
Towards the end of the year, we announced
the decision to rationalise our three operating
brands in the UK (Nationwide Platforms,
Panther and EPL Skylift) under the common
name of Nationwide Platforms. This has been
implemented successfully in the first weeks of
2012, with strong acceptance from our
combined customer base.
The combination of the rental revenue
growth and operating efficiencies derived
from transportation and sales force
optimisation actions enabled underlying
operating profits to increase by 20% to
£13.6 million (2010: £11.3 million), with
margins improving to 12.1% from 10.1%
in the previous year.
Germany
Total revenues in Germany increased by
8% during the year to £51.2 million
(2010: £47.3 million), with rental revenues
also improving by 8% to £49.7 million
(2010: £46.0 million). This improvement was
principally volume-driven, although towards
the end of the year, we saw early signs of
pricing starting to firm.
During the year, the German management
team was strengthened and a detailed plan
to improve performance was agreed and is
being implemented. The plan encompasses
specific actions to improve operational
efficiency through reducing transportation
capacity, improving the availability of the
fleet and realigning the sales resource to be
cost effective. In addition, the capital base
of the business has been reviewed and a
controlled reduction in fleet size of
approximately 600 machines is being
undertaken to adjust our capability to be
more in line with the demand from markets
that we are targeting.
The actions being taken are designed to
improve the ROCE performance of the
business and ensure its contribution to the
overall financial performance of the Group is
more reflective of the level of capital
deployed in the territory. To date, we are
encouraged by the progress made and expect
to see the rate at which benefits are realised
gather pace as we move through 2012.
The revenue growth in the year, combined
with the operational efficiency gains to date,
enabled underlying operating profits to
increase three-fold to £4.1 million (2010:
£1.3 million) and margins improve to 8%
from 2.7% in 2010.
Belgium
Belgium’s total revenues grew strongly by
18% to £15.7 million (2010: £13.3 million),
driven by an increase in rental revenues of
17% to £14.8 million (2010: £12.6 million).
This revenue performance reflects a robust
level of activity throughout the year and a
stable pricing environment. Underlying
operating profits increased by 46% to £3.5
million (2010: £2.4 million), with margins up
at a healthy 22.3% from 18.0% in the
previous year.
Towards the end of the year, the Belgian
fleet was increased through the transfer of
225 machines following the closure of the
Group’s Spanish operation.
This expansion in fleet provides Belgium
with the necessary capacity to facilitate
further revenue growth and support the
future development of the business.
France
Our French business grew strongly in 2011,
with total revenues increasing by 17% to
£17.9 million (2010: £15.3 million), and rental
revenues improving by 16% to £17.4 million
(2010: £15.0 million). This strong revenue
performance has been supported by
excellent availability of fleet and improved
transport efficiency, leading to an underlying
Chief Executive’s review
continued
6          Lavendon Group plc 2011 operating profit increase of 82% to £2.0
million (2010: £1.1 million), with margins
improving to 11.2% from 7.2% in the
previous year.
As with Belgium, the scale of our French
operation was increased towards the end of
the year with approximately 350 machines
being transferred from Spain. Whilst this
increase in fleet will take some time to be
absorbed in 2012, it will be placed within the
existing depot network and consequently,
the operating leverage of the business will
be improved as the expanded fleet
becomes utilised.
Middle East
Revenues from our Middle East operations
have progressively improved throughout the
year with rates of year on year growth
accelerating across the second half. This
growth has been driven through increases in
activity in the Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi
markets, which have more than offset
continued weakness in Dubai and Qatar.
We believe that the recovery in activity levels
is sustainable and consequently, we are
committing approximately £5.0 million of
additional capital to the region in 2012.
This investment will supplement the re-
distribution of fleet and personnel that has
taken place during the year and will be used
to expand the rental fleet to secure further
revenue growth opportunities.
Total revenues for the year declined to
£28.3 million (2010: £29.5 million), weighted
towards the first half of the year and to a
decline in the revenues derived from the sale
of new machines. Rental revenues increased
by 1% to £26.6 million (2010: £26.3 million),
with constant local currency revenues
showing a 5% year on year increase.
Underlying operating profits for the year
reduced to £6.8 million (2010: £8.6 million),
weighted towards the first nine months of
the year, with an overall margin of 24.2%
(2010: 29.2%). The region returned to year
on year profit growth on a monthly basis in
the final quarter.
Future developments
The Group made good progress during 2011
in improving the financial performance of its
operations. As we move into 2012, we are
encouraged by the operational efficiency
gains made to date and the impact that
these will have on the Group’s operating
leverage as revenue growth is delivered. Our
improvement plans for Germany are being
implemented and our Middle East operation
is now demonstrating a sustained recovery
in revenues. The increased level of capital
investment in the Group’s rental fleet
planned for 2012 will be funded from our
annual cash flows, thereby still allowing free
cash to be generated to further reduce net
debt levels.
Whilst clearly conscious of the continuing
uncertain economic environment, we
believe that the combination of “self-help”
measures to improve operational
performance, our selective investment in
high return assets and close management of
cash generation, should enable the Group to
make further progress in improving its return
on capital employed in the coming year.

8          Lavendon Group plc 2011
In recent years, we have concentrated our efforts on building our
market position in those sectors that value service, reliability and
product range above that of simply achieving the lowest price.
At the same time, we have sought to widen the geographic spread
of our operations to reduce the impact of fluctuations in the
economic circumstances of a particular country in which we operate.
During 2011 we have continued the development of consultative
capabilities to offer solutions to major powered access users,
enabling them to achieve safer, more controlled and more efficient
environments for their staff involved in working at height.
Through deployment of these, often intellectual-property protected
solutions, we believe we can continue to win market share in
maturing markets with a proposition based on total value added,
rather than direct rental price.
Our strategy
Delivering superior returns on capital employed (“ROCE”).
Competitive environment
The competitive environments that we experience vary from country to country.
However, a consistent feature is that the markets are highly competitive, serviced by
operations ranging from divisions of public companies, through private equity backed
ventures, to privately owned family businesses, with the construction sector an
important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. 
We believe that by achieving superior returns;
• substantial shareholder value will be created;
• additional growth capital will be attracted when required; and
• the Group’s investment case will be fundamentally differentiated
against available alternatives.
Our strategy will be delivered through deploying capital into markets
that offer attractive margins and/or growth potential, and ensuring our
businesses operate with sufficient scale and efficiency that strong
market positions are secured to support the future growth of the Group.
We aim to  increase the ROCE from 9% to in excess of the weighted
average cost of capital (“WACC”)  over the business cycle.

10        Lavendon Group plc 2011 Business and
market overview
Powered access equipment is
designed to enable people to work
safely and efficiently at height.
It is used in a wide range of
market sectors and applications,
including construction, civil
engineering, cleaning, inspection,
facilities management, industrial
maintenance, broadcasting and
telecommunications.
In addition to general economic
conditions, demand for the equipment
is driven by the following factors:
• Commercial pressure to reduce
project timescales, where speed,
convenience, efficiency and safety
are prime concerns.
• Increased focus on safety in the
workplace, supported by ever
more stringent Health and Safety
legislation, accelerating the
substitution of more traditional
methods of access, such as ladders,
scaffolding and mobile towers
by powered access.
• The increasing modularisation of
construction processes, which
tends to produce a greater
demand for access equipment
on construction sites.
• Escalating costs and shortage of
skilled labour in the construction
and refurbishment sectors, leading
to a need to ensure those
available are equipped with the
necessary tools to be as
productive as possible.
Powered access equipment tends to
be rented rather than owned for the
following three main reasons:
• The equipment has a relatively high
capital cost and stringent transport
and maintenance requirements.
• A range of equipment would be
required to satisfy all applications.
• The need for the equipment tends
to be infrequent and inconsistent
due to varying work schedules
and applications.
The combination of the drivers of
demand and the efficiencies gained
from the rental of the equipment,
should, we believe, continue to
enable the market to grow in the
coming years, subject to prevailing
economic conditions.

The review of the Group’s financial
performance is based principally on what
we term the ‘underlying’ business
performance of the Groups continuing
operations. This measure excludes
amortisation charges, exceptional items,
movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives and the results from the
Group’s discontinued Spanish operation.
We believe that the use of underlying
figures aids the comparison with prior
periods and the understanding of the
Group’s financial performance.
Underlying trading performance
A summary of the Group’s financial
performance for 2011, at both constant
currency exchange rates and actual
exchange rates, with a comparison against
2010, is set out in the table below:

Operating and 
financial review
Alan Merrell
Group Finance Director
With little year on year movement in
average exchange rates for the Group’s
main trading currencies (principally Sterling,
Euros and a number of Middle east
currencies), there is only a marginal
difference between the Group’s results
for the year at constant and actual
currency exchange rates.
Group revenues for the year increased by 4%
to £225.4 million (2010: £217.5 million). The
split of these revenues between the various
countries of operation, compared to 2010,
is shown opposite (all figures in £’millions).
The Group’s revenues are principally derived
from the rental of its equipment fleet, but
also include revenues from the sale of new
equipment and from the disposal of ex-
rental fleet units. The split of revenues
between each of these channels is shown
in the table below.
Rental revenue is shown net of discounts
and value added tax, but includes income
generated from the transportation of
equipment, provision of fuel, charging of
damage waiver fees and the sale of spare
parts. The income derived from the rental of
machines is determined by the interplay of
several factors: size of rental fleet, mix of
machine types within the fleet, utilisation of
the fleet and rental rates achieved. The
importance, or weighting, of each of these
factors can change by week or by month as
the year progresses, due to normal seasonal
patterns of demand, or to changing
customer workloads.

of Bristol street art spectacle
Reaching new heights with platform 
hire from Nationwide Platforms.
In September, our equipment helped artists from across 
the world transform areas of Bristol with striking street art.
For the “See No Evil” spectacle we provided a number of
access platforms over six days, enabling graffiti artists and
muralists to rejuvenate ten buildings in the heart of the city.
The event was coordinated by Bristol City Council’s Place
Making Director Mike Bennett who called on our working 
at height expertise to help make the project a reality.
Our machines delivered working height access of between
8 metres and 43 metres, as well as a maximum horizontal
outreach of between 10 and 21 metres, ideal for reaching
buildings at height over obstacles at ground level.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   13

compared to 2010, was expected due to the
completion of the disposal in 2010 of the
surplus equipment identified during the
restructuring of the Group’s operations in
2009. The reduced level of sales of new
equipment reflects the unpredictable nature
of this revenue stream, particularly in the
Middle East region.
The Group’s costs are largely fixed in nature
within the short to medium term, with
significant movements in the cost base,
outside of acquisitions, mainly being
determined by either depot openings and
closures, or fleet expansion or contraction.
This feature of our business amplifies the
effect of any small movements in revenue
on the profitability of the Group, as there is
little associated increase or decrease in our
cost base in the short term. This impact is
often referred to as “operational leverage”.
The two main cost areas of the business are
employee costs and depreciation. During
2011, employee costs excluding redundancies
from continuing operations increased to
£59.9 million (2010: £55.4 million), but as a
percentage of rental revenues, these costs
remained stable at 27.6% (2010: 27.6%).
Depreciation costs reduced to £41.6 million
in the year (2010: £43.5 million), with the
percentage of rental revenues reducing to
19.2% (2010: 21.7%) due to the continued
reduction in the size of the Group’s rental
fleet and the increased revenues generated
from this fleet.
The Group’s underlying EBITDA for the year
increased to £71.7 million (2010: £68.2
million), with margins improving to 31.8%
from 31.4% in 2010. Underlying operating
profits increased by 21% to £30.0 million
(2010: £24.7 million), with margins
improving to 13.3% from 11.4% in the prior
year. The improvements seen in both
underlying EBITDA and operating profit
margins reflect the combination of
operating leverage on the rental revenue
growth achieved and actions taken to
increase operational efficiencies and
restructure the Group across the year.
Net underlying interest charges on the
continuing businesses for the year reduced
to £8.1 million (2010: £11.4 million),
following the reduction in the net debt levels
of the Group across both 2010 and 2011.

effective tax rate of 25% (2010: 25%), the
Group’s underlying profit after tax was

The Group’s underlying earnings per share
increased by 65% to 10.03 pence per share
(2010: 6.07 pence).
Statutory trading performance
Amortisation charges were £2.3 million for
the year (2010: £2.3 million), including the
amortisation of the intangible assets
acquired with the acquisition of Blue Sky
Access Limited from 1 October 2011.
During the year, the Group incurred a total
post tax exceptional charge of £0.4 million
(2010: nil). This overall charge is the net
effect of exceptional operating costs of
£4.8 million (with an associated tax credit
of £0.9 million), relating to restructuring
charges incurred during the year, and,
following agreement with the tax authorities
on the treatment of intra-group financing
arrangements from prior years, exceptional
interest payable and tax credits of £1.4
million and £4.9 million respectively.
The Group also benefited in the year from a
credit on the movement in the fair value of
the Group’s financial derivatives of £0.8
million (2010: nil). This credit has been
included within interest payable charges.
After amortisation charges and exceptional
operating costs, the Group produced an
operating profit of £22.9 million (2010:
£22.4 million). After amortisation charges,
exceptional items and movements in the fair
value of financial derivatives the Group
produced a profit before tax of £14.2 million
(2010: £10.9 million) and a profit after tax of
£15.2 million (2010: £8.3 million), earnings
per share of 9.22 pence (2010: 5.05 pence).
Discontinued operation
The Group’s Spanish business was closed
during the year and has been reported as a
discontinued operation. The loss for the year
was £0.8 million (2010: loss of £0.2 million),
and an overall closure cost, reported as an
exceptional item, of £5.0 million was incurred.
Dividends
The Group is proposing a final dividend of
1.38 pence per share, doubling the final
dividend for 2010 and making a total
dividend for the year of 1.75 pence (2010:
1.00 pence). The final dividend, if approved,
will be paid on 1 May 2012 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business of
9 March 2012.
Cash flow, investment
and acquisitions
A summary of the Group’s cash flows for
the year is shown in the chart on page 16.
During the year, the Group generated
£61.3 million of cash from operations, after
movements in working capital but prior to
the purchase and sale of rental assets
(2010: £62.4 million).
Investments
A total of £16.9 million was invested in the
maintenance and expansion of the Group’s
fixed asset base (2010: £14.7 million). This
investment was partly funded by the sale of
surplus and retired assets, which generated
£6.2 million in cash (2010: £14.0 million).
After movements in amounts owed to
equipment suppliers at the beginning and
end of the year of £1.9 million, the net
capital expenditure for the year was £8.8
million as shown in the chart above. The
amount owed to equipment suppliers at the
end of the year was £3.4 million. The total
cash outflow, prior to offsetting disposal
proceeds, of £15.0 million (being the
investment of £16.9 million together with
the movement in amounts owing to
equipment suppliers of £1.9 million) differs
from the total amount disclosed in the
‘Group cash flow statement’ as ‘Purchase of
rental fleet’ and ‘Purchase of property, plant
and equipment’ by £2.5 million, which
represents the value of assets funded by hire
purchase finance and which is disclosed
separately in the ‘Reconciliation of net cash
flow to movement in net debt’.
Acquisition
With effect from 1 October 2011, the
Group acquired Blue Sky Access Limited
in the UK for a total consideration of
£7.1 million (net of cash acquired). Of the
total consideration, £3.1 million was paid
on completion (net of cash acquired) and
a further £2.5 million will become payable
over the next two years. In addition to the
total consideration, further payments of
up to £1.5 million could become payable
over the next four years dependent on
revenue generation.

1Net debt is comprised of bank borrowings and hire purchase
liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.
2 Return on capital employed = operating profit from continuing
operations before exceptional items as a percentage of capital
employed. Operating profit before exceptional items as per the
Group income statement. Capital employed being the aggregate
of the average of the Group’s opening and closing net assets and
net debt, as per the Group financial statements.
3Net debt divided by underlying EBITDA, where underlying EBITDA
is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation,
exceptional items and movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives from both continuing and discontinuing businesses.
4Net debt divided by shareholders’ equity.
The Group’s net assets increased by 3% to
£185.2 million (2010: £180.1 million), with
net assets per share increasing to £1.14
(2010: £1.10). The main movements in the
balance sheet were:
• an increase in intangible assets following
the acquisition of Blue Sky Access Limited;
• depreciation of property, plant and
equipment (net of investments made
during the year);
• an increase in current assets (principally
trade and other receivables) due to the
revenue growth in the year;
• an increase in liabilities principally due to
an increase in amounts due to suppliers of
the Group’s rental fleet and the deferred
consideration relating to the acquisition
of Blue Sky Access Limited; and
• a reduction in net debt following
repayments from operational cash flows
in the year.
The control of capital expenditure during
the year enabled the Group, as in 2010, to
generate significant free cash flow, which
when combined with a favourable foreign
exchange movement of £1.6 million, enabled
the Group to reduce its net debt level at the
year-end to £106.6 million (2010: £140.3
million). The corresponding net debt to
underlying EBITDA ratio is 1.49 times, a
significant reduction from the previous year’s
level of 2.00 times, and net debt to equity
ratio is a comfortable 58% (2010: 78%).
This reduced level of debt is well supported
by operational cash flows.
The Group’s return on capital employed
increased for the year to 9.0%, a marked
improvement on the 6.6% achieved in 2010,
driven by increased operating profits and a
reduced amount of average capital employed
during the year. Further improvement in this
key metric remains the fundamental
objective of the Group for the coming years.
Operating and 
financial review
continued
The Group has exposure to movements in
interest rates on its borrowings. This exposure
is managed by a combination of fixed and
floating interest rate agreements. This allows
the Group to mitigate the impact of interest
rate fluctuations by allowing some benefit
from rate reductions, whilst offering some
protection against rate rises. At the year-end,
the fixed rate element of borrowings was
65%, broadly stable with the previous year-
end fixed rate element of 66%. Based on the
year-end mix and quantum of borrowings,
a movement in Euro interest base rates of
0.25% would increase or decrease the Group’s
annual interest cost by approximately
£114,000, whilst a similar movement in
Sterling base rates would increase or decrease
annual costs by £21,000.
With effect from 29 February 2012, the
Group has agreed terms to replace its
existing bank facilities with new debt
facilities of £150 million, comprising a
£100 million revolving bank facility expiring
in July 2016 and a €60 million US private
placement expiring in July 2019. The bank
facility has an interest rate margin of
between 225 basis points and 325 basis
points above LIBOR or EURIBOR depending
on the currency drawn, and the US private
placement has a fixed coupon of 4.89%.
These facilities provide the Group with a
robust medium to long-term diversified
financing package, with significant liquidity
and additional covenant headroom, that will
support the development of the Group in
the coming years. The costs associated with
the completion of this refinancing exercise
total approximately £2.9 million, or 2% of the
new facilities, and these will be amortised
over the term of the facilities.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have formed a judgement, at the
time of approving the accounts, that the
Group can have a reasonable expectation
that adequate resources will be available
for it to continue its operations for the
foreseeable future, and consequently it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern
principle in the preparation of the financial
statements. In forming this judgement, the
directors have reviewed the Group’s budget
for 2012 and the forecast for 2013 (including
downside sensitivity scenarios), cash flow
forecasts, contingency planning, the

The access platform offered a horizontal outreach of more

Dundee’s Victoria Dock in Scotland.
The maintenance workers also took advantage of the

even more precision during the change-over process by

Risks
The Group has a structured process to
identify and prepare mitigation strategies for
business risks. A formal risk register is
reviewed annually by the Group Executive
Committee and the Group’s internal
auditors. The register details the risks
identified, the allocation of executive
accountabilities and current and planned
future mitigation strategies. The Group
Executive Committee and the Audit
Committee have approved the risk register.
There are risks and uncertainties inherent
in our business that may affect future
performance. Some of these factors have
already been discussed, but others are listed
below and are amongst those that we think
could cause the Group’s actual results to
differ materially from those expected or
those produced historically:
Competition
The powered access industry is highly
competitive and highly fragmented.
Numerous competitors, ranging from
national operators to smaller multi-regional
or independent companies, serve many of
the markets in which the Group operates.
The Group is generally able to compete on
the basis of quality and breadth of service,
expertise, reliability, and the price, size, mix
and relative attractiveness of its powered
access fleet. During the year, the Group has
pro-actively sought to strengthen its market
positions, by developing consultative
capabilities which seek to differentiate our
offering to customers, to mitigate the impact
of increased competition should it occur.
Reduction in demand by customers
A large portion of the Group’s customer
base consists of customers from the
commercial construction and industrial
sectors. A downturn in commercial
construction or industrial activity, or a
decline in the desirability of powered
access equipment, may decrease the
demand for powered access equipment,
or depress the hire rates that the Group
can charge for its units.
The key factors which may cause a
temporary or long-term downturn in the
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   17 commercial construction and industrial
sectors are as follows:
• a slow-down in the economies within
which the Group operates; and/or
• a significant increase in interest rates or
other factors affecting end customer
demand/investment; and/or
• a restriction on the availability of finance
to fund construction projects; and/or
• over-capacity in the businesses that drive
the demand for commercial construction
or industrial equipment.
Whilst a downturn in the commercial
construction and industrial sectors could have
a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, we are actively managing our
exposure to these sectors and are focusing
our efforts on widening the Group’s customer
base into other less cyclical areas. In addition,
in recent years, we have increased the Group’s
geographic spread of profits and cash flows
to reduce the impact that country specific
economic fluctuations would have on the
Group’s overall performance.
Seasonality
The Group is subject to changes in demand
patterns during the year caused by seasonal
factors. Construction activity tends to
increase in the summer months and during
periods of prolonged mild weather, whilst
decreasing during the winter months and
extended periods of adverse weather.
In addition, due to the timing of public
holidays in Europe, there are more invoicing
days in the second half of the year.
Furthermore, the Group’s trading is
weighted towards the months of
September, October, November and early
December as the Group’s customers seek
to complete work ahead of the year end
and onset of winter. Should the Group
experience a prolonged period of adverse
weather, it could have a material adverse
effect on the Group’s business.
Retention of senior management
and employees
The Group depends on its senior
management team and a stable
experienced workforce. Although it is
not anticipated that members of the
management team will be lost or replaced,
or that employee turnover will increase
sharply, the disruption caused by either of
these events happening could adversely
affect the Group’s business until suitable
replacements are found. The Group
regularly reviews remuneration packages
and aims to offer competitive salaries and
attractive short- and long-term incentive
schemes, including the use of share
incentive plans where appropriate.
Access to capital/additional finance
The Group requires capital for, amongst
other things, purchasing powered access
machines to replace existing machines that
have reached the end of their useful life
and for growth through increasing the scale
of the existing rental fleet, by establishing
new depots and operations, or completing
acquisitions. If the cash that the Group
generates from its business, together with
cash that it may borrow or has borrowed
under its credit facilities, is not sufficient
in the long term to fund its capital
requirements, additional debt and/or
equity financing will be required. If such
additional financing were not available to
fund the Group’s capital requirements,
revenue and cash flow could decrease,
potentially having a material adverse
effect on the Group.
The Group aims to ensure that it has the
necessary equity base and sufficient banking
and other credit facilities available to support
its development plans. We believe that the
combination of the Group’s equity base and
the strong cash flows generated by the
business, together with the credit lines
available from banks and other institutions,
will provide adequate funding for our
foreseeable needs.
Currency and interest rate
fluctuations
Although the Company is a UK company that
reports in pounds Sterling, in 2011 the Group
derived approximately 38% and 13% of its
revenue in Euros and Middle Eastern
currencies, respectively. A significant amount
of its assets, liabilities and costs are also
denominated in Euros. These overseas results
are translated at the applicable exchange
rate, which fluctuates from time to time.
Fluctuations in the value of the Euro or
Middle Eastern currencies in relation to the
Operating and 
financial review
continued
pound Sterling may have a significant
impact on the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations as reported in
pounds Sterling.
Currency fluctuations can also have a
significant impact on the Group balance
sheet, particularly total shareholders’ funds,
when the financial statements of the non-
UK subsidiaries are translated into pounds
Sterling. The translation of the assets and
liabilities of the Group’s non-UK businesses
at the relevant balance sheet date results in
the recognition of foreign exchange
translation gains or losses. The Group
balance sheet is affected by movements in
the Sterling value of its net investments in its
non-UK businesses and the Sterling value of
its consolidated net debt.
The Group uses net investment hedging
arrangements to mitigate its exposure to
changes in currency rates.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate
risk on its floating rate debt. Fluctuations in
interest rates may affect the interest
expense on existing debt and the cost of
new financings. The Group utilises interest
rate swap agreements to manage and
mitigate its exposure to changes in the
interest rates.
Legal proceedings
The nature of the Group’s business exposes
it to claims for personal injury or property
damage resulting from the use of the
powered access equipment that the Group
rents or sells. The Group carries insurance
covering a wide range of potential claims.
The Board believes that the level of
insurance is sufficient to cover existing
and future claims.
Changes in tax legislation
or interpretation
The Group is exposed to the risk presented
by changes in tax legislation and the
interpretation and enforcement of such
legislation. The Group’s activities are subject
to tax at various rates, computed in
accordance with relevant legislation and
practice. Action by governments to increase
tax rates or to impose additional taxes could
reduce the profitability of the Group. In
common with many companies, the Group
has structured its intra-Group financing
18        Lavendon Group plc 2011 Meeting of platform giants
Gardemann presented the ideal solution 
when a new antenna system had to be
installed at a wind farm.
Three access platforms from Gardemann installed a new
antenna system with a ring assembly on the mast of a
wind power wheel in the Wiesensteig wind park on the
Drackenstein Hang of the Swabian Alb. 
“Masts of wind power stations become narrower towards the
top, which means they are much wider at the bottom. The ring
to be installed, consisting of three parts, was to be placed on
the mast without anchoring. All three parts had to be mounted
simultaneously. Afterwards, the ring was lowered slowly until 
it was supported by the mast. That was the reason for this
somewhat unusual solution.
The baskets of all three platforms could be extended to a
distance of 3.70m. This gave the technicians sufficient freedom
of movement and also helped to limit the duration of the work
to only four days. For Eckert & Graf that meant substantial
savings in time and money.” Olaf Lenz Gardemann Field Service

tax legislation or to the interpretation of such
legislation then these could have a material
effect on the Group’s business.
Political, legal and regulatory
developments
The Group is subject to various legal and
regulatory regimes. Future global political,
legal or regulatory developments concerning
the activities carried out by the Group and
the arena in which the business operates
may affect the Group’s ability to operate
and operate profitably in the affected
jurisdictions. Should the Group’s businesses
fail to comply with applicable legal and
regulatory requirements, or become unable
to operate due to a deteriorating political
climate, this may result in a financial loss or
restriction on the Group’s ability to operate
its business.
Environment and safety laws and
regulations
The Group’s operations, like those of other
companies engaged in similar business,
require the handling, use, storage and
disposal of certain regulated materials.
As a result, the Group is subject to the
requirements of UK and European
environmental and occupational health and
safety laws and regulations. These regulate
such matters as waste water, storm water,
solid and hazardous wastes and materials
and air quality. Under such laws and
regulations, the Group may be liable for,
amongst other things, the cost of
investigating and remediating
contamination (regardless of fault) and for
fines and penalties for non-compliance.
The Group’s operations generally do not
raise significant environmental risks, but the
Group does use hazardous materials to
clean and maintain equipment, dispose of
solid and hazardous waste and waste water
from equipment washing, and store and
dispense petroleum products from storage
tanks located at some of its locations. The
Group has rigorous procedures to manage
the disposal of these materials.
The Group also operates in an industry
where safety is a key consideration for
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   19 Inspection of the Reichstag facades

both the well being of our employees
and customers that hire our equipment.
Failure to comply with regulatory
requirements or to meet customer
expectations with regard to the provision
of safe equipment could result in litigation,
financial penalties and damage to the
reputation of the Group.
As far as the Board is currently aware,
there are no pending or likely litigation,
remediation or compliance costs relating to
either environmental or safety issues that
will have a material adverse effect on the
Group. However, it is not possible to be
certain as to the potential financial impact
on the Group if adverse environmental
conditions or safety concerns are discovered
or environmental or safety requirements
become more stringent. If the Group were
required to incur material environmental
compliance or remediation costs that are
not currently anticipated, the Group’s results
would be adversely affected.
Business IT system availability
An interruption to the availability of the
Group’s IT systems could have a material
impact on the Group’s communication,
ability to service customer needs,
maintenance of adequate records and
overall financial performance.
In order to mitigate this risk, the Group is
engaged in a continuous improvement
programme to upgrade and harmonise its
operational, business and accounting
processes across all territories. The Group
employs system and software programming
professionals to maintain the Group’s IT
infrastructure and develop systems to meet
the business requirements. In addition the
Group has a fully formed and tested disaster
recovery programme in place to protect
against major systems failure.

Since 1999 it has housed the Bundestag, the lower house of
the German Parliament. From 1991-1999 the building, erected
by Paul Wallot in 1894, was completely remodelled to fulfil its
present-day function.
Regular inspections are necessary to ensure that this important
symbol of the city of Berlin can be used by future generations.
For two weeks the entire facade on all sides of the Reichstag was
carefully inspected for cracks and defects. Small damages were
repaired immediately.
A 70-metre high platform with a basket boom was the perfect
solution for the high tower elements. Its lateral working radius was
large enough to inspect the hard-to-reach facade areas. T o save
costs, a 35-metre unit was used to inspect the lower levels.
The neo-classical Reichstag, with its glass cupola,
is one of Berlin’s most prominent buildings.  Corporate and social responsibility
In our 2010 Annual Report we set out the
vision for our Corporate Responsibility (CR).
We believe we have always operated in a
responsible and sustainable manner but we
have recognised the need for a more
focussed and directed CR agenda as a part
of our unique offering to our customers and
to further engage our employees. In our
previous annual report we identified the 4
key principles that our Company operates by; 
• Performance: valuing and rewarding 
the attainment of business goals.
• Integrity: being reliable, ethical, honest and
straightforward in our relationships with
customers, staff, shareholders and suppliers.
• Process-orientation: encouraging a
culture where business challenges are
resolved constructively and permanently
and “fire-fighting” is avoided.
• Initiative: encouraging staff to take
ownership of business opportunities 
and to proactively collaborate in their
personal development.
These principles are reflected in a set of
management values, which have been
adopted by the Board and senior
management of the business as the guide 
to how we endeavour to run our business:
• We provide a safe working environment.
• We aspire to be a motivated, 
professional team.
• We treat everyone with respect.
• We invest time and resources to develop
each employee to their full potential.
• We behave like responsible co-owners 
of the business.
• We care about customers and 
colleagues alike.
• We are easy to do business with.
• We deliver on our promises, both
operational and financial.
These key principles have served us well and
will continue to form the foundations of our
vision for Lavendon Group’s Corporate
Responsibility going forward.
2011 saw our UK business take a greater
involvement with Business in the Community
(BITC), the largest business-led charity
dedicated to Corporate Responsibility. Using
the guidance of BITC we are developing our
UK Corporate Responsibility agenda with the
view to expanding our vision and ambition
across the entire Group. We understand that
a sustainable approach to Corporate
Responsibility requires it to be intrinsic to 
all aspects of our business and only by
supporting our vision with a clear and
justified business strategy can we expect 
to support our actions across our global
operations for years to come.
At the start of December 2011 the UK
business adopted Lavendon Group’s new
Sustainability Policy. The policy outlines 
our commitment to working in a more
responsible and sustainable way using the
Business In The Community four pillars of
Corporate Responsibility. A copy of our
policy is displayed in this report and on the
Nationwide Platforms website. The policy
will begin being rolled out to our other
operations in 2012.
Environment
Human impact on the planet is all too well
understood and we recognise that as a
business we have a responsibility to manage
how we engage with our customers,
suppliers and employees to bring about
improvements to reduce the impact of our
operations on the environment. 
Our biggest environmental challenges come
from our transport fleets, our company cars
and our use of electricity. Tackling these
issues not only delivers a reduction in the
level of our emissions but also offers a
significant reduction in costs, while
improving the efficiency of our service.
As a part of our effort to reduce our vehicle
emissions we have replaced most of our 
delivery fleet in the UK business with vehicles
that emit lower levels of CO
2
and we offer
company cars that have the lowest CO
2
emissions in their banding, which is 
regularly reviewed and amended as newer
technologies come onto the market. At the
end of 2011 we also introduced a new
system to remould old tyres instead of
disposing of them, which allows us to cut
down on the waste and emissions associated
with buying new tyres.
To achieve our target of a 10% reduction 
in energy use by 2012, employees are
encouraged to switch off any unused office
equipment as a part of our ‘Big Switch Off’
campaign and printers are set to print double
sided where possible. A reduction in 10%
over our 2010 figures would deliver us over
£30,000 in savings and a decrease in CO
2
of almost 90,000 tonnes. We have plans 
to drive these savings throughout 2012 
and into the future years.
Reducing the amount of waste sent to
landfill is an issue that society at large faces,
and it is something that we take very
seriously. We understand that reducing our
waste not only saves the direct costs and
resources associated, but also reduces risk 
to public health, impact on communities,
pollution to water courses and damage to
the wider environment. In our business, we
also have to deal with the hazardous waste
associated with our processes, such 
as waste oil, batteries and solvents. We are
dedicated to challenging ourselves and 
the companies responsible for our waste
management to improve the amount of
waste we recycle. In our 2010 Annual Report
we set a target to recycle 97% of depot
waste. Achieving this target is not simple, 
but discussions with our waste management 
companies, improving waste handling
techniques and adopting best practice should
see us make progress towards this goal.
We are trialling new battery and charger
technologies with the aim of reducing the
amount of batteries that we dispose of by
extending their life or reconditioning them at
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   21 Working on a sustainable future
Principles and management 
We aim to conduct our business in a socially responsible manner and
actively promote a culture based on four key principles.
Management values
These principles are, in turn, reflected in a set of management values, which
have been adopted by the Board and senior management of the business
as the guide to how we endeavour to run our business:
Responsibility for all aspects of Corporate Responsibility rests with the Board, but in order to
involve staff fully in the decision-making process, a Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) Forum was
established. This forum acts as a steering committee for the organisation, evaluating
opportunities and providing direction for CR activities and awareness campaigns. Engagement
with major customers is starting to provide consistent objectives in areas such as energy
reduction targeting and CO
2
calculators for MEWPs.
• We provide a safe working environment.
• We aspire to be a motivated, professional team.
• We treat everyone with respect.
• We invest time and resources to develop each employee 
to their full potential.
• We behave like responsible co-owners of the business.
• We care about customers and colleagues alike.
• We are easy to do business with.
• We deliver on our promises, both operational and financial.
• Performance:
Valuing and rewarding the attainment of business goals.
• Integrity:
Being reliable, ethical, honest and straightforward in our
relationships with customers, staff, shareholders and suppliers.
• Process-orientation:
Encouraging a culture where business challenges are resolved
constructively and permanently and “fire-fighting” is avoided.
• Initiative:
Enabling staff to take ownership of business opportunities 
and to proactively collaborate in their personal development.
22        Lavendon Group plc 2011 the end of it. We are also negotiating the
resale of the batteries for reconditioning
after their useful life with our waste
management providers, this not only delivers
us savings, but ensures that the waste
batteries are more efficiently recycled.
In our 2010 Annual Report we introduced
our 6 KPIs for the Environment. We set
targets that would not only challenge our
employees but would tackle environmental
issues that will be relevant to us for the
foreseeable future. The Environment area
of focus arguably necessitates a greater
involvement from our workforce. Achieving
these targets requires our employees to
change their habits and involve themselves
more in the management process. It is
getting this involvement that requires more
than just a system change. It requires
clear and justified reasoning as well as
encouragement and leadership from all
areas of the business. Some of our targets
will be easier than others. Our machine
maintenance programme means machines
can remain in our fleet longer, be transferred
to other operating countries or be sold for
further use. In other areas though, we have
great challenges. Being a business reliant on
electricity for charging machines, operating
IT infrastructure and lighting office and
warehouse space, a reduction of 10% in
energy use by the end of 2012 will be a
challenge. 2012 will see the implementation
of various initiatives designed to help us
move closer towards achieving these targets.
Communities
At the end of 2010 we formed our charities
committee, tasked with putting in place a
measurable process of managing how much
money was donated to good causes. We
have continued to support our employees
fundraising efforts throughout 2011 with
our fundraising match programme, where
the Company matches up to £250 for any
individual’s fundraising efforts. 2011 also
saw us sponsor local community sports
teams as a means of raising our local profile.
The sports teams were nominated by our
staff within the communities.
In July 2011 our five Management Trainees,
with the support of other members of the
business, cycled from Aberdeen to Liskeard
to raise money for the Lighthouse Club
Benevolent Fund. Their effort raised over
£10,000 for the charity, including a
£2,500 match from Lavendon Group.
The Lighthouse Club Benevolent Fund was
identified by the Management Trainees
because of its strong association with
those affected by death or injury in the
construction industry, some of which will
have been due to falls from height.
In total for 2011, £48,934 of charitable
donations were made in support of local
and national charities.
2012 will see the introduction of our
volunteering policy which will encourage our
staff to take part in community volunteering
and charity events. Community volunteering
has been identified as a great way to
engage our employees in our corporate
responsibility aims, as well as developing
new skill sets, stronger teams and greater
community participation for our employees.
It is anticipated that a charity of the year,
nominated by our employee engagement
forum, will benefit from the use of
employee volunteers.
Lavendon Group has long supported the
training of apprentices, especially in
engineering trades, and we continue to
take on a new apprentices each year.
We understand that the benefit of an
apprenticeship scheme is that it allows us
to our train engineers from a basic level and
embed not just the skills but also the culture
of our Company. We recognise that the
engineering trade is becoming increasingly
under-subscribed and by working to
introduce engineers at an apprenticeship
level we hope to minimise the issue of
recruiting from an ever decreasing pool of
talent. Our apprentices come from all our
areas of the country including, some of
which are communities listed in the English
Indices of Deprivation for education and
employment. Promoting and developing
our apprenticeship scheme helps to tackle
these issues head on.
In addition, to our apprenticeship scheme,
we hope to continue to support the
prospect of engineering and our industry as
a career option by working with schools in
our local areas, either through our voluntary
ambitions or through partnering schools in
work related projects. 
On February 2nd 2012 we merged our three
UK businesses, Nationwide Platforms,
Panther and EPL Skylift under one name,
Nationwide Platforms. As a part of this
process, employee work wear will be
rebranded. In support of our community
focus, Lavendon Group will be working with
the National Industrial Symbiosis
Programme (NISP) to identify organisations
across our regions that can reuse or recycle
any work wear that is no longer required.
This has the dual benefit of reducing waste
and supporting the local community.
Our Community Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) for the end of 2012
involve creating a voluntary policy, a gifts in
kind policy and implementing a community
strategy. With the help of Business In The
Community these policies are currently in
development and we are confident of
delivering them during 2012.
Workplace
Our employees are the key to driving the
success of our Corporate Responsibility.
The workplace is where we engage our staff
with our CR aims and develop a sustained
approach to Corporate Responsibility.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   23

Corporate and

continued
The quality of our service to our customers is
based upon how we look after our people in
their work place. Key to this has always been
our health and safety record. We were first
awarded the RoSPA Gold award in 2010 and
again repeated this award in 2011, clearly
demonstrating our dedication to making
sure our employees can return from work
safely. This process has been supported by a
Company wide effort, from electing Safety
Representatives in each location to installing
technologies on our transport vehicles that
are designed to protect our drivers. By
championing our Health and Safety we are
not only protecting our employees from
injury and reducing the down time and costs
associated, but we also protect all those who
visit our workplace whether they are
customers, visitors or other contractors
carrying out work.
In 2008 Lavendon Group started the
TechX programme, designed to improve
efficiencies in work, health and safety
and general housekeeping through the
5S method (‘Sort, Set, Standardise, Shine and
Sustain’), which is embedded in the Toyota
Production Management lean philosophy.
This not only supports our commitment to
Health and Safety and the highest levels of
quality for our customers, but it goes a long
way to improving our work on helping the
environment. The TechX programme aids
the reduction and efficient streaming of
waste and it promotes the efficient
maintenance of machines, which together
with Planned Preventative Maintenance,
reduces the emissions and waste associated
with attending machine breakdowns. All of
this goes towards achieving our targets but
also delivering the highest standard of
quality to our customers.
The development and progression of our
employees is vital to us in order to retain
talent, develop the skills of our staff and
constantly improve on the service we offer
to our customers. Lavendon Group is keen to
promote its staff from within and with clear
and focused attention on our training we
will develop a pool of talent over time.
The Lavendon Academy delivered over
147 training courses to internal delegates in
2011, each aimed at developing the skills
and abilities of the employees in their line of
work whether the delegate was an engineer,
hire desk staff or managers. The first intake
to the Management Development Scheme
completed their course at the end of 2011
and the first intake of Management
Trainees will finish their two year training
scheme in April, 2012. 
We run an ‘employee of the month’ award
process that culminates in an ‘employee of
year’ awards ceremony. Employees are
nominated by their colleagues based upon
going above and beyond in their line of
work; these nominations are then discussed
to select a deserving winner. 
At the beginning of 2011 we re-elected the
Employee Engagement Forum. After two
years in post, the positions on the employee
forum were opened for re-election.
Employees across the business were
encouraged to nominate themselves or their
colleagues before voting for an individual
from the shortlist to represent them. Each
region and head office is represented and
the group meet every quarter with the aim
of increasing communication in all aspects
of our business. It provides employees with
an opportunity to voice their concerns and
simultaneously enables our management to
keep in touch with the views of our
employees on a variety of subjects. The
Forum also enables employees to receive
information on all crucial elements of our
business including business performance
and published financial information.
Our KPIs for the Workplace centre around
our ambition to be an employer of choice,
respected as a quality supplier, operating a
workplace that is safe for both our
employees and those who visit.
Measurement of employee and customer
opinion will be made through the use of a
Net Promoter Score. In June 2012 an
external party will undertake a survey of both
our employees and our customers in order
to gauge their opinion on our business.
With the investment made in our employees,
service and business offering in the past
years, we believe that these results will show
a great improvement over 2010 figures.
Our Zero Reportable Accidents target, while
ambitious, is the only result we will accept.
The safety of our workplace and the health
of our employees are of greatest concern
and we will continue to work at this until we
can guarantee that every employee can
return home safely from work. 
Marketplace
Lavendon Group is focussed on delivering
excellence to its customers, through
innovation and service. Our internal
programmes such as TechX, the Lavendon
Academy and Planned Preventative
Maintenance all go towards improving the
experience of the customer when dealing
with our Company. Further to this we have
the benefits that are coming out of our
Corporate Responsibility work. 
Responding to our customers needs for a
developed CR approach, we have been
working on providing them with
technologies that can improve their
productivity, their health and safety and
their environmental practises.
The BlueSky range of products, exclusive to
Lavendon Group, offers a range of solutions
to our customers that can help to reduce
unsafe practises. Product examples are
SkyRack, which is designed to carry pipe
work safely to height, the SkySiren, which
has been designed specifically to prevent
crushing hazards in a boom lift, and the
SkySentry, which prevents unauthorised use
of machines. In 2012 the development,
trial and implementation of further new
technologies will continue, helping our
customers to work in a safer and in some
cases more environmentally friendly way.
Carbon emissions have become an ever
increasingly important topic when talking to
our customers and other organisations
involved in our business operations. That is
why we have been working with the
European Rental Association (ERA) on
developing a reliable method to calculate the
CO
2
emissions associated with the hire of a
machine. By providing our customers with
this information we intend to demonstrate
how the work that we are doing is reducing
the CO
2
associated with the hire of a
machine, while providing our customers with
data that can help them understand the
impact of the machines they are using.
Our Marketplace KPIs reflect our strong
ability to innovate and our determination to
offer an unparalleled service to our
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Lavendon Group plc 2011   25 customers. 2012 will see us start to offer
CO
2
statements. We also expect to see a
continued interest in our SkySiren product
designed to prevent operator entrapment.
The amount of customers using this device
has been significant and we believe 2012
will see more companies demand it as a
minimum requirement on boom type
Mobile Elevated Work Platforms. Innovation
of new products and services will continue
in 2012 and our ambition is to add to our
range products, new attachments or
enhancements that offer the ability to
reduce our customer’s use of electricity.
Strong relationships with our customers
and their projects offer us the unique
ability to trial and develop new products
in tandem with their requirements, while
helping us to achieve our own CR targets
and ambitions.
Expanding our vision
Until now our CR focus has been on the UK
business. In 2012 the Sustainability Policy
will be adopted across the Group and we
will begin to introduce our strategy into
our other global locations. By establishing
a CR Focus Group, with nominated
representatives in each operation, we will
use our experiences from the UK to get
Corporate Responsibility on the agenda
in these other operations.
We understand that there will be a varying
national emphasis on Corporate
Responsibility in each of our operating
countries, and that each location will have a
different starting point, but with the positive
experiences of its implementation in the UK,
the introduction of a wider Corporate
Responsibility programme across the rest of
our Group will greatly benefit us.
The CR Focus Group will work to identify
issues specific to each operating country and
assess the risks and opportunities associated
with implementing a framework of change
around them. By working with our
representatives in each location we will
create a set of targets and ambitions that
support our Sustainability Policy across the
entire Group. This will ensure that these
targets are intrinsic to our operations,
supporting implementation not just because
they achieve our wider Corporate
Responsibility aims, but because they have
clear strategic business advantages.
The implementation and coordination of
our Corporate Responsibility in the UK has
demonstrated that not only can our
operations deliver savings and greater
engagement with our workforce, but the
systems and processes that we put in place
are promoting best practise and are
delivering a better service to our customers.
It is this realisation that is of paramount
importance in sustaining our Corporate
Responsibility and this is the message that
we will give when introducing the idea of
Corporate Responsibility to our other
operations. We believe that by promoting
this agenda in our other territories, where
a national focus on CR might not be so
prominent, we can deliver the same
benefits outlined in this report. 
Throughout 2012 we will continue to
develop our Corporate Responsibility
programme and, supported by the feedback
from the BITC CR Index submission of 2011,
we will identify our strengths and
weaknesses and use this information to
develop an ever more sustainable approach
to Corporate Responsibility.

This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and is in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under
the Companies Act 2006 as well as the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The report describes
how the principles relating to director’s remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 (“the Code”) have been applied during the
year. A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company on 19 April 2012.
Auditable information
The Remuneration report has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as required by Schedule 8 to the Companies Act 2006 as follows.
Under Part 3 of the schedule, the following sections of the Remuneration report are subject to audit: directors’ remuneration, directors’
pension entitlement, Long term equity incentives and directors’ interests. The remaining sections of the Remuneration report are unaudited.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) comprises the two non-executive directors of the Company, Jan Åstrand (Chairman of
the Committee) and Andrew Wood, together with the Group’s Chairman John Standen. All members of the Committee are considered to
be independent by the Company. The terms of reference for the Committee are available from the Lavendon Group website
(www.lavendongroup.com). The Committee’s principal duties are summarised below:
• Make recommendations to the Board on the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Company’s Chairman, executive
directors and other senior management members as shall be determined;
• Review the remuneration policy on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate and that members of executive management are
rewarded fairly and provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance; and
• Review and approve the design, determine the targets and level of annual awards for any performance related bonus schemes and
long-term incentive schemes.
During the year, the Committee were advised by Aon Hewitt, a firm of independent executive remuneration consultants, on its current
remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of the Company’s executive directors (Aon Hewitt did not provide any other services
to the Company or Group in the year). The Committee met on four occasions during the year where the following matters were reviewed:
• whether any bonus was payable to executive directors under the annual bonus scheme for 2010;
• the design of the annual bonus scheme, including targets, for executive directors for 2011;
• whether any awards made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme in earlier years were to vest;
• the level of awards to be made under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Scheme for 2011, together with the performance measures
and targets that were to apply to these awards;
• the details of the termination payment to Kevin Appleton, the Group’s previous Chief Executive Officer;
• the details of the remuneration package for Don Kenny, the Group’s new Chief Executive Officer;
• the appropriateness of the Company’s remuneration policy and the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and
senior management members; and
• approval of the Remuneration report for 2010.
The Committee has undertaken a review of the remuneration arrangements of the executive directors, to ensure that the arrangements
support the business strategy and are fully aligned with the interests of shareholders. As a result of this review, the Committee is seeking
shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for a new Deferred Share Bonus Plan to run in conjunction with the
existing Long Term Incentive Plan. Under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, executive directors will be required to defer part of their annual
bonus in shares. In addition, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the executive directors may voluntarily invest part or all of
their remaining cash bonus in shares and receive a potential matching award subject to performance over a three year period (up to a 1:1
match on the gross bonus invested). Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, the first voluntary deferral of bonus
eligible for matching under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan would be made in 2013 (assuming executive investment of bonus earned in
2012). It is currently intended that the performance conditions for the first matching awards will be based on earnings per share and
return on capital employed reflecting the strategic priorities of the business to grow earnings and improve returns on the Company’s
invested capital. The actual targets will be set prior to the grant of the awards and communicated in the relevant remuneration report.
In addition, the Committee is introducing clawback provisions to be applied to future awards under the annual bonus scheme, Long Term
Incentive Plan and the new Deferred Share Bonus Plan. This reflects best practice guidelines as set out in the Code and enables the
Committee to ‘clawback’ awards in prescribed circumstances.
28 Lavendon Group plc 2011
Remuneration report In summary, the changes are designed to:
• strengthen the alignment between corporate performance and executive reward by increasing the weighting of key financial
performance metrics;
• increase the levels of executive shareholding to encourage a longer term focus; and
• reflect changes in corporate governance best practice, through the introduction of clawback provisions into the executive incentive schemes.
The Committee believes that the increase in potential total remuneration that results from these proposals is merited by the level of
performance required to generate the increased payouts. Further details on the Deferred Share Bonus Plan are set out in the Notice and
Agenda of Annual General Meeting and associated appendix at the end of this annual report.
Details of attendance at Remuneration Committee meetings are given in the Corporate governance report on page 46.
Directors’ remuneration packages
In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors of the Group, and advising, where appropriate, on the remuneration
policies relating to the Group’s senior management below Board level, the Committee aims to ensure that:
• executives are appropriately rewarded for their contributions to the Group, and account is taken of their individual responsibility
and performance;
• remuneration packages reflect current market conditions in order to attract, retain and motivate executives of a high quality;
• rewards are linked to the Group’s performance so that the interests of the executives are aligned with those of the Company’s
shareholders; and
• the Company complies with the Code of Best Practice set out in the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The Board has determined the fees payable for the Chairman and the non-executive directors with reference to current market
conditions and after consultation with external advisers.
Directors’ remuneration
The remuneration paid to individual directors in 2011 is summarised in the table below:

Remuneration report

Amounts shown as salary and fees relate to base salary in the case of executive directors and fees in the case of the Chairman and the
non-executive directors. John Standen and Jan Åstrand received additional fees of £145,000 and £99,000 respectively, due to their
expanded interim responsibilities as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive – Europe while the search for the Company’s new Chief
Executive Officer was being undertaken. Andrew Wood received additional fees of £8,125 due to the increase in his responsibilities
for the period that John Standen and Jan Åstrand assumed interim executive roles in the management of the Group. The fees of
Jan Åstrand and Andrew Wood include a supplementary payment of £8,125 to their base fees as non-executive directors for the year,
that relates to the time commitment required at the start of their terms of appointment to become fully briefed on the Group’s
operations and markets.
In addition to Kevin Appleton’s termination payment of £312,000, shown in the above table, the Committee determined that awards over
136,500 shares in the Company, previously granted under the Company’s 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2010, would vest on the date
of cessation of his employment. These awards were exercised on 9 August 2011 and had a value, on exercise, of £136,500.
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of the executive director’s remuneration packages should be performance related,
that encourage the long-term success of the Company. The targeted composition of each director’s remuneration is as follows:
Base salary 
and fees Performance related
Don Kenny 52% 48%
Alan Merrell 52% 48%
John Standen 100% 0%
Jan Åstrand 100% 0%
Andrew Wood 100% 0%
The individual components of the executive director’s remuneration package are summarised below:
Base salary
The Committee reviews salaries of executive directors annually, with changes taking effect on 1 January of each year. In determining
salary increases the Committee takes into account individual performance, market data and the policy being adopted by the Company
for pay reviews elsewhere in the Company or Group. Salaries are benchmarked against comparable roles in companies of a similar size
and in companies within the industry sector. Base salaries were reviewed in January 2011, with no increases being awarded to the
executive directors, and again in January 2012 when Alan Merrell’s base salary was increased to £230,000. Don Kenny’s current salary,
set on his appointment to the Company in October 2011, is £315,000.
Benefits in kind
The executive directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally company cars, private medical insurance and disability cover.
Directors’ pension entitlement
The Company does not offer a defined benefit pension scheme, instead it makes contributions to individual executive pension schemes.
Executive directors are also offered ‘cash in lieu’, as an alternative to pension scheme contributions.
In 2011, the Company contributed 25% of Don Kenny’s and Alan Merrell’s base salaries to individual executive pension schemes, totalling
£19,688 and £50,000 respectively. Lavendon Group plc 2011 31
Annual bonus payments
The Committee establishes the criteria that must be met in each financial year if a bonus is to become payable to the executive
directors. For 2011, the maximum bonus potential was 150% of salary with 45% being payable for on-target performance. The targets
established were a combination of financial performance and corporate objectives, with 75% of the bonus opportunity based on the
financial performance of the Group. The financial performance targets had to be achieved before any bonus relating to corporate
objectives became payable. Specifically for 2011, the Group’s financial performance had to deliver an operating profit before
amortisation and exceptional items of £28 million and a return on capital employed of 8.4% before any bonus payments would start to
accrue. The maximum bonus potential would be earned if operating profits before amortisation and exceptional items for the year were
£35 million and the Group’s return on capital employed reached 11.0%. The Group achieved its target level of performance for the year,
and therefore a bonus payment of 45% of base salary became payable to Don Kenny and Alan Merrell, with Don Kenny’s bonus being
pro-rated from 1 October 2011, being the date he joined the Company.
The bonus scheme for 2012 will operate on a similar basis, with achievement of a combination of financial performance and corporate
objectives being required before any bonuses become payable. In addition, should a bonus become payable in excess of £30,000, then
30% of any bonus payable will be deferred into shares of the Company for a period of one year under the new Deferred Share Bonus
Plan, which is seeking shareholders approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Long term equity incentives
The Committee has responsibility to supervise the Company’s long-term equity incentive schemes, determining the level of annual
awards and their associated performance conditions. The executive directors currently have outstanding awards under two equity
incentive schemes, the 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan. The Share Option
Scheme is now closed and no further awards will be made under it. The Share Option Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan are
described in more detail below.
1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme
The awards granted under this Scheme are detailed in the table below, and are subject to performance conditions that require a range
of earnings per share growth targets to be met. The Scheme is now closed and no further awards will be made.

Note:
(i) The options granted to Alan Merrell and Kevin Appleton on 27 February 2002 were exceptional grants made by deed (all other options have been granted under the
terms of the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme). The options will not be exercisable unless growth in pre-exceptional earnings per share
(“EPS”) exceeds growth in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) over the performance period by at least an average of 8 per cent per annum in the case of Alan Merrell’s option
and 3 per cent per annum in the case of Kevin Appleton’s option. The options will be exercisable in full if growth in pre-exceptional EPS exceeds growth in RPI by at least
an average of 12 per cent per annum in the case of Alan Merrell’s option, and 6 per cent per annum in the case of Kevin Appleton’s option. Each option will be exercisable on
a straight-line basis between nil and 100% between the two applicable percentage targets. The performance target will be measured over an initial period of three financial
years and may be achieved in each successive year thereafter provided that the period over which the performance target is measured will be extended to include each
additional successive year up to the tenth anniversary of grant and the target will always be measured from the fixed base of the financial year preceding the year of grant.
The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2011 was 87.25 pence; the range of market prices during the year was
between 80.00 pence and 119.75 pence. The options were not exercised during the year, and the options lapsed on 27 February 2012. Remuneration report

2006 Long Term Incentive Plan
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the Company is able to make annual awards up to 150% of base salary each year. The performance
period for each annual award is three years with no retesting available. The performance measures are either a combination of ‘Total
Shareholder Return’ and ‘Earnings per Share’ targets, or ‘Total Shareholder Return’ as a sole measure. The awards granted under this Plan
to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:

Notes:
(i) The awards are subject to performance conditions. The vesting of 50% of the awards will be based on the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance and the vesting of the other half
will be based on the Company’s ‘EPS’ performance. EPS will be measured by reference to the fully diluted EPS as disclosed in the audited annual financial statements
adjusted to exclude unusual or non-recurring items at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The vesting of the TSR-related half of the awards will require the
Company’s TSR performance over a single three-year period to be at least £5.00 for 7.5% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% of the awards
vesting if the share price is a least £7.50. The EPS-related element will require the Company’s EPS in 2010 to be at least equal to 30.22p for 7.5% of the awards to vest
and greater than or equal to 44.61p for 50% of the awards to vest. The performance conditions of these awards were not met during the performance period, and the
awards lapsed on 23 April 2011.
(ii) The awards are subject to performance conditions. The vesting of 50% of the awards will be based on the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance and the vesting of the other
half will be based on the Company’s ‘EPS’ performance. EPS will be measured by reference to the fully diluted EPS as disclosed in the audited annual financial statements
adjusted to exclude unusual or non-recurring items at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The vesting of the TSR-related half of the awards will require the
Company’s TSR performance over a single three-year period to be at least £2.00 for 7.5% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% of the awards
vesting if the share price is a least £4.00. The EPS-related element will require the Company’s EPS in 2011 to be at least equal to 33.10p for 7.5% of the awards to vest
and greater than or equal to 48.92p for 50% of the awards to vest.
(iii) The awards are subject to a performance condition. The vesting of 100% of the awards will be based on the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance relative to the performance of
the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts (the “Index”). The vesting of the awards will require the Company’s TSR performance over a single three-year period
to be at least equal to the performance of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if the TSR performance
is 60% or more above the performance of the index.

Company performance
The chart below shows the Company’s performance, measured by ‘Total Shareholder Return’ (TSR), compared to the FTSE Small Cap
Index excluding Investment Trusts (the ‘Index’) for the five years ended 31 December 2011. The Company considers the Index to be the
most meaningful comparison of historic share price performance in assessing the Company against an index of similarly sized businesses.
Total shareholder return reflects the theoretical growth in
value of a shareholding over the period assuming that gross
dividends are reinvested to purchase additional shares at
the closing price applicable on the ex-dividend date.
Directors’ service contracts
In keeping with recommended practices under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), the Group’s policy on executive
directors’ service contracts is that no notice period of employment should exceed twelve months duration and that contractual
termination payments must not exceed the notice period in the directors’ service contracts at the time of termination. In relation to the
service contract of Don Kenny, if in the first six months of employment there is a change of control of the Company and within six
months of that change in control his service contract is terminated, then he shall be entitled to a termination payment of six months
salary in addition to his notice period. The service contracts of both Don Kenny and Alan Merrell contain provisions relating to their
duty to mitigate their loss in the event of termination.
The executive directors have service contracts with the Company and the Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of
appointment, which in the case of the non-executive directors, are for a period of three years. Details of the service contracts and
letters of appointment are given below:

aerial access for people in a broad range of applications: in industrial repair and maintenance; construction; telecommunications; outside
broadcasting; sign erection; and highway maintenance. These activities are undertaken both in the UK and overseas.
Review of the business
The Group is required to set out in this report a fair review of the business of the Group during the financial year ended 31 December 2011
and of the position of the Group as at 31 December 2011, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the
Group (known as a ‘Business review’). The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business review can be found in the following
sections of the Chief Executive’s review: Review of performance by country on pages 6 to 7; Business and market overview on page 11; and
within the Operating and financial review: Risks on pages 17 to 20; and Corporate responsibility on pages 21 to 27 which are incorporated
in this report by reference.
Financial results
The financial results for the year are set out in the Group income statement on page 50. The Group profit for the year of £9,377,000 (2010:
profit of £8,043,000) will be transferred to reserves. The position at the end of the year is set out in the Group balance sheet on page 51.
Dividend
In addition to the interim dividend of 0.37 pence per share paid during the year, the directors recommend a final dividend for the year of
1.38 pence per share (2010: interim dividend of 0.33 pence per share, final dividend of 0.67 pence per share) (see note 13).
Directors
The directors of the Company during the year are shown on page 42. Information on the directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the
Company during 2011 is set out in the Remuneration report on pages 28 to 34.
No director has, or has had, any beneficial interest in any transaction of significance, which has been effected by any Group company at
any time during the year.
The Company has maintained insurance throughout the year to cover all directors against liabilities in relation to the Company and its
subsidiary undertakings.
Employees
The Group pursues a policy of employee communication through regular team briefings and newsletters. Personal employee development is
encouraged through the provision of relevant training towards industry accredited certification and licences. Employee involvement in the
financial performance of the Group is encouraged through a comprehensive range of well-established profit share programmes. The Group
consults with employees on a regular basis so their views can be taken into account in making decisions that might effect their interests.
It is the policy of the Group that disabled people, whether registered or not, should receive full and fair consideration for all job vacancies
for which they are suitable applicants. Employees who become disabled during employment will be retained wherever possible and
retrained if necessary. The Group is prepared to modify procedures or equipment wherever this is practicable, to allow full use to be
made of an individual’s abilities.
The Board has issued a statement of business operations and culture detailing the Group’s commitment to ensuring that all employees comply
with all applicable laws and regulations, support a culture of honesty and integrity, conduct operations in an ethical and professional manner,
and act at all times to prevent impropriety, discrimination, bribery and corruption. The Board also operates an independent whistle-blowing
system across the Group’s operations to allow employees to raise matters that they feel should be addressed by the Group.
Non-current assets
During the year the Group’s total capital expenditure on non-current assets amounted to £16,929,000 (2010: £14,685,000). Details of this
expenditure, and all other non-current asset movements, are set out in notes 14 and 15 to these financial statements. Issue of share capital
By resolutions passed at the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2011 the directors were generally and unconditionally authorised for the
purposes of Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares and grant
rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares:
(a) up to an aggregate nominal amount (within the meaning of Section 551(3) and (6) of the Act) of £549,708 (such amount to be
reduced by the nominal amount allotted or granted under (b) below in excess of such sum); and
(b) comprising equity securities (as defined in Section 560 of the Act) up to an aggregate nominal amount (within the meaning of
Section 551(3) and (6) of the Act) of £1,099,417 (such amount to be reduced by any allotments or grants made under (a) above) in
connection with or pursuant to an offer by way of a rights issue in favour of holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as nearly as
practicable) to the respective number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment (and holders of any
other class of equity securities entitled to participate therein or if the directors consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of
those securities), but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may consider necessary or appropriate to deal
with fractional entitlements, treasury shares, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under the laws
of, or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever.
These authorisations expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 19 April 2012, and the
directors are re-proposing that renewal should be sought. Such proposals are set out as resolutions 11 and 12 in the Notice of the
Annual General Meeting on pages 94 to 104. Details of movements in share capital during the year are set out in note 27 to the Group’s
financial statements.
In addition, the directors have been given power pursuant to Sections 570(1) and 573 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to:
(a) allot equity securities (as defined in Section 560 of the Act) of the Company for cash pursuant to the authorisation conferred by that
resolution; and
(b) sell ordinary shares (as defined in Section 560(1) of the Act) held by the Company as treasury shares for cash, as if Section 561 of
the Act did not apply to any such allotment or sale, provided that this power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities for
cash and the sale of treasury shares:
i. in connection with or pursuant to an offer of or invitation to acquire equity securities (but in the case of the authorisation granted
under (b) above, by way of a rights issue only) in favour of holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the
respective number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment or sale (and holders of any other class of
equity securities entitled to participate therein or if the directors consider it necessary, as permitted by the rights of those
securities) but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may consider necessary or appropriate to deal
with fractional entitlements, treasury shares, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under the laws
of or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever; and
ii. in the case of the authorisation granted under (a) above (or in the case of any transfer of treasury shares), and otherwise than
pursuant to paragraph (i), up to an aggregate nominal amount of £82,456.
These authorities expire (unless renewed, varied or revoked) at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 19 April 2012.
During the year, the Company issued an aggregate of 359,422 ordinary shares (2010: 1,643,860 ordinary shares) of 1 pence each:
222,922 shares were issued under the Share Incentive Plan and 136,500 shares were issued following the vesting of awards under the
Lavendon 2006 Long term Incentive Plan.
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on admission of its ordinary shares to the Official List of the London Stock
Exchange on 10 October 1996, namely:
i. the Lavendon Group 1996 Company Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Scheme’); and
ii. the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the ‘Executive Scheme’).
Options were granted under the terms of the schemes on the day following the announcement of the Group’s interim and annual
financial results each year at an option price equal to the mid-market quoted share price derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily
Official List at the close of trading on the preceding day. No further share options will be issued under these schemes, as the schemes
were closed on reaching their tenth anniversary on 10 October 2006.
Directors’ report

36 Lavendon Group plc 2011 Lavendon Group plc 2011 37
The value of options granted to any individual during a year was subject to an individual limit such that the aggregate exercise price of all
options granted during a year could not exceed 200 per cent of base annual salary in the case of a director, or 100 per cent in the case
of any other employee.
Options were granted subject to the following performance targets:
The Employee Scheme
An option would be exercisable in full if growth in pre-exceptional earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeded growth in the Retail Price Index
(“RPI”) over the performance period by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
The Executive Scheme
An option would not be exercisable unless growth in pre-exceptional EPS exceeded growth in the RPI over the performance period by an
average of at least 3 per cent per annum. The option would be exercisable in full if growth in EPS exceeded growth in the RPI by an
average of at least 6 per cent per annum. The option would be exercisable on a straight line basis between these two percentage levels.
All performance targets are measured over an initial three year period and to the extent that they are not met, will be retested. In the case of an
option granted in the period to 31 August 2003, the target may be achieved on a three-year rolling basis up to the tenth anniversary of grant in
the case of the Employee Scheme, and the seventh anniversary in the case of the Executive Scheme. Any options granted after this date will be
capable of being retested annually over 0-4 years and 0-5 years, provided that the target will always be measured from the fixed base of the
financial year immediately prior to grant and the option will lapse to the extent that the target has not been achieved by the end of the fifth year.
There is a two year period over which options can be exercised. The options remain exercisable until the seventh anniversary of their date of grant.
Details of options granted to executive directors are disclosed separately in the Remuneration report on pages 28 to 34.
Details of all other share options granted under the terms of the schemes, that still have options exercisable at 31 December 2011, are

No options were granted in the current year as the above schemes are now closed.
Share incentive plan
During 2007 the Company established a Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’).
The SIP is a UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) approved plan under which the Company can provide share benefits in a tax
advantaged way to all its UK employees on the same terms. Details of the shares issued under the SIP are detailed in note 28.
The SIP allows the Company to either give “free shares” to employees or provide a facility for employees to purchase shares from their
pre-tax salary. Shares purchased by employees may be supplemented by the Company with additional free “matching shares”. Operation
The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) supervises the operation of the SIP.
The SIP comprises the following three elements and the Board may decide which element to offer to eligible employees:
(a) “Free Shares” are ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) which may be allocated to an employee.
The market value of Free Shares allocated to any employee in any tax year may not exceed £3,000 or such other limit as may be
permitted by the relevant legislation. Free Shares may be allocated to employees equally, on the basis of salary, length of service or
hours worked, or on the basis of performance, as permitted by legislation.
(b) “Partnership Shares” are Shares an employee may purchase out of their pre-tax earnings.
The market value of Partnership Shares which an employee can purchase in any tax year may not exceed £1,500 (or 10% of the
employee’s salary, if lower), or such other limit as may be permitted by the relevant legislation. The funds used to purchase
Partnership Shares will be deducted from the employee’s pre-tax salary.
(c) “Matching Shares” are free Shares which may be allocated to an employee who purchases Partnership Shares.
The Board may allocate Matching Shares to an employee who purchases Partnership Shares up to a maximum of two Matching
Shares for every one Partnership Share purchased (or such other maximum ratio as may be permitted by the relevant legislation).
The same Matching Share ratio will apply to all employees who purchase Partnership Shares under the SIP on the same occasion.
An award of Shares may not be made under the SIP later than ten years after shareholder approval of the SIP.
Eligibility
Employees of the Company and any designated participating subsidiary who are UK resident taxpayers are eligible to participate.
The Board may allow non-UK tax resident taxpayers to participate. The Board may require employees to have completed a qualifying
period of employment of up to 18 months in order to be eligible to participate. All eligible employees must be invited to participate.
Retention of shares
The trustee of the SIP trust will award Free Shares and Matching Shares to employees and hold those Shares on behalf of the
participants. Free Shares and Matching Shares must usually be retained by the trustee of the SIP trust for a period of between three
and five years after award. The trustee will acquire Partnership Shares on behalf of participants and hold those Shares on behalf of the
participants. Employees can withdraw Partnership Shares from the SIP trust at any time.
The Board may decide that awards of Free Shares and/or Matching Shares will be forfeited if participants cease to be employed by a
company in the Company’s Group within three years from the grant of those awards unless they leave by reason of death, injury,
disability, redundancy, retirement on or after reaching age 50, or the business or company for which they work ceases to be part of the
Company’s Group. In any of those cases, the participants will be required to withdraw their Shares from the SIP.
If an employee ceases to be employed by the Company’s Group at any time after acquiring Partnership Shares, he will be required to
withdraw the Shares from the SIP trust.
Corporate events
In the event of a general offer being made to shareholders, participants will be able to direct the trustees how to act in relation to
their Shares. In the event of a corporate reorganisation any Shares held by participants may be replaced by equivalent shares in a
new holding company.
Dividends on shares held by the trustee of the SIP
Any dividends paid on Shares held by the trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants may be either used to acquire additional Shares for
employees (“Dividend Shares”) or distributed to participants.
Rights attaching to shares
An employee will be treated as the beneficial owner of Shares held on his behalf by the trustee of the SIP.
Any Shares allotted under the SIP will rank equally with Shares then in issue except for rights attaching to such Shares by reference to a
record date prior to their allotment.

Overall SIP limits
The SIP may operate over new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share
capital of the Company under the SIP and any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purpose of this limit unless institutional investor bodies decide that they need not count.
Variation of capital
In the case of a variation in the share capital of the Company, Shares held in the SIP will be treated in the same way as other shares.
Alterations to the SIP
The Board may, at any time, amend the SIP in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for any
amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on participation, the overall limits
on the issue of Shares or the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, Shares
to be acquired and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain prior shareholder approval will not, however, apply to any minor alteration to benefit the administration of the
SIP, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control, or regulatory treatment for any
participant or any company in the Company’s Group.
General
Awards made under the SIP are not transferable other than to the participant’s personal representatives in the event of their death.
No benefits received under the SIP will be pensionable.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) have been the Company’s auditors since the Group’s flotation in 1996, with the Group audit partner changing
by rotation, most recently in 2008. During 2011, the Company’s Audit Committee reviewed the effectiveness of the auditors and recommended to
the Board that a resolution to re-appoint PwC be proposed at the Annual General Meeting. Consequently a resolution to reappoint PwC as auditors
to the Company will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting together with a resolution authorising the director’s to fix their remuneration.
A review of PwC’s effectiveness will be undertaken in 2012 following completion of the 2011 year end audit. The Audit Committee will
continue to keep under review the independence and objectivity of the Company’s external auditors. There are no contractual
obligations restricting the Company’s choice of external auditor.

Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration report and the Group and the Parent Company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union, and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state that the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and with regard to the Parent
Company financial statements that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group will continue in business, in which case there should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as necessary. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them
to ensure that the financial statements and the Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Directors’ statement pursuant to the Disclosure and Transparency Rules
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in the Directors and advisers section of the Annual Report confirms that,
to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the Parent Company
financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and the Company; and
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group,
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group web site, www.lavendongroup.com. Legislation in the
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of the financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware and they have
taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and
to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.

The Chairman holds separate meetings, at least annually, with the non-executive directors in order to review the contributions and
performance of all individuals comprising the Board.
The Company reviews conduct and liability issues as part of its annual risk review and mitigates these exposures through Directors and
Officer’s insurance cover where appropriate.
Board balance, independence and commitment
The two non-executive directors constitute, excluding the Chairman, one half of the Board. The non-executive directors provide a strong
and independent monitor on the performance of both the Company and its executive management.
The Board believes that the non-executive directors are independent within the guidance of the Code as they have not been previously
employed by the Company (although John Standen and Jan Åstrand undertook interim executive roles for four months during the year while
the Company recruited a new Chief Executive Officer), do not currently and have not had a material business relationship with the Company,
are remunerated on a fixed fee basis, do not have close family ties with the Company’s advisers, directors or senior employees, do not hold
cross directorships with the other directors nor have other significant links with other directors, do not represent significant shareholders and
have not served on the Board for more than nine years. Their backgrounds in industry and finance make them suitably qualified to perform
their duties as members of the Board and as members of the Audit, and Remuneration and Nomination Committees. The executive directors, Don Kenny and Alan Merrell, do not hold non-executive directorships outside of the Company. Neither the
Chairman nor non-executive directors currently hold other roles that are considered to impair or conflict with their abilities to fulfill their
duties to the Company.
Appointments to the Board
The Nomination Committee is chaired by the Company’s Chairman, John Standen, with the two non-executive directors, Jan Åstrand,
and Andrew Wood as members of the Committee. The Committee has written terms of reference, which are published on the Company’s
website (www.lavendongroup.com). The principal responsibilities of the Committee are to consider and review the structure and
composition of the Board and its committees, identification and consideration of candidates for appointment to the Board, re-election
of Board members retiring by rotation and succession planning in general. All Committee members are considered to be independent.
During 2011, the Nomination Committee held two formal meetings. The attendance of each director at these meetings is shown in the
table below:

Apologies given ––––
* Tim Ross retired from the Company’s Board on 20 April 2011
In addition to the formal meetings of the Nomination Committee, a number of informal discussions took place during the year.
The appointment of Don Kenny as Chief Executive Officer of the Company was made following an external search, undertaken by an
unconnected third party search consultancy, to identify suitable candidates.
Information and professional development
Board papers are circulated to all members of the Board in advance of each meeting, and the quantity and focus of such information is
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Directors provide feedback to management to enable the reporting formats and content of Board papers
to be enhanced, and make individual enquiries of management for clarification on issues whenever necessary.
The Company allows directors to take professional and independent advice as may be necessary in carrying out their duties. Directors
also attend training courses, when appropriate, to ensure they remain up to date with the latest developments and legal requirements
that impact their individual responsibilities.
The joint role of Finance Director and Company Secretary, held by Alan Merrell, ensures that the directors have ready access to the
Company Secretary in all relevant matters and that compliance with Board procedures is maintained.
Performance evaluation
The Board has undertaken an annual review of its performance in 2011. This review was facilitated by the directors completing detailed
appraisals on matters relevant to the Board, its Committees and director performance, from which action plans were developed, where
necessary, to address areas identified for improvement.
Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, all directors are subject to election at the Company’s first Annual General
Meeting following their appointment, and all are required to seek re-election at intervals of no more than three years. In accordance with
best practice, this year all the Company’s directors will seek re-election, and their biographical details and the Annual General Meeting
particulars are detailed on page 42 and on pages 94 to 104.

Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The directors and auditors set out their respective responsibilities for preparing and reviewing the financial statements in the Statement
of directors’ responsibilities on page 41 and in the Independent auditors’ report on page 49. The Company’s strategy for delivering
sustained value over the longer term is set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 12 to 20, which also incorporates the
Company’s review on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern principle in preparing the financial statements for 2011.
Risk management and internal control
The Board maintains a system of internal controls within the Company to manage risks and provide a reasonable, but not absolute,
degree of assurance on the reliability of the financial and other information used both within the business and for external publication, as
well as safeguarding the assets of the Company against unauthorised use or disposition. The systems in place are designed to identify to
the Board, on a timely basis, matters that require attention so that they may be considered and dealt with appropriately. The Board has
reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control that were in operation during the past financial year, and up to the date of
the annual report, and these are summarised under the following headings:
• Control environment
There is a clearly defined organisational structure that allows the Company’s objectives to be planned, communicated, executed,
controlled and monitored. The Company employs suitably qualified staff so that the appropriate level of authority can be delegated
to ensure the efficient management of the business. Delegated authority limits are embedded throughout the organization, covering
the preparation and review of financial and operational information, the setting of appropriate local authority levels and the defining
of procedures for seeking and obtaining approval for major transactions and organisational changes.
• Identification and evaluation of business risks and control objectives
The identification, evaluation and management of both financial and non financial business risks facing the Company is reviewed
annually by the Board. During this process the effectiveness of its internal controls in safeguarding against these risks is considered,
and where necessary additional controls are introduced or existing controls are enhanced.
• Information systems
The management information systems provide the Company with relevant and timely reports from which both the Board and senior
management can monitor the performance of the business. Budgets and prior year data provide the Board and senior management
with comparative information with which to assess and monitor the performance of the various activities of the Company.
Operational performance statistics are reviewed against a range of measures including competitive benchmarks and historical trends.
The Group has continued to invest in developing and enhancing these information systems during the year, to ensure that the
information is provided in the most efficient manner.
• Monitoring
The executive directors have significant involvement in the day-to-day management of the Company’s activities and are, therefore,
able to monitor the control procedures at an operational and financial level. A Group Executive Committee, comprising the two
executive directors and direct reports from the operating subsidiaries and business functional units, meets regularly to discuss key
operational risks and issues, monitor business unit performance and ensure efficient communication.
The Group has in place appropriate internal control and risk management systems in relation to the preparation of their consolidated accounts.
The Group maintains an internal audit function, outsourced to Grant Thornton LLP, which undertakes a programme of audits across the
Group. Each year, a risk workshop is held to identify and evaluate the key business risks, from which a focused audit programme is
developed and agreed with the executive and the Audit Committee. The internal audit reports are addressed to, and reviewed by, the
Audit Committee, and appropriate actions, if required, agreed. In addition, the Company’s operations are subject to regular Quality and
Health & Safety audits.
Any reportable control weaknesses identified by the Company’s external auditors are discussed with the Audit Committee, and reports
circulated to the relevant executive directors. Audit Committee and Auditors
The Audit Committee Chairman is Andrew Wood, with Jan Åstrand and John Standen as members of the Committee. The Committee’s
main responsibilities and activities are set out in a separate Audit Committee report on page 48. The Committee has written terms
of reference, which are published on the Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com). All Committee members are considered to
be independent.
During 2011 the Audit Committee held four formal meetings. The attendance of each director at these meetings (and the occasions at
which the Group’s external auditors attended) is shown in the table below:

Remuneration
The Remuneration Committee Chairman is Jan Åstrand, with John Standen and Andrew Wood as members of the Committee.
The Committee has written terms of reference, which are published on the Company’s website (www.lavendongroup.com).
All Committee members are considered to be independent.
The Remuneration Committee considers it is complying in full with the relevant provisions of the Code and outlines its procedures and
guidelines in a separate Remuneration report on pages 28 to 34. Details of the directors’ remuneration and interests in shares during
2011 are included within the Remuneration report. The Committee annually invites shareholders to vote on the Remuneration report
at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
During 2011, the Remuneration Committee held four formal meetings. The attendance of each director at these meetings is shown in

Non-executive directors hold appointments for a term of three years, and their fees are determined by the Board following external
benchmarking. The reappointment of non-executive directors is addressed after giving due consideration to their qualifications,
continuing independence, performance and willingness to accept reappointment.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office
and during the Annual General Meeting each year.

Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The directors hold a series of meetings with institutional investors after the publication of the Company’s annual and interim financial
results each year. Meetings are also held during the year with both existing and prospective shareholders, to provide the opportunity to
understand the Company’s operations and strategy in greater detail.
The Chairman maintains a regular dialogue with major shareholders in relation to strategy and corporate governance issues, and non-
executive directors are also available to meet major shareholders as required. In particular, the Senior Independent Director, Jan Åstrand,
is available to meet major shareholders in the Company, to allow any concerns to be raised independently from the Board. In addition,
the non-executive directors are available for questions from individual shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting each year.
The Board retains a Stockbroker to ensure a regular flow of relevant information is made available to both current and prospective
shareholders and to facilitate feedback to assist the Board in understanding the issues and concerns of its shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting and shareholder communications
The majority of the Company’s share capital continues to be held by institutional investors.

Whilst the Company does not include a formal presentation at the Annual General Meeting for smaller private shareholders, the Company
maintains a website: www.lavendongroup.com, which publishes financial results, presentations, formal announcements, and a number of
corporate governance documents for review by current and potential shareholders. In addition, at the Company’s Annual General
Meeting, the full Board, including the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees, are available to answer
individual questions or concerns about the Company’s performance and strategy.
It is the Company’s policy to ensure that Annual General Meeting resolution proposals remain segregated when voting issues are substantially
separate issues. The directors announce the proxy vote on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting, after the show of hands for each
resolution. The overall voting for each resolution is publicly announced following the completion of the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of compliance with the Code under listing rule 9.8.6R
In accordance with the guidance of the UK Listing Authority, the Board has formally reviewed its internal control procedures as required
by the Code.
With the exception of the period where the Company’s Chairman and Senior Independent Director were undertaking interim executive
roles within the Company for four months during the year, the directors believe that the Company is complying with all current areas of
best practice as detailed in the Code. Members and qualifications of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Company’s two independent non-executive directors, Andrew Wood as Chairman and Jan Åstrand,
together with the Company’s Chairman, John Standen. The Committee’s Chairman, Andrew Wood, is a chartered management
accountant with over 15 years experience as Group Finance Director of FTSE 250 companies. The biographies of the members of the
Committee are set out on page 42. The Company believes that the Audit Committee has the necessary recent and relevant financial
experience, accounting knowledge and resources to fulfil its duties competently.
Terms of reference
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference which are reviewed annually and published on the Company’s website
(www.lavendongroup.com).
The Committee’s principal responsibilities are to:
• Monitor and review the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any announcements related to the Group’s performance.
• Review the Group’s accounting policies annually to ensure they remain relevant and comply with best practice.
• Monitor the Group’s key areas of risk, together with the application of policies, procedures and practices to manage these risks.
• Review the performance of the internal audit function, its scope of work and findings.
• Approve the appointment, scope of work and remuneration of the Group’s external auditors.
• Review and make recommendations to the Board on any issues raised by either internal or external auditors.
• Monitor the continuing independence of the external auditors and make appropriate policy recommendations to the Board.
• Determine and communicate policy to the Board relating to procurement of non-audit related assignments from the external auditors.
Performance of the Audit Committee
The Committee held four meetings during the year, with the Group’s external auditors attending on three occasions where the interim
and annual financial statements were reviewed, and an assessment of the scope, strategy and findings of the external audit discussed.
The Audit Committee confirmed with the external auditors that they had received all necessary information for completion of their
assignments. At each meeting, the external auditors were asked whether they wished to bring any matters to the attention of the
Committee without the Executive Directors being present.
During the year, the Committee oversaw the programme of internal audit on the Group’s operations, reviewing reports produced and
agreeing appropriate actions where required.
To enable employees to raise matters of impropriety or concern relating to financial or other issues, the Committee maintains an
independent reporting procedure through which employee concerns can be raised. This procedure provides feedback to all employees of
matters raised and actions taken.
During 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have formally confirmed their independence and willingness to continue as auditors to the
Group. The Audit Committee has a formal policy relating to the procurement of non-audit related work from the Group’s external auditors.
This policy is reviewed annually and permits the engagement of external auditors, without the prior approval of the Committee, for non-
audit services where the fees will not exceed 30% of the annual audit fee for the Group (50% in the case of taxation services), and where
the services relate to advice on the interpretation of accounting regulations, taxation and treasury services and other matters that have
relevance to the external audit function. Details of the auditors remuneration are given in note 7 on page 66. The policy specifically
prohibits engaging external auditors to make management decisions or provide management services, acting as an advocate in litigation,
investment banking services, internal audit services of a recurring nature, the design and implementation of financial and risk management
systems and executive search services. After reviewing the level of fees relating to the provision of non-audit services and the nature of
that work, the Committee believes that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP remain independent of the Group.

Report of the Audit Committee Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc
Lavendon Group plc 2011 49
We have audited the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the
Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the
Group statement of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities set out on page 41, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an
opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Group financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are prepared
is consistent with the Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the directors’ statement, set out on pages 16 and 17, in relation to going concern;
• the part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008
Combined Code and the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011
and on the information in the directors’ Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

1. Principal accounting policies
General information
Lavendon Group plc (‘the Company’ or with its subsidiaries ‘the Group’) is the European and Middle Eastern market leader in the rental of
powered access equipment operating a fleet of 20,000 machines through a network of 95 active depots located in Belgium, France,
Germany, the UK and a number of countries in the Middle East.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 15 Midland Court, Central Park, Lutterworth, Leicestershire LE17 4PN.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards
(“IFRS’s”) and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The
Group financial statements have been prepared, on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention as modified by financial
assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss. A summary of the more significant Group
accounting policies is set out below.
The Parent Company has not adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. Its results, reported under UK GAAP, are detailed on
pages 86 to 92.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the
amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. All intra-
group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured
as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition
date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition costs
are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities where a controlling interest is held by the Group or, in the case of the Middle East, where the
Group has the right to give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies and as a result is considered to have control of
the entities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Details of the principal subsidiaries of the Group are given in note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements on page 89.
Impact of new accounting standards
The new standards and interpretations applicable from the beginning of the year are as follows:
• IAS 24 (revised) ‘Related party disclosures’;
• amendment to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation on classification of rights issues’;
• amendment to IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption on financial instrument disclosures’;
• annual improvements 2010;
• amendment to IFRIC 14 ‘Pre-payments of a minimum funding requirement’; and
• IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’.
There is no significant impact from these new standards and interpretations on the consolidated financial statements for the period
ended 31 December 2011.

Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue from rental fleet hire is recognised on a daily basis over the period of hire when the Group can reliably measure the likely flow of economic
benefits. Other revenue, including the sale of ex-rental fleet equipment, is recognised as at the point at which the goods or services are provided.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,
has been identified as the Group Board that makes strategic decisions.
A discontinued operation is a component that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, and (a) represents a
separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; and (b) is a part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate
major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (c) is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Cashflows and operations that relate to a major component of the business or geographical region that has been sold or is classified as
held for sale are shown separately from continuing operations.
The continuing operating segments are the main geographic areas in which the Group operates. These are the United Kingdom, Belgium,
France, Germany and the Middle East.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentational currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are
subject to effective cash flow or net investment hedges which are recorded in equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items are
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where effective, are taken to equity. Tax charges and credits attributable
to those exchange differences are also taken directly to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are
recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a
foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Joint ventures
The Group’s interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Where material the Group
discloses its share of the revenue and the operating profits on the face of the income statement. The Group also discloses its share of
the gross assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. At 31 December 2011 the balances relating to joint ventures were not
disclosed separately in the financial statements because they were not material.
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and
loans, receivables and other liabilities. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired. Management
determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position at each reporting date.
Lavendon Group plc 2011 55 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial instruments held for trading and those assets designated
at fair value through profit or loss. A financial instrument is classified in this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling
or repurchasing in the short term or if it is a financial asset so designated by management on initial recognition. Derivative financial
instruments are included as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Items in this category are classified as current assets or
current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans, receivables and other liabilities
Loans, receivables and other liabilities are non-derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the
receivable. They are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date,
which are classified as non-current liabilities. Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are included in the income
statement in the period in which they arise. Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. Impairments of such financial assets are recorded in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for equipment rental or other products or services performed in the ordinary course of
business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement. The
cost of unrecoverable trade receivables is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement along with any associated issue costs of replacement facilities.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as:
• cash flow hedges – hedges of floating interest rate transactions; or
• net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at
hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Movements on the hedging reserves in equity are shown in
the Group statement of changes in equity.
56 Lavendon Group plc 2011 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss
(for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and
included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is
recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and
losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in
the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of
business on the balance sheet date. Financial assets held by the Group are valued on a mark to market basis by financial institutions.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The nominal value less
estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair value of financial
liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for
similar financial instruments.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on
the finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in financial liabilities –
borrowings. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under
finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.
Lavendon Group plc 2011 57 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and
• it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are recorded
separately in the financial statements where material.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where
discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Where the Group expects amounts to be received in relation to a provision, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when its
receipt is considered certain.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at delivered cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments in value.
Additional transportation costs incurred to move existing fleet between operating segments are expensed in the year in which they are
incurred. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and
equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows:
Useful lives Residual values
Short leasehold properties – amortised over the period of lease nil
Rental fleet – 7 to 13 years 5-20%
Office fixtures and equipment – 3 to 4 years nil
Motor vehicles – 3 to 5 years nil
Residual values are reassessed annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of
identifiable net assets of a subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where necessary
to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of
goodwill exceeds its fair value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where
necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable
and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria
are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
58 Lavendon Group plc 2011 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition are detailed in note 14. They are estimated to have asset lives in the range of 1 to 10 years
and are amortised on a straight-line basis accordingly.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will
generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Trademarks and patents
Trademarks and patents are carried at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of up to 5 years.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment,
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (operating segments). In assessing the value
in use, the estimated future cash flows of the operating segments are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and associated risks.
The directors consider that an operating segment is generally an individual country of operation.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in
the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Following the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in 2006, the Group now has an obligation to a single ex-employee of the
Gardemann group under a defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is unfunded, but a full provision of £152,374 (2010: £147,117), based
on an actuarial valuation, is included in the Group’s balance sheet under accruals. Given the immateriality of this single obligation to the Group
as a whole, management do not consider the full disclosure required by IAS19 “Retirement Benefits” to be appropriate in this instance.
The Group provides no other post-retirement benefits to its employees.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Inventories
Inventories, comprising ex-rental fleet equipment available for sale, third party equipment purchased for resale, machine spare parts and
consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost basis used within the Group is a ‘First In First Out’ or FIFO
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Taxation including deferred tax
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate.
Lavendon Group plc 2011 59 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
1. Principal accounting policies continued
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor
taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related
deferred taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
amounts can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not discounted.
Share based payment
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is
determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and in the case of share matching plans and the
long-term incentive plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by
reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions
are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date,
the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original
estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the Parent Company and the
Group. This does not have an impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group Balance
Sheet. For the purposes of the Group Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Key assumptions and estimates
Significant estimates have been used in respect of the calculation of the residual values of property, plant and equipment, the calculation of any
impairment to the carrying value of goodwill, the valuation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, and the trade receivables provision.
The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are estimated based on management’s historic experience of
disposals of such used equipment and their judgement of the current market conditions.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using estimating long-term growth rates and
appropriate discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of future prospects. Other intangible assets
are tested for impairment if there are indications they might be impaired. Full details of the assumptions used are given in note 14.
The fair value of intangibles recognised on acquisition is derived from a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation
with independent valuers.
The trade receivables provision is based on management’s best estimate of the recoverability of specific customer balances, after taking
into account the recent payment experience, underlying economic climate and discussions with key customers.
Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items to be those that, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the
financial statements in order to better understand the underlying performance of the Group. These include, but are not limited to, costs
of reorganisation and restructuring, impairment of non-current assets, significant one-off financing costs and significant one-off claims.
60 Lavendon Group plc 2011 2. Segmental analysis
The Group’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is the Group Board, comprising the two executive directors and direct reports
from the operating subsidiaries and business functional units in the Group. The Group Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in
order to monitor and assess performance of the operating segments for the purpose of making decisions about allocation of resources.
Performance is evaluated based on actual results compared to agreed targets and performance in prior periods.
The primary profit measure used by the CODM is the underlying operating profit.

(ii) The Group reached an agreement with certain tax authorities on the treatment of intra group financing arrangements from prior periods (2006 – 2009). This agreement
resulted in a reduction being required to the Group’s corporation tax and deferred tax creditors to reduce these provisions to reflect the actual liability agreed, and interest
payable becoming due on the agreed liability.
(iii) Relates to the movement in fair value of interest rate swaps that are not designated as cash flow hedges.

5. Acquisition of subsidiary companies
Blue Sky Access Limited (“Blue Sky”)
On 19 October 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Blue Sky Access Limited.
The consideration paid on completion was £3.1 million (net of cash acquired) in cash. Deferred consideration of £1.5 million is payable
in cash on the first anniversary and £1.0 million in cash on the second anniversary.
Additional consideration of up to £1.5 million could become payable over four years from the date of acquisition, subject to the
achievement of certain performance criteria.
Further amounts are contingent on the sale of the rights in certain territories, the financial impact of which cannot currently be quantified.
The effective date of the acquisition was 1 October 2011. Accordingly only three calendar months of trading have been recorded in
the current period results.
Details of the acquisition are provided below:

Adjustment to intangible assets to provisional fair value 8,598
Deferred tax on fair value adjustments and intangible assets (1,816)
The adjustment to intangibles assets is based on the Group’s estimate of the fair value of acquired intellectual property.
As the company’s trade is within the Group, the revenues generated are all intercompany. Therefore revenue generated for the Group is nil.

jurisdictions and involve complex structures. Given the auditors considerable experience and knowledge of the Group’s structure and
history, it is deemed expedient to use their tax services.

– adjustment in respect of prior years (557) (327)
– taxation movement on share based payments (34) (140)
Total deferred tax (4,729) (3,781)
Taxation (credit)/charge (1,034) 2,652
The taxation charge on the underlying profit is £5,353,000 (2010: £3,312,000). The taxation credit on amortisation charges, exceptional
items and fair value movements on financial derivatives is £6,387,000 (2010: £660,000), see note 3.
In addition to the amount credited to the income statement, tax of £15,000 (2010: credit of £172,000) in respect of share based
payments was charged directly to reserves. This represents the reduction (2010: recognition) of a deferred tax asset which is in excess
of the credit to the income statement for share based payments.
No provision has been made in the financial statements for any tax liability which may arise upon future distributions of profit to the
United Kingdom from overseas subsidiaries.

11. Taxation continued
Reconciliation of taxation
The tax (credit)/charge for the year is lower (2010: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 26% (2010: 28%).
The differences are explained below:
2011 2010
£’000 £’000
Profit before taxation 14,157 10,936
Profit at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: 26.49% (2010: 28%) 3,750 3,062

Tax losses not recognised 454 803
Timing differences on which deferred tax is not provided (3) 53
(1,034) 2,652
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011. Accordingly, the Company’s UK profits for
this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 26.49%. From 1 April 2012 the UK corporation tax rate will change to 25%
(legislation was enacted in Finance Act 2011). Further annual reductions of 1% are expected until 1 April 2014, until the corporation tax
rate reaches 23%. For every 1% reduction in the tax rate an estimated £0.6m reduction in tax will arise. The impact of reducing the
corporation tax rate on deferred tax balances will be accounted for in the period when any rate change is substantively enacted.

Diluted 9,951 164.0 6.07p (212) 164.0 (0.13p) 9,739 164.0 5.94p
Earnings per share are calculated on the 164,688,101 weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended
31 December 2011 (year ended 31 December 2010: 164,011,025).
Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares which arise from share incentive scheme awards
granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary share capital during the
year. The effect of this dilution is to increase the weighted average number of ordinary shares to 164,696,423 (year ended 31 December
2010: 164,011,436).
Underlying earnings per share is presented to exclude the impact of amortisation charges, exceptional items, movements in financial
derivatives and discontinued operations in the year and their associated tax effect. The directors believe that underlying earnings per
share provides additional relevant information about underlying business performance.

Intangibles recognised on acquisitions comprises brand names £nil (2010: £0.1m) and customer relationships £3.0m (2010: £4.5m).
Goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated, at date of acquisition, to the operating segments that benefited from that
business combination. The directors consider that an operating segment is generally an individual country of operation.
70 Lavendon Group plc 2011 14. Intangible assets continued
The allocation of the goodwill by operating segment is shown in the table below: Goodwill
2011 2010
Operating segments £’000 £’000
United Kingdom 40,941 40,941
Belgium 20,261 20,714
Germany 17,401 17,793
Total 78,603 79,448
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. For the purpose of
determining potential goodwill impairment, recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections
based on financial plans covering a five year period. The growth rate assumptions used in the plans are based on past performance and
management’s expectations of market developments. The growth rate assumptions used to determine the cash flows beyond the five year
period is 2.5% (2010: 2.5%). The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows for UK and Germany is 11% and for Belgium 12.5%
(2010: all were 11%). The goodwill exceptional impairment charges total £nil (year ended 31 December 2010: £nil).
The impairment review for Belgium has identified headroom of £10,257,000 (2010: £5,074,000) against the carrying value of the assets. If the
pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is increased by 2% to 14.5% then no additional impairment charge would be required
(2010: additional impairment charge of £nil) in Belgium. If the terminal growth rate is decreased by 1% to 1.5% then no further additional impairment
would be required for any of the remaining operating segments. The directors consider that no reasonably possible change in any of the key
assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of any of the operating segments at 31 December 2011 to fall below their carrying value.
The other intangibles exceptional impairment charge is £nil (year ended 31 December 2010: £nil).

At 31 December 2010
Interest rate swaps – 2,160
In accordance with IAS39 ‘Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement’, the Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded
derivatives that are required to be accounted for separately if they meet certain requirements set out in IAS39. No contracts requiring
separate accounting were identified that would have a material effect on the financial statements.

Derivative financial instruments
– interest rate swaps – 780 – – 2,160 –
The level 2 valuations are derived from Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets and Bank of Scotland Markets models, and are based on mid-
market levels as of the close of business on 31 December 2011.
Fair value gains of £1,380,000 (2010: gains of £518,000) relating to interest rate swaps have been recognised in equity or in the income
statement as appropriate. Interest rate swap cash flows are paid/received on a quarterly basis. Interest rate swaps are valued on a marked
to market (‘MTM’) basis by established financial institutions.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 were
£10,000,000 and €43,000,000.
At 31 December 2011 the EURIBOR fixed interest rates secured by the interest rate swap contracts ranged from 3.62% to 4.25%,
compared to the 1m EURIBOR floating interest rate at the year end of 0.964%. The fair value of the difference between fixed and floating
interest rates is deferred in equity where hedging is effective and will reverse in the income statement during the next 9 months.
At 31 December 2011 the LIBOR fixed interest rate secured by the interest rate swap contract was 4.09%, compared to the 1m LIBOR
floating interest rate at the year end of 0.770%. The fair value of the difference between fixed and floating interest rates is deferred in
equity where hedging is effective and will reverse in the income statement during the next 1 month.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities
The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which are designated as hedges of the net investment in its subsidiaries in Belgium, France
and Germany. The foreign exchange profit on translation into Sterling of £1,912,000 (2010: loss of £565,000) relating to these hedged
borrowings has been recognised in the net investment hedge reserve where hedging is effective. No ineffectiveness has been charged to
the income statement in the year (2010: £nil).

24. Financial risk management
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the overall cost of capital.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital risk management during the year.
Consistent with other companies in the rental industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of return on capital employed and the
ratio of net debt to equity.
2011 2010
£’000 £’000
Total borrowings (note 21) 122,596 153,646

Net debt 106,565 140,255
Total equity 185,160 180,144
Debt to equity ratio 58% 78%
The ratio of net debt to equity decreased during the year, principally as a result of the reduction in net debt through the application of
operational cash flows. During the period the Group has complied with its banking covenants, and expects to remain compliant for the
foreseeable future.
Lavendon Group plc 2011 77 Notes to the financial statements
Continued
24. Financial risk management continued
The Group has exposure to the following principal risks:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management policy aims to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial markets on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally by the Group except for customer credit risk which is the responsibility of each operational entity.
1. Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s income, or its financial instruments, will be affected by changes in market prices, for example
interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. The risk is managed by a
combination of interest rate swaps and fixed rate hire purchase and finance lease agreements. Interest rate risk is presented in the
Operating and financial review on page 18.
The Group also has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. This risk is minimised through the use of foreign currency
borrowings and net investment hedging. The effect on the Group’s 2011 results due to movements in foreign exchange rates is
presented in the Operating and financial review on page 12.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Such risk arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers, cash and bank balances, and interest rate swaps.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is shown in the table below:
2011 2010
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents (note 18) 16,031 13,391
Trade and other receivables (note 17) 47,927 47,372
63,958 60,763
Cash and cash equivalents
Surplus cash is held in current and deposit accounts with established financial institutions. All the financial institutions have at least a
Moody’s credit rating of Baa.
Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure to customers is the responsibility of each operation who have formal credit policies in place to
mitigate this risk. The credit policies require that the credit worthiness of a customer is assessed prior to trading and that the level of
exposure to that customer remains within agreed credit limits. To support these policies, the Group maintains certain levels of credit
insurance for its main operating subsidiaries.
The Group’s only exposure to concentrations of credit risk is to geographic and industry sector risk. As set out in the Operating and
financial review on page 12 the construction sector is an important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. This exposure is
actively managed with efforts being focused on widening the Group’s customer base to other sectors.
No individual customer makes up more than 3% of revenue (2010: 2%).

52,681 5,697 51,193 4,633
The Group defines impaired receivables to include those in legal hands or that are unrecoverable due to financial difficulties. Over 90% of
accounts receivable that are more than 6 months past due but not impaired are covered by credit insurance policies.
The carrying amount of the Group’s trade and other receivables excluding prepayments are denominated in the following currencies:
2011 2010
£’000 £’000
Sterling 21,364 20,337
Euros 14,368 16,063
Middle East currencies 12,195 10,972
47,927 47,372
3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a
balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective borrowing structure. The Group has committed bank facilities of
£65 million and €68.4 million which finally mature in September 2013. This is supplemented by hire purchase and finance lease facilities.
The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit lines available to supplement cash flows generated from trading to
meet known obligations in the next twelve months. An analysis of liquidity risk, being the maturity of financial liabilities and the
undrawn committed borrowing facilities is presented in note 23.
The Group’s financial liabilities are analysed in note 22.

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12)
during the year are shown in the table below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right
of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
During the year, a deferred tax asset has been recognised based on brought forward tax losses of £22,943,000 (2010: £23,456,000
losses), which in the opinion of the directors are more likely than not to be realised.
There are unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to trading losses in overseas operations. The losses which have not been recognised
amount to £27,451,000 (2010: £31,427,000). The tax values associated with these losses are £8,011,000 (2010: £9,419,000).

28. Share based payments
The Group operates five equity settled compensation plans:
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Company Share Option Plan (the “Employee Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group Share Matching Plan 2005 (the “Plan”);
• the Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”); and
• the Lavendon Group Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”).
The total charge for the year relating to the five equity settled compensation plans was £571,000 (2010: £511,000), all of which related
to equity settled share based payment transactions. After deferred tax credited/debited to the income statement, the total charge was
£537,000 (2010: £371,000).
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on 10 October 1996. The Company has made periodic grants of options under both
schemes, details of which are given in the Directors’ report on pages 35 to 40. Both the Employee Scheme and the Executive Scheme
closed in October 2006. Consequently no further awards have been made since that date.
The fair value of the share options is based on historic volatility of the share price over the last five years. The expected life is the average
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.

Long term incentive plan
The Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) was approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2006.
Under the LTIP, participants are granted awards in the form of a conditional allocation of ordinary shares in the Company or a nil cost
option. Awards will normally vest on or following the third anniversary of grant once the applicable performance conditions have been
satisfied. For awards issued prior to 31 December 2009, the vesting of 50% of each award will be based on the Company’s total
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the other half of the award will be based on the Company’s Earnings Per Share
(“EPS”) performance. For options issued on or after 31 December 2009, the award is based on the TSR performance relative to the return
on the FTSE Small Cap Index – excluding Investment Trusts. Following the capital raising on 8 December 2009 the EPS performance
measure was adjusted. The TSR performance measure was unadjusted.
Grants made in 2009
For grants made in 2009, the performance condition will require the Company’s EPS in 2011 to be at least equal to 33.10p for 7.5% of
the awards to vest and greater than or equal to 48.92p for 50% of the awards to vest. The awards will vest on a straight line basis
between these minimum and maximum thresholds. EPS will be measured by reference to the fully diluted EPS as disclosed in the audited
annual financial statements adjusted to exclude unusual or non-recurring items at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The vesting of the TSR-related half of the 2009 awards will require the Company’s TSR performance over a single three year period to be at least
£5.00 for 7.5% of the awards to vest, increasing on a straight line basis to 50% of the awards vesting if the share price is at least £7.50. The actual
share price performance of the Company will be adjusted to take into account the impact of dividends and any capital adjustments.
Grants made in 2010 and subsequently
For grants made in 2010 and thereafter, the performance condition is based on the Group’s TSR performance relative to the performance
of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts (the “Index”) over the vesting period. The vesting of the awards will require the
Company’s TSR performance over a single three year period to be at least equal to that of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest,
increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if the TSR exceeds the index by 60% or more. The actual share price
performance of the Company will be adjusted to take into account the impact of dividends and any capital adjustments.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards made in 2011 are detailed below:
TSR
Share price at grant date (pence) 94
No. of employees 24
Rights granted 1,034,000
Vesting period (years) 3

Share Incentive Plan (“The SIP”)
In November 2007 the Group introduced the Lavendon Group plc Share Incentive Plan.
222,922 SIP shares (2010: 335,275) were issued during the year of which 87,706 shares were SIP matching shares (2010: 133,068).
The fair values are calculated by applying the following models:
Share Incentive Plan – Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Nil pence per share
Expected share price volatility 58.3% – 67.4%
Expected share price volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised daily volatility of the share price over the preceding three years.
Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield
Risk-free interest 2.80% – 3.52%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.

34. Post balance sheet event
With effect from 29 February 2012, the Group has agreed terms to replace its existing bank facilities with new debt facilities of
£150 million, comprising a £100 million revolving bank facility expiring in July 2016 and a €60 million US private placement expiring in
July 2019. These new facilities provide the Group with a robust medium to long-term diversified financing package, with significant
liquidity, that will support the development of the Group in the coming years. The costs associated with the completion of this
refinancing, approximately £2.9 million or 2% of the new facilities, will be amortised over the term of the facilities.

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Lavendon Group plc
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise
the Parent Company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 41, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and
express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition,
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2011;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial statements are prepared is
consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the directors’ Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with
the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Notes to the Company’s financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2011
1. Principal accounting policies
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable Accounting Standards in the
United Kingdom (UK GAAP). The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques have been applied consistently and are set
out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Adoption of new accounting standards
No new Financial Reporting Standards (“FRS’s”) were adopted during the year.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange
differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are included at cost stated at the historical Sterling value at the time of investment other than where overseas investments
are hedged by foreign currency borrowings in which case the investment is included at cost, restated at the year end Sterling value at the
balance sheet date and any exchange movement is taken to reserves. Where appropriate, the carrying values of fixed asset investments
are measured by reference to their discounted future operational cash flows, or their imputed resale value, and provision is made for any
diminution in value where necessary.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans on behalf of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Fair value is
determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Share Incentive Plan, and in the case of
Share Matching Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the vesting
period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-
market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. At
each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of
the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the
remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares) are
accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the Parent Company and the Group.
The amounts in the Company are immaterial and are therefore not disclosed.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the
dividends are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs, which are amortised over the expected
period of the borrowing to the profit and loss account.
Interest costs are recorded in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate. 1. Principal accounting policies continued
Trade debtors
Trade debtors are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade
debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the
original terms of debtor. The amount of the provision is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The cost of unrecoverable trade debtors is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit can differ from net profit/loss as reported in the profit and
loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method.
2. Profit for the financial year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these
financial statements. The Parent Company’s loss after tax for the financial year was £7,085,000 (2010: loss of £4,338,000).
3. Employee information
The Company has no employees. Non-executive directors of the Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details
regarding their remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration report on pages 28 to 34.

to the respective number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment or sale (and holders of any other

with fractional entitlements, treasury shares, record dates or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under the laws
of or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever; and

Company may before such expiry make any offer or agreement that would or might require equity securities to be allotted, or
treasury shares to be sold, after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities, or sell treasury shares in pursuance of any
such offer or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired. All previous unexercised authorities under Sections 570

Notes
1. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that in order to have the right to
attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and also for the purpose of determining how many votes a person entitled to attend
and vote may cast), a person must be entered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m. on 17 April 2012 or, in the
event of any adjournment, at 6.00 p.m. on the date which is two days before the day of the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on
the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
2. A member is entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend, to speak and to vote at the
Annual General Meeting. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is
appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
A form of proxy for the meeting is enclosed. To appoint more than one proxy you may photocopy this form.
To be valid any proxy form or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by post or by hand (during normal business
hours only) by our registrar Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4TU. Votes must be received no later than
12.00 p.m. on 17 April 2012. If you are a CREST member, see note 3 below.
Completion of a form of proxy, or other instrument appointing a proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not preclude a member
attending and voting in person at the meeting if he/she wishes to do so.
3. Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST, you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST electronic proxy
appointment service. Further details are contained below:
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the
Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures, and to the address, described in the CREST Manual
(available via www.euroclear.com/CREST) subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. CREST personal members
or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to
their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST
Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) specifications
and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must,
in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA 10) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy
appointments specified in the notice of the Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time
(as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to
retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not make
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in
relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST
member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of
the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting
service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST
system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001. Notes continued
4. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may have a right, under an agreement between him/her and the member by whom he/she
was nominated, to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated
Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right, under such an agreement, to
give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the above rights of the members in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to Nominated Persons.
Those rights can only be exercised by members of the Company.
5. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
6. Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any
such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has already
been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good
order of the meeting that the question be answered.
7. Copies of executive directors’ service agreements and copies of the terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours from the date of this notice until the
close of the Annual General Meeting (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) and will be available for inspection at the
place of the meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.
8. A copy of this notice, and other information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, can be found at
www.lavendongroup.com.
9. Under Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have
the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General
Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at
which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to
raise at the Annual General Meeting. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its
expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under
Section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been
required under Section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10. As at 29 February 2012 (being the last practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) the Company’s issued share capital
consists of 164,912,484 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at that date
are 164,912,484.
11. You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of Section 333(4) of the Companies Act 2006) provided in this Notice
of Meeting (or in any related documents) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Resolutions 8 and 9: The auditors
Company law requires Lavendon Group plc, at each general meeting at which accounts are laid, to appoint auditors who will remain in
office until the next general meeting at which accounts are laid. Resolution 8, therefore, proposes to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as auditors of Lavendon Group plc and Resolution 9 authorises the directors to agree to the auditors’ remuneration. Explanatory notes to the Resolutions continued
Resolution 10: Remuneration report
The directors are seeking approval of the shareholders for the directors’ Remuneration report for the financial year ended on
31 December 2011. The resolution is an advisory vote, as permitted by law, and no entitlement to remuneration is made conditional
on the resolution being passed. The Remuneration report is set out in full on pages 28 to 34 to in the Annual Report of the Company
for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Resolution 11
Your directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares only if authorised to do so by
shareholders. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company is due to expire at this year’s Annual General
Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 11 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot shares and grant rights to
subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares (a) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £549,708 and (b) in connection with a rights
issue up to an aggregate nominal amount (reduced by allotments under part (a) of the resolution) of £1,099,417.
These amounts represent approximately 33.3 per cent. and approximately 66.7 per cent. respectively of the total issued ordinary share
capital of the Company as at 29 February 2012, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice. If given, these authorities
will expire at the Annual General Meeting in 2013 or on 31 May 2013, whichever is the earlier.
Your directors have no present intention of issuing shares pursuant to this authority.
As at the date of this notice the Company holds no treasury shares.
Resolution 12
Your directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities or sell treasury shares for cash and otherwise than to
existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting of the Company is due to expire at
this year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 12 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart from
offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of equity securities
and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £82,448 (being five per cent. of the Company’s issued ordinary
share capital at 29 February 2012, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice). If given, this power will expire on
31 May 2013 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2013, whichever is the earlier. Your directors will have due regard to
institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance consultation and explanation
before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5 per cent. of the Company’s issued share
capital in any rolling three year period.
Your directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Resolution 13
Resolution 13 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on 14 days’ notice.
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a
shorter notice period, which cannot be less than 14 clear days. Annual General Meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days’
notice. The flexibility offered by Resolution 13 will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider a shorter
notice appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next
annual general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. In order to be able to call a general meeting on less

Resolution 14
Resolution 14 is designed to deal with rules on political donations and expenditure contained in Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (the
“Act”) (sections 362 to 379). Under section 378 of the Act, a company may not make donations to a political party, or other political
organisation, or to an independent election candidate of more than £5,000 in total, or incur any political expenditure, without first
obtaining shareholder approval.
It is the Company’s policy not to make contributions to political parties. There is no intention to change that policy. What constitutes a
“political donation”, a “political party”, a “political organisation” or “political expenditure” under the Act is not clear, as the legislation is
capable of wide interpretation and may have the effect of covering a number of normal business or charitable activities that would not be
thought to be political donations in the usual sense. To avoid any possibility of inadvertently contravening the Act, the Board considers that
it would be prudent to follow the procedure specified in the Act to obtain shareholder approval for the Company and its subsidiaries to
make political donations to incur political expenditure in the forthcoming year until the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the
Company in 2013. This authority will not be used to make any political donations as that expression would normally be understood.
Resolution 15: Lavendon Group Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Remuneration Committee of the Company has recently conducted a review of the Company’s long-term incentive arrangements.
To strengthen the alignment between executive reward and corporate performance, the Company is seeking your approval for the
introduction of a new Deferred Share Bonus Plan (resolution 15). A summary of the principal terms of the Plan is set out in the Appendix
to this Notice. A copy of the draft rules of the Lavendon Group Deferred Share Bonus Plan will be available for inspection at the offices of
New Bridge Street, 10 Devonshire Square, London EC2M 4PL during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays and English public
holidays excepted) until the close of the Annual General Meeting and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes
prior to and during the Annual General Meeting. 102 Lavendon Group plc 2011
Appendix
Summary of the principal terms of the Lavendon Group Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the “Plan”)
Operation
The remuneration committee of the board of directors of the Company (the “Committee”) will supervise the operation of the Plan.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the Plan at the
discretion of the Committee.
Grant of awards
The Committee may grant awards to acquire ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) within the period of six weeks following the
Company’s announcement of its results for any period. The Committee may also grant awards within six weeks of shareholder approval
of the Plan or the date of determination of bonuses or at any other time when the Committee considers there are exceptional
circumstances which justify the granting of awards.
It is currently intended that awards under the Plan will be made to executive directors only (although the Committee may extend the
participant population in future years) and that the first awards will be made in 2013, subject to eligible executive directors receiving a
bonus in respect of the 2012 financial year.
The Committee may grant awards as conditional shares or as nil (or nominal) cost options. An award structured as an option will remain
exercisable up until the tenth anniversary of grant unless it lapses earlier. The Committee may also decide to satisfy share-based awards
in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
An award may not be granted more than 10 years after shareholder approval of the Plan.
No payment is required for the grant of an award. Awards are not transferable, except on death. Awards are not pensionable.
Individual limit
An employee may not receive awards in any financial year over Shares with a market value exceeding 150 per cent of his salary.
Compulsory deferral and voluntary investment
The Committee may grant Deferred Awards and/or Matching Awards under the Plan, as described below.
Compulsory deferral
In order to participate in the compulsory deferral part of the Plan, an employee must receive a discretionary bonus relating to all or part
of the immediately preceding financial year (“bonus”) in excess of a threshold amount set by the Committee. If the bonus received
exceeds this threshold amount, a percentage of the total gross bonus will be deferred into shares (“Deferred Award”).
It is the Committee’s current intention that if the employee receives a gross bonus of £30,000 or more in respect of the 2012 financial
year, then he will be granted a Deferred Award over shares in respect of 30% of his total gross bonus.
Deferred Awards will normally vest one year after grant provided the participant is still employed in the Company’s group.
The vesting of Deferred Awards may also be subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition set by the Committee. It is current
intention that initial Deferred Awards will be subject to a performance condition which requires the Company’s earnings before interest,
taxation and amortisation (“EBITA”) and return on capital employed (“ROCE”) in the financial year of deferral to be equal to or greater
than the EBITA and ROCE figures published in the Company’s audited accounts for the financial year to which the bonus relates. If the
performance condition is not satisfied, then unless determined otherwise by the Committee in exceptional circumstances, the Deferred
Award will lapse in full.

Appendix continued
Voluntary investment and match
The Committee may, at its discretion, invite eligible employees to voluntarily invest up to 70% of their net bonus in the acquisition of
Shares (“Investment Shares”). Following the purchase of Investment Shares, the Company will grant an award over Shares with a value
equal to or no higher than the pre-tax value of the bonus invested in Shares (“Matching Award”). The Investment Shares will either be
held by a nominee or the participant will allow their shareholding to be monitored by the Company. Investment Shares will remain the
property of the participant and will not be subject to forfeiture under the Plan.
The vesting of Matching Awards will be subject to performance conditions set by the Committee. It is the current intention that the
performance conditions will be based on earnings per share and ROCE.
The Committee can set different performance conditions for future awards provided that, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee,
the new targets are not materially less challenging in the circumstances than the 2013 performance conditions.
The Committee may vary the performance conditions applying to existing awards if an event has occurred which causes the Committee
to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the Committee considers the varied conditions
are fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original conditions would have been but for the event in question.
Matching Awards will normally vest three years after grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied, the
Investment Shares have been retained by the participant and provided he is still employed in the Company’s group.
On the vesting of a Matching Award, the participant will be able to sell or otherwise transfer his related Investment Shares, subject to any
shareholding requirement which may apply to him.
Clawback
The Committee may decide that a participant’s award will be subject to clawback where there has been a misstatement of the
Company’s financial results or accounts, an error in assessing the bonus to which an award relates or if the participant’s employment is
terminated for gross misconduct. The Committee may require the satisfaction of the clawback by way of a reduction in the vesting, or
size of, any other award and/or a requirement to make a cash payment.
Dividend equivalents
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, participants will receive a payment (in cash and/or Shares) on or shortly following the vesting
of their awards, of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on those Shares between the time when the awards
were granted and the time when they vest. The amount payable may assume the reinvestment of dividends. Alternatively, participants may
have their awards increased as if dividends were paid on the Shares subject to their award and then reinvested in further Shares.
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon a participant ceasing to hold employment or be a director within the Company’s group.
However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or a director because of his death, ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement,
his employing company or the business for which he works being sold out of the Company’s group or in other circumstances at the
discretion of the Committee, then:
• his Deferred Award will vest in full when he leaves, subject to the satisfaction of any applicable performance condition; and
• his Matching Award will vest on the date when it would have vested if he had not ceased such employment or office. The extent to
which a Matching Award will vest in these situations depends upon two factors: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions
have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the Matching Award to reflect the reduced period of time between its grant
and vesting, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate a Matching Award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the
particular circumstances. If a participant ceases to be an employee or director in the Company’s group for one of the “good leaver”
reasons specified above, the Committee can decide that his award will vest when he leaves, subject to the extent to which the
performance conditions have been satisfied by reference to the date of cessation and time pro-rating as described above.
An award structured as an option will remain capable of exercise for a period of 12 months from the date of vesting. Appendix continued
Change of control
In the event of a takeover or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation), all Deferred Awards will vest
early unless the Committee determines otherwise. All Matching Awards will vest early subject to: (i) the extent that the performance
conditions have been satisfied at that time; and (ii) the pro-rating of the Matching Awards to reflect the reduced period of time between
their grant and vesting, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate a Matching Award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in
the particular circumstances.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company
unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the basis that would apply in the case of a takeover as described above.
If a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed, which, in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the market price
of Shares to a material extent, then the Committee may decide that awards will vest on the basis that would apply in the case of a
takeover as described above.
Participants’ rights
Awards will not confer any shareholder rights until the awards have vested and the participants have received their Shares.
Rights attaching to Shares
Any Shares allotted when an award vests under the Plan will rank equally with Shares then in issue (except for rights arising by reference
to a record date prior to their allotment).
Variation of capital
In the event of any variation in the Company’s share capital, a demerger, special dividend or other similar event which affects the market
price of the Shares to a material extent, the Committee may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate to the number of Shares
held under an award and/or the exercise price payable (if any).
Overall Plan limits
The Plan may operate over new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than:
• 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the Plan and any other employee share plan adopted by the
Company; and
• 5 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the Plan and any other executive share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purpose of this limit unless the institutional investors decide that they need not count.
Alterations to the Plan
The Committee may, at any time, amend the provisions of the Plan in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders is
obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on participation,
the overall limits on the issue of Shares or the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the
terms of, the Shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit the
administration of the Plan, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or
regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company’s group.
Overseas plans
The shareholder resolution to approve the Plan will allow the Board, without further shareholder approval, to establish further plans for
overseas territories, any such plan to be similar to the Plan, but modified to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws,
provided that any Shares made available under such further plans are treated as counting against the limits on individual and overall
participation in the Plan.

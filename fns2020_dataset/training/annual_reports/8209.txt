OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
2009 has marked another year 
of record growth, with a strong 
performance in both revenues and 
profits. Particularly pleasing was the 
excellent cash generation, which puts 
the Company on a very solid footing 
for the future, as well as enabling us to 
invest in our internal infrastructure and 
systems to support further growth.
The performance in 2009 is the culmination 
of your Board’s commitment to build a 
business with excellent people, first class 
leadership and financial performance in the 
upper quartile of our industry. Solid execution 
globally has led to this performance. On a 
geographic basis, we are pleased to see that 
our Asia Pacific operations have delivered 
14% constant currency growth year on year; 
the Europe, Middle East and Africa region 
has progressed well despite challenging 
economic conditions and trading in the 
Americas was, as anticipated, flat year on year.
Not only have we strengthened the leadership 
team but also we have deployed and 
continue to deploy, across the business, 
improved processes and systems all of which 
have and continue to lead to operational 
improvement, greater customer focus 
and an increased ability to measure the 
performance improvement of all that we 
do; Intec is committed to continuing this 
drive for performance improvement since 
we believe that it serves both customer and 
shareholder value creation and will serve us 
well no matter the external environment.
I am pleased to note that overall licensing 
volumes held up in the current climate and our 
Professional Services business showed strong 
growth following operational improvements 
by the new management team. Indeed, gross 
margins were buoyed by a strong contribution 
from Professional Services, which we believe 
is now approaching a competitive margin 
level, and in general supported by improved 
operational gearing. Over the coming 
year, we intend to continue to invest in the 
business to provide solid foundation for future 
growth. Our pipeline of new opportunities 
has been significantly strengthened and our 
visibility continues to improve; contracted 
revenue for the year ahead has also grown in 
comparison with the level 12 months ago. 
René Kern retired from the Board in April and 
I would like to thank him for his outstanding 
contribution over the past four years. I 
welcome Franchon Smithson in his place. 
The Company continues to invest for 
organic growth as well as considering 
earnings accretive acquisitions and the 
strength of the business and its balance 
sheet has led the Board to propose a 
dividend for the first time in our history, 
with a full-year payment of 1p per share. 
As these results attest, the last year has seen 
Intec transform itself as a business and I would 
especially like to thank all of our employees 
for their hard work and commitment 
during this period and our customers and 
partners for their confidence and support.

c hie F executive OFF icer ’s 
statement Intec has reported an excellent 
performance in 2009, delivering growth 
in revenues, profitability and cash. We 
have strengthened management across 
our organisation and have sharpened 
execution with a focus on sales, delivery 
and operational optimisation. We have 
improved our targeting of opportunities 
and our ability to both win and deliver 
new customer contracts. Cross-selling and 
up-selling to existing customers has been 
an important feature of this performance. 
Our broad spread of addressable markets 
has protected us somewhat from current 
global economic conditions and we have 
been successful in increasing our pipeline 
and contracted backlog following our 
increased focus on sales execution. Mature 
market operators have continued to upgrade 
and renew their legacy systems to improve 
efficiency and gain competitive advantage 
and in emerging markets, growth has 
come from deregulation and an increase 
in wireless subscribers. Although we are 
pleased with our results, we believe there 
is still opportunity to further enhance our 
financial performance. While continuing 
to monitor closely the economic pulse 
of our customers, we will make targeted 
investments to further improve our business. 
An important event for our employees, 
customers, partners and other stakeholders 
has been the relaunch of Intec both 
internally and externally through our ‘One 
Intec’ vision. This vision for the future is 
underpinned by the launch of clearly defined 
corporate values, refreshed imagery and 
a new corporate profile for the Group. 
FINANCIAL RESuLTS
I am especially pleased not only by our 
growth in revenue, profit and cash 
but also in our ability to build a strong 
backlog of business during a period of 
challenging economic conditions. 
During the year, we restructured, consolidated 
and strengthened our teams in both the 
Americas and APAC regions, and delivered 
2% and 14% growth at constant currency 
respectively. The comparison with the 
exceptional performance in 2008 masks the 
growth in the Americas, where business in 
the last quarter of 2009 for North America 
was particularly strong with several new 
strategic customer wins. APAC benefited from 
increased management focus as a primary 
growth area and in Europe, Middle East and 
Africa (EMEA) we won business across the 
region enabling very good growth of 7%. 
Sales and delivery execution has been 
excellent and our investment in new systems 
has substantially improved our pipeline and 
forecast management, leading to a higher 
degree of forecast accuracy and predictability 
and a better level of sales performance 
across our business. The year has been 
characterised by high sales conversion levels 
and an increase in our 30 September 2009 
contracted revenue backlog by over 20% 
when compared to the same time last year. 
Our global pipeline cover is significantly 
higher than it was at the start of 2009. 
CuSTOMER WINS AND 
PRODuCT DEVELOPMENT 
Intec’s strong sales results in 2009 arise 
from a healthy mix of new customer wins 
and repeat business from our existing 
customer base leading to an increase in 
market share against our major competitors. 
A recent report from Analysys Mason
1
, the 
telecoms industry analysts, now places Intec 
as the number three software provider, by 
revenue, of Billing Systems in the world.
Overall, Intec signed 24 new licence contracts 
in 2009 of which 15 were with new name 
customers and nine with our existing 
customer base. Nine of the 24 contracts 
are for multi-product sales, resulting in 
38 new product installations in total.
In addition, strong business growth 
among our existing licensed customers 
meant that 38 of them exceeded their 
licensed volume thresholds during the year 
triggering volume-based licence upgrades.
In our managed services business, we signed 
a number of small renewals and three major 
outsourcing contracts: a five-year deal with a 
new customer and two multi-year renewals. 
Customer wins came across all product 
categories and a broad geographical 
constituency spanning mature and 
emerging markets, with customers 
ranging from new ‘greenfield’ 
operators to long-established PTTs.
Of particular note was our success in  
winning eight new contracts for our  
Singl.eView retail billing solution, including 
two strategically important new customers 
outside of our traditional telecommunications 
service provider market: a global handset 
manufacturer and a global electronics 
retailer. In each case, Singl.eView will provide 
solutions for the commercialisation of 
content and online services, demonstrating 
the flexibility of the Singl.eView solution 
in addressing the business needs of the 
burgeoning Content and New Media markets.

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
We have extended our market leadership 
in the settlement market with 19 new 
installations of our Wholesale Business 
Management Solution (WBMS). As with  
Singl.eView, these solutions are fully adapted 
for the next-generation content market and 
we were particularly pleased to win the 
contract to provide a multi-party content 
settlement solution for a Tier 1 ‘app store’.
We continue to win significant new 
business in our core service provider 
market where we have demonstrated the 
capability of Intec’s product portfolio by 
delivering contracts to a range of companies 
providing mobile, fixed-line, broadband 
and cable services. In this market, we are 
seeing an increasing requirement for real-
time solutions across mediation, rating, 
charging and settlement. Multiple wins in 
2009 for our Singl.eView on-line charging 
solution and our active mediation solution, 
IntersessioN, indicate that Intec is well-
positioned to meet these requirements.
We have continued to improve the 
competitiveness of our core portfolio and 
over the last year Intec has brought to 
market a number of new releases, offering 
enhanced functionality across all three 
product families. As well as the move to 
real-time, other common themes include 
features to increase scalability, reduce cost 
of ownership and provide more flexible 
reporting. Particularly significant is our ability 
to support low-cost commodity hardware, 
which will significantly reduce up-front and 
ongoing costs for our customer base and 
open up new potential markets for Intec.
STRATEGY 
Intec’s vision is to become the most 
trusted supplier of BSS products 
and solutions in the world. 
Earlier this year, we conducted an in-depth 
market and company assessment, resulting 
in the creation of a clear strategy, vision 
and set of business priorities for the future. 
This exercise included an evaluation of 
the relevancy of Intec to our customers 
and an examination of ways to improve 
our overall competitiveness and create the 
ability to drive growth and profitability. 
We will continue to invest prudently 
in our leading software products and 
solutions and will focus that investment 
in high value and high growth markets.
The BSS market offers significant growth 
potential and, despite the current economic 
conditions, continues to attract investment 
from telecoms service providers as they seek 
to adapt their business practices in search of 
new revenue streams and improved margins. 
In developed markets, investment is focused 
on support for next generation value-added 
services (also known as ‘Content Services’), 
whilst in emerging economies investment 
is driven by continued rapid subscriber 
growth, particularly in wireless. Intec’s 
recent product investments have anticipated 
many of these key market trends, ensuring 
that Intec’s portfolio remains as relevant as 
ever to the needs of our customer base.
In 2010, we will increase our investment 
in products and skills to ensure that our 
products remain world-class and deliver 
competitive advantage to our customers. 
These investments will occur across our 
portfolio and include innovative solutions for 
emerging business models in the settlement 
market, support for new technologies that 
take Singl.eView to new price-performance 
levels and investments in our mediation suite 
that will enhance our real-time capabilities.
In support of these product investments,  
we shall also focus on a number of  
complementary strategic initiatives across  
the business:
Customer Centricity: •	 Intec takes 
pride in the depth and quality of its 
customer relationships. Our broad and 
varied customer base is crucial to our 
future growth. By remaining close to 
our customers, we can learn at first-
hand the issues they are facing in 
their markets and make sure that our 
solutions continue to meet their needs. 
 In early 2010, we shall be conducting a 
comprehensive customer survey which will 
be used to drive continued improvements 
in our service levels and strengthen 
further our customer engagements.
Partnering: •	 We will establish strategic 
alliances and partnerships in order to 
increase our market reach and growth 
prospects, while augmenting our delivery 
and solutions capability and breadth.
 In 2009, we created a dedicated partner 
team and business plan that will ensure 
that partnerships are at the centre of 
our strategy moving forward. In line 
with this plan, we have recently signed 
two major new partnership agreements. 
A number of our new business wins 
were closed in collaboration with 
partners and we anticipate that this 
will be an important feature of our 
business development going forward. 
Intec’s vision is to become 
the most trusted supplier of 
Business Support Software 
(BSS) products and solutions 
in the world.  INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

statement CONTINUED
People: •	 We will strive to attract and retain 
the very best staff as we increase our 
shift to a performance-driven culture.
 During 2009, we worked with our 
employee base to develop a shared set of 
corporate values. These values, which are 
tightly aligned with our overall strategic 
goals, are now firmly embedded across all 
of our activities and play an important role 
in our internal performance management 
programme. A recent employee survey 
shows a very high level of employee 
engagement and has provided excellent 
feedback which we will use to drive further 
improvements across the business. 
Business Optimisation: •	 We will take  
steps to improve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of our operations, 
while continuing to simplify our 
business, making it easier to 
understand and do business with. 
 We have continued to invest in our 
Professional Services centre in India 
(Bangalore) and have increased staffing 
at our Professional Services centres 
in Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur) and Brazil 
(São Paulo). This emphasis will continue 
throughout 2010 as we develop further 
our off and near-shore capabilities, while 
also enhancing our customer-facing 
capabilities across all regions. We have 
strengthened our management team with 
senior hires to run our Customer Services, 
Managed Services and Global IT activities 
and identified a number of key initiatives 
that will enable us to further optimise our 
future performance. We will continue to 
develop our service delivery and product-
support capabilities, ensuring that we 
strengthen our reputation for delivering 
high quality software products on time and 
to excellent levels of customer satisfaction. 
SuMMARY AND OuTLOOK
Following on from a very strong performance 
in 2008, Intec has delivered an excellent 
performance in 2009. We have made 
substantial progress in executing against 
each of our strategic priorities and have 
focused on excellence by continuing to 
build and develop a world class team. 
We strengthened our regional business 
leadership, which, coupled with the 
implementation of global sales management, 
has enabled us to strengthen the quality 
of our new business pipeline. Our sales 
performance has been very strong with high 
win rates, which has enabled us to build a 
strong contracted revenue back-log for 2010.
We have continued to focus on efficiency 
by managing our costs more effectively and 
improving our delivery execution, ensuring 
that contracts are delivered on time and to 
a high level of customer satisfaction. We 
have continued to expand our geographical 
footprint in emerging growth markets. 
Looking forward, Intec enters the 2010 
financial year as a stronger and more 
mature business with an increased level 
of focus on executing our strategy and 
building a truly world class software 
company. We will continue to concentrate 
on delivering excellence across our business 
and through targeted investments in 
2010 we will continue to optimise our 
operations, strengthen our global delivery 
model, improve our competitiveness and 
enhance the environment to deliver long 
term sustainable revenue growth. This 
continued focus on enhancing our financial 
performance further will be balanced by our 
efforts to create a great place to work and a 
great company to work with and to deliver 
against our ‘One Intec’ vision and values. 
We enter 2010 with a strong pipe-line 
of prospects and contracted revenue 
20% higher than we entered 2009.
Notwithstanding the challenging 
economic and market conditions, we 
believe that with Intec’s established and 
growing customer base, robust financial 
position and market relevance we are 
well placed to deliver against our strategic 
objectives during 2010 and beyond.

In delivering these results, we have 
increased investment in sales and 
marketing, strengthened the team and 
made operational improvements to 
the business. We continue to improve 
profit margins and adjusted EBITDA 
(defined in Table 2) has increased to 
18.6% of revenue (2008: 14.2%).
Foreign exchange
The Group operates across multiple 
geographies and therefore has 
substantial transactions in currencies 
other than UK pounds sterling (GBP). 
Approximately 80% of the Group’s revenues 
and 40% of costs are in euro or US dollar 
denominated. Over 10% of costs are incurred 
in Australian dollars and between 5% and 
10% are incurred in each of Canadian dollars, 
Indian rupees and South African rand.
In view of the very high proportion of the 
Group’s revenues and costs denominated in 
currencies other than GBP, it is not considered 
practical to attempt to hedge translation 
exposure. Steps taken to mitigate identified 
transaction exposures include matching the 
currency of current assets and liabilities and 
the use of forward contracts and swaps. 
During 2009, revenue benefited from 
translation gains of £22.9m when compared 
to 2008. The estimated translation benefit 
in profit for the year attributable to equity 
shareholders amounted to £7.0m which 
equates to a benefit of 2.3p in adjusted EPS.
Where applicable, subsequent commentary 
in this report is with reference to the 
2008 constant currency comparatives 
(designated 2008 CC) which have been 
calculated by translating the 2008 
results at 2009 exchange rates.
Income statement
Table 2 is a presentation of the income 
statement incorporating non-statutory 
measures that the Board considers to be 
appropriate key performance indicators 
together with a constant currency 
restatement of the 2008 results. 
Revenue by region
Revenue for the Group (defined in Table 3) 
increased to £167.9m (2008 CC: £158.7m) 
with growth in all three regions.
Americas continues to grow and the 16.5% 
constant currency growth in 2008 was 
followed by a further 2.0% growth to £73.3m 
revenue in 2009. The majority of the Group’s 
non-Telco revenue in the year has been in 
this region which also accounts for most of 
the Group’s Managed Services revenue.
Revenue from the EMEA region grew by 6.8% 
with particularly strong growth in the Middle 
East and Africa where consumer demand for 
mobile and broadband connections continued 
to expand rapidly. Licence revenue, from 
both new clients and increases in existing 
clients’ subscriber volumes, accounted for 
just under one third of this region’s revenue.
A strong second half resulted in APAC 
recording a 13.5% increase in revenue to 
£30.2m. Growth has been driven by new 
business in India which accounted for 
three of the region’s five largest deals. 
Revenue by type
There was strong growth in Professional 
Services revenue due to a higher number 
of transactions involving the sale of 
integrated solutions. Professional services 
accounted for 45.6% of the Group’s 
revenue (2008 CC: 39.3%) (see Table 4). 
Good growth in Licence revenue in EMEA and 
APAC was not quite sufficient to compensate 
for a decline in the Americas which had 
benefited from a very large non-Telco licence 
deal in 2008. As a result, the proportion of the 
Group’s 2009 revenue derived from Licence 
sales reduced to 19.1% (2008 CC: 21.9%).

Hardware revenue is considered incidental 
and the decline was expected as a major 
integrated project, secured in 2008, 
progressed to the next phase.
 
Gross profit
Gross profit, as set out in Table 2, increased 
by 10.6% to £91.0m reflecting the increase in 
revenue and improvement in gross margin rate 
to 54.2% (2008 CC: 51.9%). Estimated margin 
dilution of 2.2 points, arising from the change 
in revenue mix by category, was more than 
compensated for by efficiency improvements. 
These improvements have arisen primarily in 
our Professional Services business where: 
utilisation (i.e. the proportion of  •	
time chargeable to customer projects)  
has been significantly higher than in the  
prior year; and 
there has been an increase in the •	
proportion of work carried out in  
lower cost locations, under our Global  
Delivery Model.

Operating expenses
We remain focused on optimising our cost 
base and, although we have achieved further 
efficiencies in a number of areas, we made 
investments in sales and marketing which 
resulted in our net operating expenses, 
before depreciation, amortisation, foreign 
exchange differences and exceptional 
items increasing by 5.5% to £59.4m. 
The commentary, which follows, discusses 
changes in net operating expenses before 
incentive plan (IP), share-based payments 
(SBP), exceptional items and depreciation 
and amortisation (see Table 5).
Development costs were consistent 
with the prior year, although investment 
increased in the second half and is 
planned to increase further in 2010. 
Distribution costs increased to 13.5% 
of revenue (2008 CC: 12.9%) reflecting 
the creation of our partner programme 
and the full-year impact of the 
investment in new systems and people 
which was commenced in 2008.  INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
Administrative expenses showed a net 
decrease of £0.3m as the benefit of cost 
reduction initiatives was partially offset by 
an increase in vacant property provision 
and related costs of £0.5m and non-
recurrence of the 2008 net reduction in 
provision for doubtful debts of £1.2m.
Incentive plan costs increased to £6.0m 
(2008 CC: £4.3m), reflecting the record 
results, and share based payments rose to 
£2.0m (2008 CC: £1.5m) due to additional 
participants and a higher cost in the context 
of the recent share price performance. 
£4.6m (2008 CC: £3.4m) of these costs are 
included in Operating expenses (see Table 
5) with the balance of £3.4m (2008 CC: 
£2.4m) recorded under Cost of sales. 
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation, excluding 
amortisation on acquired intangibles 
and amortisation included in cost of 
sales, as set out in Table 2, reduced to 
£4.7m (2008 CC: £5.9m) reflecting the 
lower levels of capital expenditure on 
computer equipment and software in 
recent years, following the significant 
investment in Group systems in 2005. 
Capital expenditure has increased to 
£3.8m in 2009 (2008: £2.3m) and is 
planned to increase further in 2010.

Exceptional items
During the first half-year we incurred 
exceptional costs of £2.2m in a cost-
reduction exercise. This was partly offset 
by gains totalling £0.6m which relate to 
deferred consideration received on the 
business sold to Volubill SA in 2008 and the 
recovery of previously written off balances 
relating to a former associate company. 
To aid comparability within the 2008 results 
presented in this report, we have reclassified 
the one-time costs of £1.1m for the closure 
of the Mechanicsburg facility, which were 
previously included in cost of sales, to 
exceptional items (see note 3 to the accounts). 
Taxation
The overall tax credit for the year is £13.7m 
(2008: charge £3.3m). This represents a 
current tax charge of £4.8m (2008: £1.9m) 
and a deferred tax credit of £18.5m (2008: 
charge £1.4m). £16.7m (2008: £nil) of the total 
tax credit has been included in exceptional 
items. The pre-exceptional tax charge is thus 
£3.0m or 11.5% of pre-exceptional profit 
before tax (2008: £3.3m and 26.6%). INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009

c hie F Financial 
OFFicer’s rep Ort CONTINUED
The current tax charge comprises £2.2m 
(2008: £1.0m) of taxes on local profits 
in a number of group companies across 
the world and £2.6m (2008: £0.8m) of 
withholding taxes for which full credit relief 
is not available. There were no significant 
prior year charges (2008: £0.1m).
The deferred tax credit includes first time 
recognition of tax losses in the UK, Ireland 
and the USA and also the future benefit 
of annual goodwill allowances available to 
the US operations reflecting the continuing 
forecast profitability of the group entities 
in those countries. These amounts have 
been included in exceptional items and 
total £16.7m (2008: £nil). The remaining 
deferred tax credit of £1.8m (2008: charge 
£1.4m) relates to other temporary differences 
and, for the first time, share options.
Intec has operations in numerous countries 
and with a worldwide customer base, there 
is a natural level of complexity in our tax 
affairs meaning that future levels of tax 
will be dependent on a number of factors. 
Following the recognition of the deferred 
tax assets in respect of tax losses, other than 
those in the US, the benefit to the tax charge 
in the accounts will be less in future years.
 
EPS
Basic earnings per share increased to 
12.5p (2008: 3.4p) and is materially 
impacted by the deferred tax credit as 
discussed in the taxation section above.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which the 
Directors consider provides a useful measure 
of underlying trading, increased by 114.2% 
to 7.5p (2008:3.5p and 2008 CC: 5.7p).
The weighted average number of shares 
used to calculate basic earnings per share 
is 306.1m (2008: 305.6m) and for the fully 
diluted equivalent 320.5m (2008:314.1m). 
The significant increase in the latter has 
arisen due to this year’s rise in the share 
price increasing the number of dilutive 
share options included in the calculation.
GROuP FINANCIAL POSITION
Balance sheet review
The Group’s balance sheet has strengthened 
considerably during the year and net assets 
have increased to £204.7m. Table 6 is 
a presentation of net assets, with 2008 
balances restated to 2009 exchange rates, 
to aid discussion of material changes.
Other intangible assets 
Amortisation in the year exceeded additions 
leading to a decrease of 29.6% in the 
carrying value of other intangible assets, 
principally purchased software, capitalised 
development and project costs, to £5.7m. 
Deferred tax asset 
The Group’s improved trading performance 
has resulted in the recognition of a number 
of assets including tax losses in the UK 
and Ireland and the future benefit of 
annual goodwill allowances available in 
the USA (as further described under the 
Taxation heading above). This has lead to 
a near tenfold increase in the deferred tax 
asset on the balance sheet to £21.8m. 
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash generation has been very strong and 
we have ended the year with record cash 
balances of £74.8m (2008 CC: £32.5m), 
an increase of £42.3m. Key components 
of the increase were adjusted EBITDA of 
£31.2m and a net reduction in working 
capital of £14.4m, part of which is expected 
to reverse in the first quarter of 2010 as a 
number of annual payments are made. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables decreased 
to £63.9m (2008 CC: £75.4m), 
an improvement of £11.5m.

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
Trade debtors, where the average credit period 
based on invoice date has reduced from 64 
days to 57 days, decreased by £11.4m and 
various other receivables decreased by £1.7m. 
These were partially offset by an increase 
of £1.6m in accrued income to £19.0m, 
reflecting the usual effect of billing 
on projects accounted for under the 
percentage of completion method, and 
contractual negotiations concluded in 
September but invoiced during October. 
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables increased to £53.0m 
(2008 CC: £47.0m), an increase of £6.0m. 
 
Accruals accounted for £3.6m of the 
increase and deferred revenue, representing 
amounts invoiced to customers but not 
yet recognised as revenue, increased 
by £1.6m to a total of £25.8m. 
Other liabilities
This is an amalgamation of borrowings, 
provisions and other liability headings, each 
of which has moved by £0.5m or less.
Shareholders’ equity
There have been material changes in 
the components of shareholders’ equity 
during 2009 as summarised in Table 7.
Share premium account 
and other reserves
On 29 April 2009, the High Court of 
Justice consented to the cancellation of 
the Company’s share premium account 
of £162.0m approved by shareholders at 
a general meeting on 14 April 2009. The 
resulting capital reconstruction led to an 
increase of £135.2m in other reserves and the 
elimination of the deficit in retained earnings. 
Shares issued since April 2009 in satisfaction 
of option exercises has resulted in an increase 
of £0.1m in the share premium account.
Translation reserve
The functional currencies of many 
Group companies have strengthened 
since 30 September 2008 resulting in 
a gain in the year of £10.1m on the 
translation of non-UK net assets.
Retained earnings
The profit for the year accounts for £38.4m of 
the £68.3m increase in the Group’s retained 
earnings. A further £26.9m arose on the 
April 2009 cancellation of the share premium 
account, as described above, with a further 
£3.1m arising on the recognition of share-
based payments and related deferred tax.
Dividend
The capital reconstruction in April 2009 
extinguished the deficit in the distributable 
reserves of Intec Telecom Systems PLC which 
had arisen from the previous impairment in 
the carrying value of certain investments. 
Distributable profits earned by the Company 
from April 2009 to 30 September 2009 
were in excess of £4.0m and the Company 
is in a position to add substantially to this 
balance throughout the coming year.
In view of this and taking into account the 
Group’s performance and strong balance 
sheet, the Board are pleased to propose 
an inaugural full-year dividend of 1.0p per 
ordinary share amounting to £3.1m which, 
subject to approval at the Annual General 
Meeting on 4 February 2010, will be paid 
on 18 February 2010 to shareholders 
on the register at 15 January 2010 .

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
Generically all our products are referred 
to as Business Support Systems (BSS). 
Our products represent an integrated 
portfolio and it is quite common for us 
to sell more than one product to a new 
customer to solve a particular problem, 
or to sell additional products after an 
initial sale. Once they are installed, it is 
normal for our customers to keep our 
products for many years. Supporting 
our products are a broad range of 
professional and managed services. 
Professional Services primarily allow us to 
design, implement, configure and maintain 
our software products for customers. 
Managed Services allow us to deliver the 
capabilities of our products by operating 
them on behalf of our customers at either 
our own facilities or on the client’s premises. 
Intec has particular strengths in supplying 
products and services that address the global 
industry trend known as ‘convergence.’ This 
can mean convergence of both networks 
and services – the net result is that customers 
are increasingly offered a wider range of 
more complex, higher-value products such as 
broadband internet access, music and other 
content downloads, or mobile TV, through a 
range of different methods, including fixed 
lines, cable, cellular wireless and wireless local 
area networks (LANs). Intec has a product 
set which inherently addresses converged 
services with proven effectiveness and we are 
seeing increasing success in these markets.
SOuRCES OF REVENuE
Intec derives revenues from a number of 
sources. With a large and stable customer 
base, Intec has visibility of a good proportion 
of its forecast revenue at any time. ‘Recurring 
revenue’ (which includes support and 
maintenance and managed services) is highly 
predictable. Professional Services provide 
another steady revenue stream. Revenue 
from new licences is the least predictable 
although our broad product portfolio and 
wide geographic sales coverage gives us 
improved stability against market dynamics.
New software licences and licence 
upgrades. Licence revenues come from 
selling software product licences to both new 
and existing customers. Pricing is based on 
volume of usage – for example the number 
of calls handled per day by a billing system. 
If a customer exceeds the amount of usage 
contracted for in the initial licence fee, we will 
charge an upgrade fee to the next usage level. 
This is normally reviewed on an annual basis 
and can substantially increase the amount 
we bill to a customer over a period of years.
Professional services. These are 
services provided by Intec staff to help 
customers implement and run our 
products. These services include:
Consulting – to help customers design •	
and specify the systems they need;
Implementation – to install, configure •	
and integrate our products; and
Education and training – to •	
transfer technical and operational 
knowledge to customers. 
Intec has over 900 staff providing 
these services, based in four ‘Centres 
of Excellence’ around the world with a 
proportion of staff on customer sites at 
any point in time. We also partner with 
other companies to provide services where 
appropriate or requested by the customer.
Managed services. Intec provides fully 
managed facilities for various services 
needed by telecoms companies, mainly 
around the billing area. These services are 
delivered from a highly equipped technical 
facility and can deliver economies of scale, 
particularly to smaller carriers who prefer 
not to have such capabilities in-house. 
Support and maintenance fees. We 
charge customers operating our software an 
annual support and maintenance fee which 
provides them with a very comprehensive 
support service, as well as upgrades to new 
software versions. The charge is based on 
a percentage of the original licence fee 
depending on the level of service provided.
We understand the business challenges  
of our customers:
Improving time to market for new services. •	
Addressing convergence of voice •	
and data, pre-paid and post-paid, 
wireless and wireline services.
Improving customer interaction by •	
offering high-quality service bundles.
Launching IP enabled next generation •	
voice, data and content services.
Maximising network profitability and •	
improve operational efficiencies.
Streamlining order-to-cash cycle times. •	
Optimising partner relationships and •	
reduce cost of partner management. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

have the necessary level and grade of staff 
resources to meet our business commitments 
and forecasts while ensuring that staff 
are fully employed and productive.
Intellectual Property. Intec is a product 
based business and the Intellectual Property 
Rights (‘IPR’) contained in our products are key 
to our success. We use sophisticated tools and 
technologies to ensure that our products offer 
high performance and robustness and we 
engage in regular dialogue with customers to 
ensure that we deliver appropriate capabilities. 
We believe that our products have a strong 
reputation for performance, reliability and 
functionality and that our large, varied and 
stable customer base justifies this claim.
Reputation and position. Our customers 
depend heavily on our products for critical 
aspects of their operations such as revenue 
generation or customer relationship 
management. Our ability to sell to, and retain 
such customers depends on our market 
reputation. We work hard to communicate 
our business strengths in numerous ways, 
through marketing activities, through 
our customer relationship and account 
management programmes and through 
our communications to the financial 
markets. Ultimately, our reputation rests 
on our ability to meet customer needs. 
CuSTOMERS
Intec divides its customers into two groups – 
those with software licences who operate our 
technology in-house and those for whom we 
provide managed services (which are based 
on our products). Our licence customers 
are mainly large national or international 
carriers although we also work with smaller 
and start up businesses where our products 
are appropriate for their needs. There are 
several thousand recognised telecoms 
providers around the world but the majority 
of our licence customers fall into the top 
1,000 by size. By contrast, the majority of 
our managed services customers are smaller 
long-established US-based carriers serving 
local markets although we do also serve a 
number of larger national operators in the US.
We also have a small but growing number 
of customers outside telecoms in the 
financial services and logistics industries. 
These customers have recognised that 
the sophisticated billing technology 
we have developed for telecoms can 
be applied to their own businesses.
Intec has a very good track record of customer 
retention which we achieve through a 
combination of high performance, reliable 
and highly functional products and close 
attention to customer service. We invest 
continually in product development and 
we listen carefully to customers through a 
number of mechanisms including regular 
user conferences, user committees, surveys 
and good account management. We have 
good relationships with our customers who 
we survey on an annual basis for satisfaction. 
Recurring and services income from our 
customers represents a large proportion of 
our revenues and it is important that we retain 
their confidence and support through good 
products and services. Our aim is that no 
customer should ever need to change away 
from an Intec product or service through 
something we have done or failed to do. 
Almost every customer won in the early 
years of Intec remains a customer today. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS
Intec is a high-technology business 
operating in global markets and, like 
all businesses, we are exposed to a 
number of risks and uncertainties. The 
principal risks we have identified are 
detailed below, along with a high level 
statement of how we mitigate against 
them. This can never be an exhaustive 
list and there may be other risks which 
we have not identified or do not 
consider to be significant at present.
MARKET RISK
Intec sells primarily to the global 
communications market, which is dynamic, 
and characterised by rapidly changing 
technology, industry standards and customer 
needs as well as by frequent releases of 
new software applications and products. 
Intec engages in regular dialogue with 
customers to understand their needs and 
aims to offer products and services which 
meet these needs now and in the future. 
Changes within this customer base, for 
example due to consolidation, may impact 
the size of the market opportunity. The 
telecoms sector, like many other sectors, 
has been impacted by the current global 
economic credit crisis. Whilst we have not 
yet experienced any significant change in 
demand for our products, no assurances 
can be given that this will continue to be 
the case going forward and may lead to 
delays in the closure of contracts, the loss of 
prospects in our current and future pipeline 
and non-payment of customer balances. 
As some of our key product offerings can 
also be delivered through an outsourcing 
model, we are able to tailor the needs of 
our customer depending on their financial 
and operational policy towards capital 
expenditure. We continue to investigate 
new opportunities in sectors outside our 
traditional communications market. 
OPERATIONAL RISK
As described elsewhere in this document, 
we have gone through a period of both 
people and structural change with the aim 
of further improving our performance. 
This reorganisation includes a simplified 
but more globalised structure. There are a 
number of actions and priorities that are 
being implemented by the new management 
team who are experienced in implementing 
change. They are motivated by incentive 
packages that are designed to align their 
interests to those of the shareholders. 
Our employees are an important element of 
our business and our challenge is to attract 
and retain these highly skilled resources. If we 
were to lose management or employees with 
specialised product and market knowledge, 
we might not be able to manage our business 
effectively and efficiently. Intec has good 
recruitment processes and offers a range of 
long-term incentives to maximise key staff 
retention. Performance appraisal and internal 
development plans are a key part of the 
annual review process for our employees. 
A significant part of Intec’s revenue is 
derived from large multi-product or multi-
site contracts which vary in complexity and 
duration. Failure to identify and assess the 
risks and manage the contract appropriately 
may affect the results of the Group, its client 
relationships and reputation. In order to 
identify and manage risk, Intec has a detailed 
contract approval process which includes the 
preparation and approval of a transaction 
term sheet summarising information about 
financial and operational key performance 
indicators and non-standard terms and 
conditions identified from the pre-sales 
stage up to the final contract signature. 
Contract reviews are held monthly and more 
frequently for large staff-intensive projects. 
The Group maintains a risk register which is 
reviewed regularly by senior management.
We are subject to the laws and regulations of 
a number of countries covering a wide variety 
of import/export controls, anti-corruption 
legislation and data protection requirements. 
It is also possible that we may breach other 
companies’ rights in terms of intellectual 
property. We ensure we take all reasonable 
steps to comply with local regulations. We 
make all reasonable efforts to ensure that 
we do not breach the legal rights of others 
in developing or implementing products 
and we safeguard our own intellectual 
property rights (IPR) through oversight 
by our legal staff and the use of external 
trademark and copyright agencies. Our IPR 
is generally protected by copyright rather 
than patent law. In the event of any dispute, 
we take legal action only as a last resort, 
preferring to resolve issues by negotiation.
FINANCIAL RISKS
Intec’s principal financial risks are foreign 
exchange, credit and liquidity risk. The 
geographic diversity of our operations leaves 
Intec exposed to fluctuations in exchange 
rates with the highest exposure to US, 
Canadian and Australian dollars, euros, Indian 
rupees and South African rand. This spread of 
currencies exposes Intec both to transaction 
and translation risk and also to economic 
risk. We continue to monitor the credit 
risk of our customers including exchange 
control restrictions. We maintain an active 
dialogue with customers to identify at an 
early stage the level of risk associated with 
any potential non-payment. In addition, we 
ensure our liquid funds are maintained in a 
number of different banks around the world.

Corporate governan Ce COMPLIa NCE wITh ThE COMbINEd COdE
The Board is committed to the principles of good Corporate 
Governance set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
as applicable under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority (the 
‘Code’). The Code requires listed companies to report how the main 
and supporting principles of the Code have been applied, giving 
sufficient detail to enable shareholders to evaluate the report and to 
state whether there has been compliance with the provisions of the 
Code, providing an explanation for any points of non-compliance.
Throughout the period of this report, the Company has been in 
compliance with the Code.
ThE bOa Rd
The Board currently comprises the Non-Executive Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer, one other Executive Director, three independent 
Non-Executive Directors and one other Non-Executive Director who is 
not considered independent.
The Code requires the Company to have an effective Board whose role 
is to provide leadership and vision for the Group in a framework of 
controls which allow the assessment and management of risk. The 
Board sets strategic aims and the Group’s values and ensures that 
obligations to shareholders are met. The role of Non-Executive 
Directors includes the development of strategy, the scrutiny of 
executive management and ensuring the integrity of financial 
information and risk management systems. The Board believes it has 
met these requirements. The Directors and Officers of the Group have 
the benefit of a Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance policy.
Functioning of the board
The Board meets at least quarterly and from 2010 will hold an 
increased number of meetings. The Board has adopted a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for it to consider. These matters include 
the acquisition and disposal of businesses, risk management, 
significant contractual commitments, treasury policy, health and safety 
and the monitoring of operational and financial performance.
In addition, monthly updates are provided to Non-Executives and  
there is regular communication between Executive and Non- 
Executive Directors on matters requiring attention before the  
next Board meeting.
The Chairman and Non-Executives meet at least once each year 
without the Executive Directors being present.
Role of the Chairman and Chief Executive
The Code requires that there should be a clear division of 
responsibilities between the running of the Board and executive 
responsibility for the running of the business so that no one person has 
unrestricted power.
The Board has met this requirement by establishing clearly defined 
roles for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This division of 
responsibilities is set down in writing and agreed by the Board. The 
Chairman is responsible for the leadership of the Board, ensuring its 
effectiveness and setting its agenda. Once the strategic and financial 
objectives have been agreed by the Board, it is the Chief Executive 
Officer’s responsibility to ensure their delivery. He chairs the Senior 
Leadership Team and leads and motivates senior management. The 
Chief Executive Officer is obliged to comply with a practical schedule 
of matters requiring Board approval before implementation; this 
schedule is reviewed annually.
The current commitments of Mr Hughes outside Intec are as Chairman 
of Spectris plc and Telecity Group PLC, Deputy Chairman of Parity 
Group plc and a Board member of Nice Systems Limited and Chloride 
Group plc.
board composition
The Code requires that there should be a balance of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors. The Board has met the Code requirement 
that at least half of the Board should be independent throughout the 
year. In deciding the chairmanship and membership of Board 
Committees, both the need to refresh the membership and the skills of 
the individuals are taken into account.
Three Non-Executive Directors are considered to be independent. 
Franchon Smithson, who was appointed to the Board on 14 April 2009 
and René Kern, who resigned from the Board on the same date, are 
not considered to be independent as each represents the interest of 
General Atlantic Partners (Bermuda) LP, a major shareholder in the 
Company. Mr Smithson is appointed to the Board until such time as his 
removal or replacement is requested by General Atlantic or if the 
General Atlantic shareholding falls below 10% of the issued share 
capital of the Company. He is required to resign and present himself 
for reappointment by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 
in accordance with the Articles of Association and the Companies  
Act 2006.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the 
Company’s share schemes, bonus or pension arrangements.
In accordance with the regime for dealing with Directors’ conflicts of 
interest, processes are in place to ensure that, in the event of a 
potential conflict, this is reported to the Board and the Director 
involved takes no part in the relevant discussion. The Company has 
amended its Articles of Association to give the Board the power to 
authorise Director’s conflicts of interest.
a ppointments
There is a rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of 
new Directors which are made on merit and against objective criteria. 
The Director representing the interests of the major shareholder is 
recommended on the basis that he brings suitable experience and skills 
to the Board.
Information and development
A main principle of the Code is that information of sufficient quality is 
supplied to the Board in a timely manner. The Company Secretary 
ensures that the Board is supplied with detailed information several 
days prior to the Board meeting. The agenda for each Board meeting 
includes substantial reports on all aspects of the Group’s business and 
ad-hoc reports are circulated if decisions are required between formally 
arranged meetings. Non-Executive Directors have ready access to 
Executive Directors.
All newly appointed Directors are provided with an induction 
programme including meetings both internally and externally with 
those principally involved with the business. Ongoing training for 
Directors is provided for all Board members to ensure that they are 
aware of their responsibilities and regular updates on regulation and 
legislation relevant to the Group and the Directors are included within 
the Board papers.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and are able to take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense. The Company Secretary is responsible for 
ensuring that Board processes and procedures are followed. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

Performance evaluation
The Code requires the Board to undertake a formal and rigorous 
evaluation of its own performance annually and that of its Committees 
and the Directors and the Board is committed to evaluating its  
own performance.
A formal evaluation was conducted by means of detailed 
questionnaires which were completed by each Director. The answers 
will form the basis of a review by the whole Board led by the 
Chairman. Comments were invited on a wide range of issues including:
Board and Board Committee skill and balance; •

Re-election
Under the Code, Directors should offer themselves for re-election at 
regular intervals and under the Articles of Association all the Directors 
submit themselves for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting 
to be held 30 months after their re-election. Directors stand for 
reappointment by the shareholders at the first Annual General Meeting 
following their appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a term of three years and 
may be reappointed for a further term of three years with the approval 
of the Board. On appointment, each Non-Executive Director receives a 
letter setting out the terms of their appointment. The terms and 
conditions are available for inspection from the Company Secretary. 
Non-Executive Directors are not employees and do not participate in 
the daily business of the Group.
In accordance with the Code and with the Company’s Articles of 
Association, Franchon Smithson, Robin Taylor and John Hughes 
present themselves for re-election at the forthcoming Annual  
General Meeting.
bOa Rd COMMITTEES
The Board has three standing Committees to deal with specific aspects 
of the Group’s affairs: Audit, Remuneration and Nomination. Each has 
its own terms of reference which are available on request and on the 
Company’s website, www.intecbilling.com. The Committees review 
their terms of reference annually. Minutes of Committee meetings are 
available to all Directors and Committee updates are provided orally at 
Board meetings. The Company Secretary is secretary to each 
Committee.
a udit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Gordon Stuart and its other 
members are John Allkins and Peter Manning. The Chief Financial 
Officer and representatives of the external auditors attend by 
invitation. The Committee meets at least three times a year. At least 
once a year, the external auditor is able to meet the Committee 
without the Executive Directors being present. The Board has 
determined that the Committee members have sufficient skills and 
experience to contribute meaningfully to the Committee’s discussions. 
The Chairman of the Committee has the required experience in 
accounting and financial management. The Committee takes account 
of the guidance in the Combined Code on Audit Committees.
During the year, the Committee assisted the Board in discharging its 
responsibilities including reviewing and monitoring:
interim and annual report information including consideration of •	
the appropriateness of accounting policies and material assumptions 
and estimates adopted by management;
developments in accounting and reporting requirements; •	
the external auditors’ plan for the year end audit of the Company •	
and its subsidiaries;
matters raised by the external auditor; •	
the effectiveness of the Committee; •	
the terms of reference of the Committee; •	
the systems of internal control and their effectiveness, reporting to •	
the Board on the results of the review and receiving regular updates 
on key risk areas of financial control;
the requirement or otherwise for an internal audit function; •	
the performance and independence of the external auditor; •	
the audit and non-audit fees charged by the external auditor; •	
non-audit work includes tax advice, due diligence and other 
transaction related services;
the formal engagement terms entered into with the external •	
auditor; and
the expenses of Directors and the senior management. •	
The Committee reviewed the requirement for an internal audit function 
and concluded that the nature of the business and the internal controls 
in place were of sufficient quality not to require such a function at 
present. The Group has a Quality function that is responsible for 
setting formal standards policies and procedures applicable to the 
Group’s activities, conducting systematic reviews of those policies and 
procedures as applied to business functions. Such audits have been 
performed under a programme which covers a number of non-
financial operational areas. The audits are performed either by 
members of the Quality department or through peer review. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009
20
An enhanced self-assessment process operates which requires 
responsible managers to confirm the adequacy of their system of 
internal financial controls and compliance with Group accounting 
policies and to report any control weaknesses identified during 
the period.
The Committee has set parameters so that the independence of the 
external auditors is not prejudiced when undertaking non-audit work 
which include requiring such work and related fees in excess of 
£25,000 to be approved in advance by the Audit Committee Chairman. 
Non-audit work includes tax advice, due diligence and other 
transaction related services. In turn, the external auditors have in place 
processes to ensure that their independence is maintained. Non-audit 
fees paid to the auditor in respect of the year ended 30 September 
2009 totalled £268,000 (2008: £136,000). See Note 4 to the 
financial statements.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Peter Manning and its 
other members are John Allkins and Gordon Stuart. Further 
information regarding the Remuneration Committee is set out on page 
22 and the Directors’ Remuneration Report is on pages 22 to 26.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by John Hughes with the other 
members being John Allkins, Peter Manning, Gordon Stuart and René 
Kern (until 14 April 2009). The Committee meets at least once 
each year.
The role of the Committee is to assist the Board in determining the 
composition and make-up of the Board and its Committees. It is 
responsible for periodically reviewing the Board’s structure and 
identifying and recommending candidates for appointment as 
Directors, giving full consideration to succession planning and the 
needs of the Group. Before concluding arrangements with any 
preferred candidate for appointment to the Board, the Committee 
satisfies itself that their other commitments are not such that would 
adversely affect their ability to devote adequate time to the position.
During the year the Committee reviewed its terms of reference and 
reviewed the candidature of the replacement General Atlantic LP 
nominated director.
SENIOR LEad ERShIP TEa M
The Senior Leadership Team (SLT) is the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Committee and is responsible for managing the business. It comprises 
the Executive Directors together with the President of Global Markets, 
the President of Global Services, the Chief Technology Officer, the 
Commercial Director, the Group Human Resources Director and the 
R&D Director. It meets regularly throughout the year. The SLT focuses 
on implementation of strategy, decision making, monitoring of 
operational performance, and leading and facilitating change in 
the Group.
INTERNa L CONTROL
The Directors, who are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control, have established systems to ensure that an appropriate and 
reasonable level of oversight and control is provided. The systems are 
reviewed for effectiveness annually by the Audit Committee and the 
Board, and include financial, operational, compliance and risk 
management controls. The Group’s systems of internal control are 
designed to help the Company meet its business objectives by 
appropriately managing, rather than eliminating, the risks to those 
objectives. The controls can only provide reasonable, not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Executive Directors and staff meet to review both the risks facing the 
business and the controls established to minimise those risks and their 
effectiveness in operation on an ongoing basis. The aim of these 
reviews is to provide reasonable assurance that material risks and 
problems are identified and appropriate action taken at an early stage.
The Board confirms that procedures to identify, evaluate and manage 
the significant risks faced by the Group have been in place throughout 
the period and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report. The 
key risks identified in these review processes are summarised in the 
section for Principal Risks on page 15, and the principal features of the 
Company’s control framework are described below.
Financial control
The annual plan is reviewed and approved by the Board. Financial 
results with comparisons to plan and forecast results are reported  
on at least a quarterly basis to the Board together with a report on 
operational achievements, objectives and issues encountered. The 
quarterly reports are supplemented by interim monthly summary 
financial information. As the Group’s business is managed on a 
geographical basis, each geographical region prepares a monthly 
report on the financial and operational performance of the region. 
Regional management are supplied with detailed information on plan 
performance and variances to allow them to prepare their reports and 
address any problems. Monthly forecasts and objectives are updated 
regularly in the light of market developments and the underlying 
performance and expectations of each region. Significant variances 
from plan are discussed at Board meetings and actions set in place to 
address them.
Approval levels for authorisation of expenditure are at set levels and 
cascaded through the regional management structure with any 
expenditure in excess of pre-defined levels requiring approval from the 
Executive Directors and selected senior managers. All commercial 
contracts of business require review by the in-house legal department 
and, in the case of sales, a bid and contract approval process is 
in place.
OPERaTIONa L CONTROL a Nd RISk Ma Na GEMENT
Operating and regional units prepare monthly reports on all non-
financial matters, such as customer account management, sales 
performance, research and development project progress, health and 
safety, product quality and customer support metrics, marketing 
programmes, IT systems, internal service level agreements and human 
resources issues.
Risk management is applied through a systematic process of:
identification of risk sources by senior managers; •	
assessment of the effects of risk; •	
formulation of strategies to address each risk; and •	
monitoring of controls over key risks and the residual risk •	
which remains.
All senior managers of key operational areas of the business compile a 
list of significant risks, rank each risk for likelihood and impact, and set 
out plans for their management and mitigation, in light of the relative 
impact and costs. This information is reviewed monthly and 
summarised into a Risk Report which is reviewed by the Board on at 
least an annual basis.

External communications and price sensitive information
The requirement for compliance with relevant Financial Services 
Authority provisions, such as staff share dealing and external 
communications, is communicated regularly to staff and actively 
monitored and regulated by the Company Secretary. An understanding 
of compliance and regulatory issues is now a part of staff induction 
training, is set out in the Company Handbook, and forms part of the 
terms and conditions of employment. All Employee Insiders are notified 
on a regular basis of any applicable close period or other restrictions on 
dealing or external communications consequent on working for a listed 
Company. Only Executive Directors are authorised to comment 
externally on matters which might be considered to be price sensitive 
information, and a Board-level process exists for determining which 
events or information should be considered price sensitive. All material 
external communications are subject to formal Board approval and by 
appropriate external advisers if relevant.
Information management and security
The Group uses computer systems for the majority of its financial 
control and record-keeping purposes. These systems are regularly 
reviewed for their ability to provide the security, accuracy and 
availability of information required to manage and control the business. 
The Group has established controls and procedures over the off-site 
storage of data held on computers, has a defined and monitored 
information security policy for all staff, maintains appropriate measures 
against deliberate external attack, regularly audits all computers for 
legal compliance and educates all staff in these matters. Security 
systems are periodically reviewed and upgraded to deal with perceived 
changes to the risk of loss, damage or information corruption through 
internal and external factors.
Quality of personnel and employee involvement
The Board approves all senior appointments to the Group’s regional 
management structure. The Group is committed to attracting and 
retaining the highest calibre of personnel. It strives to do this through, 
amongst other things, the application of high standards in recruitment.
The Group is aware of the importance of good communication in 
relationships with its staff. The Group follows a policy of encouraging 
training and regular meetings between management and staff in  
order to provide a common awareness on the part of the staff  
of the financial and economic circumstances affecting the  
Group’s performance.
Commitment to continuous improvement
Measures continue to be taken to review and embed internal controls 
and risk management procedures into the business processes of the 
organisation and to deal with areas of improvement which come to the 
management’s and the Board’s attention. Metrics and quality 
objectives continue to be actively implemented and monitored as part 
of a continual improvement programme.

INTROdu CTION
This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, sets out Intec Telecom 
Systems PLC’s executive remuneration policy and details Directors’ 
remuneration and benefits for the financial year under review. The 
report meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied 
the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors’ remuneration. 
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will 
be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which 
the financial statements will be presented for approval.
The report is divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited 
information. The regulations require the independent auditors to 
report to the Company’s shareholders on the ‘audited information’ 
section of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part 
of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 (as amended by the Regulations).
uNaud ITEd INFORMaTION
Remuneration Committee
The Company has a Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) which 
is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Combined Code. Throughout the year, the Committee was chaired by 
Peter Manning and its other members were Gordon Stuart and John 
Allkins. Details of attendance at Committee meetings can be found in 
the attendance table included in the Corporate Governance Report.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interests 
(other than as a shareholder), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee met four times during the financial year. It has 
responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the 
Company’s policy on staff remuneration and the determination of 
remuneration packages for the Chairman of the Company, each of  
the Executive Directors and senior management (including pension 
rights and any compensation payments). The remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board. None of the 
Directors or senior managers participate in discussions about their  
own remuneration. The terms of reference of the Committee are 
available for review on the Company’s website or on request from  
the Company Secretary.
The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to:
make recommendations to the Board on the Company’s policy on •	
Executive Directors’ and senior management’s remuneration, 
including awards under the long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’);
set remuneration at a level appropriate to the responsibility and •	
experience of the Directors;
ensure that such remuneration is adequate to attract and retain •	
Directors and staff of the required calibre; and
ensure that remuneration is in line with current industry practice •	
and market conditions.
Remuneration policy
Executive remuneration packages are:
designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the calibre •	
needed to maintain the Company’s position as a market leader 
within the IT and telecoms industry;
designed to realise the Company’s business objectives and align the •	
interests of executives with shareholders; and
constructed with a substantial performance related element set •	
against appropriately demanding targets.
The performance measurement and determination of annual 
remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and key members of 
senior management are worked on by the Committee and presented 
to the Board for final approval. In determining the Directors’ 
remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted an independent 
external consultancy, Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants LLP 
(‘HNBSC’), about its proposals. HNBSC did not provide any other 
services to the Company except for advice on the valuation and vesting 
of long-term incentive plans.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for 
Executive Directors:
(a) basic salary;
(b) flexible benefits (including pension arrangements);
(c) annual bonus payments;
(d) share option incentives; and
(e) awards under the long-term incentive plan.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the 
remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-
related. As described below, Executive Directors may earn annual 
incentive payments with the benefits of participation in equity and 
long-term incentive schemes. In 2007, the share option scheme was 
superseded by the long-term incentive plan which is the primary 
equity-based incentive plan for Executive Directors. The remuneration 
policy described below will be kept under review, although the current 
intention is that the policy should continue to apply in future financial 
years.
basic salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary is normally reviewed annually and 
paid monthly as a fixed cash sum. The Committee, in determining 
salary adjustments, considers increased responsibilities such as the size 
of the Group, individual performance and contribution and market 
data. In July 2009, following a review by the Committee, which 
included reference to external salary survey data, no changes were 
made to the base salaries of the Executive Directors.
Flexible benefits and pension arrangements
Intec operates a flexible benefits scheme under which the Directors 
may choose how a benefits allowance of a maximum of 28% of basic 
salary is allocated towards a range of employee benefits, including 
additional holiday (10 days maximum) and voluntary contributions to a 
personal pension scheme. Any unallocated amounts will be paid 
monthly in cash. Outside of the flexible benefits scheme, all staff and 
Executive Directors are also entitled to private medical insurance and 
death in service benefit. These benefits are consistent with the 
preceding financial year. Intec also makes contributions to the 
Executive Directors’ personal pension schemes. The cash received 
under the flexible benefit scheme and private medical insurance are 
taxable benefits.
a nnual bonus payments
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a performance-related 
annual bonus scheme. The maximum potential bonus for any 
individual, together with the associated performance measures and 
targets, is set by the Committee.

ANNUAL REPORT 2009

OVERVIEw GOVERNaNCE FINaNCIaLS
In 2009, the Executive Directors were eligible to receive a bonus of up to 120% of their basic salary, with an on-target bonus of 65% of salary. 
These on target and maximum levels will continue to apply in 2010. The Committee determined that for the 2009 financial year the target set 
should be Group Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation, impairment and exceptionals (‘Adjusted EBITDA’). Actual performance 
for 2009 exceeded targets by more than 20%, and actual bonus awards payable are disclosed in Table A under the audited section of  
this report.
Share options
The Group operates the Intec Company Share Option Scheme (‘Company Scheme’) which is constituted by rules, and includes a section which 
has been approved by the Inland Revenue under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (‘UK Approved Section’). There have been no new 
option grants in the year and, other than in exceptional circumstances (such as recruitment), no further options will be granted to Executive 
Directors under the Company Scheme. In future, if options are granted under these exceptional circumstances, it is intended that a three-year 
vesting period, in line with best practice, will be adopted. All options, which were subject to performance conditions tied to prior periods, have 
vested and are exercisable at any time.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’)
Under the LTIP, Executive Directors may receive an annual award of conditional nominal cost shares (a ‘Nominal Cost Award’) with a face value at 
grant of up to 100% of salary, vesting after three years from grant subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions and 
continued employment. In addition, the LTIP has flexibility to grant awards on a matching basis, pro-rata to the number of shares purchased via 
annual bonus (‘Matching Awards’). Selected individuals, including all Directors, may invest a proportion of their annual bonus after tax (initially 
set at 25% of net bonus) in Company shares which will be matched on a one for one basis (to the grossed up value of the bonus invested) after 
three years subject to performance conditions and continued employment. The maximum value of Conditional Awards and Matching Awards 
which may be granted to an individual in any year is limited to 125% of basic salary.
During the year, Nominal Cost Awards were granted to the Executive Directors to an equivalent of 45.7% of salary. These awards vest in January 
2012, dependent on achievement against key performance indicators developed by the Committee and the Board to ensure the long-term 
sustainable success of the Company. These key performance indicators are measured over the three year period to 30 September 2011.
Also during the year, the eligible Executive Directors (Andrew Taylor and Robin Taylor) invested a proportion of their 2008 bonus in Company 
shares, and accordingly, 84,274 and 102,723 Matching Awards were granted to Andrew Taylor and Robin Taylor respectively. The matching 
awards were granted at the same time as the Nominal Cost Awards granted in 2009.
Two Performance Conditions are applied to the Conditional Awards. Up to 50% of the award may vest depending on growth of the Company’s 
absolute before exceptionals and impairment earnings per share (‘normalised EPS’) growth.
Vesting for EPS growth under each of the annual awards is set out below:
  Vesting percentage of up to 50% of the shares 
 a bsolute normalised EPS growth over the Performance Period subject to a Conditional award
 2007 grant 2008 grant 2009 grant
 Less than 4.00p Less than 0.75p Less than 0.177p 0%
 4.00p 0.75p 0.177p 30%
 Between 4.00p and 6.00p Between 0.75p and 2.00p Between 0.177p and 0.59p Between 30% and 100% 
    pro-rata on a straight-line basis
 6.00p or above 2.00p and above 0.59p and above 100% basis
For the 2007 and 2008 awards, vesting of the remaining 50% of the initial Nominal Cost Award is based on a comparison of the Company’s 
total shareholder return (‘TSR’) over the performance period for each respective grant against a group of UK and US software and computer 
services companies (Amdocs Limited, Anite Group plc, Comptel Corporation, Comverse Technology Inc., Convergys Corporation, CSG Systems 
International Inc., Info Vista S.A., Misys plc, Openwave Systems Inc, Fidessa group plc and Sage Group plc).
For the 2009 award, vesting of 25% of the initial nominal cost award and the matching awards is based on a comparison of the Company’s TSR 
against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap and the remaining 25% is based on comparison against the FTSE All Share Software and 
Computer Services Index.
Vesting of TSR related awards is as follows:
 TSR ranking of Intec compared to the comparator group over the Performance Period Vesting percentage of up to 50% of the shares subject to an award
 Below median ranking 0%
 Median ranking 30%
 Between median and upper quartile ranking Between 30% and 100% pro-rata on a straight-line basis
 Upper quartile ranking 100%
The Committee will review the above performance targets to ensure that they are appropriate and, where changes are required for subsequent 
awards (e.g. revised EPS growth targets), the Committee will ensure that targets are no less challenging than those set out above. 60

For the awards granted in 2007, all targets for 100% vesting have been 
met and therefore the awards will vest in full in December 2009.
Shareholding requirements
Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding 
guideline. At the time awards vest under the LTIP, executives are 
required to retain no less than 50% of shares net of taxes until such 
time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of their prevailing basic 
salary has been achieved.
External appointments
The Board recognises the benefit to the Group of permitting Executive 
Directors to serve as Non-Executive Directors of other companies. 
Subject to review in each case, the Board’s general policy is that each 
Executive Director may accept Non-Executive Directorships from which 
any fees received may be retained. Andrew Taylor is currently a 
Non-Executive Director of Scottish Water Business Stream Limited for 
which he received a fee of £19,400. Robin Taylor is currently a 
Non-Executive Director of Covalent Software Limited for which he 
received a fee of £11,000.
directors’ contracts

at the year end are set out below. Andrew Taylor’s notice period is 18 
months for the first two years from the date of his appointment. Robin 
Taylor’s service contract is terminable on 12 months’ prior written 
notice by either party, but the Company has the option to terminate 
the agreement immediately at any time on making a payment of salary 
in lieu of the notice period. Copies of Directors’ service contracts will

OVERVIEw GOVERNaNCE FINaNCIaLS
Corporate r esponsibility Corporate Responsibility (CR) is about businesses managing their 
impact on our society, our economy and our environment. It is an 
opportunity for the business community to meet and exceed the 
expectations of customers, employees, shareholders and other 
stakeholders beyond their statutory obligations.
At Intec, we are developing our approach towards CR and this is our 
first report. The period covered by this report is the 12 months to 
September 2009. In developing our reporting incrementally, we are 
focusing on those areas of greatest importance to our stakeholders, 
giving particular consideration to our employees.
OuR Va LuES
During the year, we introduced a set of global core values to the 
Group. We engaged with many of our staff through interviews, 
workshops and an all employee online survey, receiving over 900 
responses. In many instances, the responses demonstrated the 
commitment and belief that we have in Intec and stands out as a 
source of real pride in our achievements and successes; in others areas, 
we highlighted where we could do better.
We believe firmly that our values are essential to how we wish to frame 
our business and to deal with all our stakeholders, including customers, 
suppliers, shareholders and each other. We are taking actions to 
embed the values within our business. These include encouraging and 
measuring employee engagement through a series of regular more 
targeted employee surveys. This will enable the management team to 
continue to monitor progress and support the ongoing engagement of 
our employees. Employees who live the values will be rewarded and 
recognised. The values will become an integral part of our future 
performance management, measuring the extent to which we live our 
values and as a basis of future individual and team development. As 
we bring people into the organisation, we will focus our effort on 
hiring people that follow our values: individuals that are able to work 
well within a team, take into account the views of others and share 
information readily.
RESPONSIbLE buSINESS PRa CTICES
Ethics
We place importance on high standards of delivery and relationships 
between customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers and the public. 
Being trustworthy is a key value and we aim to ensure that companies 
throughout the Group behave ethically and can be trusted. The Group 
has a Code of Ethics which states that Intec will conduct its business 
fairly and in an ethical and proper manner and in full compliance with 
all applicable laws and regulations.
Corruption
Corruption is illegal and highly damaging to societies and to 
businesses. Intec’s policy states in simple terms what we all believe to 
be right – that corruption will not be tolerated. No other policy or 
business target of the Group takes precedence over this rule. We keep 
a record of payments made by the Company to agents and 
consultants. Gifts to employees are subject to a code for declaration as 
are entertainment and hospitality.
Political donations
It is our position to maintain a position of impartiality with respect to 
politics. The Group does not make political donations to any political 
party, politician or candidate for political office.
whistleblowers’ line
We ensure that any employee with concerns they feel cannot be raised 
with their line management has access to the Chairman and we will 
provide full support to employees reporting their legitimate concerns – 
even if such concerns turn out to be groundless. There were no reports 
during the year.
FTSE4Good
The Group is a member of the FTSE4Good Index. The FTSE4Good 
Index has been designed to measure the performance of companies 
that meet globally recognised corporate responsibility standards and to 
facilitate investment in those companies.
Employees
The Group recognises the value of its employees and that its continued 
success is due to their efforts. The Group has approximately 1,700 
employees located in 24 countries. During the year, we carried out an 
all-staff survey using an external agency to ensure that replies remain 
confidential. Over three quarters of our employees replied and 87% of 
those were either satisfied or very satisfied working at Intec. Questions 
relating to direction and communication, management, reaction to the 
corporate values and working at Intec were generally responded to 
positively. The responses will provide us with some challenges for the 
coming year.
Information to employees is disseminated through a variety of methods 
– regional meetings, briefings from the senior leadership team, 
teleconferencing and email.
diversity
Our objective is to create a supportive culture in which all employees 
can develop their skills, advance their careers and maximise their 
potential. No one will be discriminated against on the grounds of 
gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious 
beliefs, age, disability, race or culture. Intec will comply with any local 
laws related to non-discrimination in the workplace. The Group does 
not tolerate any sexual, physical or mental harassment. The Group 
does not employ underage staff. In our employee survey, we ask a 
question related specifically to the area of harassment and pleasingly 
this is not an area of concern for us.
Employment of disabled persons
It is Group policy to offer equal opportunities to disabled people and 
to continue wherever possible the employment of staff who become 
disabled and we offer retraining for the purposes of career 
development to staff who become disabled.
development and training
Intec is a growing organisation and is starting to place more focus on 
this area. Skills training is available to our employees. In 2009, we 
concentrated specifically on the area of management training and, 
through a series of internal face to face courses, we have provided 
training to our managers in areas such as basic leadership skills, 
performance management, managing discipline and effective 
communication. More is planned in this area in 2010.
health and Safety
During the year we began a review of our health and safety policies to 
ensure that best practice is adopted across the Group. We ensure that 
the Group meets all its legal requirements wherever it operates. We do 
not allow the safety of our people to be compromised. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

Customers and suppliers
The Group aims to treat all its customers and suppliers with respect 
and to be honest and fair in its dealings. Customer satisfaction is 
surveyed annually and we aim to deal with complaints and issues fairly 
and efficiently. It is the Group’s normal practice to make payments to 
suppliers in accordance with agreed terms provided that the supplier 
has performed in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions.
Communities
We recognise that there is an appropriate role for business in helping 
to tackle some of the issues affecting our society through community 
investment. We also recognise that employee volunteering and 
organising charitable fundraising initiatives create valuable 
opportunities for personal development and teamwork.
In total £12,862 (2008: £7,920) was donated to a number of charities 
across the Group during the year. This included matched funding to 
members of staff participating in fund raising events.
As part of our employee survey we offered to provide £1 to charity for 
each reply to the office that had the highest percentage response rate 
and the office that managed the most replies. A donation of £1,321 
was made to the Melbourne office who selected Heart Kids Australia 
as their nominated charity and the same sum to our Bangalore office 
who are distributing the funds to a number of local charities. 
We respect the laws in the countries in which we operate and  
aim to be sensitive to the local community’s cultural, social and  
economic needs.
Environment
It is the Group’s policy to support and encourage environmentally 
sound business operations and we recognise that the business has its 
part to play in protecting our environment. Our policy is to meet the 
statutory obligations placed on us, encourage teleconferencing and 
teleworking and recycle waste where possible and practicable, 
disposing of non-recyclable materials safely.
Currently, the Group does not record its energy use but in the coming 
year we will be registering the Woking office under the UK CRC Energy 
Efficiency Scheme. Most of our offices are located in larger buildings 
and energy charges are not billed separately so accurate recording of 
energy use is unlikely to be achieved. However, our offices are 
targeting energy reduction through use of timed light switches, energy 
efficient bulbs and a ‘switch off the lights’ campaign. Many of our 
staff, including almost 90% of those in our Brisbane office, use public 
transport to get to work. Seven staff members in the UK registered for 
the Woking Cycle Challenge replacing their vehicle with a cycle and 
over the two week challenge covered a total of 395 miles saving 74kg

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. The Directors are required by the IAS Regulation to 
prepare the Group financial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The 
Group financial statements are also required by law to be properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that IFRS financial 
statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events 
and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition 
criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with 
all applicable IFRSs. However, Directors are also required to:
properly select and apply accounting policies; •	
present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that •	
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information; and
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific •	
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The Directors have elected to prepare the parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). The parent Company financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; •	
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; •	
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been •	
followed;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless •	
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue  
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the parent 
Company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIbILITY STaTEMENT
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International •	
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and
the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ •	
Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face.

Under the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006, a Company’s Directors’ Report is required, among 
other matters, to contain a fair review by the Directors of the Group’s business through a balanced 
and comprehensive analysis of the development and performance of the business of the Group 
and the position of the Group at the year-end, consistent with the size and complexity of  
the business.
The Directors’ Report set out above, including the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s 
Statement, the Chief Financial Officer’s Report, the Business Description and the Corporate 
Responsibility Review incorporated into it by reference (together, the Directors’ Report), has been 
prepared only for the shareholders of the Company as a whole and its sole purpose and use is to 
assist shareholders to exercise their governance rights. In particular, the Directors’ Report has not 
been audited or otherwise independently verified. The Company and its Directors and employees 
are not responsible for any other purpose or use or to any other person in relation to the  
Directors’ Report.
The Directors’ Report contains indications of likely future developments and other forward-looking 
statements that are subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the economic and 
business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries, sectors and business 
segments in which the Group operates. These factors include, but are not limited to, those 
discussed under Principal Risks (page 15). These and other factors could adversely affect the 
Group’s results, strategy and prospects. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties 
and assumptions. They relate to events and/or depend on circumstances in the future which could 
cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those currently anticipated. No 
obligation is assumed to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the 
European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Changes in accounting standards
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS)
The Group has adopted IAS 39 ‘(Amendment) Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement: Eligible hedged items’ during the year. This 
has not had any material impact on the Group’s results or financial position.
The Group has adopted IFRIC 16 ‘hedges of a net Investment in a Foreign Operation’ which has not had any material impact on the Group’s 
results or financial position.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations that are not yet effective have not been early adopted by the Group:
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
IFRS 3 (revised) ‘Business Combinations’
IAS 27 (revised) ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’
IAS 23 (amendment) ‘Borrowing Costs’
IAS 28 (amendment) ‘Investment in Associates’
IAS 32 (amendment) ‘Financial Instruments’
IAS 38 (amendment) ‘Intangible Assets’
IAS 39 (amendment) ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement’
IFRS 2 (amendment) ‘Share-based payment’
IFRS 5 (amendment) ‘Non-current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’

IFRIC 18 ‘Transfer of assets from customers’
The Directors are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these standards, amendments and interpretations.
The following interpretations have been published and are mandatory but are not relevant to the Group:
IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’
basis of preparation
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of certain items which are measured at fair value 
as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and the Directors’ statement in respect of going concern is provided on 
page 29.
The 2008 results have been expanded to disclose separately the one-time charge for the closure of the mechanicsburg facility in order to provide 
additional clarity of the underlying results for the comparative period.
basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company. The results 
of entities or businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition being 
the date on which control passed. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
acquired entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of an acquired entity or business to bring their accounting policies into line 
with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

Segmental reporting
The Group has one reportable operating segment, that of the development, sale, implementation and support of business/operations support 
software solutions.
business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued plus any costs directly attributable 
to the business combination.
The assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of the 
cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any shortfall of the cost of acquisition 
below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting
The Group principally derives its revenue from the sale of software licences, development projects performed for clients and fees for installation, 
consultancy, training and maintenance. Revenue is recognised on individual contracts based on the fair value of consideration received or 
receivable under the following principles:
Revenues from software licence agreements are recognised where there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with a customer, delivery of •	
the software has taken place, collectability is probable and the fee is fixed and determinable. Such revenue, being licence and implementation 
revenue, is generally recognised on a percentage of completion basis (on the basis of hours incurred against total anticipated hours) over the 
period of the installation unless the licence fee and any implementation services meet the conditions for separate recognition.
Revenue from the sale of unbundled software licences is recognised on the completion of contractual milestones or when milestones are •	
unconditional. These contractual milestone obligations normally include grant of licence on signing of the contract, which coincides with 
delivery, installation of the software and customer acceptance. Thus a portion of revenue is deferred until final customer acceptance.
Fee income from implementation, consulting, training and maintenance is recognised over the period in which the service is provided. •	
Consulting and training is recognised on the basis of time and materials or for fixed price contracts on hours incurred against total anticipated 
hours. maintenance is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreement.
Revenue from hardware sales is recognised on customer acceptance, which normally coincides with delivery. •	
Accrued income represents revenue recognised in advance of billings to customers. Amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised are 
included in deferred revenue.
Revenue is stated net of any value added tax or sales related tax.
finance income
Finance income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective rate applicable, which is the rate that 
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of that financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount.
foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is Intec Telecom Systems PLC’s functional and presentational currency.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, foreign currency transactions are converted to sterling at the rates ruling at the 
dates of the transactions. monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. These translation differences are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average 
rates for the year. The net assets or liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange rates. The exchange differences arising 
on translation of the opening net assets or liabilities and results of overseas operations are taken to equity through the Group’s translation 
reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and 
translated at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of 
transition to IFRS as sterling-denominated assets and liabilities.
Intangible assets – Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of identifiable assets 
and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009

1. aCCO uNTING POLICIES (CONTINuEd)
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies 
of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently  
where there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Any impairment is immediately recognised in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising prior to the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amount, subject to testing for impairment at 
that date.
Other intangible assets
Separately acquired intangible assets, primarily intellectual property rights, development costs and software are initially measured at cost. After 
initial recognition, the intangible asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation less any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is 
charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life which ranges from three to 10 years.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is recognised as an internally generated intangible asset only when the following criteria are met:
an asset is created that can be separately identified; •	
the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it will be available for use has been achieved; •	
the Group has the intention to complete the asset and use or sell it; •	
the Group has the ability to use or sell the asset; •	
it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; •	
adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and •	
the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. •	
If all the above tests are not met the expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
The qualifying expenditure capitalised represents costs directly attributable to the development of the asset. This expenditure is capitalised from 
the point at which the above criteria are met up to the point at which the asset is in use. Asset lives are generally as follows:
Intellectual property rights 5–10 years
Development costs 3–5 years
Software 3–5 years
Other 3–5 years
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which are estimated to be between three and 
five years.
Costs relating to the implementation of managed service solutions for specific customers are capitalised and amortised over the minimum term 
of the data processing period specified in the customer contract. The capitalised costs may include an element of hardware, however, as this 
element is considered to be an integral part of the managed service solution, it is included as part of the intangible asset.
PROPERTY, PLa NT a Nd Equ IPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation less any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises the 
purchase price and directly attributable costs of acquiring the asset. Depreciation is provided on cost on a straight-line basis over the estimated 
useful life of the assets. Asset lives are generally as follows:
Leasehold improvements over the lease term
motor vehicles 3–4 years
Computer equipment 3–5 years
Furniture and equipment 3–5 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the 
term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying 
amount of the asset and is recognised in income.

Lease and hire purchase contracts 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable and lease incentives are taken to the income statement on a straight-line 
basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Items of property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets at their fair value  
or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, at the date of inception of each lease or contract and depreciated over  
their estimated useful lives. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease  
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on  
the outstanding liability.
Impairment of assets 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of all of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any of 
those assets has suffered an impairment loss.
If impairment is indicated, then the recoverable amount is assessed to determine the extent of the impairment. Where the asset does not 
generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which 
the asset belongs. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less disposal costs and its value in use. Value in use calculations 
are performed using cash flow projections, discounted at a pre-tax rate which reflects the asset-specific risks and the time value of money.
To the extent that the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the shortfall is immediately recognised in the income statement and 
the carrying amount reduced.
With the exception of goodwill, where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount subject to the new recoverable amount not exceeding the carrying value that would have been in use had the 
initial impairment not been recognised. The reversal is immediately recognised in the income statement.
financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of  
the instrument.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the estimated future 
recoverable amount.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and other short-term liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash 
and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Restricted cash is carried in the balance sheet at cost. Restricted cash comprises collateral required for letter of credit arrangements over certain 
customer contracts.
Financial assets at fair value through income statement 
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated by 
management. Financial assets held in this category are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with changes in value 
recognised in the income statement in the line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction.
Impairment of financial assets 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets are impaired. Where there is objective 
evidence that an impairment loss has arisen on assets carried at amortised cost, the carrying amount is reduced with the loss being recognised in 
the income statement. The impairment loss is measured as the difference between that asset’s carrying amount and the present value of 
estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is only reversed if it can be 
related objectively to an event after the impairment was recognised and is reversed to the extent the carrying value of the asset does not exceed 
its amortised cost at the date of reversal.
The carrying amount of trade receivables in case of impairment is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in 
the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments 
are set out below. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009
40
1. aCCO uNTING POLICIES (CONTINuEd)
Bank borrowings 
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges are accounted for on 
an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs 
All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method in the period in which they are incurred and are 
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair 
value at the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised 
directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or 
forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is 
recognised, the associated gains or losses or the derivative that had been previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, amounts deferred in 
equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as 
they arise.
Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial 
assets are derecognised when the Group no longer has rights to cash flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. Financial 
liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. In particular, for all regular way purchases 
and sales of financial assets, the Group recognises the financial assets on the settlement date, which is the date on which the asset is delivered 
to or by the Group.
Retirement benefits 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they become due. Payments made to comparable 
state managed schemes are treated in the same way.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense that are material in amount which merit separate disclosure in order to provide an 
understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Examples of events giving rise to the disclosure of material items of income and 
expense as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, impairment events, reorganisation of Intec’s operations, first time recognition of 
deferred tax assets and profits and losses on sale of businesses.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or recovered and is calculated using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Tax currently payable is based on taxable profit 
for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are 
taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. It is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business 
combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.

1. aCCO uNTING POLICIES (CONTINuEd)
Deferred tax is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is not probable that it will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement unless it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity in which case it is also 
charged or credited directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required 
to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle that obligation at the balance sheet 
date, and are discounted to present value.
Restructuring provisions comprise unexpired future lease payments on vacant properties, removal costs and employee termination payments. 
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a formal, detailed plan for the restructuring and this has been 
communicated to affected parties.
Onerous lease provisions are established on a property-by-property basis (or separable portions thereof) to meet the estimated liabilities, 
including dilapidations, of all surplus properties. The provision includes all ongoing, unavoidable costs net of any sub-letting income.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 to all grants of equity instruments made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at  
1 January 2005 in accordance with the transitional provisions of that Standard.
The Group operates various share-based award schemes, all of which are equity settled. The fair value of awards determined at the date of grant 
(excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period that 
service conditions apply, with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ equity, based on an estimate of the number of share-based awards that 
are expected to vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The fair value of the award is calculated using either the Black-Scholes or the monte Carlo model as described in Note 9. Non-market conditions 
are included in assumptions around the number of awards that are expected to become exercisable and these assumptions are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date. Proceeds received on exercise of the awards are credited to equity.
2. SIGNIfICa NT a CCOuNTING jud GEMENTS a Nd ESTIMaTES
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the Group’s accounting policies and 
make estimates about the future. The critical judgements that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the consolidated 
financial statements and the key areas of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value 
of assets and liabilities in the next financial year, are discussed below:
a) Revenue recognition – Judgement is sometimes required as to when a contract should be unbundled and its constituent parts accounted 
for separately. The Directors consider the nature of the services and licence sold to determine whether unbundling is appropriate. Key factors 
to be considered include whether professional services are essential to the functionality of the licence and whether each component of the 
contract has a determinable fair value. In addition, recognition of revenue on certain contracts is determined, inter alia, by reference to the 
stage of completion of those contracts. At the balance sheet date, the Directors make estimates based upon experience of the remaining 
costs to complete a contract and hence assess the proportion of the revenue to be recognised on the contract.
b) Impairment testing – Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets involves comparing the carrying value of an asset with its value 
in use, based upon a discounted cash flow model. This model involves making assumptions involving future revenues and profits as well as 
long-term growth rates and the appropriate discount rate. Further details are set out in Note 13.
c) Share-based payments – The value of share-based payments requires several judgements to be made regarding expected volatility, the 
expected life of the options granted, risk free interest rate and dividend yield. The details of these assumptions are disclosed in Note 9.
d) Provisions – Using information available at the balance sheet date, the Directors make judgements based on experience of the level of 
provision required to satisfy onerous lease and dilapidation commitments, including assessing whether any sublet income will arise and the 
length of any void period.
e) Provisions for bad debts – Provision is made based on management’s estimate of the prospect of recovering the amount due which 
includes considering the credit status of the customer and its history in meeting its commitments.
f) deferred taxation – The recognition of deferred tax assets requires judgement as to future revenue and profits and the jurisdictions in 
which they arise. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

5. REvENuE a Nd SEGMENTa L a Na LYSIS
The Directors consider that the Group operates in one continuing class of business, namely that of the development, sale, implementation and 
support of business/operations support software solutions.
From 1 October 2008, two of the Group’s key geographical regions comprising North America and Caribbean and Latin America (CALA) have 
been combined for operational reasons. As a consequence the segmental analysis disclosed in this note now comprises three key geographical 
segments comprising Americas, Europe, middle East and Africa (EmEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC) and product operations. The geographical 
segments are based on customer location. Product operations comprise our development, product management and offshore operations. The 
2008 numbers have been restated to provide comparable information.
Inter-segmental revenue and expenses comprise amounts charged to other regions for resources used on projects outside their home region. The 
revenue and expenses are determined on an arms-length basis. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those 
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise corporate assets, liabilities and expenses. Segment information under 
the primary reporting format is as disclosed in the table below:

The Group’s share-based payment plans are described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report, which also details the applicable terms and 
conditions. The Group’s share-based payment arrangements are entirely equity settled, and resulted in an expense for the year of £2,043,000 
(2008: £1,458,000).
a) Share options
There have been no new share option grants in 2009. All outstanding options have vested and are exercisable at any time subject to individual 
restrictions during close periods. In the past, when share options have been granted under the Group’s share option scheme, the grant price was 
equal to the market price of Group shares at the date of grant. Service conditions generally apply for three years. If the option remains 
unexercised after 10 years from the date of grant, the option expires. Options are forfeited if the recipient voluntarily leaves the Group before 
the service conditions are met.
The Group operates a UK Approved and Unapproved Share Option Scheme and a US Stock Option Plan for the benefit of Directors and 
employees. Details of the outstanding share options are disclosed in the table below:

The fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility was based upon the historic volatility of Intec’s 
shares over a period of up to three years before grant date and adjusted for items such as periods of exceptional volatility between June 2000 
and march 2003. The following table shows the fair values calculated and the assumptions made to derive those fair values for options granted 
during the year ended 30 September 2008.

b) Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
In may 2007, the Company’s shareholders approved the LTIP. 6,187,170 awards (2008: 4,332,327) awards including 371,440 (2008: 227,762) 
matching awards were made in 2009 to Executive Directors and senior management. Vesting of the awards is conditional upon earnings per 
share growth and the Company’s Total Shareholder Return over a three year period from the start of the financial year in which the awards  
were granted.
The cost of the awards was calculated using the monte Carlo model as 50% of the awards granted have market-based vesting conditions. The 
following table shows the fair value calculated and the assumptions made to calculate the fair value of the awards granted in 2009 and 2008. 
The awards granted in 2009 and 2008 will vest three years from the date the awards were granted subject to the performance conditions 
highlighted above.

The standard rate of current tax in the UK (being the country of residence of the parent Company) for the year is 28% (2008: 29%). The tax 
reconciliation is based on this rate due to the difficulty in selecting a weighted average rate given the range of tax rates (0%–39%) and countries 
in which the Group operates and the range of profits and losses arising in those countries. The amount of the future tax charge will depend 
primarily on the level of profits together with the jurisdiction in which they are achieved and the ability to use available tax losses. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares outstanding during the year. The average number of shares outstanding excludes those held in trust by the Group (see Note 24), which 
are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as the basic earnings per share with a further adjustment to the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding to reflect the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The number of dilutive potential ordinary 
shares is derived from the number of share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the 
Company’s ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share, which is defined as basic earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of acquired intangible assets 
and the first time recognition of deferred tax shown in exceptional items, has been calculated and disclosed above as the Directors consider it 
provides an additional indication of underlying trading performance.

The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2009 of 1.0p per share, which would reduce 
shareholders’ funds by approximately £3,100,000. The proposed dividend is subject to approval at the AGm on 4 February 2010 and has not 
been recognised as a liability in these financial statements. If approved, the final dividend will be paid on 18 February 2010 to shareholders on 
the share register on 15 January 2010.

IFRS requires that goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to benefit from 
that business combination. Goodwill arising on acquisitions has been allocated to Product Operations. In assessing whether goodwill has been 
impaired, the carrying amount of Product Operations (including goodwill) is compared with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
determined by its value in use. The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model. These cash flows include operating profits 
generated by the geographies using the products. The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset and discounted using a 
pre-tax discount rate of 8.18% (2008: 12.27%). This discount rate is derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. The Group 
prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management which cover a period of 12 months. The key 
assumptions used in the impairment testing are revenue and operating margin by product type (and hence profit before interest and taxation), 
discount rates and rates of growth beyond the 12 month planning period.
The cash flow forecasts reflect management’s expectations of revenue growth and operating margin, based upon signed orders, identified 
prospects for contract extensions or renewals with existing customers, together with expectations of work to be sold to new clients. The 
forecasts are most sensitive to changes in projected revenue growth rates in the first year of the forecast period which are based on the 2010 
budget. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated based on growth rates for each product group in product operations of 3% (2008: 3%). 
Goodwill is not amortised, but is instead subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might 
be impaired. There are no intangible assets apart from goodwill that have indefinite useful lives.

This customer paid its balance in full in October 2008. management do not believe that there is a significant concentration of credit risk in trade 
receivables. Information on new customers, including country risk, is obtained during the contract negotiation stage and is assessed by 
management on a case by case basis. The average credit period for trade receivables is 57 days (2008: 64 days) based on invoice date. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC

brought forward are for the period up to the first option to break in 2011 on a property lease in Denmark and up to September 2010 for part of 
the office space at the Group’s UK headquarters. As a result of the change in the economic outlook related to sub-letting of properties in the 
UK, an additional provision of £469,000 was established during the year which now covers the period to 2012. As a result of a change in 
tenancy in the Denmark property, an additional provision of £33,000 was established during the year.
The other provisions category relates to the estimated restoration costs of properties, primarily within North America and the UK, and are 
expected to be incurred in 2010 in North America and 2015 in the UK.

Deferred tax assets of £7,635,000 (2008: £434,000) have been recognised in respect of the future use of tax losses carried forward in  
certain subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward and other temporary differences in certain Group companies have not been recognised 
because, at present, it is not envisaged that there will be sufficient taxable profits in those companies to absorb these reliefs. The unutilised 
reliefs may be carried forward indefinitely, with the exception of the US tax losses, of which the first will expire, if not previously used, in 2020.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £12,333,000 (2008: £26,723,000) relating to the unremitted earnings of 
overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will  
not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 30 September 2009 are significantly reduced from the previous year as a 
result of a change to UK tax legislation which largely exempts from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009. The temporary 
differences at 30 September 2009 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings  
may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these 
subsidiaries operate.

Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business. The capital structure of the Group consists cash and cash equivalents 
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Note 24.
The Group does not have any net debt, therefore no gearing ratio is calculated.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Categories of financial instruments
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis 
on which income and expenses are recognised in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in

financial risk management objectives
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are market risk (primarily foreign currency risks and interest rate risks), liquidity risk 
and credit risk. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework, 
which are set out on page 15. INTEC TELECOM SYSTEMS PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT 2009

22. fINa NCIa L INSTRuMENTS (CONTINuEd)
Market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the 
value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within 
acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group’s activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The exposure to interest rate risk is 
limited to cash and cash equivalents.
Risk is measured in terms of its impact on the assets and liabilities and the effect on the income statement.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are primarily on its cash and cash equivalents as no overdrafts 
are operated and the Group has no loans. An increase of 1% in interest rates will have the effect of an increase in finance income of £749,000, 
whilst a decrease of 0.5% in interest rates will reduce finance income by £373,000.
Foreign currency risk and sensitivity analysis
Translation
The Group has foreign operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the balance sheets 
and income statements into sterling. The Group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the balance sheet and 
income statement of overseas operations.
Transaction
Operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
and once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group’s policy is to settle intercompany balances on which maximum exposure arises due to currency movements. This policy has the effect 
of protecting the Group’s consolidated balance sheet and the income statement from movements in those currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s monetary assets and monetary liabilities in currencies denominated in a currency other than the functional 
currency of the Company or its subsidiaries at the reporting date are as follows:

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses presented below are based on a 10% appreciation/depreciation of the euro and US dollar against sterling. The impact on 
the income statement represents the impact of a change in the exchange rates on the net monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that are not 
denominated in the functional currency of the entity involved. The impact on other equity relates to the translation of the Group’s net assets that 
are denominated in euro and US dollar at the flexed exchange rates.

forward foreign exchange contracts
At year end the Group has one forward foreign exchange contract to the value of ZAR 28 million in relation to the hedging of a Group  
company receivable.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a customer will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables which represent the Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk in relation to financial assets and is shown in the table below:

Trade receivables       16 36,025 42,171
        110,857 71,098
87% of the Group’s cash is held with three banks, however, credit risk is considered to be limited due to government support behind  
these institutions.
The Group’s policy to mitigate its potential credit risks on trade and other receivables is included in Note 16.
Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk 
management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by the regional finance teams. Since the Group has no 
borrowings other than finance lease liabilities the risk is minimal. The Group has creditors and other amounts payable to tax authorities for which 
it has sufficient cash balances.

Other reserves 
Other reserves include a merger reserve of £249,000 which arises as a result of applying Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985 to the 
acquisition of the Digiquant Group in 2003.
On 29 April 2009, the high Court of Justice consented to the cancellation of the Company’s share premium account, which was approved by 
shareholders at a general meeting on 14 April 2009 and subsequently registered by Companies house on 6 may 2009. Cancellation of the 
£162.0 million in the share premium account has enabled the Company to eliminate the accumulated deficit on its profit and loss account. An 
amount of £135.3 million of this has been transferred to other reserves.
This reserve will remain non-distributable until the Company repays all of its creditors in existence at the date of cancellation and/or certain other 
conditions have been met.
Own shares 
Own shares are held by the Intec Employee Share Trust. The trust currently holds 270,000 shares in the Company at a cost of 205.0p each. The 
written down value of the shareholding is £95,000.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve is used to record exchange differences relating to the translation of the net assets and results of foreign subsidiaries 
arising after 1 October 2004.

The average effective borrowing rate was 6.9% (2008: 9.9%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment 
basis and no arrangements have been made for contingent rental payments. Lease obligations are denominated in sterling, US dollars, euros, 
Australian dollars and South African rand. The fair value of the lease obligations approximates their carrying value. The lease obligations under 
finance leases are secured by the lessors’ charges over the leased assets.
c) bonds and guarantees
The Company has entered into a composite guarantee arrangement in respect of the financial obligations arising from the provision of banking 
facilities to the UK and certain subsidiaries within the Group. The Group also has various letters of credit and guarantees over certain customer 
contracts. The total amounts outstanding as at 30 September 2009, relating to these obligations was £5.3 million (2008: £3.8 million).
d) Related party transactions
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed

basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting 
standards. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s profit and loss account and statement of total recognised 
gains and losses are not presented in these financial statements. The Company has not published its individual cash flow statement as its 
liquidity, solvency and financial adaptability are dependant on the Group rather than its own cash flows.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 ‘Related party disclosures’ and has not reported transactions with fellow 
Group undertakings.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and has not produced any 
disclosures required by that standard, as disclosures that comply with FRS 29 are available in the Intec Telecom Systems Plc Annual Report for the 
year ended 30 September 2009.
Investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the net proceeds after issue costs. Issue costs are recognised in the profit and loss account 
over the life of the borrowing facility, using the effective interest method.
Share-based payments 
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all share options granted after 7 November 2002 that remain unvested 
as of 1 January 2005. FRS 20 has also been applied to all share options granted after 31 December 2004.
The Company operates various share-based award schemes, all of which are equity settled. The fair value at the date at which the share-based 
awards are granted to its own employees is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a 
corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest. The services received from 
employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. If the shares are issued to employees of a subsidiary, the amount is 
debited to the investment account. The Company’s subsidiary recognises the charge in its profit and loss account for the share options issued to 
its employees with a corresponding increase in equity disclosed as a contribution from the parent.
The fair value of the options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes or monte Carlo methods, as described in Note 9 to the Group accounts. 
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards that vest.
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less 
tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the 
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial 
statements. Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell 
the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted.
financial instruments
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction, unless matching forward foreign 
exchange contracts have been entered into, in which case the rate specified in the relevant contract is used. At the balance sheet date unhedged 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at that date.

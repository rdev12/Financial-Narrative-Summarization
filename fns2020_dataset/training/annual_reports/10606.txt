CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report another year of strong progress for the Group. Building on the extensive customer  
research 	 in 	 2013 	 we 	 continued 	 to 	 develop 	 and 	 redefine 	 both 	 the 	 Moss 	 Bros 	 master 	 brand 	 and 	 the 	 supporting	 
sub-brands.	All	the	collateral	has	been	redesigned	including	store	windows,	product,	advertising	and	point	 
of sale. This is being rolled out across our network of stores and on-line in a managed programme. This 
brand driven focus has given the Executives a strong foundation from which to deliver growth in both sales  
and 	 profits, 	 across 	 all 	 channels, 	 ahead 	 of 	 market 	 expectations 	 despite 	 the 	 challenging 	 external 	 environment.
Total	like-for-like*	sales	including	VAT	reflected	a	4.2%	increase	on	the	prior	year.	Profit	before	taxation	
was	£4.4m,	compared	with	a	profit	before	taxation	and	exceptional	items	of	£3.0m	in	the	previous	
year.	Profit	before	taxation,	after	exceptional	items,	was	£4.4m	against	£3.1m	in	the	prior	year.	EBITDA	
continued	on	a	positive	trend	to	£9.2m,	compared	with	Adjusted	EBITDA**	of	£7.9m	in	the	previous	year.	
Similarly,	our	cash	position	continues	to	be	very	strong	and	confidence	in	our	future	trading	position	has	
encouraged	the	Board	to	significantly	increase	the	dividend	from	0.9p	to	5.0p	per	share.	
Actions to improve performance have included establishing our multi-channel credentials across the 
UK,	the	launch	of	a	new	Hire	website	in	November	2013,	the	development	of	a	number	of	international	
websites	for	retail,	expanding	the	product	offerings	such	as	Moss	Bespoke	(which	is	now	available	in	
21	stores),	and	investing	in	the	UK	store	estate	(including	2	new	store	openings	and	13	refits).	
In	 parallel	 with	 these	 actions,	 the	 team	 continues	 to	 apply	 strong	 cash	 and	 working	 capital	 controls	 and	 the	
business	continues	debt	free,	with	a	healthy	cash	balance,	enabling	the	Board	to	adopt	a	more	progressive	
dividend policy.
During	the	last	12	months,	we	saw	another	significant	change	to	the	share	register,	with	the	sale	by	 
Laura	Ashley	of	their	10%	stake.	This	was	successfully	taken	up	by	a	number	of	‘blue	chip’	investors.
We added to the strength of the executive team with the appointment of a new Commercial and Operations 
Director, 	 with 	 specific 	 accountability 	 for 	 establishing 	 and 	 leveraging 	 the 	 Moss 	 Bros 	 brand 	 across 	 the 	 business.
As	announced	on	14	January	2014,	the	Board	is	proposing	the	payment	of	a	final	dividend	of	4.7	pence	per	
share	to	be	paid	on	26	June	2014	to	all	shareholders	on	the	register	on	the	6	June	2014	(ex	dividend	date	 
4 	 June 	 2014). 	 It 	 is 	 our 	 intention 	 to 	 apply 	 a 	 progressive 	 dividend 	 policy 	 balanced 	 against 	 the 	 wider 	 investment	
needs of the business. 
In	the	coming	year,	we	will	accelerate	our	store	refit	programme,	and	build	on	our	multi-channel	offer,	
in the UK and internationally. The strength of the Moss Bros brand will allow us to enhance our position 
as	‘the	UK’s	No.1	Men’s	Formalwear	Specialist’	and	the	executive	team	is	focused	on	bringing	further	
momentum	to	that	strategy.	Although	we	see	a	continuation	of	competitive	market	conditions,	we	are	well	
placed to build on our credentials and to grow our market share.
Finally,	we	would	like	to	thank	our	people	for	their	continued	hard	work	and	contribution	to	another	
successful year.

STRATEGIC	REVIEW
StrategY and OBJectiVeS
Moss	Bros	Group	PLC	(“the	Group”)	retails	and	hires	formal	wear	for	men,	predominantly	in	the	UK.	The	
Group	operates	predominantly	through	Moss	Bros	branded	mainstream	stores,	promoting	a	number	
of own branded sub-brands and third party brands. The Group also trades through the premium Savoy 
Taylors	Guild	fascia,	where	there	is	a	historical	link	in	areas	such	as	the	Strand	in	London.	
The Group’s vision is to be the UK’s No.1 men’s formal wear specialist through creating a multi-channel 
menswear	business	focused	on	our	target	customer	groups.	There	are	three	pillars	to	this	strategy:
1)	 	 Implement	a	clear	brand	strategy	leveraging	the	Moss	Bros	master	brand	and	complementary 
sub-brands.
2)	 Achieve	full	multi-channel	capability	so	that	customers	can	shop	seamlessly	across	all	channels.
3)	 	 Revitalise	the	customer	experience	across	all	channels	through	great	service	and	great	
environments.
We	continue	to	develop	the	positioning	of	the	brand,	and	to	that	end,	completed	a	customer	insight	project	
during	the	first	half	of	the	year.	Our	customers	have	told	us	very	clearly	how	much	they	value	the	Moss	
Bros	brand	for	its	expertise,	heritage,	product	quality	and	value	for	money	but	lacked	awareness	of	our	
retailing credentials and product offer. A number of initiatives are underway to exploit our market position 
and the opportunity this creates. 
A	key	objective	of	our	e-commerce	initiatives	is	to	provide	a	fully	multi-channel	offer	to	all	customers,	
offering	a	number	of	ways	to	shop.	The	project	to	create	a	single	customer	database,	including	full	
customer	transaction	history,	is	expected	to	complete	in	2014/15	and	offers	significant	opportunities	
for	the	business.	Our	on-line	performance	continues	to	grow,	with	significant	increases	from	launch	in	
customer	traffic	flow,	conversion	rates	and	sales.	There	are	also	opportunities	to	exploit	international	 
on-line growth. 
There are also opportunities to grow and develop our UK store estate. The UK store refurbishment 
programme	remains	on	track	with	positive	results	seen	from	refitted	stores	compared	to	non-refitted	
stores,	with	refitted	stores	achieving	our	three	year	payback	target	and	an	enhanced	customer	experience.

RETAIL
There	are	102	Moss	Bros	and	Savoy	Taylors	Guild	branded	stores	(2012/13:	102	in	total)	and	31	Moss	Bros	
outlet	 stores	 (2012/13:	 34)	 as	 at	 25	 January	 2014,	 which	 trade	 Moss	 Bros	 own	 brands	 and	 carefully	 selected	
third	party	brands	including	Hugo	Boss,	Canali,	Ted	Baker,	DKNY	and	French	Connection,	where	the	store	
profile	demonstrates	a	demand	for	this	type	of	product.	The	vast	majority	of	the	stores	also	have	a	Moss	
Bros	Hire	‘store	within	a	store’	operation	within	them.	
In	parallel	with	operational	improvements,	we	have	continued	to	review	the	positioning	of	the	Moss	Bros	
brand with current and potential customers and the overall perceived value of the offering. The concept of  
Moss 	 Bros 	 for 	 Hire, 	 Buy 	 or 	 Bespoke 	 underpins 	 our 	 vision 	 to 	 be 	 ‘the 	 UK’s 	 No.1 	 Men’s 	 Formalwear 	 Specialist’.	
The Moss Bespoke concept is a good example of leveraging our expertise in suits into a new and growing 
segment	of	high	quality,	affordable,	bespoke	suits	for	a	more	mass	market.	Not	only	does	it	add	‘theatre’	
to	the	Moss	Bros	offering,	it	sits	well	with	the	hire	offer	as	an	alternative	for	occasions	like	weddings.	It	
also enhances our reputation for quality and value for money and provides an opportunity to improve the 
footfall	and	sales	densities	in	our	larger	stores.	We	have	also	successfully	opened	another	3	(2012/13:	12)	
‘store	within	store’	Moss	Bespoke	outlets	in	other	core	Moss	Bros	Retail	Stores	during	2013/14	as	part	
of	the	store	refurbishment	programme.	Bespoke	is	now	available	in	21	(2012/13:	18)	stores	across	the	
country	and	the	plan	is	for	28	(2012/13:	2)	more	to	be	added	during	2014/15.	
HIRE
Moss Bros Hire is the market leader in the UK hire market and the number one recognised name for hire. 
We	have	129	Moss	Bros	Hire	outlets	as	at	25	January	2014	(2012/13:	131);	all	contained	within	core	Moss	
Bros Retail and Savoy Taylors Guild Stores. 
E-COMMERCE
Our	new	Retail	website	which	went	live	in	January	2013	has	seen	significant	increases	from	launch	in	
customer	traffic	flow	and	conversion	rates.	Our	international	focus	has	taken	shape	during	the	second	half	
of	the	financial	year	with	the	launch	of	local	currency	websites	in	Denmark,	Sweden	and	the	Republic	of	
Ireland. 
A new transactional Hire website went live in November 2013 in preparation for the 2014 wedding season. 
This is still at an early stage of growth but it is showing encouraging results.
SUPPLY	CHAIN	AND	COSTS
The	buying	team	continually	assesses	supplier	performance,	to	ensure	the	most	commercially	beneficial	
results	for	the	Group	and	to	minimise	lead	times.	Over	the	last	few	years,	we	have	introduced	direct	
sourcing	from	China	and	achieved	a	better	buying	margin	as	a	result,	whilst	also	improving	the	quality	of	
our products. Costs remain tightly controlled with all expenditure carefully planned and monitored. With 
a	continued	increase	in	sales,	the	focus	has	shifted	to	process	efficiencies,	enabling	us	to	further	simplify	
the business. 
INFRASTRUCTURE
Appropriate deployment of information technology is vitally important to the success of our business and in 
enabling	the	establishment	of	a	multi-channel	shopping	environment.	The	project	to	create	the	framework	
for	multi-channel	is	due	to	complete	in	2014/15	and	we	have	commenced	a	project	to	upgrade	our	main	IT	
systems.
The	operational	efficiency	of	our	distribution	centre	based	in	Barking	is	closely	monitored.	Options	for	
improving	its	performance,	including	space	management,	are	continually	appraised	by	the	operations	
team to streamline the business.  6 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

reVieW OF OperatiOnS 
The	 Group	 has	 continued	 to	 make	 good	 progress	 through	 the	 year.	 A	 focus	 on	 brand	 development,	 product,	
operational	delivery	and	cost	control	has	enabled	us	to	grow	profits	ahead	of	market	expectations.	
MULTI-CHANNEL PROJECT
Our	previously	stated	project	to	implement	a	multi-channel	shopping	environment	for	our	customers	is	
nearing	completion.	The	new	Hire	website,	launched	in	November	2013,	marked	the	introduction	of	a	
single	customer	database	across	stores	and	on-line,	including	full	transaction	history	for	customers.	Our	
retail stores and websites will also be incorporated into multi-channel during 2014. Once completed this 
will	enable	customers	to	shop	for	retail	and	hire	across	a	range	of	channels	(in-store,	PC,	tablet,	mobile).	
Once	full	multi-channel	capability	is	in	place,	we	will	leverage	our	new	single	customer	database	using	
customer relationship management software tools so that we can focus customer communications on 
propositions that are relevant and appealing. An option for customers to receive their in store customer 
receipt	via	email	will	also	be	introduced.	As	well	as	improving	customer	convenience,	we	anticipate	that	
this	will	significantly	increase	email	collection	rates	and	therefore	associated	marketing	opportunities.	
RETAIL
We	have	continued	to	implement	operational	improvements	across	the	business,	continuing	our	
programme of streamlining the product range through stock management initiatives. These actions 
impacted	positively	on	the	like-for-like*	sales,	which	were	up	by	6.4%	on	the	previous	year	(2012/13:	4.1%).	
Christmas trading in particular was above expectations and year end residual stock levels were lower than 
in the previous year.
The gross margin performance was enhanced by consolidation into fewer suppliers and the gradual move 
to direct supply from the Far East.
We	opened	two	new	stores	in	the	UK	in	the	year,	as	planned,	and	closed	five	loss	making	stores.	We	are	
looking at a number of new store opening opportunities in the UK in the next 12 months. The Group now 
trades from 133 stores.
The	inherent	flexibility	in	our	property	estate	gives	us	options	in	what	we	anticipate	will	be	a	fast	changing	
retail	landscape.	43%	of	our	property	leases	are	due	for	renewal	within	the	next	36	months	and	the	
average lease length across the store portfolio is 53 months. There will be opportunities to improve terms 
on renewal in some cases. Unlike many high street retailers who are looking to actively reduce their 
store 	 footprint, 	 the 	 underpinning 	 of 	 Hire 	 and 	 the 	 demand 	 for 	 e-commerce 	 ‘click 	 & 	 collect’ 	 and 	 ‘click 
& 	 r e t u r n ’ 	points,	together	with	advantageous	lease	deals,	means	there	is	an	opportunity	to	expand	our	
store	footprint	on	a	selective	and	cost	effective	basis,	with	good	returns.
HIRE
As	reported	in	the	media	2013	was	a	difficult	year	for	the	wedding	hire	market.	This	may	have	been	due,	
in	part,	to	the	widely	reported	‘2013	effect’	of	customers	avoiding	an	unlucky	year,	although	there	is	no	
conclusive evidence of this. 
Overall	like-for-like	Hire	sales	fell	by	6.4%	in	the	year,	the	first	decline	for	a	number	of	years.	The	shortfall	
was	however	confined	to	weddings,	down	9.5%,	with	eveningwear,	Royal	Ascot	and	school	proms	up	3.2%.
We	are	confident	our	position	as	the	leading	hire	brand	will	be	maintained	through	the	product	and	
technology initiatives currently underway.

previous	year.	Online	sales	now	comprise	5.1%	of	total	sales	(2012/13:	1.7%).	A	new	retail	platform	was	
launched	in	January	2013,	including	nationwide	‘click	and	collect,’	and	has	seen	a	50%	improvement	in	
the buying conversion rate from visitors to the site since launch. The addition of a mobile enabled website 
in	May	2013	has	had	an	immediate	impact	on	enhancing	our	customer	offer.	Site	traffic,	conversion	and	
retention	rates	are	all	on	improving	trends	and	the	returns	rate	is	steady	at	20%.	E-commerce	has	also	
proved	to	be	a	very	efficient	means	of	clearing	end	of	lines	stock	with	faster	sell	through	rates	and	an	
improvement in prices achieved.
Expansion	into	international	markets	is	underway	with	dedicated	sites	launched	for	Eire,	Sweden,	
Denmark and Netherlands. Further territories are planned for 2014/15. 
E-commerce	will	play	a	key	role	in	maximising	the	benefits	to	be	derived	from	the	capability	to	trade	in	a	
fully multi-channel environment.
SUPPLY	CHAIN	AND	COSTS
The	earlier	clearance	of	residual	stocks	has	allowed	new	seasons	stock	to	be	introduced	to	stores	earlier,	
improving the customer offer and allowing much greater scope for tactical promotions. 
The increase in direct sourcing of stock from the Far East has increased our exposure to foreign exchange 
risk which is mitigated by the adoption of hedging.
PEOPLE
Investment	in	staff	training	in	the	form	of	recruitment,	induction,	performance	appraisal	and	performance	
management continues with a wider range of courses available and increased numbers of staff being 
trained.	Our	customer	insight	project	confirmed	that	excellent	customer	service	is	vitally	important	to	our	
customers,	particularly	given	our	intended	implementation	of	a	multi-channel	shopping	environment.	We	
have	strengthened	our	central	operations,	marketing,	e-commerce	and	merchandising	teams	in	2013.
Financial reVieW
The	improvement	across	the	business	continued	in	2013/14	with	good	like-for-like*	sales	growth	and	
continued	control	over	costs.	Underlying***	profit	before	taxation	and	exceptional	items	on	continuing	
operations	 was	 £4.4m,	 compared	 with	 a	 profit	 of	 £3.0m	 in	 the	 previous	 year,	 an	 increase	 of	 £1.4m	 including	
a	 net	 £0.4m	 credit	 in	 respect	 of	 provisions	 for	 onerous	 property	 lease	 contracts	 (2012/13:	 net	 £0.3m	 credit).
REVENUE
Despite	the	shortfall	on	Hire,	overall	revenue	was	up	4.3%	(up	4.2%	like-for-like*)	on	the	previous	year	to	
£109.1m.	Retail	was	up	6.2%	(up	6.4%	like-for-like*)	on	the	previous	year.	As	reported,	Hire	had	a	difficult

GROSS MARGIN
Underlying***	gross	margin	decreased	by	60	basis	points	in	the	year	(59.0%	vs	59.6%),	due	in	part	to	the

DIVIDEND
As	announced	on	14	January	2014,	given	the	strong	progress	made	in	2013/14	and	the	ongoing	cash	
generation	the	Board	feels	it	is	appropriate	to	propose	the	payment	of	a	final	dividend	of	4.7p	per	share	
(2012/13:	0.7	pence)	bringing	the	total	for	the	year	to	5.0p	per	share.	This	compares	with	0.9	pence	
per	share	for	the	year	ended	26	January	2013.	The	final	dividend	is	to	be	paid	on	26	June	2014	to	all	
shareholders	on	the	register	as	at	6	June	2014	(ex	dividend	date	4	June	2014).	
INVESTMENT
Total	capital	expenditure	in	the	year	was	£6.1m	(2012/13:	£5.5m)	and	depreciation	and	amortisation	was	
£4.9m	(2012/13:	£4.5m).	This	included	the	opening	of	two	new	stores	and	the	refurbishment	of	13	stores.	
The	total	capital	expenditure	included	further	investment	in	new	Moss	Bros	Hire	inventory	of	£1.6m	
(2012/13:	£1.4m),	whilst	depreciation	on	hire	inventory	was	£0.8m	(2012/13:	£0.9m).
CASH	AND	LIQUIDITY
The	year	end	cash	balance	was	£28.3m	compared	to	£25.7m	last	year.
INVENTORY
The	mix	of	inventory	in	the	business	was	re-geared	during	the	year	to	ensure	sufficient	inventory	is	
available to support sales across the business and as a consequence residual stocks at the year end were 
£0.3m	lower	than	the	previous	year.	
TRADE	AND	OTHER	PAYABLES
The	terms	and	conditions	with	our	suppliers	are	reviewed	and	adjusted	so	as	to	maximise	the	average	
cash	balance,	whilst	improving	the	product	gross	margin.
Future deVelOpMentS
The	Board	believes	Moss	Bros	has	an	exciting	future,	with	the	growth	of	e-commerce	underpinning	the	
move	to	multi-channel	retailing	in	2014/15.	The	adoption	of	Moss	Bros	as	the	master	brand,	supported	
by complementary sub-brands and introduction of carefully targeted marketing activity to maximise 
opportunities	to	grow	our	business	amongst	target	customers	represents	a	significant	opportunity. 
The	introduction	of	customer	relationship	management	(“CRM”)	following	the	full	implementation	of 
multi-channel in 2014/15 and the ongoing store refurbishment programme will further enhance the 
customer experience and perceptions of the brand. 
The	customer	insight	project,	undertaken	in	2013	revealed	significant	potential	for	the	Moss	Bros	brand.	
Although	Moss	Bros	is	seen	as	having	strong	heritage	and	suiting	expertise,	it	is	still	overwhelmingly	best	
known	as	a	hire	brand.	The	majority	of	men	do	not	initially	think	of	Moss	Bros	for	suit	purchase	and	many	
are	unaware	of	the	strength	of	our	3rd	party	brand	offering.	We	have	identified	the	key	drivers	of	our	brand	
and will implement a new annual brand tracking survey to monitor our progress against these critical 
factors.
There	is	clearly	an	opportunity	to	improve	our	profile	amongst	potential	retail	customers	and	we	plan	to	
develop and implement an improved marketing strategy to deliver this. “Moss Bros” is to be adopted as 
the	master	brand,	in	place	of	“Moss”,	and	our	sub-brands	(Ventuno,	Blazer	and	Dehavilland)	are	to	be	
re-aligned,	with	launch	planned	for	Autumn	2014.	“Moss	London”	will	replace	Ventuno,	“Moss	Esq.”	will	
replace	Dehavilland	and	“Moss	1851”	will	replace	Blazer.
Carefully targeted marketing activities will be introduced to support this initiative. 10 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

CHIEF	ExECUTIVE’S	REVIEW
CONTINUED
RETAIL
As	well	as	improving	the	brand	positioning	and	product	offering,	the	team	continues	the	project	to	
modernise	the	look	and	feel	of	core	Moss	Bros	stores.	We	now	have	36	‘new	look’	stores,	including	new	
store	openings,	relocations	or	refits.	The	wider	implementation	programme	is	being	prioritised	and	
coordinated to coincide with lease renewals so as to secure the best possible terms before committing 
expenditure.	We	are	planning	28	refits	in	2014/15.
HIRE
We will continue to leverage the opportunities to grow our market share through new distribution channels 
including	the	new	transactional	internet	site,	launched	in	November	2013,	which	marked	our	entry	into	
multi-channel,	and	which	has	seen	traffic	levels	above	expectations.	We	will	also	exploit	new	markets	and	
the continued growth of the School Proms hire market is very encouraging. New product areas such as the 
Ted	Baker	morning	suit,	launched	in	May	2013,	and	continued	investment	in	hire	stock	bodes	well	for	the	
future. 
Early	 season	 wedding	 bookings	 for	 2014	 have	 stabilised	 with	 like-for-like*	 sales	 down	 1.2%	 (after	 adjusting	
for	the	Easter	2013	effect)	and	the	month	of	March	has	seen	an	upturn	in	bookings	compared	to	last	year.	
It is too early to say if this upturn will be sustained but the business is in excellent shape to build market 
share.
Moss	Hire	also	offers	one	of	the	most	significant	opportunities	to	develop	our	customer	offering	by	
leveraging	the	rich	source	of	customer	data,	many	of	whom	are	currently	unaware	of,	or	do	not	consider	
the	Moss	Retail	offer.	We	believe	the	opportunities	for	CRM,	in	the	context	of	a	multi-channel	offer,	are	
significant.
E-COMMERCE
We plan to further exploit growth opportunities both in the UK and overseas through building on our 
success and leveraging the advantages that full multi-channel capability will bring. Additional websites for 
overseas markets are planned. 
SUPPLY	CHAIN	&	COSTS
Our	supply	chain	continues	to	be	of	significant	importance	in	delivering	service	and	efficiencies.	
We anticipate central costs will increase in line with turnover in 2014/15 as we increase our investment in 
marketing and our multi-channel capability.
Capital	expenditure	for	2014/15	is	estimated	at	£9.2m,	including	£5.6m	for	28	store	refits.	
INFRASTRUCTURE
Plans	are	in	place	to	upgrade	our	Point	of	Sale,	Stock	Control	and	DC	systems	in	2014/15.	Risk	has	been	
mitigated	through	upgrading	existing	systems,	rather	than	wholesale	replacement.	The	upgrade	is	largely	
cost neutral with lower annual maintenance costs offsetting higher depreciation charges. The upgrade 
project	will	involve	capital	expenditure	of	£0.8m	in	2014/15.	Additional	one	off	revenue	costs	of	£0.2m	will	
be incurred in 2014/15 and 2015/16 during the implementation period.
As	well	as	introducing	latest	technology,	the	upgrade	will	improve	business	efficiency	and	customer	
experience.
With	the	introduction	of	multichannel,	growth	of	e-commerce	and	shortening	of	product	lead	times	the	
efficiency	of	the	Distribution	Centre	is	central	to	our	ability	to	serve	our	customers.	The	investment	in	IT	in	
2014/15	will	underpin	the	operational	efficiencies	introduced	in	2013	and	enable	further	improvements	to	
be made.

OutlOOK
These	results	reflect	another	period	of	good	progress	for	the	Company.	
We continue to make good progress in the delivery of our strategic priorities. The modernisation of the 
store portfolio is achieving the anticipated returns and our plans for the implementation of a multi-channel  
shopping environment are on track. The decision to return to the master brand “Moss Bros” was supported  
by strong and compelling feedback from our customer insight programme and we look forward to the 
realignment and launch of our sub-brands in Autumn 2014. This research is helping us to prioritise how 
best to leverage the resonance the brand has with current and potential customers of all age groups.
Hire,	having	had	a	difficult	2013	for	wedding	related	hire,	is	showing	some	signs	of	some	recovery	and 
we are well placed to maximise revenues in the 2014 Wedding season. The early response to the 2014

the business. An assessment of these is shown below.

Hire the Hire business demands 
the highest  
level of customer service 
This is delivered through a 
highly	developed	and	efficient	
infrastructure which enables 
consistent	‘delivery	to	promise’.	
Any disruption to this 
infrastructure would affect our 
ability to maintain customer 
service levels.
We have a dedicated customer 
service team which actively 
seek to resolve any customer  
service issues arising. 
We are continually refreshing 
and replenishing our stock of 
hire garments to ensure we are 
able to cater for all occasions 
whenever they fall due.
The	risk	is	ongoing,	 
however we are better  
able to address customer 
service issues as we have 
expanded our customer service 
team during the year. 
We have opened up our market 
during the year through 
the introduction of a new 
transactional Hire website 
which went live in November 
2013 in preparation for the 2014 
weddings season.

Bespoke
Factors outside our  
control, such as an economic 
downturn affecting the uK, 
may have a material adverse 
effect on results 
As a retail business based and 
operating predominantly in the 
UK,	we	are	particularly	exposed	
to any economic downturn 
in the UK which could affect 
consumer	confidence	and	
therefore spending.
We continually focus on 
maintaining	our	product	quality,	
customer service and supplier 
relationships,	whilst	retaining	
our	competitive	position,	
including in value and pricing.
This risk has reduced during 
2013/14 through greater 
market development with 
cross-channel and 
geographical market expansion 
overseas. The current economic 
outlook is also generally 
perceived to be stronger than it 
was in 2012/13.
We have improved our product 
range with mix and match and 
package offerings appealing to 
all	levels	of	customer	profile.
e-commerce customer service is  
as important online  
as offline
Ease of navigation/ability to 
transact quickly on the website 
is key to generating sales 
online.
Keeping up with competitor 
offerings in being able to 
interact with the product 
online,	offering	product	choice	
and	availability,	and	allowing	
multiple payment and delivery 
options are key to growing our 
online presence.
Ensuring a secure online 
marketplace is also vital  
for customers to be able  
to transact safely.
We are continually developing 
our website offering in order to  
become fully multi-channel. 
Our	new	‘click	&	collect’	
Retail website which went 
live in January 2013 has 
seen	significant	increases	
in	customer	traffic	flow	and	
conversion rates from launch. 
We have implemented security 
policies,	rules	and	technical	
measures to protect customer 
data.
With the increase in trade 
through e-commerce and 
importance in our strategy of 
becoming	fully	multi-channel,	
the risk has increased during 
the year. 
The risk has been partly 
mitigated through the 
introduction of new and 
improved e-commerce 
channels. 14 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Brand image Maintaining our store 
presentation is important 
for attracting customers and

The historical underinvestment 
in the store estate in previous 
years has meant that some 
of our stores lack the level of 
presentation that we require 
to grow the business and the 
brand. 
We are undergoing a store 
redevelopment programme to 
both modernise the look and 
feel of the stores and to meet

progression of the store

costs cost price increases  
and currency fluctuation could 
have a materially adverse 
affect on results
A	fluctuation	in	currency	rates	
could materially affect the 
Group’s cost base and margins. 
Management has mitigated the 
cost	price	risk	as	a	significant	
proportion of inventory is 
direct sourced and prices have 
been agreed as a result of 
competitive tendering. 
In	addition,	the	Group	
operates a treasury policy 
which hedges the foreign 
exchange risk from such 
direct sourcing arrangements. 
Management closely monitor 
the effectiveness of these 
arrangements.
The risk is ongoing

Suppliers going out of business

comprised	Debbie	Hewitt	(MBA,	FCIPD)	and	Maurice	Helfgott	(MBA).	The	terms	of	reference	for	the	Audit	
Committee	provide	that	the	Chief	Executive	Officer	and	Finance	Director	are	invited	to	attend	the	meetings	
as appropriate. 
There	is	an	opportunity	for	any	employee,	in	confidence,	to	raise	any	concerns	with	management	about	
possible	impropriety	in	financial	or	other	matters	The	Company	has	established	an	internal	confidential	
helpline which is independent of line management.
The	 Board	 has	 delegated	 to	 the	 Audit	 Committee	 responsibility	 for	 ensuring	 the	 financial	 statements,	 when	
taken	as	a	whole,	are	fair,	balanced	and	understandable.	The	Audit	Committee	has	considered	all	matters	
brought to its attention during the year. The Audit Committee has also considered whether there were any 
areas	where	they	required	more	information	in	order	to	decide	if	the	annual	report	is	fair,	balanced	and	
reasonable and made arrangements for this information to be reported to them. The Committee met four 
times during the year and reported to the Board on all matters relating to the regulatory and accounting 
requirements	affecting	the	Group,	together	with	the	financial	reporting	and	internal	control	procedures	
including	the	annual	and	interim	financial	statements.	
In	addition,	the	Audit	Committee	ensures	that	an	objective	and	professional	relationship	is	maintained	with	
the external auditor. The external auditor may attend all meetings of the Audit Committee and have direct 
access to the Audit Committee and its Chairman.

internal	controls.	The	Committee’s	review	of	the	interim	and	full	year	financial	statements	focused	on	the	
following	key	areas	affecting	the	Group’s	financial	reporting:	
Valuation	of	property	plant	and	equipment	
The	estimated	useful	lives	of	non-current	assets	is	considered	to	be	a	key	area	of	judgement,	particularly	
given the nature of the business.
Valuation	of	inventory	and	related	provisions
Inventory	is	a	significant	value	on	the	Group’s	statement	of	financial	position	and	there	is	an	element	of	
judgement	relating	to	the	inventory	provision.
Measurement and accounting for share-based payments 
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered 
a	key	area	of	judgement.
Revenue recognition on hire and bespoke deposits
Revenue	is	deferred	until	collection	of	goods	arises.	The	movement	and	amount	deferred	is	significant	to	
the	financial	statements.	
Other	areas	of	focus	considered	by	the	Committee	were:
Onerous leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes.
Deferred taxation 
The	carrying	amount	of	deferred	tax	assets	are	reviewed	at	each	balance	sheet	date	and	a	judgement	
made	over	the	probability	of	there	being	sufficient	taxable	profits	arising	in	the	future	to	allow	all	or	part	of	
the asset to be recovered. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 23

CORPORATE	GOVERNANCE	REPORT
CONTINUED
Evaluation	of	the	Board’s	performance	has	been	conducted	through	individual	questionnaires,	followed	by	
a review of the output by the Board and an action plan of improvements. This includes a review of progress 
on	the	actions	agreed	in	the	previous	year’s	review,	a	review	of	the	individual	contribution	of	Non	Executives	
and a review of the Chairman.
APPOINTMENTS TO THE BOARD
Board	members	are	appointed	by	the	Board	on	the	recommendation	of	the	Nomination	Committee,	which	 
is	chaired	by	the	Chairman	and	consists	of	the	Non-Executive	Directors,	although	the	Chief	Executive	 
Officer	is	invited	to	meetings	as	appropriate.
Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and copies of the Non-Executive 
Directors’ letters of appointment with the Company are available from the Company Secretary.
TRAINING	AND	DEVELOPMENT
On	appointment	to	the	Board	and	to	any	Board	Committee,	every	Director	is	provided	with	appropriate	
induction and training to enable them to discharge their duties as a Director. Additional training may be 
sought as necessary.
The Board has conducted a review of its effectiveness and the effectiveness of each individual Director. 
The conclusions of the review have been presented to and discussed by the Board as a whole and actions 
resulting from this review will be kept under review during the forthcoming year. The Senior Independent 
Director 	 separately 	 reviews 	 the 	 performance 	 of 	 the 	 Chairman, 	 with 	 input 	 from 	 Executive 	 and 	 Non-Executive	
Directors.
RE-ELECTION
Subject	to	re-election	at	the	first	AGM	after	which	they	were	appointed,	Non-Executive	Directors	are	
appointed initially for a three year term. The Group will take into account the balance of skills and 
experience	on	the	Board,	their	contribution	and	level	of	independence	when	considering	whether	to	extend	
their appointment beyond the initial term. The Board may ask a Non-Executive Director to remain for a 
further term. The Non-Executive Directors’ contracts are terminable on three months’ notice and the 
Chairman’s on six months’ notice.

INFORMATION AND SUPPORT
All	Directors	have	access	to	the	advice	of	the	Company	Secretary,	who	is	responsible	to	the	Board	for	
ensuring that procedures are followed. In addition the Directors are able to seek appropriate independent

The	Board	takes	significant	measures	to	ensure	that	all	Board	members	are	kept	aware	of	both	the	views	
of	the	major	shareholders	and	changes	in	the	major	shareholdings	of	the	Group.
The	Board	ensures	two-way	communication	with	major	shareholders,	through	Broker	briefings	and	
feedback	from	the	Executive	Directors	following	meetings	with	major	shareholders.	The	Chairman	also	
meets	with	major	shareholders	on	a	regular	basis.	
AUDIT COMMITTEE AND AUDITORS
During	 the	 period	 ended	 25	 January	 2014,	 the	 Group’s	 external	 auditor,	 Deloitte	 LLP,	 provided	 advice	 to	 the	
Group.	The	fees	paid	to	Deloitte	for	non-audit	services	were	£6,000	(2012/13:	£22,000).	The	use	of	Deloitte	
LLP for non-audit work was carefully evaluated by the Audit Committee and the Board.
The	Audit	Committee	views	the	independence	and	objectivity	of	the	Group’s	auditor	as	essential	and	
ensures	that	Deloitte	is	not	instructed	on	any	issues	which	would	prejudice	this.	The	Audit	Committee	
obtains	written	confirmation	on	at	least	an	annual	basis	of	the	independence	of	the	external	auditor.
To	fulfil	its	responsibility	regarding	the	independence	of	the	external	auditor,	the	Audit	Committee	also	
reviewed:
•	 	 the	external	auditor’s	plan	for	the	current	year,	noting	the	role	of	the	senior	statutory	audit	partner,	
who	signs	the	audit	report	and	who,	in	accordance	with	professional	rules,	has	not	held	office	for	
more	than	five	years	(the	senior	statutory	audit	partner	has	held	office	for	three	years),	and	any	
changes	in	the	key	audit	staff;
•	 the	arrangements	for	day-to-day	management	of	the	audit	relationship;
•	 the	overall	extent	of	non-audit	services	provided	by	the	external	auditor;	and
•	 the	past	service	of	the	auditor	that	was	first	appointed	for	the	year	ended	31	January	2009.
It is also the Committee’s policy to consider every year whether there should be an audit tender process.
To	assess	the	effectiveness	of	the	external	auditor,	the	Audit	Committee	reviewed:
•	 the	arrangements	for	ensuring	the	external	auditor’s	independence	and	objectivity;
•	 the	external	auditor’s	fulfillment	of	the	agreed	audit	plan	and	any	variations	from	the	plan;
•	 	 the	robustness	and	perceptiveness	of	the	external	auditor	in	their	handling	of	the	key	accounting	and	
audit	judgements;	and
•	 the	content	of	the	external	auditor’s	reporting	on	internal	control.
accOuntaBilitY 
Each	person	who	is	a	Director	at	the	date	of	approval	of	this	Annual	Report	confirms	that:
•	 	 so	far	as	the	Director	is	aware,	there	is	no	relevant	audit	information	of	which	the	Company’s	auditor	
is	unaware;	and
•	 	 the	Director	has	taken	all	the	steps	that	he/she	ought	to	have	taken	as	a	Director	in	order	to	make	
himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
This	confirmation	is	given	and	should	be	interpreted	in	accordance	with	the	provisions	of	s418	of	the	Act.
Deloitte	LLP	have	expressed	their	willingness	to	continue	in	office	as	auditor	and	a	Resolution	to	 
re-appoint them will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 26 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

CORPORATE	GOVERNANCE	REPORT
CONTINUED
GOING CONCERN
The	Group’s	business	activities,	together	with	the	factors	likely	to	affect	its	future	development,	
performance and position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Business 
Review.	The	latter	describes	the	financial	position	of	the	Group,	its	cash	flows,	liquidity	position,	together	
with	the	Group’s	objectives,	key	risks	and	uncertainties.	The	Group’s	financial	risk	management	objectives	
and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk are described in note 24.
As	also	highlighted	in	note	24	to	the	financial	statements,	the	Group	meets	its	day-to-day	working	capital	
requirements through surplus cash balances. 
The Board of Directors has undertaken a recent thorough review of the Group’s budgets and forecasts and 
has	produced	detailed	cash	flow	projections,	which	take	account	of	reasonably	possible	changes	in	trading	
performance,	showing	that	the	Group	is	expected	to	operate	within	the	level	of	its	current	surplus	cash	
balances. 
After	making	enquiries,	the	Directors	have	a	reasonable	expectation	that	the	Group	and	Company	have	
adequate	resources	to	continue	in	operational	existence	for	the	foreseeable	future.	Accordingly,	they	
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Accounts for the 52 weeks 
ended 25 January 2014.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board has applied principle C.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code by establishing a continuous 
process	for	identifying,	evaluating	and	managing	the	significant	risks	the	Group	faces	and	for	determining	
the	nature	and	extent	of	the	significant	risks	it	is	willing	to	take	in	achieving	its	strategic	objectives.	The	
Board	regularly	reviews	the	process,	which	has	been	in	place	from	the	start	of	the	year	to	the	date	of	
approval of this report and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in 
October	2005	(the	Turnbull	Guidance).	The	Board	is	also	responsible	for	the	Group’s	system	of	internal	
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk	of	failure	to	achieve	business	objectives,	and	can	only	provide	reasonable	and	not	absolute	assurance	
against material misstatement or loss.
In	compliance	with	provision	C.2.1	of	the	UK	Corporate	Governance	Code,	the	Board	regularly	reviews	
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems. The Board’s monitoring 
covers	 all	 material	 controls,	 including	 financial,	 operational	 and	 compliance	 controls.	 It	 is	 based	 principally	
on	reviewing	reports	from	management	to	consider	whether	significant	risks	are	identified,	evaluated,	
managed	and	controlled	and	whether	any	significant	weaknesses	are	promptly	remedied	and	indicate	a	
need	for	more	extensive	monitoring.	The	Board	has	also	performed	a	specific	assessment	for	the	purpose	
of	this	annual	report.	This	assessment	considers	all	significant	aspects	of	risk	management	and	internal	
control arising during the period covered by the report including the work of internal audit. The audit 
committee assists the Board in discharging its review responsibilities.
During	the	course	of	its	review	of	the	risk	management	and	internal	control	systems,	the	Board	has	
not	identified	nor	been	advised	of	any	failings	or	weaknesses	which	it	has	determined	to	be	significant.	
Therefore	a	confirmation	in	respect	of	necessary	actions	has	not	been	considered	appropriate.
The Board recognises that no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against losses 
arising from mismanagement and that the Group’s systems must be designed to manage rather than 
eliminate	risk.	Internal	control	and	risk	management	is	an	ongoing	process	designed	to	identify,	evaluate	
and	manage	the	significant	risks	faced	by	the	Group.	The	system	of	internal	control	includes	internal	
financial	controls,	operational	procedures,	risk	management	and	compliance	matters.	The	system	has	
been in place throughout the period ended 25 January 2014 and up to the date of this Report.
The	significant	risks	the	Board	has	identified	are	detailed	in	the	Chief	Executive’s	Business	Review. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 27

During the period the Board has reviewed the adequacy of the current internal audit department in 
accordance	with	the	Code.	In	view	of	the	size	and	scale	of	the	Group,	the	Board	decided	it	was	not	
appropriate to expand the current scope of the internal audit function which focuses on inventory and cash 
control.
The Group’s work to review the risk management structure and ensure a robust mechanism is in place for 
logging and monitoring risks continues.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
IN	RESPECT	OF	THE	ANNUAL	REPORT,	THE	DIRECTORS’	REMUNERATION	REPORT	AND	THE	
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	preparing	the	Annual	Report,	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	and	
the	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	law	and	regulations.
Company	law	requires	the	Directors	to	prepare	financial	statements	for	each	financial	year.	Under	that	
law	the	Directors	are	required	to	prepare	the	group	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	International	
Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union	and	Article	4	of	the	IAS	
Regulation	 and	 have	 chosen	 to	 prepare	 the	 parent	 company	 financial	 statements	 in	 accordance	 with	 United	
Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice	(United	Kingdom	Accounting	Standards	and	applicable	
law).	Under	company	law	the	directors	must	not	approve	the	accounts	unless	they	are	satisfied	that	they	
give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	affairs	of	the	company	and	of	the	profit	or	loss	of	the	company	for	
that period.
In	preparing	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	the	Directors	are	required	to:
•	 select	suitable	accounting	policies	and	then	apply	them	consistently;
•	 make	judgements	and	accounting	estimates	that	are	reasonable	and	prudent;
•	 	 state	whether	applicable	UK	Accounting	Standards	have	been	followed,	subject	to	any	material	
departures	disclosed	and	explained	in	the	financial	statements;	and
•	 	 prepare	the	financial	statements	on	the	going	concern	basis	unless	it	is	inappropriate	to	presume	
that the company will continue in business.
In	preparing	the	group	financial	statements,	International	Accounting	Standard	1	requires	that	Directors:
•	 properly	select	and	apply	accounting	policies;
•	 	 present	information	including	accounting	policies,	in	a	manner	that	provides	relevant,	reliable,	
comparable	and	understandable	information;
•	 	 provide	additional	disclosures	when	compliance	with	the	specific	requirements	in	IFRSs	are	
insufficient	to	enable	users	to	understand	the	impact	of	particular	transactions,	other	events	and	
conditions	on	the	entity’s	financial	position	and	financial	performance;	and
•	 make	an	assessment	of	the	company’s	ability	to	continue	as	a	going	concern.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	keeping	adequate	accounting	records	that	are	sufficient	to	show	and	
explain	the	company’s	transactions	and	disclose	with	reasonable	accuracy	at	any	time	the	financial	
position	of	the	company	and	enable	them	to	ensure	that	the	financial	statements	comply	with	the	
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The	Directors	are	responsible	for	the	maintenance	and	integrity	of	the	corporate	and	financial	information	
included on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination	of	financial	statements	may	differ	from	legislation	in	other	jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY	STATEMENT
We	confirm	that	to	the	best	of	our	knowledge:
•	 	 the	 financial	 statements,	 prepared	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 relevant	 financial	 reporting	 framework,	 give	
a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	assets,	liabilities,	financial	position	and	profit	or	loss	of	the	company	and

ANNUAL STATEMENT ON DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION
Dear	Shareholder,
I am pleased to present the Directors’ remuneration report for the year ended 25 January 2014. This is the 
first	report	under	the	new	Remuneration	Reporting	Regulations.
This has been a busy period for the Committee. We have taken the opportunity to review all aspects of 
our	Remuneration	Policy,	ensuring	we	retain	our	overall	philosophy	of	adopting	clear	and	simple	market	
competitive remuneration and incentive schemes. The alignment of executive remuneration structures 
with	 the	 objectives	 of	 the	 shareholders	 has	 been	 the	 principal	 focus,	 ensuring	 remuneration	 structures	 are	
fully attuned to the business strategy. 
In	this	Annual	Statement,	which	precedes	our	Directors’	Remuneration	Policy	and	Annual	Report	on	
Remuneration,	I	have	summarised	our	performance	in	2013/14,	and	how	this	relates	to	remuneration	
decisions and outcomes. 
In	2013/14,	performance	has	continued	to	improve.	Despite	a	generally	challenging	market,	we	have	
remained	focused	on	establishing	a	clear	brand	strategy	leveraging	the	Moss	Bros	brand,	strong	
development	of	our	e-commerce	proposition,	successful	store	refits,	and	the	delivery	of	other	strategic	
objectives	such	as	a	shift	to	more	direct	sourcing.	All	of	these	have	helped	to	accelerate	our	trading	
performance.	 In	 addition,	 careful	 management	 of	 stock,	 a	 good	 Christmas	 trading	 performance	 and	 strong	
cash	generation,	all	contributed	to	Moss	Bros	continuing	to	deliver	a	robust	financial	performance	with	
annual	pre-tax	profit	growth	of	48.5%	and	the	adoption	of	an	enhanced	dividend	payment.
This	level	of	performance	has	been	reflected	in	the	performance-related	elements	of	Moss	Bros’	
remuneration. The Annual Bonus for 2013/14 was based entirely on the satisfaction of stretching Pre-Tax 
Profit	targets,	and	performance	over	the	year	resulted	in	55%	of	the	maximum	bonus	opportunity	being	
paid	to	our	Executive	Directors.	In	addition,	the	strong	growth	in	adjusted	EBITDA	over	the	last	five	years	
from	£1.3m	in	2009/10	to	£9.2m	in	2013/14	will	result	in	the	remaining	tranche	of	the	2009/15	LTIP	award	
vesting to Executive Directors.
Looking	forward,	the	Committee	intends	to	keep	broadly	the	same	incentive	structure	in	2014/15,	but	will	
introduce	strategic	performance	objectives	to	the	annual	bonus	alongside	the	current	profit	targets.	These	
objectives	will	include	development	of	our	Hire	strategy,	e-commerce	growth	and	brand	and	customer	
satisfaction	tracking.	It	will	determine	up	to	half	of	any	bonus	payment.	As	in	prior	years,	the	bonus	will	
continue	to	be	self-funding	and	as	such,	no	bonus	will	be	payable	if	the	minimum	profit	target	is	not	met.	
This	will	ensure	that	the	annual	bonus	continues	to	focus	on	financial	performance,	but	also	provides	an	
incentive	to	achieve	key	strategic	objectives.
In	relation	to	the	LTIP,	the	Committee	intends	to	make	awards	to	Executive	Directors	which	will	vest	after	
3-years	if	a	demanding	PBT	performance	target	is	satisfied,	with	capital	return	conditions	too.	
The	Committee	has	also	approved	two	changes	to	the	operation	of	our	remuneration	policy:
•	 	 The	introduction	of	clawback	provisions	to	the	annual	bonus	and	LTIP	starting	within	the	2014/15	
annual	bonus	and	LTIP	awards	granted	in	2014/15	financial	year;	
•	 	 The	 introduction	 of	 a	 two	 year	 holding	 period	 for	 Executive	 Directors	 for	 any	 awards	 which	 are	 granted	
from	1	April	2014.	This	means	that	the	first	awards	subject	to	this	holding	period	will	be	the	LTIP	
awards	granted	in	the	2014/15	financial	year.
The Committee believes that these two changes will help increase the long-term alignment of our 
executives’	interests	with	those	of	shareholders,	which	is	one	of	the	aims	of	our	remuneration	policy. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 31

Finally,	as	a	result	of	the	new	regulations	on	Remuneration,	this	is	the	first	year	in	which	Moss	Bros’	
Directors	Remuneration	Report	is	split	in	three	sections,	namely,	this	Annual	Statement,	the	Directors’	
Remuneration	Policy,	and	the	Annual	Report	on	Remuneration.	At	the	2014	Annual	General	Meeting,	
the	Directors’	Remuneration	Policy	will	be	put	to	a	binding	shareholder	vote,	which	will	mean	that	the	
Remuneration Committee is not permitted to deviate from the approved policy for three years unless it 
gains	 shareholder	 approval	 for	 an	 amended	 policy.	 At	 the	 same	 meeting,	 the	 Annual	 Statement	 and	 Annual	
Report on Remuneration will be put to an advisory vote which provides shareholders with the opportunity 
to voice their opinions on how the Committee has implemented the remuneration policy.
2013/14	was	another	good	year	of	progress	for	Moss	Bros	and,	in	this	context,	we	look	forward	to	receiving	
your support on our approach to Remuneration at the Annual General Meeting.

DIRECTORS’	REMUNERATION	POLICY
The Remuneration Committee determines the Company’s policy on the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and other senior executives. The principles which underpin the remuneration policy for the 
Company	are	to:
•	 	 ensure	Executive	Directors’	rewards	and	incentives	are	directly	aligned	with	the	interests	of	the	
shareholders	in	order	to	reinforce	the	strategic	priorities	of	the	Group,	optimise	the	performance	
of	the	Group	and	create	sustained	growth	in	shareholder	value,	without	encouragement	to	take	
excessive	undue	risk;
•	 	 provide	the	level	of	remuneration	required	to	attract,	retain	and	motivate	Executive	Directors	of	an	
appropriate	calibre;
•	 	 ensure	a	proper	balance	of	fixed	and	variable	performance	related	components,	linked	to	short	and	
longer-term	objectives;	and
•	 reflect	market	competitiveness,	taking	account	of	the	total	value	of	all	the	benefit	elements.
Remuneration	for	the	Executive	Directors	is	structured	so	that	the	variable	pay	element	(annual	bonus	
and	long-term	incentives)	forms	a	significant	proportion	of	the	overall	package.	This	provides	a	strong	
link between the remuneration paid to Executive Directors and the performance of the Company. This also 
provides	a	strong	alignment	of	interest	between	the	Executive	Directors	and	shareholders	(particularly	as	
part	of	the	annual	bonus	and	all	of	the	long-term	incentive	is	payable	in	the	form	of	shares).
It	is	intended	that	for	the	purposes	of	section	226D(6)(b)	of	the	Companies	Act	2006	this	policy	will	take	
effect from the date of the 2014 AGM which is scheduled to be held on 23 May 2014.

CHOICE OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND TARGET SETTING
For	the	annual	bonus	and	long-term	incentive,	our	policy	is	to	choose	performance	measures	which	help	
drive	and	reward	the	achievement	of	our	strategy,	and	also	provide	alignment	between	employees	and	
shareholders.	The	Committee	reviews	metrics	each	year	to	ensure	they	remain	appropriate	and	reflect	the	
future strategic direction of the Group.
Targets for each performance measure are set by the Committee with reference to internal plans and 
external	expectations.	Performance	is	generally	measured	on	a	‘sliding	scale’	so	that	incentive	payouts	
increase pro-rata for levels of performance in between the threshold and maximum performance targets.
Performance measures and targets are disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration. In cases where 
targets	 are	 commercially	 sensitive,	 for	 example	 annual	 profit	 targets	 for	 the	 annual	 bonus,	 they	 will	 only	 be	
disclosed retrospectively.
DIFFERENCES	IN	PAY	POLICY	FOR	EMPLOYEES	AND	ExECUTIVE	DIRECTORS
No	element	of	the	Executive	Director	remuneration	policy	is	operated	exclusively	for	Executive	Directors,	
and,	as	stated	in	the	introduction	to	this	Policy	Report	on	page	32,	the	principles	applied	to	the	
remuneration of Executive Directors are the same as those for the Company. The difference between pay 
for Executive Directors and employees is that Executive Director pay is structured so that the variable pay 
element	forms	a	significant	proportion	of	the	overall	package	and	the	total	remuneration	opportunity	is	
higher	to	reflect	the	increased	responsibility	of	the	role. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 35

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2012/13 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
ExECUTIVE	SHAREHOLDING	GUIDELINES
In	any	event,	50%	of	the	value	awarded	as	part	of	the	annual	bonus	scheme	will	be	awarded	as	deferred	
shares,	to	be	held	for	a	period	of	no	less	than	three	years,	and	shares	vesting	under	the	LTIP	scheme,	if	
exercised,	to	be	held	for	a	minimum	of	two	years	after	the	vesting	date.	
Furthermore,	to	encourage	executives	to	use	vested	LTIP	shares	to	build	and	maintain	a	significant	
shareholding,	executives	are	required	to	retain	all	of	the	post-tax	number	of	shares	until	a	minimum	
shareholding has been achieved. 
Executives	who	receive	a	long-term	incentive	award	which	exceeds	50%	of	salary	are	expected	to	build	a	
holding	equal	in	value	to	100%	of	salary,	before	they	are	allowed	to	sell	the	vested	shares.	Executives	who	
receive	an	award	of	50%	of	salary	are	expected	to	build	a	holding	of	50%	of	salary,	along	the	same	lines	
as	above.	Executives	who	receive	an	award	below	50%	of	salary	are	expected	to	build	a	holding	of	15%	of	
salary,	along	the	same	lines	as	above.
For	the	purpose	of	this	calculation,	the	value	of	shares	is	calculated	using	the	higher	of	their	acquisition	
price and current market price.

Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are 
determined by the Board within the limits  
set by the Articles of Association and  
are based on information on fees paid in 
similar companies taking into account  
the experience of the individuals and the 
relative time commitments involved.
Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are 
reviewed in alternate years.
Current fee levels 
are set out in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration.
Overall fee limit  
will be within the 
limit set out in the

Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements nor do they

Note	 that	 clothing	 allowance	 benefit	 which	 is	 available	 to	 Debbie	 Hewitt	 was	 withdrawn	 for	 newly	 appointed	
Non-Executive Directors from 2010/11 onwards.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT
The principle applied in recruitment of a new Director is for the remuneration package to be set in 
accordance with the terms of the approved remuneration policy for existing directors in force at the 
time	of	appointment.	In	addition,	the	Committee	may	offer	additional	cash	and/or	share-based	‘buy	out’	
awards	when	it	considers	these	to	be	in	the	best	interests	of	the	Company	and,	therefore,	shareholders,	
including	awards	made	under	Listing	Rule	9.4.2	R.	Any	such	‘buy	out’	payments	would	be	based	solely	
on	remuneration	lost	when	leaving	the	former	employer	and	would	reflect	the	delivery	mechanism	(i.e.	
cash,	shares,	options),	time	horizons	and	performance	requirements	attaching	to	that	remuneration.	
Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.
As	 a	 result	 of	 this	 policy,	 the	 maximum	 ongoing	 variable	 remuneration	 (i.e.	 excluding	 buyout	 awards)	 which	
could	be	granted	to	a	new	executive	Director	is	200%	of	salary. 36 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2012/13 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
DIRECTORS’	REMUNERATION	POLICY
CONTINUED
In	the	case	of	an	internal	appointment,	any	variable	pay	element	awarded	in	respect	of	the	prior	role	
may	be	allowed	to	pay	out	according	to	its	terms	on	grant,	adjusted	as	relevant	to	take	into	account	the	
appointment.	In	addition,	any	other	ongoing	remuneration	obligations	existing	prior	to	appointment	
may	continue,	provided	that	they	are	put	to	shareholders	for	approval	at	the	first	AGM	following	their	
appointment.
Other	aspects	of	our	recruitment	policy	include:
•	 	 Where	it	is	appropriate	to	offer	a	below	median	salary	initially,	a	series	of	increases	to	the	desired	
salary	positioning	may	be	given	over	the	proceeding	few	years	subject	to	individual	performance	and	
experience in role.
•	 	 Different	performance	measures	may	be	set	initially	for	the	annual	bonus,	taking	into	account	the	
responsibilities	of	the	individual,	and	the	point	in	the	financial	year	that	they	joined.
•	 A	new	Director	may	receive	fees	for	professional	advice	as	appropriate.
•	 A	new	Director	may	receive	relocation	assistance	if	applicable.
POLICY	ON	PAYMENT	FOR	LOSS	OF	OFFICE
Elements	of	fixed	remuneration	are	treated	as	follows:	
Upon	termination	by	either	party	the	Executive	Directors	are	entitled	to	salary	and	benefits	for	the	duration	
of the notice period. It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to seek to mitigate termination 
payments. 
In	addition,	the	Company	can	make	a	payment	in	lieu	of	notice	equal	to	base	salary	that	would	have	been	
paid	over	the	notice	period.	In	addition,	any	statutory	entitlements	or	sums	to	settle	or	compromise	claims	
in connection with the termination would be paid as necessary.
Elements	of	variable	remuneration	would	be	treated	as	follows:
Annual bonus
Under	the	Annual	Incentive	Plan,	an	employee	who	ceases	employment	or	is	under	notice	prior	to	the	
payment	of	bonus	typically	will	not	receive	any	payment.	However,	the	Committee	has	discretion,	where	an	
individual	is	considered	a	‘good	leaver’,	to	make	a	bonus	payment,	payable	in	cash,	but	pro-rated	for	the	
period	of	time	served	from	the	start	of	the	financial	year	to	the	date	of	termination	and	not	for	any	period	
in	lieu	of	notice	or	garden	leave.	Any	such	bonus	payment	typically	would	be	subject	to	the	normal	bonus	
targets,	tested	at	the	end	of	the	year,	and	would	take	into	account	performance	over	the	notice	period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
Under	the	LTIP,	unvested	awards	will	normally	lapse	upon	cessation	of	employment.	However,	in	line	with	
the	plan	rules,	the	Committee	has	discretion,	where	an	individual	is	considered	a	‘good	leaver’,	to	allow	
awards	to	vest	at	the	normal	vesting	date,	or	earlier.	If	the	Committee	exercises	this	discretion,	awards	
are	normally	pro-rated	to	reflect	time	served	since	the	date	of	grant	and	based	on	the	achievement	of	the	
performance criteria.
SAYE
The Executive Directors participate on the same basis as for other employees.
APPROACH	TO	SERVICE	CONTRACTS	AND	LETTERS	OF	APPOINTMENT
The Committee’s policy is to offer service contracts for Executive Directors with notice periods of six to 
twelve	months.	In	addition,	the	Executive	Directors	are	subject	to	a	six	month	non-compete	clause	from	
the date of termination.
For	the	Chairman,	appointment	is	terminable	on	six	months’	notice.	All	other	Non-Executive	Directors’	
appointments are terminable on three months’ notice on either side.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 37

STATEMENT	OF	CONSIDERATION	OF	EMPLOYMENT	CONDITIONS	ELSEWHERE	IN	THE	GROUP
The Moss Bros Remuneration Committee does not consult directly with employees when determining 
remuneration	policy	for	Executive	Directors.	However,	remuneration	and	pay	increases	across	the	Group	
are taken into account when setting pay levels for Directors.
STATEMENT	OF	CONSIDERATION	OF	SHAREHOLDER	VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the AGM each 
year.	When	any	material	changes	are	proposed	to	the	remuneration	policy,	the	Remuneration	Committee	
Chairman	will	inform	major	shareholders	in	advance,	and	will	generally	offer	a	meeting	to	discuss	these.	
KEY	AREAS	OF	DISCRETION
Finally,	we	have	chosen	to	highlight	key	areas	of	discretion	in	the	application	of	our	remuneration	policy.	
These	discretions	are	implicit	in	the	policy	stated	above,	but	we	have	listed	them	for	clarity.	Key	areas	of	
discretion	include,	but	are	not	limited	to:
•	 Whether	annual	bonus	is	paid	to	Executives	once	notice	has	been	served;
•	 	 Discretion	in	exceptional	circumstances	to	amend	previously	set	annual	incentive	targets	or	to	adjust	
the proposed payout to ensure a fair and appropriate outcome.
•	 	 Certain	decisions	relating	to	the	Long-Term	Incentive	Plan	awards	for	which	the	Committee	
has discretion as set out in the rules of the relevant share plans which have been approved by 
shareholders. 
•	 The	decisions	on	exercise	of	malus	and/or	clawback	rights.
LEGACY	ARRANGEMENTS
For	 the	 avoidance	 of	 doubt,	 in	 approving	 this	 Policy	 Report,	 authority	 is	 given	 to	 the	 Company	 to	 honour	 any	
commitments entered into with current or former Directors before the current legislation on remuneration 
policies	came	into	force	or	before	an	individual	became	a	director	(such	as	the	payment	outstanding	
incentive	awards,	and	clothing	allowance	for	Directors)	even	where	it	is	not	consistent	with	the	policy	
prevailing	at	the	time	such	commitment	is	fulfilled.	Details	of	any	payments	to	former	Directors	will	be	set	
out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise. 
ExTERNAL	DIRECTORSHIPS	FOR	ExECUTIVE	DIRECTORS
The	Company	believes	that	there	are	benefits	to	the	Company	and	for	Executive	Directors	accepting	
non-executive directorships in other organisations. Executive Directors may accept one non-executive 
directorship	with	the	prior	agreement	of	the	Board	provided	it	does	not	conflict	with	the	Group’s	interests	
and the time commitment does not impact upon the Executive Director’s performance. The Executive 
Directors may retain the fees from their external directorship.
In	the	case	of	the	CEO,	the	Committee	has	approved	two	non-executive	directorships,	which	were	held	
prior	to	him	joining	the	Board.	These	are	unpaid	and	in	the	view	of	the	Committee,	they	are	not	overly	
burdensome on his time. The Committee keeps this under review and reserves the right to ask him to 
step	down	from	one	or	both	if	time	commitments	require	him	to	do	so.	In	any	case,	no	Executive	Director,	
including the CEO would be allowed more than one paid Non-Executive Directorship.
Details of outside directorships held by the Executive Directors and any fees that they received are provided 
on page 41 of the Annual Report on Remuneration. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 39

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This	part	of	the	report	has	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	Part	3	of	The	Large	and	Medium-sized	
Companies	and	Groups	(Accounts	and	Reports)	(Amendment)	Regulations	2013	and	[9.8.8R]	of	the	Listing	
Rules. The Annual Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM which 
is scheduled to be held on 23 May 2014. The information on pages 39 to 49 has been audited.
IMPLEMENTATION	OF	REMUNERATION	POLICY	IN	2014/15
Executive Directors’ Base Salaries
The	Remuneration	Committee	has	awarded	modest	cost	of	living	salary	increases	of	3%	for	the	
forthcoming	year	which	reflect	the	general	level	of	increase	given	to	employees	across	the	business,	and	
are	considered	to	be	at	the	median	for	equivalent	roles	in	other	retailers	of	a	similar	size.	With	effect	from	
1	February	2013,	these	increases	will	take	Brian	Brick’s	base	salary	from	£292,125	to	£301,000	and	Robin	
Piggott’s	base	salary	from	£189,625	to	£195,400.
Pension	and	Benefits
There	will	be	no	changes	to	pension	or	benefits	provision.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus in 2014/15 will be consistent with the policy detailed in the Policy Report in terms of the 
maximum	bonus	opportunity,	and	performance	measures	will	be	based	50%	on	the	achievement	of	PBT	
targets,	whilst	the	remainder	will	be	based	on	the	achievement	of	strategic	objectives.	To	ensure	that	the	
bonus	is	self-funding,	no	bonus	will	be	payable	if	the	minimum	PBT	target	is	not	met.
PBT targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2016/17 Annual Report on Remuneration. Strategic 
objectives	together	with	the	level	of	performance	against	each	objective,	will	be	disclosed	in	the	2014/15	
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Clawback will apply to any 2014/15 bonus payments. 
Long-term	Incentive	Plan	(LTIP)
Awards	will	be	made	under	the	LTIP	in	April	2014	on	the	same	terms	as	set	out	in	the	policy	table,	and	so	
will	be	subject	to	the	new	clawback	provisions	and	the	two	year	holding	period.	For	Brian	Brick	and	Robin	
Piggott	this	award	will	be	equivalent	to	100%	and	70%	of	salary	respectively.	The	performance	condition	is	
anticipated	to	be	as	follows:	
award 2014/15 award
Performance measure Cumulative	Profit	Before	Tax
Start of performance period 26/01/2014
End of performance period 28/01/2017
Target	for	25%	vesting £15.5m
Target	for	50%	vesting £16.5m
Target	for	75%	vesting £17.5m
Target	for	100%	vesting £18.0m
Cumulative	Profit	Before	Tax	for	these	purposes	means	operating	profit	after	any	charges	arising	from	the	
LTIP	and	it	would	exclude	exceptional	profits,	onerous	lease	provision	release,	interest,	movement	in	hire	
deposits and other material accruals unless the Remuneration Committee considers them appropriate to 
include.
Note	that	the	Committee	may	adjust	the	targets	in	order	to	neutralise	the	effect	of	any	changes	to	the	
capital base. 40 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

All	awards	granted	under	the	LTIP	are	subject	to	continued	employment	and	the	satisfaction	of	the	
performance conditions set out below. All awards have a nil exercise price.
2009-2015 Award
The	first	award	was	granted	under	the	LTIP	in	2009.	This	award	may	vest	in	any	financial	year,	
commencing	with	the	financial	year	ended	of	grant	date,	up	to	a	six	year	period	ending	with	the	financial	
year	ended	January	2015,	subject	to	the	satisfaction	of	challenging	EBITDA	performance	thresholds	and	
the	requirement	for	continued	employment.	If	the	targets	are	not	achieved	during	the	six	year	period,	the	
award will lapse. 
The performance period for this LTIP award was extended to a six year scheme following the disposal of 
Hugo	Boss	and	Cecil	Gee,	to	reflect	the	extra	degree	of	stretch	in	the	targets	that	had	been	set	with	the	
loss	of	the	trading	profits	from	these	disposals. 44 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
CONTINUED
The	performance	conditions	for	these	awards	are	assessed	each	year	against	the	following	EBITDA	range,	
with	progressive	vesting	as	follows:
(i)	 	 the	first	50%	of	the	award	will	vest	if	the	EBITDA	for	the	Company	is	equal	to	or	greater	than	 
£3	million	for	any	financial	year	in	the	performance	period;
(ii)	 	 the	next	25%	of	the	award	will	vest	if	the	EBITDA	for	the	Company	is	equal	to	or	greater	than	 
£5	million	for	any	financial	year	in	the	performance	period;	and
(iii)	 	 the	final	25%	of	the	award	will	vest	if	the	EBITDA	for	the	Company	is	equal	to	or	greater	than	 
£9	million	for	any	financial	year	in	the	performance	period.
EBITDA	for	these	purposes	means	Earnings	before	Interest,	Taxation,	Depreciation	(including,	for	the	sake	
of	clarity,	depreciation	of	hire	inventory)	and	Amortisation,	excluding	the	effects	of	Exceptional	Items	and	
after any charges arising from the LTIP.
Awards	will	only	vest	if	the	Remuneration	Committee	is	satisfied	that:
(i)	 	 the	EBITDA	performance	for	the	relevant	financial	year	is	reflective	of	the	long-term	underlying	
financial	performance	of	the	Company	(taking	into	account	expected	future	financial	performance	of	
the	Company);
(ii)	 	 the	Company’s	Profit	Before	Taxation	for	the	relevant	financial	year	is	consistent	with	the	calculation	
of	the	relevant	EBITDA	figure;	and
(iii)	 	 the	Company	has	instituted	a	regular	dividend	payment	(or	the	Board	has	unanimously	determined	
that,	although	retained	earnings	are	considered	sufficient	to	commence	the	payment	of	dividends	
under	a	regular	dividend	policy,	dividends	should	not	be	paid	and	instead	retained	earnings	should	be	
used	for	other	purposes).
EBITDA	was	chosen	as	the	performance	metric	as	it	provides	a	strong	focus	on	the	level	of	profitability	
at	an	operating	level.	The	Committee	will	ensure	that	a	consistent	approach	(in	line	with	our	principal	
accounting	policies)	is	taken	in	relation	to	its	calculation.
Grant levels for the initial awards have been determined to take account of the need to provide a retentive 
and long-term focus to remuneration policy for the senior executive team. EBITDA at the levels required 
represents	a	sustained	and	significant	improvement	in	Company’s	performance	which	would	add	
significant	shareholder	value.
In	line	with	the	Company’s	performance	in	2011/12	and	the	achievement	of	the	£5	million	EBITDA	
threshold,	75%	of	this	Award	vested	to	participants	in	March	2012.	The	remaining	25%	will	vest	in	
March	2014	as	2013/14	EBITDA	for	the	Company	was	equal	to	£9.2	million,	which	was	greater	than	the	
performance	target	of	£9	million.
2012-2015 Award
An	LTIP	award	for	members	of	the	Executive	Management	Team	(including	Executive	Directors)	with	a	
performance	period	covering	the	three	financial	years	ending	January	2015	was	made	in	April	2012.	The	
award was based on a number of ordinary shares in the Company issued in the future at a nil exercise 
price,	subject	to	the	satisfaction	of	challenging	performance	conditions	and	the	requirement	for	continued	
employment.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 45

Recognising	the	improvement	in	the	level	and	stability	of	the	Company’s	profitability	the	Committee	
considered	that	the	performance	condition	should	be	based	on	PBT	(as	opposed	to	EBITDA).	PBT	for	these	
purposes	means	operating	profit	after	any	charges	arising	from	the	LTIP	and	it	will	exclude	exceptional	
profits,	onerous	lease	provision	release,	interest,	movement	in	Hire	Deposits	and	other	material	accruals,	
unless	the	Remuneration	Committee	considers	them	appropriate	to	include.	The	targets	may	be	adjusted	
in order to neutralise the effect of any changes to the capital base.
Depending	on	the	Company’s	cumulative	PBT	performance	during	the	three	year	performance	period,	the	
following	percentages	of	the	award	will	vest:
(i)	 25%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£7.9m
(ii)	 50%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£8.4m
(iii)	 75%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£8.9m
(iv)	 100%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£10.5m
Awards	will	only	vest	if	the	Remuneration	Committee	is	satisfied	that:
(i)	 	 the	PBT	performance	for	the	relevant	financial	year	is	reflective	of	the	long-term	underlying	financial	
performance	of	the	Company	(taking	into	account	expected	future	financial	performance	of	the	
Company);
(ii)	 	 the	Company	has	maintained	a	regular	dividend	payment	(or	the	Board	has	unanimously	determined	
that,	although	retained	earnings	are	considered	sufficient	to	continue	the	payment	of	dividends	under	
a	regular	dividend	policy,	dividends	should	not	be	paid	and	instead	retained	earnings	should	be	used	
for	other	purposes).
2013-2016 Award
The Remuneration Committee has approved a new LTIP award for members of the Executive Management 
Team	 (including	 Executive	 Directors)	 which	 was	 made	 in	 April	 2013	 with	 a	 performance	 period	 covering	 the	
three	financial	years	ending	January	2016.	The	award	will	be	based	on	a	number	of	ordinary	shares	in	the	
Company	issued	in	the	future	at	a	nil	exercise	price,	subject	to	continued	employment,	regular	dividend	
payments	and	consistent	underlying	profit	performance.	
For	Brian	Brick	and	Robin	Piggott	this	award	is	equivalent	to	100%	and	70%	of	salary	respectively.	
The Remuneration Committee considered that the performance condition should again be based on 
PBT;	PBT	for	these	purposes	to	have	the	same	definition	as	for	the	April	2012	Award.	The	targets	may	be	
adjusted	in	order	to	neutralise	the	effect	of	any	changes	to	the	capital	base.
The	Committee	did	consider	the	inclusion	of	measures	like	TSR,	but	given	the	stage	of	the	Company’s	
turnaround,	the	Company’s	scale	and	the	absence	of	direct	competitors	in	this	market,	the	Committee	
felt	that	for	the	current	time	PBT	was	an	appropriate	measure.	Furthermore,	by	making	it	a	cumulative	
measure,	it	would	avoid	a	windfall	from	the	performance	of	one	particular	year	and	therefore	promotes	
reward for a more progressive growth pattern. 
Depending	on	the	Company’s	cumulative	PBT	performance	during	the	three	year	performance	period,	the	
following	percentages	of	the	award	will	vest:
(i)	 25%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£12.0m
(ii)	 50%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£13.0m
(iii)	 75%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£14.0m
(iv)	 100%	will	vest	if	the	business	achieves	a	cumulative	PBT	of	£15.9m 46 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF MOSS BROS GROUP PLC
OPINION ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF MOSS BROS GROUP PLC
In	our	opinion:
•	 	 the	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	state	of	the	group’s	and	of	the	parent	
company’s	affairs	as	at	25	January	2014	and	of	the	group’s	profit	for	the	year	then	ended;
•	 	 the	group	financial	statements	have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	International	
Financial	Reporting	Standards	(IFRSs)	as	adopted	by	the	European	Union;
•	 	 the	Parent	Company	financial	statements	have	been	properly	prepared	in	accordance	with	United	
Kingdom	Generally	Accepted	Accounting	Practice;	and
•	 	 the	financial	statements	have	been	prepared	in	accordance	with	the	requirements	of	the	Companies	
Act	2006	and,	as	regards	the	group	financial	statements,	Article	4	of	the	IAS	Regulation.
The	financial	statements	comprise	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Comprehensive	Income,	the	
Consolidated	Statement	of	Changes	in	Equity,	the	Consolidated	Statement	of	Financial	Position,	the	
Consolidated	Cash	Flow	Statement,	the	Company	Balance	Sheet	and	the	related	notes	1	to	25.	The	
financial	reporting	framework	that	has	been	applied	in	their	preparation	is	applicable	law	and	IFRSs	as	
adopted	by	the	European	Union	and,	as	regards	the	parent	company	financial	statements,	as	applied	in	
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
GOING CONCERN
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 26 that the group is a 
going	concern.	We	confirm	that:
•	 	 we	have	concluded	that	the	directors’	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	in	the	preparation	
of	the	financial	statements	is	appropriate;	and
•	 	 we	have	not	identified	any	material	uncertainties	that	may	cast	significant	doubt	on	the	group’s	ability	
to continue as a going concern.
However,	 because	 not	 all	 future	 events	 or	 conditions	 can	 be	 predicted,	 this	 statement	 is	 not	 a	 guarantee	 as	
to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our 
audit	strategy,	the	allocation	of	resources	in	the	audit	and	directing	the	efforts	of	the	engagement	team:
risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Store impairments 
Loss making stores provide an indication that 
the	fixed	assets	related	to	that	store	could	be	
impaired.	Impairments	are	subject	to	an	element	
of	judgement	due	to	the	assumptions	made	within	
cash	flow	projections.
We	have	challenged	the	cash	flow	projections	as	
well as Management’s longer-term plans for each 
loss-making store to ensure that impairments are 
recognised at appropriate stores. This challenge 
has included a comparison of forecasts to historical 
performance,	challenge	of	forecast	growth	
rates and an assessment of how achievable cost 
reduction plans are. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 51

risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
the valuation of inventory and related provision 
Inventory is presented net of the following 
provisions:
•	 	 Provision	for	obsolescence	and	items	to	be	
sold	at	less	than	cost;	and
•	 	 Provision	for	shrinkage.	
There	is	an	element	of	judgement	relating	to	these	
provisions based on historical evidence and the 
current economic conditions.
We have performed testing of the controls around 
the inventory business cycle. We visited the 
Distribution	Centre	(‘DC’)	in	Barking	for	year-end	
stock	take	procedures,	in	addition	to	a	sample	
of stores. We have considered the inventory 
provision for obsolescence and items to be sold 
at less than cost in the light of historical data and 
Management’s	latest	estimates	and	plans,	and	post	
year-end selling price. We have recalculated the 
shrinkage provision using data from the internal 
audit team.
the measurement and accounting for 
share-based payments
The share awards are measured at the fair value 
at the date of the grant and expensed on a straight 
line	basis	over	the	vesting	period.	The	judgement	
of the fair value and number of awards expected to 
vest is based on a management estimate.
We have assessed Management’s accounting under 
the principles of IFRS 2 Share-based payments. 
In	particular,	we	have	audited	the	fair	value	
calculations for all new share awards granted in 
the year and the vesting conditions and assessed 
the ongoing fair value of the existing share-based 
payments.	This	included:
•	 	 A	review	of	the	share	option	award	
agreements.
•	 	 An	assessment	of	the	reasonableness	of	
inputs including volatility compared to peer 
group.
•	 	 Recalculation	of	the	amounts	recognised	over	
the vesting period.
the accounting for property leases (onerous lease 
provision)
If the Group is the lessee of a property which is 
either	vacant,	loss	making	or	sublet,	a	provision	
may be required to recognise the onerous element 
of the lease.
We have tested the utilisation and additions to the 
onerous lease provision and assessed whether the 
year-end provision is reasonable given the actual 
performance of the stores provided for compared to 
Management’s forecasts. 
We have challenged all store forecasts to determine 
if the provision is complete. Where stores have 
not	been	provided	for,	we	have	considered	
Management’s stated turnaround strategies in 
relation to the length of the lease remaining or 
plans to relocate the stores.
revenue recognition and cut-off (specifically in 
relation to hire and bespoke deposits)
We	have	identified	the	hire	and	bespoke	revenue	
streams	as	areas	of	significant	audit	attention	due	
to	the	specific	accounting	treatment	of	holding	
deposits less the relevant commission and cleaning 
costs for hire transactions as deferred revenue until 
the suits are collected by the customer.
We have tested the deferred revenue balance in 
relation to hire and Bespoke deposits through 
inspection of sales invoices and recalculation of the 
deferred element. We have tested a sample of the 
direct costs held against the deferred hire revenue. 52 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
CONTINUED
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 22.
Our	audit	procedures	relating	to	these	matters	were	designed	in	the	context	of	our	audit	of	the	financial	
statements	as	a	whole,	and	not	to	express	an	opinion	on	individual	accounts	or	disclosures.	Our	opinion	
on	the	financial	statements	is	not	modified	with	respect	to	any	of	the	risks	described	above,	and	we	do	not	
express an opinion on these individual matters.
OUR	APPLICATION	OF	MATERIALITY
We	define	materiality	as	the	magnitude	of	misstatement	in	the	financial	statements	that	makes	it	probable	
that	the	economic	decisions	of	a	reasonably	knowledgeable	person	would	be	changed	or	influenced.	We	
use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We	determined	materiality	for	the	group	to	be	£0.5	million,	which	is	below	0.5%	of	revenue,	and	below	2%	
of equity. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of	£10,000,	as	well	as	differences	below	that	threshold	that,	in	our	view,	warranted	reporting	on	qualitative	
grounds.	We	also	report	to	the	Audit	Committee	on	disclosure	matters	that	we	identified	when	assessing	
the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.	
AN	OVERVIEW	OF	THE	SCOPE	OF	OUR	AUDIT
Our audit work is designed to provide a full audit of the Group which now consists of only Moss Bros PLC 
following the liquidation of the Ireland subsidiary in November 2013. All work is performed by the Group 
audit team.
OPINION	ON	OTHER	MATTERS	PRESCRIBED	BY	THE	COMPANIES	ACT	2006
In	our	opinion:
•	 	 the	part	of	the	Directors’	Remuneration	Report	to	be	audited	has	been	properly	prepared	in	
accordance	with	the	Companies	Act	2006;	and
•	 	 the	information	given	in	the	Strategic	Report	and	the	Directors’	Report	for	the	financial	year	for	which	
the	financial	statements	are	prepared	is	consistent	with	the	financial	statements.
MATTERS	ON	WHICH	WE	ARE	REQUIRED	TO	REPORT	BY	ExCEPTION
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under	the	Companies	Act	2006	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	opinion:
•	 we	have	not	received	all	the	information	and	explanations	we	require	for	our	audit;	or
•	 	 adequate	accounting	records	have	not	been	kept	by	the	parent	company,	or	returns	adequate	for	our	
audit	have	not	been	received	from	branches	not	visited	by	us;	or
•	 	 the	parent	company	financial	statements	are	not	in	agreement	with	the	accounting	records	and	
returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 53

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2012/13 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have 
nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under	International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland),	we	are	required	to	report	to	you	if,	in	our	
opinion,	information	in	the	annual	report	is:
•	 materially	inconsistent	with	the	information	in	the	audited	financial	statements;	or
•	 	 apparently	materially	incorrect	based	on,	or	materially	inconsistent	with,	our	knowledge	of	the	group	
acquired	in	the	course	of	performing	our	audit;	or
•	 otherwise	misleading.
In	particular,	we	are	required	to	consider	whether	we	have	identified	any	inconsistencies	between	our	
knowledge acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is 
fair,	balanced	and	understandable	and	whether	the	annual	report	appropriately	discloses	those	matters	
that	we	communicated	to	the	audit	committee	which	we	consider	should	have	been	disclosed.	We	confirm	
that	we	have	not	identified	any	such	inconsistencies	or	misleading	statements.
RESPECTIVE	RESPONSIBILITIES	OF	DIRECTORS	AND	AUDITOR
As	explained	more	fully	in	the	Directors’	Responsibilities	Statement,	the	directors	are	responsible	for	
the	preparation	of	the	financial	statements	and	for	being	satisfied	that	they	give	a	true	and	fair	view.	Our	
responsibility	is	to	audit	and	express	an	opinion	on	the	financial	statements	in	accordance	with	applicable	
law	and	International	Standards	on	Auditing	(UK	and	Ireland).	Those	standards	require	us	to	comply	with	
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard 
on	Quality	Control	1	(UK	and	Ireland).	Our	audit	methodology	and	tools	aim	to	ensure	that	our	quality	
control	procedures	are	effective,	understood	and	applied.	Our	quality	controls	and	systems	include	our	
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This	report	is	made	solely	to	the	company’s	members,	as	a	body,	in	accordance	with	Chapter	3	of	Part	16	
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To	the	fullest	extent	permitted	by	law,	we	do	not	accept	or	assume	responsibility	to	anyone	other	than	the	
company	and	the	company’s	members	as	a	body,	for	our	audit	work,	for	this	report,	or	for	the	opinions	we	
have formed.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An	audit	involves	obtaining	evidence	about	the	amounts	and	disclosures	in	the	financial	statements	
sufficient	to	give	reasonable	assurance	that	the	financial	statements	are	free	from	material	misstatement,	
whether	caused	by	fraud	or	error.	This	includes	an	assessment	of:	whether	the	accounting	policies	are	
appropriate to the group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and	adequately	disclosed;	the	reasonableness	of	significant	accounting	estimates	made	by	the	directors;	
and	the	overall	presentation	of	the	financial	statements.	In	addition,	we	read	all	the	financial	and	non-
financial	information	in	the	annual	report	to	identify	material	inconsistencies	with	the	audited	financial	
statements	and	to	identify	any	information	that	is	apparently	materially	incorrect	based	on,	or	materially	
inconsistent	with,	the	knowledge	acquired	by	us	in	the	course	of	performing	the	audit.	If	we	become	aware	
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE 52 WEEKS ENDED 25 JANUARY 2014
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Moss Bros Group PLC (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated in Great Britain and domiciled in the United 
Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 8 St Johns Hill, London, SW11 1SA. The nature of 
the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Review on pages 4 to 6. The consolidated financial 
statements of the Company for the 52 weeks ended 25 January 2014 (“the period”) comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together “the Group”).
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts 
under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (“UK GAAP”).
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The 
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
Management believe the most significant areas of judgement to be:
Deferred tax
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and a judgement made over the probability of 
there being sufficient taxable profits arising in the future to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Share-based payments
The assumptions behind the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest is considered a key area of judgement.
Property Plant and Equipment
The estimated useful lives of non-current assets is considered to be a key area of judgement, particularly given the nature of the 
business. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting policies are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where IFRSs require an alternative treatment. 
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out in this note, together with the judgements made by management in applying 
these policies, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which are dealt with separately in note 2. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all 
periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except as set out below. The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The Group and Company financial statements are presented in sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic 
environment in which the Group operates and all values in tables are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds except when 
otherwise indicated.
The accounting policies adopted for the period are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements for the 52 weeks 
ended 26 January 2013. These can be seen via www.mossbros.co.uk.
Onerous property leases
The assumptions underlying these calculations are highly sensitive to small changes. 60 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS EFFECTIVE IN 2013/14
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been 
adopted in the current year. Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures - Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
Annual Improvements to IFRSs (2009 – 2011) Cycle
IFRS 10  Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
STANDARDS, AMENDMENTS AND INTERPRETATIONS TO EXISTING STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND 
HAVE NOT BEEN EARLY ADOPTED BY THE GROUP
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in 
these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IAS 36 (amendments) Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets
IAS 39 (amendments) Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group in future periods.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed 
review has been completed. 
CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated Group accounts incorporate the accounts of Moss Bros Group PLC and its subsidiaries, all of which have made up 
their accounts to 25 January 2014. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the 
power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In 
assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control 
ceases. All intercompany balances, income, expenditure and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards 
and under the historical cost convention. The following Company accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with 
items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements. As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies 
Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. The Company is exempt from the 
requirement to prepare a cash flow statement in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard Number 1.
The Company made a profit after taxation for the 52 week period to 25 January 2014 of £3,546,000 (2012/13: profit of £2,756,000).
GOING CONCERN
The Directors, have at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources in place for operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 21.
REVENUE
Revenue comprises sales to third parties (excluding VAT) and is derived from the retail sale and hire of clothing and ancillary goods. 
Revenue is recognised on exchange of goods; for the hire of clothing, the exchange of goods occurs when the hire clothing and 
ancillary goods are collected for use by the customer. At this point it is deemed that all risks and rewards have been transferred. 
Hire deposits are held within deferred revenue until this date. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or 
receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT 
and other sales related taxes. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 61

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2013/14 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales includes all costs of purchases and costs incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition. Costs 
of purchase comprise the purchase price, other taxes and transport costs. Inventory write downs are included in cost of sales when 
recognised.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and gains or 
losses on translation are included in the income statement.
LEASES
Group
Leases under the terms of which the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in payables. As 
at 25 January 2014 and 26 January 2013, the Company had no finance leases. All other leases are defined as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Amounts payable in respect of contingent rents are recognised in the period to which the sales relate.
Lease incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of expense on a 
straight-line basis.
Company
As at 25 January 2014, the Company had no finance leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a 
straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are spread 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be 
adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details of 
derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 24.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative 
is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the 
nature of the hedge relationship
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised 
as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the 
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented 
as current assets or current liabilities. 
HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges. 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged 
item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the 
inception of the hedge and at interim and period end, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in 
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. 
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in 
other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is 
included in the ‘other gains and losses’ line item. 
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the 
periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged 
item. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains and losses 
previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial 
asset.  62 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
CONTINUED
1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income at 
that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a 
forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
DIVIDENDS
Dividends are not accrued until approved by Shareholders.
TAXATION
Group
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
CURRENT TAX
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profits as reported in the income 
statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes 
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the 
balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if a temporary difference arises from the initial recognition 
of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in 
which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax 
assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Company
Tax on the loss for the periods represented comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted during 
the course of the that period and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be 
regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
Exceptional items are those significant credits or charges which, in the opinion of the Directors, should be separately disclosed by 
virtue of their size and one off nature, to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial performance. Transactions which may 
give rise to exceptional items include charges for impairment, significant provisions for onerous property lease contracts, transaction 
related costs, redundancy costs and discontinued operations which have a material impact on the absolute amount of and trend in 
the result for the period. Therefore, such items are disclosed as exceptional on the face of the income statement.

Grants/compensation received in respect of expenses incurred are credited to the income statement to match the related expense. 
Grants/compensation received in respect of capital expenditure incurred are credited to creditors and amortised to the income 
statement over the lives of the related assets.
PENSIONS
Contributions payable to the Group Personnel Pension Plan and other post retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
in the period to which they relate. Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown 
as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT 
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date. Details 
are set out in note 9. The fair value determined at grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet 
date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non market-
based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit or loss such that the 
cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-based Payments’.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Computer software and the directly related development costs that are not an integral part of the related hardware are classified as 
an intangible asset and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over five years.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation is calculated so as to write down on a straight-line basis the cost of non-current assets over their estimated useful lives 
to their estimated residual values. The rates used are as follows:
Fixtures and fittings 5-10 years
Computer hardware 5 years
Vehicles 6 years
Hire inventory is written down to £nil over its estimated useful economic life of five years.
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying value of its property plant and equipment and intangible assets to 
determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the 
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
The Group considers all the assets of a particular store to be one cash generating unit for the purposes of impairment estimate 
and the related assets of a particular store are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of 
impairment.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use. In assessing value in use of a store cash 
generating unit, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the cash 
generating unit is reduced to the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 64 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
During 2013/14 the Group progressed with the store development programme which commenced during 2012/13. An additional 
charge of £0.5m was taken in 2012/13 to reflect accelerated depreciation on existing fixtures and fittings in those stores, so that the 
value of fixtures and fittings replaced on refit will be written off by the date of refit. Management have reassesed the useful economic 
lives of these assets and a £13k credit to the income statement has been made during the year ended 25 January 2014. This has been 
treated as a prospective revision to the Group’s estimate for depreciation in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in 
Accounting Estimates and Errors.
LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS
Leasehold improvements are written off over the shorter of the period of the lease or the useful economic life of the assets on a 
straight-line basis.
Location premiums are paid to enter a property which is in a desirable location, stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision 
for impairment. Depreciation is calculated on location premiums over the useful economic life on a straight-line basis.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost, less amounts written off for any impairment in value.
INVENTORIES
Retail inventory is valued at the lower of cost (weighted average by season) and estimated net realisable value (estimated selling price 
less estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in selling and distribution). Net realisable value is estimated as discussed 
in note 2. Volume discounts received and receivable are deducted from the cost of inventories.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows. 
Provisions for onerous property lease contracts are recognised when the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the 
lease obligations exceed the economic benefits to be received under the lease. Where material, these provisions are discounted to 
their present value. Provisions are recognised on a lease by lease basis.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain 
future development of the business. To achieve this, the Board of Directors monitors the balance sheet, working capital, the cash 
flows and the level of dividends paid to shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the 
advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
During the period the Company’s approach to capital management was reviewed and a policy of spreading cash deposits across 
three UK based banks was adopted so as to minimise the risks associated with default by any one bank. The banks selected carry the 
highest available credit ratings. 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 65

2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates in many areas and the actual outcome 
may differ from those calculated. The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of 
causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are:
IMPAIRMENT CALCULATIONS
The carrying amount of non-current assets on the balance sheet is dependent on the estimates of future profits and cash flows 
arising from the Company’s operations.
The key assumptions for the value used in calculating any impairment loss referred to in the property, plant and equipment 
accounting policy note, are regarding expected growth rates to individual stores during the year and discount rates applied to the 
forecast cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using a pre-tax discount rate based on the weighted average cost of 
capital for the Group. Sales and cost growth rates are based on the managements’ best expectations of future business performance 
over a maximum period of five years.
No impairments have been made to assets during 2013/14 (2012/13: £nil).
ONEROUS PROPERTY LEASE CONTRACTS
The Company provides for onerous property lease contracts where the Group believes that the unavoidable costs of meeting the lease 
obligations exceed the economic benefit until the end of the lease. The provision is calculated as the lower of contracted rental costs, 
estimated net exit costs and the forecast operating losses through to the end of the lease. These provisions are based on the best 
estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as economic conditions 
and marketplace demand. Expectations will be revised at each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted 
for in the period in which the revision is made.
The provision for onerous property lease contracts is discounted to reflect the time value of money.
As a result, a net debit of £397,000 was recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in relation to onerous 
property lease contracts for continuing operations for the period ended 25 January 2014 (2012/13: £932,000 debit).
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
The fair values of the options granted, and shares granted under the LTIP and SAYE, that are referred to in the accounting policies 
note, are measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options and shares 
were granted. Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 9. 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. The Company has applied the requirements of FRS20 
‘Share-based Payments’. 
The amount recorded in the income statement in respect of share-based payment transactions, is IFRS 2 charge of £488,000 and 
employer’s National Insurance charge of £188,000 (2012/13: IFRS 2 charge of £286,000 and employer’s National Insurance charge 
£358,000) and relates to the LTIP and SAYE. 
INVENTORY PROVISIONS
Net realisable value is the selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business less estimated selling costs. Provision is made 
for the estimated obsolescence of old seasons’ lines based on historical margin trends and for the estimated loss of inventory from 
shop theft based on historical data. The provision at 25 January 2014 was £430,000 (2012/13 £525,000).
3. REVENUE AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS
OPERATING SEGMENTS
The majority of the Company’s turnover arose in the United Kingdom, with the exception of two stores in Ireland.
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of 
the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance.
Information reported to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment 
performance is focused on the split between Mainstream Retail, Bespoke and Hire. Given the similarities between Mainstream Retail 
and Bespoke, they meet the aggregation criteria under IFRS 8, therefore are both reported under Retail.
Information regarding the Group’s continuing operating segments is reported below. 66 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

Only revenue and gross profit have been reported for the Group’s business segments; Retail and Hire, as the main operating costs, 
being property, related overheads and staff, cannot be separately identified as they both use the same stores and hence operating 
profit is not reported to the Chief Executive Officer split by Retail and Hire. Revenue and gross profit are the measures reported to the 
Chief Executive Officer for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segmental performance.
On the same basis, assets cannot be allocated between Retail and Hire, and are not reported to the Chief Executive Officer separately.

compensation claim made in 2007 on the Group’s former distribution centre following the successful London Olympics bid. £423,000 
of this amount related to revenue and £1,017,000 related to fixed assets. Of the £1,017,000 which related to fixed assets, £610,000 was 
recognised in 2012/13 as an exceptional item representing six years accumulated depreciation and £407,000 was deferred into future 
years to be released over the useful economic lives of the relevant replacement assets. This ongoing annual release has not been 
treated as an exceptional item in 2013/14 but netted off the annual depreciation charge for the replacement assets.
In 2012/13 an additional provision for onerous property lease contracts was made under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and 
Contingent Assets’ of £1,366,000 in respect of two loss-making stores as they met Management’s definition of exceptional items due 
to their individual size and nature. The additional provision represented the net present value of additional projected losses for each 
store, until the end of lease. There was no such additional provision during 2013/14. 68 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. The Company has applied the requirements of FRS20 
‘Share-based Payments’. There are no significant differences between FRS20 and IFRS2 as detailed below. 
SAVE AS YOU EARN SHARE OPTION SCHEME
A save as you earn scheme was approved and adopted in 2012/13. Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to 
purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs 
(HMRC) approved Save As You Earn (SAYE) savings contract. For the 2012 and 2013 plans, the Board limited the maximum amount 
saved to £150 per month. This limit is to be increased to £500 per month for the 2014 plan, in line with HMRC limits. The price at 
which options were offered is the average closing price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date. The options may 
normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, three years after entering the scheme.

LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In 2009/10 a new equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders. In accordance with this plan, the 
shares are exercisable at nil cost, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and the requirement for the continued 
employment during the vesting period. The fair value is measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model and 
recognised over the vesting period. Based on the year ended 25 January 2014 the remaining 25% of these options will vest (by 
26 January 2013 75% of these options had vested) based on satisfying the performance conditions. 
On 5 April 2012 a new equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders and 1,526,216 shares were 
awarded to directors and senior employees. Under the same April 2012 LTIP, 156,882 shares were awarded to senior employees on 
8 May 2012. In accordance with this plan, the shares are exercisable at nil cost, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions 
and the requirement for continued employment during the vesting period. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised 
over the vesting period. These grants are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2. 
On 11 April 2013 a new equity settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was approved by shareholders and 1,341,541 shares were 
awarded to directors and senior employees. Under the same April 2013 LTIP, 138,190 shares were awarded to senior employees on 
26 September 2013. In accordance with this plan, the shares are exercisable at nil cost, subject to the satisfaction of performance 
conditions and the requirement for continued employment during the vesting period. The fair value is measured at grant date and

At 25 January 2014 the deferred tax asset in respect of capital allowances, share-based payments and other short term temporary 
differences was recognised on the basis that the Company is profitable in 2014/15 and forecasts to be profitable in future years. 
At the balance sheet date, the Finance Act 2013 had been substantively enacted confirming that the main UK corporation tax rate 
will reduce to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and 20% from 1 April 2015. Therefore, at 25 January 2014, deferred tax assets and 
liabilities have been calculated based on a rate of 20% where the temporary difference is expected to reverse after 1 April 2015. These 
reductions may also reduce the Group’s future current tax charges accordingly.  MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 75

11. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the weighted average of 95,135,614 (2012/13: 94,657,166) ordinary shares in issue 
during the period after deducting for shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and are calculated by reference to the profit 
attributable to shareholders of £3,580,000 (2012/13: profit of £2,385,000). 
Underlying* earnings per ordinary share is based on the weighted average of 95,135,614 (2012/13: 94,657,166) ordinary shares in 
issue during the period after deducting for shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and are calculated by reference to the profit 
attributable to shareholders of £3,580,000 (2012/13: profit of £2,204,000).
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is based upon the weighted average of 101,294,098 (2012/13: 98,685,928) ordinary shares after 
deducting for shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust, which include the effects of shares under SAYE, LTIP and Deferred Bonus 
Shares of 6,318,052, that were anti-dilutive for the period presented and could dilute earnings per share in the future and are 
calculated by reference to the profit attributable to shareholders as stated above.

Given the excellent progress made in 2013/14 and the prospects for further growth the Board feels it is appropriate to propose the 
payment of a final dividend. 
A dividend of 4.7 pence per share is proposed to be paid on 26 June 2014 to all shareholders on the register as at 6 June 2014 
(ex dividend date 4 June 2014) and in line with the Board’s policy, will be monitored to ensure we achieve robust dividend cover over 
time. 76 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

* Note this was presented in Accruals and deferred income in 2012/13.
**  The additional provision of £322,000 on dilapidations during the period reflects the Group’s estimate of obligations arising under operating leases.
***  The release of £267,000 on Onerous property lease provisions represents the release on stores which closed during the period or stores which 
were renewed on terms which meant the lease was no longer considered onerous. £210,000 of lease reassignment costs were debited against the 
provision. The net release to the income statement on stores which closed during the year was £57,000.
**** The utilisation of £19,000 of Dilapidations provision and £340,000 of Onerous property lease provision was the release on continuing stores. 
The provision at 25 January 2014 of £2,576,000 (26 January 2013: £3,183,000) on onerous leases is the estimated future cost of the 
Group’s onerous property lease contracts. The net release to the income statement on stores which closed during the year and on 
continuing stores was £397,000 (2012/13: charge of £932,000). This has been discounted to reflect the time value of money. The effect 
of the unwinding of the discount rate on the release for the year was a credit of £220,000 (2012/13: credit of £298,000).
23. PENSIONS
The Group currently operates a defined contribution scheme. As at 25 January 2014 there were £49,000 outstanding contributions 
relating to the defined contribution scheme (26 January 2013: £34,000).
24. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
(A) MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash and various items such as derivative forward foreign currency transactions, 
trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Company’s liquidity.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate 
risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks.
CREDIT RISK
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is maintained on an ongoing basis. At the Balance Sheet date, 
there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The carrying amount of each financial asset represents the maximum credit exposure.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Cash balances are managed and monitored on a daily basis and the peaks and troughs in the cash cycle are well known through 
experience. The Company continues to operate the business from a debt free position and current trading levels generate a healthy 
cash flow. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 85

Customer: Moss Bros Project Title: Report & Accounts 2013/14 T: 0207 055 6500 F: 020 7055 6600
FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
The Company’s policy is to mitigate all currency exposures on purchases either by buying the amount of currency required at the 
time the obligation is known and holding it in a designated bank account until it is needed or by taking out forward foreign currency 
contracts. Details of forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at 25 January 2014 are detailed in note (E) below.
INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk arises from investment of cash balances on short term deposits. The Company is not exposed to any other interest 
rate risk.

The Company recognised an allowance for doubtful debts where the trade receivable was considered irrecoverable on the basis of 
ageing and historical experience. In the current period £5,000 was provided for (2012/13: £69,000). If the Company believes that a 
specific balance is irrecoverable, it will be written off. The Company does not require collateral in respect of these financial assets.

(C) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

 Forward foreign currency contracts    (162) –
    (162) –
In the current year the Group entered into several forward foreign currency contracts, to protect the cost to the Group of 2013/14 
inventory purchases and hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. During 2013/14 the Group had entered into £3,501,000 
(2012/13: £3,630,000) US dollar forward contracts which were outstanding at 25 January 2014. In the current year, these have been 
designated as cash flow hedges. The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases 
occur during the next 12 months, at which time the amount deferred in equity will be reclassified to profit and loss. At 25 January 
2014, (£144,000) has been deferred in equity (2012/13: £28,000). The ineffective portion of cash flow hedges recognised in “Other gains 
and losses” within profit or loss is £2,000 (2012/13: £2,000).
CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group manages its capital to ensure that the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimism of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains unchanged from 2011/12.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as a disclosed in note 19.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. 
The Group’s risk management committee reviews the capital structure on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the committee 
considers the cost of capital and risks associated with each class of capital.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement 
and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are

Effect of 10% appreciation in foreign exchange rates on derivative cash flow hedges
Sterling against US Dollar   
 Deferred in equity – Hedge Reserve    (309) (2)
 Profit or loss ineffectiveness    (25) –
The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash flow hedges results from retranslation of forward purchases of US Dollars 
used to hedge 2013/14 inventory purchases. A negative number indicates a decrease in amounts deferred in equity where Sterling 
strengthens 10% against the US Dollar. The associated fair value gains and losses are deferred in equity until the purchases occur. 
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying amount of trade and other payables 
and receivables, due to the low associated sensitivity, and are reported before the effect of tax. It has been prepared on the basis that 
the Group’s hedging activities, hedge accounting designations and derivate contracts remain constant, reflecting the position at 
25 January 2014. Consequently, the analysis relates to the position at that date and is not necessarily representative of 2013/14 then 
ended. In preparing the sensitivity analysis, it is assumed that all hedges are fully effective.
The effect shown above would be reversed in the event of an equal and opposite change in foreign exchange rate.
All derivatives are categories as level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 and they are valued using techniques based significantly on 
observed market data.

 (a)  the allotment of equity securities for cash in connection with, or pursuant to, an offer of or invitation to acquire equity 
securities in favour of the holders of ordinary shares of the Company in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the respective 
number of ordinary shares held by them on the record date for such allotment, subject only to such exclusions or other 
arrangements as the Directors may consider necessary or appropriate to deal with fractional entitlements, record dates or 
legal, regulatory or practical difficulties which may arise under the laws of, or the requirements of, any regulatory body or 
stock exchange in any territory or any other matter whatsoever; and
 (b)  the allotment (otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) of this resolution) of equity securities up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £248,278.95,
  and the power hereby granted shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company (or, if earlier, 
on 24 May 2015) save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted after such expiry in which case the Directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of such offer or 
agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired.
15.  That the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of section 701 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 
“Act”) to make one or more market purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the Act) of any of its ordinary shares of 5p 
each in the capital of the Company on such terms and in such manner as the Directors may from time to time determine provided 
that:
 (a)  the maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which may be purchased is 9,931,158 ordinary shares of 5p each 
(representing approximately 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company at 25 January 2014);
 (b) the minimum price that may be paid for each ordinary share shall be 5p which is an amount exclusive of expenses, if any;
 (c) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each ordinary share is the higher of:
  (i)  105 per cent. of the average of the middle market quotations for the ordinary shares of the Company as derived from the 
Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange plc for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which 
such is contracted to be purchased; and
  (ii)  the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues 
where the purchase is carried out, as stipulated by article 5(1) of the EU Buyback and Stabilisation Regulation 2003 (No. 
2273/2003);
 (d)  unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire on 18 months from the 
passing of the resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting in 2015; and
 (e)  the Company may, before the expiry of the authority granted by this resolution, enter into a contract to purchase ordinary 
shares which would or might be executed wholly or partly after the expiry of this authority, and may make purchases of 
ordinary shares pursuant to it as if this authority had not expired.
16.  That a general meeting of the Company (other than an annual general meeting) may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ 
notice.

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
CONTINUED
NOTES
1.  Copies of the Executive Directors’ service contracts with the Company and copies of the Non-Executive Directors’ letters of 
appointment with the Company will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business 
hours on any weekday (Saturdays, Sundays and public bank holidays excepted) from the date of this notice until the close of the 
Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2014 and will also be available for inspection at the place of the meeting for 
at least 15 minutes prior to, and throughout, the meeting. A copy of this notice and other information required by section 311A of 
the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) can be found at www.mossbros.co.uk/investors/annual_reports.htm.
2.  Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and section 360(B)(2) of the Act, the Company 
specifies that in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and also for the purpose of determining 
how many votes a person entitled to attend and vote may cast), a person must be entered on the register of members of the 
Company at 12 noon on 21 May 2014 or, in the event of any adjournment, at 12 noon on the date which is two days before the day 
of the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the register of members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the 
rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
3.  A member of the Company entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint a proxy to attend, speak 
and vote in their place. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that 
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company.
4.  A form of proxy for the 2014 Annual General Meeting is enclosed. To be valid, the completed and signed form of proxy, together 
with the power of attorney or authority, if any, under which it is signed (or a duly certified copy of any such power or authority), 
or other instrument appointing a proxy must be received by post or by hand (during normal business hours) with the Company’s 
registrars, Capita Asset Services at PXS 1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham BR3 4ZF as soon as possible but not less than 
48 hours before the time of the meeting. If you are a CREST member, see note 5 below. Alternatively, a member may appoint a 
proxy electronically, or may wish to vote electronically online, at www.capitashareportal.com. Please see the form of proxy for 
further details.
  Return of a completed form of proxy, or other instrument appointing a proxy or any CREST Proxy Instruction will not preclude a 
member from attending and voting personally at the meeting if he/she wishes to do so.
5.  Alternatively, if you are a member of CREST, you may register the appointment of a proxy by using the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service. Further details are contained below.
  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so 
for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures, and to the address, described in the 
CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST) subject to the provisions of the Company’s articles of association. 
CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service 
provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on 
their behalf.
  In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear”) 
specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, 
regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously 
appointed proxy, must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA10) by the latest time(s) 
for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice of the Annual General Meeting, being 12 noon on 21 May 2014. For this 
purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the time stamp applied to the message by the CREST 
Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by 
CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means.
  CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that Euroclear does not 
make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore 
apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 91

  The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
6.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information 
rights under section 146 of the Act (a “nominated person”) may have a right under an agreement between him/her and such 
member by whom he/she was nominated, to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the Annual General 
Meeting. If a nominated person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may have a right 
under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned as to the exercise of voting rights. The statement of the 
above rights of the members in relation to the appointment of proxies does not apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only 
be exercised by a member of the Company.
7.  Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its 
powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
8.  Any member attending the Annual General Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the answer has 
already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or 
the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
9.  Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including 
the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports 
were laid in accordance with section 437 of the Act, (in each case) that the members propose to raise at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying 
with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 
Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the 
website. The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Act to publish on a website.
10.  As at 1 April 2014 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company’s issued share capital consists 
of 99,311,580 ordinary shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company as at that date are 
99,311,580.
11.  You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of section 333(4) of the Act) provided in this notice (or in any related 
documents including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.
12.  Under section 338 and section 338A of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements in those sections have the right 
to require the Company (i) to give, to members of the Company entitled to receive notice of the Annual General Meeting, notice 
of a resolution which may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the meeting and/or (ii) to include in the business 
to be dealt with at the meeting any matter (other than a proposed resolution) which may be properly included in the business. 
A resolution may properly be moved or a matter may properly be included in the business unless (a) (in the case of a resolution 
only) it would, if passed, be ineffective (whether by reason of inconsistency with any enactment or the Company’s constitution 
or otherwise), (b) it is defamatory of any person, or (c) it is frivolous or vexatious. Such a request may be in hard copy form or in 
electronic form, must identify the resolution of which notice is to be given or the matter to be included in the business, must be 
authorised by the person or persons making it, must be received by the Company not later than the date 6 clear weeks before the 
meeting, and (in the case of a matter to be included in the business only) must be accompanied by a statement setting out the 
grounds for the request.
13.  Voting on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting will be by way of a poll. This means that you will be asked to complete 
a poll card if you attend in person. The Company believes that this is the best way of representing the views of as many 
shareholders as possible in the voting process. 92 I MOSS BROS GROUP PLC shop on-line at www.mossbros.co.uk

NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

EXPLANATORY NOTES
1.  Resolution 2. This resolution is to approve the Directors’ remuneration report (other than the part containing the Directors’ 
remuneration policy) for the financial year ended on 25 January 2014. You can find the report on pages 39 to 49 of the Company’s 
Annual Report and Accounts 2013/2014, which is available on the Company’s website www.mossbros.co.uk/investors/annual_
reports.htm. As this vote is an advisory vote, no entitlement of a Director to remuneration is conditional on it. This resolution 
should be put annually as required by the Companies Act 2006.
2.  Resolution 3. This resolution is to approve the Directors’ remuneration policy contained in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
You can find the policy on pages 32 to 38 of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2013/2014. This vote is a binding vote 
and, subject to limited exceptions, no remuneration payment or loss of office payment may be made to a prospective, current or 
former Director unless consistent with the approved remuneration policy (or otherwise specifically approved by shareholders of 
the Company). If approved by shareholders, the Directors’ remuneration policy will take effect immediately after the end of the 
Annual General Meeting. This resolution should be put at least every three years as required by the Companies Act 2006. 
3.  Resolutions 4 to 9. As required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, biographical details of each of the Directors standing 
for re-election appear on page 17 of the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts 2013/2014. Under the Company’s articles of 
association, one-third of the Directors are required to retire by rotation each year. However, in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors will submit themselves for annual re-election by shareholders. The Chairman is satisfied that, 
following individual formal performance evaluations, the performance of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be 
effective and to demonstrate commitment to the role.
4.  Resolution 13. Your Directors may allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares only if 
authorised to do so by shareholders. The authority granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 13 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to grant new authorities to allot 
shares and grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares. If given, these authorities will expire at the Annual 
General Meeting in 2015 or on 24 May 2015, whichever is earlier. Resolution 13 will allow the Directors to allot ordinary shares up 
to a maximum nominal amount of £1,655,193, representing approximately one-third (33.33 per cent.) of the Company’s existing 
issued share capital and calculated as at 1 April 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to date of this document).
 As at 1 April 2014 (being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document) the Company holds no treasury shares.
5.  Resolution 14. Your Directors also require a power from shareholders to allot equity securities for cash and otherwise than to 
existing shareholders pro rata to their holdings. The power granted at the last Annual General Meeting is due to expire at this 
year’s Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, resolution 14 will be proposed as a special resolution to grant such a power. Apart 
from offers or invitations in proportion to the respective number of shares held, the power will be limited to the allotment of 
equity securities for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £248,278.95 (being five per cent. of the Company’s issued ordinary 
share capital at 1 April 2014, being the latest practicable date prior to date of this document). If given, this power will expire on 
24 May 2015 or at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2015, whichever is the earlier. Your Directors will have due 
regard to institutional guidelines in relation to any exercise of this power, in particular the requirement for advance consultation 
and explanation before making any non pre-emptive cash issue pursuant to this resolution which exceeds 7.5 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period.
6.  Resolution 15. This resolution will give the Company authority to purchase its own shares in the markets up to a limit of 10 per 
cent of its issued ordinary share capital. The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution. Your Directors believe 
that it is advantageous for the Company to have this flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares. Your Directors will 
exercise this authority only if they are satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected earnings per share and 
would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
  In the event that shares are purchased, they may either be cancelled (and the number of shares in issue would be reduced 
accordingly) or, in accordance with the Act, be retained as treasury shares. The Company will consider holding repurchased 
shares pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as treasury shares. This would give the Company the ability to re-
issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of 
its capital base.
  As at 1 April 2014, being the last practicable date prior to the date of this document, the total number of options over ordinary 
shares in the capital of the Company that were outstanding under all of the Company’s share option plans was 6,665,899, which 
if exercised would represent 6.71 per cent. of the Company’s issued share capital at that date. If the Company were to purchase 
its own shares to the fullest possible extent of its authority from shareholders (existing and being sought), this number of 
outstanding options could potentially represent 7.46 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company. MOSS BROS GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013/14 I 93

7.  Resolution 16. Changes made to the Act by the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 increase the notice period 
required for general meetings of the Company to at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, 
which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. (Annual General Meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ 
notice.)
  Until the coming into force of the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to 
call general meetings other than an annual general meeting on at least 14 clear days’ notice without obtaining such shareholder 
approval. In order to preserve this ability, resolution 16 seeks the necessary shareholder approval. The approval will be effective 
until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
  The flexibility offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account the circumstances, the directors consider this 
appropriate in relation to the business to be considered at the meeting.
  Note that the changes to the Act mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the 
Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
8. Recommendation
  Your Directors believe that all the proposed resolutions to be considered at the 2014 Annual General Meeting as set out in this 
document are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. Accordingly, your Directors unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of them as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
9. Note from the Chairman:
  “I can confirm, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code, that having fully evaluated their performances, the Board is of 
the view that each of the Directors offering themselves for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting continue to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to their role.”

of proxy.
 (c)  To appoint more than one proxy, you may photocopy this form of proxy. Please indicate the proxy holder’s name and the number of shares in relation to which they

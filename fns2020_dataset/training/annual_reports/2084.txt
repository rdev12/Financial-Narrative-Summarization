The Automotive Services division, based primarily in the United Kingdom, offers a comprehensive range of services to
the automotive sector. These services, mainly operating under the ‘Ontime’ brand name, include volume vehicle
distribution, specialist delivery services of prestige marques, prototype vehicles and clay models, repatriation of vehicles
from mainland Europe, vehicle pre-delivery inspections and refurbishment and niche marketing and support services.
Major customers include the world’s leading automotive manufacturers.
The division’s operations also include Ontime Rescue and Recovery, the largest rescue and recovery operation
outside of the motoring clubs. This operation provides services to the motoring organisations, police authorities and
large commercial fleet owners.
The Traffic Management operation provides a clamping and removal service for local borough councils. 
SHIPPING SERVICES
Bidcorp’s shipping interest consists principally of a cross-Channel freight ferry service trading as Dartline and a ship
chartering and management company, Ropner Ship Management. Bidcorp owns a port at Dartford from which it
provides a ferry service to Zeebrugge in Belgium, Vlissingen in Holland and Dunkerque in France for both
accompanied and unaccompanied trailers and containers.
Bidcorp owns six ro-ro (roll-on, roll-off) freight ferries. The three Kawasaki built vessels each have 2,723 lane
metres, with the capacity to carry 155 trailers. The three Bazias class vessels have 1,225 lane metres with the
carrying capacity for 93 trailers. All three of the Kawasaki vessels have been on charter to the Ministry of Defence
(MoD) during the past months, but will be returning in the near future to be available to meet the demands of
Dartline’s growth in traffic.
PROPERTY AND OUTSOURCED SERVICES
The Property and Outsourced Services division provides property management solutions both internally and
externally. It is also involved in developing the Group’s property assets and manages car-parking facilities for local
councils.

INTRODUCTION
Bidcorp plc has over the past eighteen months been recapitalised and
begun a process of stabilising the businesses. A strategic assessment of
all the areas of the business activities was conducted. Management was
tasked with reducing costs and addressing returns on the assets
employed. This task continues with some initial benefits being realised. 
We experienced a slow down in market activity, particularly in the
automotive services sector, as well as other setbacks. Whilst it is
disappointing not to be able to show markedly improved financial 
results, I remain optimistic about Bidcorp’s future. We have avoided
pursuing expansion opportunities until a stable foundation has been
achieved. 
STRATEGY
The strategic assessment resulted in the closure of a number of
businesses at significant cost. Our focus has been on restructuring the
continuing businesses and establishing the appropriate processes,
structures and philosophies to generate sustainable growth. Once
achieved we will turn our attention to exploring growth opportunities 
and new strategic initiatives, one of which is to ensure Bidcorp’s
participation in the trade between the United Kingdom, continental
Europe and southern Africa.
The reorganisation of the Group is progressing satisfactorily. Sustainable
business transformations require persistence and perseverance. Bidcorp’s
turnaround has taken place in incremental stages while carefully building
the critical mass required to create ‘breakthrough’ opportunities.
Unlocking value is a difficult and demanding task, but the implementation
of a decentralised and entrepreneurial culture has brought new energy to
the Group.
Management’s focus on cost savings and operational efficiencies is
ongoing and we believe the businesses are now appropriately structured
to benefit from opportunities, especially once the markets improve.
CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
Whilst tough
economic conditions
have slowed the
turnaround,
Bidcorp is well
positioned to
benefit from
market
improvements
Brian Joffe
Chairman ECONOMIC CONDITIONS
First world countries recorded slower real growth rates in the reporting
period. Uncertainty in the world economy was exacerbated by the war in
Iraq and the disruption occurring during an economic slowdown. Leading
indicator industries, such as the automotive industry, were particularly 
hard hit. 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Group turnover from continuing operations amounted to £189.8 million.
Operating profit, excluding exceptional items and discontinued
operations, amounted to £0.8 million. Finance costs were £1.6 million,
reflecting the reduction in the Group’s gearing to 28% (2001: 209%).
Turnover and operating losses, including closure costs in respect of
discontinued operations, amounted to £14.7 million and £2.9 million,
respectively.
PROSPECTS
Significant progress has been made in establishing a solid foundation to
support long term sustainable growth and profitability for Bidcorp.
Change is always difficult and it has been a demanding time for the
Group. My thanks go to the management and staff for their efforts in
trying circumstances.
Whilst tough economic conditions have slowed the turnaround, Bidcorp is
well positioned to benefit from market improvements.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT

8
The financial period under review is from January 1  2002 to June 30
2003, to bring the Group into line with the reporting period of its 
principal shareholder, The Bidvest Group Limited. The trading figures in
this report therefore compare this eighteen-month period with those of the
previous twelve months to December 31  2001.
The focus has been on identifying those businesses that fit our strategic
vision, ensuring that the appropriate management and structures are in
place, and disposing of or closing those businesses, which do not fit our
strategy. A number of the continuing businesses have required extensive
restructuring. There have been significant costs associated with this
process and these are reflected in the results of both the continued and
discontinued operations.
The combination of adverse market conditions and a number of trading
incidents resulted in a disappointing operating loss for the six months to
the end of June 2003. These incidents included an accident involving one
of our ferries, the write-off of amounts owing by an insolvent Dartline
debtor and the costs of terminating an unacceptable long standing contract
with an automotive customer. There were also a number of one-off costs
associated with the reorganisation of the Group.
The balance sheet is extremely sound with gearing of 28%, following an
equity injection of £31 million, despite the expenditure of £15 million on
a capital equipment replacement programme and £9.7 million hire
purchase repayments in respect of commitments made in earlier periods.
Long term borrowings of £2.7 million were also repaid. The business
generated cash at an operating level despite the losses recorded.
The operations are grouped into three divisions – Automotive Services,
Shipping Services and Property and Outsourced Services.
MARKET CONDITIONS
Market conditions were tough, particularly in the first half of the 2003
calendar year. This was especially true of the Automotive Volume
Distribution business where it proved difficult to maintain margins in a
highly competitive market and in the Automotive Specialist Operations
business where manufacturers’ promotional activities were severely
curtailed. A further round of cost reductions was instituted as a result of
these developments.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The focus has been on
identifying those
businesses that fit our
strategic vision
and ensuring that
the appropriate
management and
structures are
in place
Rodger Graham
Chief executive The demand for cross-Channel freight ferry services on the routes that we
operate was markedly reduced during the period of the war in Iraq, and is
only now returning to pre-war levels.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Automotive Services
Bidcorp’s Automotive Services division provides an extensive range of
services to the automotive industry including volume and specialised
transport, pre-delivery inspection and preparation as well as specialised
transportation of vehicles across the Channel and throughout Europe. The
division is also a significant player in the rescue and recovery industry in
the United Kingdom.
The automotive industry experienced difficult trading conditions with a
resultant drop in the volumes of new vehicle sales and pressure on
margins. The industry as a whole is actively focused on cost savings and
Bidcorp’s automotive operations concentrated on cost reductions and
operational efficiencies.
The Automotive Services division reported turnover of £128.9 million 
(2001: £69.6 million) and an operating loss of £0.6 million (2001: operating
loss of £0.1 million) in respect of continuing operations. In addition, turnover
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
9 of £9.9 million (2001: £9.3 million) and
operating losses of £1.9 million (2001:
operating loss of £0.4 million) were attributable
to discontinued operations.
The Individual Driver Movements (IDM)
business operated at a loss for the period.
Attempts to find a buyer for the business were
unsuccessful and the operation was closed at
the end of June 2003. 
The Automotive Services division is now
grouped into Volume Distribution and
Specialist Operations.
The ‘Ontime’ brand is gaining recognition in the
United Kingdom and, wherever appropriate, our
automotive operations have been rebranded as
such.
Volume Distribution
Operating as Ontime Automotive in the United
Kingdom and SVTV (Societe Vendomoise de
Transports de Vehicules SA) in France, the
V olume Distribution operations offer a safe and
reliable contractual automotive delivery service
to numerous blue-chip customers.
The United Kingdom operations moved in
excess of 730,000 vehicles utilising 150 of our
own transporters, as well as a number of sub-
contractors, to cater for peak demand periods.
SVTV moved over 290,000 vehicles with a
fleet of 150 transporters.
To meet the challenge of reducing margins and
the need for greater efficiencies, significant
restructuring has commenced, centralising some
of the functions that were being performed
regionally, without destroying the decentralised
culture and ethos that has been introduced.
Specialist Operations
The Specialist Operations also operates under the Ontime Automotive
brand utilising a fleet of 85 enclosed and 23 conventional transporters to
provide specialised automotive transport solutions, moving premier
automotive brands in closed, and sometimes temperature-controlled,
vehicles. During the period 39,000 vehicles were transported. 
Ontime Automotive also provides a wide range of specialist services
including market research, clinic management, specialist transportation of
clay models, prototypes and test vehicles, as well as on-site technical
liaison at photographic shoots, international motor shows and product
launches.
The pre-delivery inspection and vehicle refurbishment centres processed
over 190,000 vehicles. The Wellesbourne centre, opened in early 2002,
has seen a steady rise in the volumes of vehicles processed and is now
profitable. A contract with one of the major motor manufacturers has been
concluded and will provide substantial ongoing business for the facility. 
The loss-making vehicle preparation centre in Goole was closed in 
March 2003.
The Rescue and Recovery business performed well. Using a recovery
fleet of 220 specialised vehicles despatched from the 24-hour control
centres located throughout southeast England, the division responded to
nearly 300,000 calls for assistance. Clients include the major motoring
organisations, police forces and an extensive number of truck and bus
operators and manufacturers. This previously loss-making business is 
now contributing to the Group’s profits. 
As a result of certain long standing unprofitable contracts, the Traffic
Management business’ results were understandably disappointing. A new
storage facility in central London was leased to reduce transportation costs
and the end of an unprofitable contract will improve the performance of this
unit. Traffic Management is expected to contribute positively to Bidcorp’s
performance in the year ahead.  
Shipping Services 
Bidcorp’s Shipping Services division operates scheduled ro-ro freight
ferry services from the Thames to Dunkerque in France, Zeebrugge in
Belgium and Vlissengen in Holland under the brand name ‘Dartline’. 
BIDCORP PLC
10
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
(CONTINUED) Bidcorp owns and operates a fleet of six multi-purpose ro-ro freight
ferries, three Kawasaki deep-sea ferries and three smaller Bazias class
vessels. Direct ownership of two of the Bazias vessels was acquired out of
the joint venture structure in which they were held.
The operations in the United Kingdom are based at Thames Europort,
close to the M25 and the Bluewater business park. The port has two ro-ro
berths and a stand-by berth with an operating draft of eleven metres. 
The port is operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The port also
provides storage, parking and office facilities to Bidcorp group companies
and third parties.
The general market for cross-Channel freight on the routes serviced by
Dartline grew slowly during 2002. The Iraqi war had a negative effect on
the demand for cross-Channel freight ferry services, which dropped
significantly from the beginning of 2003. Activity on Bidcorp’s cross-
Channel routes has improved more recently. 
The unprofitable Ferryline business, which in many respects was in
competition with our customers, was closed in January 2003.
The Shipping Services division reported turnover of £56.3 million (2001:
£31.4 million) and an operating profit of £0.9 million (2001: £0.4 million)
in respect of continuing operations. In addition, turnover of £4.8 million
(2001: £6.2 million) and an operating loss of £1.0 million (2001:
operating loss of £0.3 million) were attributable to discontinued
operations.
Whilst cargo rates increased on all routes, the positive effects were offset
by a decline in the profitability of the product mix carried. 
The trade imbalance between the United Kingdom and Europe shifted
further in Europe’s favour, resulting in the increased repositioning of
empty containers back to Europe. In addition the chartered-in vessels had
a different load configuration, which resulted in a drop in accompanied
traffic.
The port of Dartford was physically reorganised, resulting in the carrying
capacity increasing by more than 30%, with still more to be achieved.
The marketing function of Dartline has been strengthened to establish 
a stronger presence in Europe from where the majority of traffic
originates.
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
11 A significant Dutch customer went into
liquidation in May 2003. In addition to the
resultant loss of trading turnover, a provision
of £244,000 was made for debts that are not
likely to be recovered.
An investment in a company, which held a
25% share in a VLCC (Very Large Crude
Carrier), was sold, yielding a profit of 
£0.4 million, not included in the
aforementioned operating results. Proceeds 
of £2.9 million arising from this transaction
were received in July 2003.
The heads of terms signed with P & O Ports
for the development of a ro-ro facility at
Shellhaven lapsed without a formal and
binding contract being concluded. Other
opportunities are under investigation.
Opportunities for deepwater terminals on the
European seaboard are under investigation in
line with the strategy to offer Bidvest’s
customers an extension of the services
performed in South African ports. 
Ropner Ship Management
Ropner Ship Management, based at Dartford,
has continued to maintain the Dartline fleet to
full international safety management
standards. Ropner ensures that all ships
comply with Bureaux Veritas “class”
requirements, ensuring that operational and
maintenance procedures are performed to the
highest standards.
From January 2003, the second and third
Kawasaki vessels operated by Dartline were
chartered to the MoD (the first had been
chartered to the MoD for the previous twelve
months) and two smaller vessels were
chartered in to replace them, increasing both charter turnover and
chartering-in costs.
Property and Outsourced Services
The Traffic Management business was transferred to the Automotive
Services division to maximise synergies with the Rescue and Recovery 
operation.
On turnover of £4.6 million (2001: £13.1 million), the Property and
Outsourced Services operations recorded an operating profit of 
£0.4 million (2001: £0.5 million).
Car Park Management
The Car Park Management unit continues to benefit from a strong
relationship with its principal customer and manages nine car parks in
and around London. The high quality of service provided is recognised
and the business can be expanded within the present management and
resource structure.
Property Management 
The Property Management division offers specialist management services
for the development and management of workspace properties to third
parties, as well as Bidcorp’s substantial operational portfolio. The
division is actively pursuing development opportunities for the Group’s
surplus property assets.
The Group retains an interest in any upliftment in the value of the
Haddenham Airfield site, which was sold in 1999. The planning report in
response to an application to develop the site, which did not increase the
land allocated for further development beyond that already approved, was
released. No consideration will be given by the relevant authorities to
further development of the site within the next three years.
PROSPECTS
The difficult market conditions with pressure on costs and margins, as
are currently being experienced by the automotive industry, are expected
to continue. Management is focused on improving efficiencies in the
Volume Distribution business through process and system upgrades,
BIDCORP PLC

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
(CONTINUED) which will require extensive reorganisation. The Specialist Operations is
well niched and can be expected to perform acceptably. Rescue and
Recovery is now established as a steady performer.
Demand for cross-Channel freight carriage has improved in recent months
and with the return of the three more cost-effective Kawasaki vessels
from charter with the MoD, larger volumes will be able to be carried,
generating increased efficiencies. The Shipping Services division’s results
should improve further.
The Parking Management operation should maintain its profitability and
further contracts are being pursued.
The Property and Outsourced Services division is currently negotiating
the sale of two properties. Should these sales be concluded successfully,
the division expects improved results in the year ahead. 
CLOSING
This has been a difficult period, but Bidcorp is a leaner, more focused
Group than it was eighteen months ago. With a continuation of the
present corrective actions, the balance sheet is expected to strengthen
further, providing a solid base for the exploitation of opportunities as they
arise.
There still remains quite a bit to be done to improve the trading activities
of the Group. Although immediate results might not represent a
substantial improvement, I believe that Bidcorp is close to turning the
corner.

GROUP PERFORMANCE
Turnover from continuing operations was £189.8 million 
(2001: £114.1 million). Turnover from discontinued operations was 
£14.7 million (2001: £15.4 million).
Under difficult trading conditions, particularly in the last six months 
of the reporting period, continuing operations recorded an operating 
profit of £0.8 million, before profit from the sale of assets and
investments of £0.7 million (2001: profit of £0.2 million before
operating exceptional charges of £12.2 million and the loss on the sale
of assets and termination of the logistics business of £0.6 million). 
As published in the interim results in February 2003, a decision was 
taken to close or dispose of the IDM operation and the Ferryline trailer
rental business. Closure of these businesses was completed in the last
six months. The Group also discontinued the vehicle preparation centre
in Goole. The operating losses and total closure costs of these
discontinued operations amounted to £2.9 million (2001: £0.7 million
operating loss). 
Bidcorp disposed of its passive indirect investment in Golden Tide
Corporation, owners of a VLCC, for a profit of £0.4 million. The 
£2.9 million cash proceeds on this sale were received in July 2003 
and will reduce debt going forward.
Until sustainable profits are achieved and reserves are available for
distribution, no dividend can be declared. 
It remains the intention of the Board to apply to the courts, in due
course, for permission to cancel part of Bidcorp’s share premium and
merger reserves. The cancelled amount would be transferred to the
profit and loss reserve to negate the deficit in distributable reserves.  
INTEREST COST
The Group’s interest cost reduced to £1.6 million (2001: £2.7 million),
reflecting the ongoing reduction in Group borrowings. 
Interest in respect of long term funding and lease purchase
arrangements amounted to £0.2 million and £1.1 million (2001:
£0.3 million and £1.3 million), respectively.
FINANCIAL
REPORT
Under difficult trading
conditions, continuing
operations recorded an
operating profit of 
£0.8 million
Kevin Torlage
Group finance officer TAXATION
There is no tax charge for the current period as a result of the net loss
position. The tax credit is primarily due to current year deferred taxation
in the Shipping Services division where tax values are lower than book
values. This credit has been reduced by the settlement of a prior year tax
charge relating to the sale of the Haddenham property.
Bidcorp Shipping Services has the option to enter into the Tonnage Tax
regime, whereby pure shipping profits would become taxable on notional
profits determined by tonnage rather than normal corporate tax rules. We
continue to assess whether or not Bidcorp will benefit from entering into
this regime. 
BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet is strong, despite the costs incurred in restructuring the
operations. After the cash injection of £31.0 million by Bidvest, the net
asset value of the Group has improved to £47.4 million (2001:
£19.5 million) with the net debt gearing reducing to 28% (2001: 209%). 
Net debt has reduced to £13.1 million (2001: £40.7 million), and 
apart from hire purchase debt of £5.5 million, all borrowings have 
been consolidated into a single overdraft facility of which £4.8 million
was undrawn at the end of the period. 
The value of tangible assets has increased to £56.2 million (2001:
£52.8 million). The vehicle replacement programme is up-to-date. 
The Group has also taken direct ownership of the Dart 3 and Dart 4,
previously held in the Rosal SA joint venture.
CASH FLOW
The Group generated £11.5 million from operating activities (2001:
£9.7 million) and £1.6 million from the sale of replaced assets 
(2001: £3.6 million). 
After a period of little or no capital expenditure, the Group spent 
£15.0 million on replacing assets (2001: £4.9 million). 
No new asset finance agreements have been entered into and all capital
expenditure has been funded through cash generation and the overdraft

facility. The existing hire purchase
agreements will be repaid in full in 2005.
TREASURY
The underlying philosophy of the Group’s
treasury policy remains one of risk
management and control. No speculative
transactions were undertaken.
The Group has exposure to the US dollar 
and Euro in its shipping operations. Net
exposures are negated and converted into
sterling on a regular basis. Appropriate
currency hedges are taken out, if required.
No outstanding currency hedges were in
place as at June 30  2003.
The Group has entered into fuel hedges until
the end of December 2003 for its expected
bunker usage in order to limit its exposure 
to the fluctuating oil prices.

INTRODUCTION
Bidcorp’s Automotive Services division provides an extensive range of
services to the automotive industry including volume and specialised
transport, pre-delivery inspection and preparation as well as specialised
transportation of vehicles across the Channel and throughout Europe. The
division is also a significant player in the rescue and recovery industry in
the United Kingdom.
The automotive industry experienced difficult trading conditions resulting
in pressure on margins and strong focus on cost reduction and operational
efficiencies. This is an ongoing process. 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
The Automotive Services division reported turnover of £138.8 million
(2001: £78.8 million) and an operating loss of £2.4 million (2001: operating
loss of £0.6 million). Turnover of £9.9 million (2001: £9.3 million) and
operating losses of £1.9 million (2001: operating loss of £0.4 million), in
respect of discontinued operations, are included in these results. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Volume Distribution
Operating under the brands of Ontime Automotive in the United Kingdom
and SVTV in France, this business provides a portfolio of blue-chip
customers with distribution services from manufacturing plants and
import facilities to their United Kingdom dealer network or, in the case of
export movements, to the port of exit.
The operations in the United Kingdom delivered over 730,000 vehicles
utilising a base fleet of 150 transporters. The continental business operates
a fleet of 150 transporters from its central control function based in
northern France, moving in excess of 290,000 vehicles throughout
western Europe.

The Automotive
operations are
positioned to benefit
from an improvement
in trading conditions In the pursuit of the high level of quality demanded by the industry, all
elements of the business have achieved ISO 9001:9002 accreditation
with certain units having also attained Ford Q1 Quality Status. Conscious
of its duty to minimise the impact of its operations on the environment,
Ontime is in the process of attaining ISO 14001 accreditation for all
operating centres.
Specialist Operations
Specialist Operations encompasses the businesses of Enclosed 
Vehicle Transportation, Vehicle Preparation Centres, Prestige Vehicle
Distribution, Individual Vehicle Movements as well as Rescue and
Recovery and Traffic Management. The Specialist Operations client
portfolio includes the world’s leading prestige car manufacturers.
Enclosed V ehicle Transportation
Specialist Operations also operates under the Ontime Automotive brand
utilising a fleet of 85 enclosed and 23 conventional transporters to
provide specialised automotive transport solutions, moving premier
automotive brands in closed, and sometimes temperature-controlled,
vehicles. The fleet distributes some of the world’s most prestigious
marques and transports engineering test vehicles and prototype clay
models throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. During the period
39,000 vehicles were transported. 
Additional services include the repatriation of vehicles for motoring
organisations between Europe and the United Kingdom. The division has
expanded organically and by the acquisition of the assets of two small
complementary businesses. The acquired businesses have been
successfully integrated and rationalisation benefits achieved.
Vehicle Preparation Centres
Specialist Operations owns and operates vehicle preparation centres
(VPC’s) at Wellesbourne, Teesport and Brentwood. The management
contract for the VPC at Goole was terminated in March 2003. 
During the period under review the VPC’s completed 190,000 pre-
delivery inspections.
AUTOMOTIVE SERVICES
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
17 The Wellesbourne VPC provides storage, pre-
delivery inspection and refurbishment
services to a number of manufacturers, dealer
groups, leasing and contract hire companies.
The Brentwood facility provides a range of
specialist services including market research
clinics, preparation for product launches and
location shoots worldwide, on-site preparation
and support at motor shows and events. 
Ontime’s Wellesbourne VPC was awarded a
three-year contract for the storage, pre-
delivery inspection and delivery of a premium
brand vehicle. The contract is now fully
integrated into the operations of the
Wellesbourne facility. 
The Wellesbourne VPC is seen as integral to
the total automotive services offered by the
Group and a platform for future expansion.
The costs of bringing this unit into profit have
been high. It started returning a profit in the
last month of the period and this improving
trend is expected to continue.
The Ontime Brentwood operations have been
streamlined and a marketing initiative to
increase the spread of this division’s client
base has been put in place. 
Prestige V ehicle Distribution
Ontime’s Prestige Vehicle Distribution
business provides and manages distribution
centres for two premium British vehicle
manufacturers. The Prestige Vehicle
Distribution business receives vehicles from
the manufacturers and arranges the entire
distribution process worldwide, either by
land, sea or air. Given the challenging market conditions, this area of
the business has performed well. New opportunities are being pursued. 
Individual Driver Movements
This loss-making operation was closed at the end of June 2003.
Rescue and Recovery
Ontime Rescue and Recovery provides 24-hour roadside assistance 
and recovery to the major motoring organisations, police authorities
and large fleet operators. The division assists all vehicles, from
motorcycles and family cars to the largest commercial vehicles and
coaches.  
Ontime Rescue and Recovery depots are strategically located adjacent
to the main arterial routes and motorways within the southeast of
England. The division’s fleet of 220 recovery vehicles is fitted with a
vehicle location system and mobile data terminals, which facilitates
communication with the division’s seven control centers, ensuring
rapid responses. 
The division has undergone a thorough review and has been returned 
to profitability. The operations of two small rescue and recovery
businesses were acquired. These operations have been fully 
integrated into the existing business and are expected to further
enhance profits. 
To provide existing clients with a nationwide service, the division has
developed the Ontime Fleet Assistance product, utilising a national
network of vetted subcontractors. This development is expected to
substantially increase the division’s client base.
Traffic Management
Arcade Traffic Management (Arcade) provides parking enforcement
solutions for local authorities and police forces mainly in London and
Sussex. 
The division employs 130 staff and owns 30 enforcement vehicles. 
Arcade operates its own and clients’ vehicle pounds and payment
centres, strategically located within the area of operation.

REVIEW OF 
OPERATIONS
(CONTINUED) New storage facilities within central London have been procured and will
provide additional vehicle pound space and reduce transport costs. 
The parking enforcement business has been integrated into the Rescue
and Recovery division and a complete review of the operations has been
undertaken. The integration of the business has produced substantial cost
savings and the business is expected to make a positive contribution to the
results of the Group in the coming year.
PROSPECTS
The Volume Distribution business is trading in a difficult market but
should benefit from the present actions to improve efficiencies. The
Automotive operations are positioned to benefit from an improvement in
trading conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Bidcorp’s Shipping Services division provides
scheduled daily ro-ro services between its hub
port at Dartford on the Thames to the three
European ports of Vlissingen, Zeebrugge and
Dunkerque.
Apart from the difficult period in the early
months of 2003, freight volumes have grown and
rates on all routes have stabilised or improved. 
However, the rate and volume increases have
not been translated into commensurate profit
growth, due to market weakness in the early
part of 2003 and expenses incurred through the
reorganisation and restructuring of the division,
which involved a change of management in
critical areas as well as training to ensure
employees have the necessary skills.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
In May 2003, the division’s largest volume customer went into
liquidation. A substantial portion of the debt owing has been recovered,
but this unexpected set-back has affected the division’s results to the
extent of £244,000.
The Shipping Services division recorded turnover of £56.3 million 
(2001: £31.4 million) and an operating profit of £0.9 million (2001:
£0.4 million) from continuing operations. The Ferryline operations were
discontinued, accounting for turnover of £4.8 million (2001: £6.2 million)
and an operating loss (including closure costs) of £1.0 million (2001:
£0.3 million operating loss).
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
The Dartford terminal is strategically located and attractive to hauliers to
the London area as it provides time and cost advantages compared to
competitors landing at Dover.
Bidvest, which owns and operates major terminals in Africa, has provided
the resources to assist with the restructuring and reorganisation of the
Shipping Services division.
Dartline
In anticipation of the economic downturn in early 2003, two of the division’s
large Kawasaki vessels were chartered to the MoD to assist with the carriage
of supplies to Iraq. The third Kawasaki vessel had already been chartered to
the MoD for the previous twelve months. Three smaller and cheaper vessels
were chartered in to cater for the expected drop in volume.
The planned revenue earning mix of cargo was not achieved as a result of
the different configuration of the smaller vessels. The planning and
turnaround of these vessels at Dartford also created unexpected problems,
which affected customer confidence.
In June, an accident involving one of our ferries resulted in damage to the
vessel. It was subsequently dry-docked for a week with resultant repair
costs and loss of revenue.
A long term agreement with the Port of Dunkerque guaranteed Bidcorp an
exclusive berth in the port. In addition, a non-strike and support
agreement was signed with the Dunkerque Dockers Union.

Focus in the
coming year will be on
improving the service
offered to clients The scheduled sailings to the port of Zeebrugge, Bidcorp’s busiest route,
were increased from two to three vessels per day.
Negotiations are in progress to allow access to improved facilities in
Vlissingen so that larger, faster ships can be allocated to this route to
improve the ferry service to Holland. If successfully concluded, this
terminal has the potential to become the focus of a deepsea terminal
marketing initiative, targeting cargos which are presently handled by
Bidvest’s terminals in South Africa destined for Europe.
Thames Europort
Important initiatives have taken place at the terminal in Dartford, including
the acquisition of new handling equipment to replace old and costly units
and a new shift structure to give a balanced 24 hours a day/seven days a
week coverage to the terminal. The area available for the handling and
storage of cargo has also been increased by 30% through improved planning
and layout of the terminal.
Entry and exit check-in booths, commissioned in January 2003, are proving
successful and have improved turnarounds, thereby eliminating delays to
customer vehicles.
The new management team at Thames Europort is confident that service
levels will improve and further cost savings will be realised.
Ropner Ship Management
The Group’s specialist vessel management operation, Ropner Ship
Management, manages the Dartline fleet of six multi-purpose ro-ro freight
ferries. 
Direct ownership of the Dart 3 and Dart 4 vessels was acquired out of the
joint venture structure in which they were held. Bidcorp’s 25% share in a
VLCC was sold at a profit of £0.4 million.
PROSPECTS
The Shipping Services division is well positioned to continue providing an
effective ro-ro service in its niche markets on all three European routes.
The focus in the coming year will be to improve the service offered to clients
by reducing vessel turnaround times and re-deploying the larger and better
configured Kawasaki vessels to maintain and improve Dartline’s service.

Outsourced Services
INTRODUCTION
The Traffic Management business was transferred to the Automotive
Services division to maximise synergies with the Rescue and Recovery
operation.
FINANCIAL REVIEW
On turnover of £4.6 million (2001: £13.1 million) the Property and
Outsourced Services division recorded operating profit of £0.4 million
(2001: £0.5 million). By its nature, the property development business
does not generate a smooth income flow and no significant property
transactions took place. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Car Park Management
Arcade Car Parks provides car park management services to owners of car
parks in central London. Services include the provision of staff, cash
handling and season ticket control as well as taxi and valeting services.
The business continued to benefit from a strong relationship with
Westminster City Council. Arcade manages the esteemed Park Lane Car
Park on behalf of Westminster and was awarded two further management
contracts, bringing the division’s total number of car parks managed to
nine. In September 2002, Arcade was again awarded bonuses based on
quality of service and revenue generated through the car parks. The
introduction of the Congestion Charge in central London has had a
detrimental effect on the levels of business in this area.
At the British Parking Association awards ceremony in London during
February 2002, Arcade was voted “Best Off-Street Operator”.

Property Management
Bidcorp’s principal property portfolio has historically comprised of
business centres and workspace units. Although the Group no longer owns
any such assets, it continues to provide property management services to
third-party owners. 
All previous activities of Skillion and Embassy have been combined in
the Bidcorp Property division and the team concentrates on maximising
returns from the existing portfolio. This process includes the development
of property values by enhancing existing planning consents.
The division provides property management services for the Group as a

operational requirements in the short term. They are further engaged in
strategic planning in relation to maximising operational efficiency of the

28 SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDING
The following substantial shareholding, in addition to those of the directors listed on page 27, in the Company’s issued share
capital that have been reported at August 14  2003 is:
Number of Percentage of
ordinary issued share
Name shares capital
The Bidvest Group Limited 142,698,245 57.5%
AUTHORITY TO DIRECTORS TO ALLOT SHARES
The Companies Act 1985 (the ‘Act’) provides that the directors of a company may not allot shares unless empowered to do so
by the shareholders. Under guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) the total nominal value of shares,
which can be allotted, must not exceed the nominal value of the lesser of the amount of authorised unissued share capital or
one-third of the issued share capital of the company at the time such authority was granted. The lesser figure for the Company
is £16,547,960, being one-third of the issued share capital of the Company.
In addition, the Act provides that, unless the shareholders otherwise consent, all new shares to be allotted for cash must, in the
first instance, be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their individual shareholdings. The directors believe it is
desirable that they should continue to have authority to make exclusions or other arrangements in connection with a rights issue
and resolve any legal or practical problems that may arise. The rights to which those excluded would otherwise be entitled will
be sold for their benefit. In order to meet any special circumstances the directors also consider that they should continue to have
the ability to make small allotments of equity shares for cash, limited to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company, being
£2,482,194 nominal share capital, to persons other than existing shareholders.
Accordingly, resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company to renew the existing authorities held
by the directors for a further five years. The directors have no present intention to utilise such authorities (except in relation to
the satisfaction of employee share options).
PURCHASE BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SHARES
The directors believe that it is desirable that the Company should continue to have authority to purchase its own shares up to
15% of the issued share capital of the Company and accordingly a special resolution will be proposed at the annual general
meeting of the Company to renew the existing authority. Shareholders will also be invited to renew such authority at subsequent
annual general meetings.
The Directors will only undertake purchases of the Company’s own shares after paying due attention to the effects on assets and
earnings per share for the remaining shareholders and when it would be advantageous to give the remaining shareholders a
greater interest in the assets and profits of the Company. The resolution proposed would only enable the Company to purchase
its own shares on the London Stock Exchange and will not permit payment of more than 5% above the average of the middle
market quotations taken from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for five business days before purchase is made,
nor less than 20 pence per share exclusive of expenses.
The Company would not be able to enter into contracts with individual shareholders directly for the purchase of shares. Any
purchases by the Company of its own shares will result in the cancellation of those shares. The Company did not purchase any
ordinary shares for cancellation during the period (2001: nil).
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 29 BIDCORP PLC
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Group is committed to high standards of corporate governance.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for corporate governance and this statement describes how the
relevant principles of governance have been applied to the Company.
APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES SET OUT IN THE COMBINED CODE
The Board is responsible for both the strategic direction and overall management of the Group, and comprises three executive
and nine non-executive directors. Mr ARCB Cooke served as the senior independent director during the period and in this
capacity he provided a focus for the non-executive directors to express any concerns. The chairman has responsibility for
managing the Board.
The chief executive, to whom the executive directors report, has responsibility for the management of the Group. Each director
is encouraged to consult the Company secretary and Group legal adviser for advice on legal and regulatory matters relating to
the Group and on matters of Board procedure. Any director wishing to obtain independent, professional advice is entitled to do
so after consultation with the chairman, Company secretary and Group legal adviser.
The biographies of the members of the Board appear on pages 4 and 5. The range of business and financial skills demonstrated
is reviewed on an ongoing basis and is considered suitable and relevant for the activities of the Group. Arrangements are in
place for directors to receive appropriate training, if required, both on appointment to the Board and on an ongoing basis.
The Articles of Association require one-third of the directors to retire by rotation in each year and submit themselves for 
re-election. At the forthcoming annual general meeting Messrs EA Worrall, DA Winduss, SD Bender and IR Spry retire by
rotation and, being eligible, it will be proposed at the annual general meeting that they are re-elected. Messrs BP Connellan 
and ARCB Cooke, who were both appointed since the last annual general meeting, also retire and, being eligible, it will be
proposed at the annual general meeting that they are both re-elected.
The Board has scheduled meetings four times per year and will otherwise meet, as required. A number of matters are
specifically reserved for decision by the Board. These include approval of the annual budget and of significant capital
expenditure, and acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries, investments and businesses. The dates of those meetings and the
directors’ attendance are detailed below:

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
FOR THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30  2003
(CONTINUED)
30 The non-executive directors of the main Board have not met without the chairman or executives present during this period, but
the non-executive members of the Audit Committee have met with the auditors without the executive directors being in
attendance.
Remuneration and Nomination and Audit Committees have been established to assist the Board.
The chairman of each of these committees will be available at the annual general meeting to answer questions. A report on
remuneration, which sets out the approach to the application of the principles of the Combined Code on remuneration matters,
is set out on pages 34 to 37.
For the period ended June 30  2003, some members of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee
were independent non-executive directors. Suitable candidates for appointment as directors were selected by the chief executive
in consultation with the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The committee submitted its recommendations to the
Board, which made the final appointment. The Audit Committee assists the Board in the discharge of its responsibilities for
corporate governance, financial reporting and corporate control.
Prior to each meeting the directors receive information relevant to the business of the meeting, including management
information on the operating, financial and trading position of the Group and risk, control, health and safety and environmental
issues requiring attention.
The Board also receives information in respect of general and specific economic trends, technical and legal matters, and
competitive activity relevant to each of its principal business units. The Board is satisfied with the form, quality, timing and
appropriateness of the information it receives. The Board regularly meets with the senior management of each principal
business unit to discuss and evaluate significant operational, business and financial matters. Special reports are provided in
respect of specific issues concerning the business unit or Group generally. 
The Company meets regularly with its institutional shareholders and is keen to encourage shareholder participation at the
annual general meeting. Proxy votes will be disclosed following a show of hands on each resolution. The practice of not
bundling resolutions together will be continued. A summary of the discussion at the annual general meeting will be made
available to shareholders on request.
The application of the Combined Code principles on accountability and audit is set out in the paragraphs following the
Statement of Compliance. The Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities and the Auditors’ Report appear on page 33 and 
page 65, respectively.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The Company has complied during the period ended June 30  2003 with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. An internal audit function
was implemented during the period.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
There is a clearly defined organisational structure within which individual responsibilities are identified in relation to both
internal operational controls and financial controls. The structure is complemented by policies laid down in Group manuals and
management is required to confirm that they operate the business in compliance with these policies. The policies include strict
rules for the operation of the relevant businesses, compliance with health and safety and environmental legislation, and the
authorisation and approval of both trading and capital expenditure. The internal control procedures established are designed to
ensure that the Board is able to identify, evaluate and manage business risks, whilst not unduly restricting normal commercial
activities.
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
DIRECTORS’ REPORT 31 BIDCORP PLC
IDENTIFICATION OF BUSINESS RISK
The Board regularly assesses the current and expected future business risks affecting both the principal business units and the
Group as a whole. The review of business risks is discussed on a regular basis with senior management in each of the Group’s
main activities. Policies and procedures have been laid down for the regular identification and management of these risks.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
There is a comprehensive budgeting system with a business plan approved by the Board each year. Each month management
accounts, containing actual and budget results and revised forecasts for the year, are prepared and reported to the Board.
These monthly management accounts analyse and explain variances against budget and report additionally on key financial
indicators: business development and economic and emerging market issues, health and safety issues including notification of
any serious incidents or trend thereon, environmental legislation and compliance thereto, and employment regulation and issues.
MAIN CONTROL PROCEDURES
The Group has defined procedures and financial controls, designed to ensure the reporting of complete and accurate accounting
information and cover systems for obtaining authority for major transactions and for ensuring compliance with laws and
regulations that have significant financial implications.
Procedures are also in place to ensure that assets are subject to proper physical controls and that the organisation remains
structured to ensure an appropriate level of segregation of duties. Together these procedures support a control culture, which the
Board considers to be suitable and commensurate with the size and activities of the Group.
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls. The Board is satisfied that the internal
control procedures established relate to an appropriate range of issues concerning the Group, recognising that these controls
provide a reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that all significant issues are identified and reported, and corrective action
quickly taken, where necessary. The Board regularly reviews the nature and scope of internal controls established by the Group
as the Group develops and as significant economic and regulatory issues arise.
MONITORING
The monitoring of financial control procedures is achieved through management reviews with the relevant responsible executive
director reporting to the Board on a regular basis.
During the eighteen months to June 30  2003 and to the date of signing the financial statements, the Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s systems of internal operational and financial controls in consultation with the internal auditors,
Audit Committee, executive directors and the external auditors. The scope of internal controls instigated enables the Board to
respond quickly to emerging problems, incidents and significant issues arising.
POLITICAL AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group made no political contributions during the period (2001: £Nil) and made no charitable contributions during the
period (2001: £1,000).
PERSONNEL
Employment policies are designed to provide equal opportunities irrespective of colour, ethnic or national origin, nationality,
sex, and mental or physical disability. Full consideration is given to the employment, training and career development of
disabled persons and employees who become disabled. Information on the Group’s affairs is disseminated through the operating
entities’ management.
REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
FOR THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30  2003
(CONTINUED)
32 ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY REVIEW
The Health & Safety Committee comprises of the executive directors, chaired by Ian Spry, is scheduled to meet three times per
annum and reports directly to the Board. Throughout the period under review Environmental, Health and Safety was monitored
and developed with a focus on improving systems and documentation. 
During the period there were no significant health, safety or environmental incidents.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
The Group seeks to obtain credit terms from suppliers that are in the best interests of the Group. Payments to suppliers are
made within a reasonable period of the invoice being received and within the terms obtained from that supplier. Creditor days
for the parent company were 34 (2001: 42). However, given the nature of these transactions, in the directors’ opinion it is more
meaningful to consider the creditor days for the Group. Group creditor days were 40 (2001: 46).
DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period, which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at the end of the period, and of the profit or loss for the period then ended. In
preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the
financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
AUDITORS
Deloitte & Touche were appointed as auditors on May 28  2002 following the resignation of PricewaterhouseCoopers. 
On August 1  2003, Deloitte & Touche transferred their business to Deloitte & Touche LLP, a limited liability partnership
incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000. The Company's consent has been given to treating the
appointment of Deloitte & Touche as extending to Deloitte & Touche LLP with effect from August 1  2003 under the provisions
of section 26(5) of the Companies Act 1989. A resolution to re-appoint Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company’s auditor will
be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT 33 RESPONSIBILITY (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has responsibility for approving all elements of the executive directors’

the remuneration of executive Board members and senior members of staff.
COMBINED CODE (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Company complied throughout the period with Section 1(B) of the Principles of Good Governance on directors’
remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules. In framing its remuneration policy the Committee has also given full consideration
to all of the matters referred to in Section 1(B) of the Code of Best Practice.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
The Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 requires the presentation of a graph of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
compared to an appropriate comparator index over a five-year period. The graph below represents the TSR for Bidcorp plc against

for this purpose.
POLICY (UNAUDITED INFORMATION)
Directors’ pay is set to be competitive with market rates and designed to be motivational, whilst remaining in the best interests
of shareholders. The committee consults with independent firms for advice on remuneration and benefit matters, where
necessary.  The elements of the remuneration package for executive directors are basic salary and benefits, pensions and
participation in the Company’s share option scheme. The basic salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually with regard
to personal performance, company performance, changes in responsibilities and competitive market practices.
Messrs RW Graham (Group chief executive), IR Spry (managing director, Volume Distribution) and DA Winduss (managing
director, Property and Outsourced Services) are employed under six-month rolling service agreements.

ANNUAL REPORT 2003
REMUNERATION & NOMINATION COMMITTEE 35 On November 22  2001, Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan and DA Winduss entered into a variation agreement with Bidcorp
(formerly Jacobs Holdings plc) that, subject to the issue of the ‘Subscription Shares’ as defined in the Circular and Listing
Particulars to shareholders approved on January 2  2002, any obligation that any member of the Bidcorp group had to make any
pension contribution in respect of Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss would terminate and any right that 
Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss had to participate in any pension scheme operated by the Group would cease,
save as in relation to the entitlement to require their employing Group company to contribute £2.00 for every £1.00 they
contributed to a money purchase pension arrangement designated by Messrs MJ Kingshott, PM Pascan or DA Winduss. This
contribution would be up to a maximum employer contribution of ten per cent of their pensionable salary per annum with effect
from November 1  2001.
The other remaining active members of the Jacobs Holdings Defined Benefit Scheme also entered into similar arrangements
with the Company at this date. This arrangement has resulted in both Defined Benefit Schemes that are operated by the Group

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF TOTAL
RECOGNISED GAINS AND LOSSES
RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENTS IN 
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
1.1 Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of
certain tangible assets, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards. A summary of the principal
Group accounting policies is set out below.
1.2 Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to June 30  2003. The
Group equity accounts for its interests in associates.
1.3 Acquisitions, disposals and goodwill
Subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements at their fair value at the date of acquisition. From
January 1  1998, any excess of consideration paid over the fair values of the net assets acquired is capitalised and shown
under the balance sheet heading, ‘Intangible Assets’, and amortised equally over its expected useful economic life, which
does not exceed 20 years. Where a potential impairment to the carrying value of goodwill and investments in subsidiary
undertakings is indicated, a detailed review of current carrying values is performed and provision made, if necessary.
Before January 1  1998, such goodwill was debited to reserves, including the merger reserve, where permitted by s131 of
the Companies Act 1985.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the net proceeds are compared to the carrying value of the subsidiary, including
any goodwill arising on the acquisition of the subsidiary to the extent that this has not already been written off in the
profit and loss account. Any difference is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The financial results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included within the
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or to the date of disposal.
1.4 Turnover
The amount receivable from transport services and agency services is recognised when the services are completed.
Charter hire income from vessels, property rental, property service charge income and property management fees are
recognised in the period to which they relate. Turnover on property development is recognised on exchange of contracts.
Turnover excludes value added tax.
1.5 Investment income
Dividend income on listed investments is accounted for when the investment is listed as ex dividend. Income from
unlisted investments is accounted for on receipt.
1.6 Tangible fixed assets
With the exception of Investment Properties (see policy 1.8), all tangible fixed assets are stated at cost. Fixed assets are
reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that impairment has occurred. The Group capitalises major vessel
maintenance costs as a tangible fixed asset, which is amortised over the period to the next planned vessel maintenance date.
Fixed assets acquired under hire purchase agreements are capitalised and the related obligations included in creditors.
1.7 Depreciation
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided to write down the cost of these assets to their estimated residual value
over their anticipated useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold land Nil
Investment properties Nil
Operating properties 50 years
Vessels and improvements Life of vessel or period of charter 
Planned vessel maintenance 30 months
Hardstanding 50 years
Equipment and motor vehicles 3 to 10 years
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30  2003

BIDCORP PLC 1.8 Investment properties
Property held for leasing to third parties is treated as investment property. In accordance with SSAP 19 (revised)
Accounting for Investment Properties:
1.8.1 investment properties are revalued annually and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to/from a revaluation
reserve, except that where the diminutions in value (or their reversal) are expected to be permanent, these are charged to
the profit and loss account; and
1.8.2 no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties or leasehold investment
properties, where the unexpired term is twenty years or more.
The treatment of certain of the Group's investment properties is a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act
concerning depreciation of fixed assets. However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and
the directors consider that systematic depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the financial statements to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount, which might
otherwise have been shown, cannot be separately identified or quantified.
The purchase or sale of investment properties is recognised on the date that contracts are exchanged.
1.9 Investments
Fixed asset investments, including listed investments, are stated in the accounts at the lower of cost or directors’
valuation, less provision for impairment.
1.10 Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and construction work in progress have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (including an
appropriate proportion of overheads) from which payments received and receivable are deducted. Finance costs incurred
on borrowings to fund specific property developments are capitalised during the period of construction.
1.11 Hire purchase agreements
Assets acquired under hire purchase agreements have been capitalised and included in fixed assets. The capital amount
of future rental payments is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account in
proportion to the balance of the capital.
1.12 Operating leases
The rental charges of operating leases in respect of land and buildings, vessels and other assets are charged to the profit
and loss account as incurred.
1.13 Deferred taxation
In accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Taxation, deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that
have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that result in an obligation to
pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which
timing differences reverse, based on the tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
1.14 Translation of foreign currencies
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. The trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rate applying during the
period. Transactions effected in overseas currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of
the transaction.
ANNUAL REPORT 2003
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 43 Exchange differences, offset by corresponding exchange hedging transactions, arising on the revaluation of the net assets
of subsidiaries at the period-end, are dealt with through reserves. Other exchange gains and losses, also offset by hedging
transactions where appropriate, are accounted for through the profit and loss account.
1.15 Pension schemes
The Group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The amount of contribution payable to the
defined contribution scheme is charged to the profit and loss account in respect of the accounting period to which it
relates.
In accordance with FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, the Group includes the net assets and liabilities of its pension schemes
in its financial statements at market value. Current service costs, curtailment and settlement gains and losses, and
financial returns are included in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate. Other gains and losses on
assets and liabilities of the schemes are recorded through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
1.16 Comparative figures
The Group has changed its year-end to June 30. The current reporting period is an eighteen-month period, however all
comparative figures are for the last twelve-month period ended December 31  2001.

The lender of a loan raised to finance an investment property has agreed to limit the repayment of the loan and rolled-up
interest thereon to the proceeds arising from the ultimate sale of the particular property (‘ring-fenced property’) and to
forego any claim for the balance remaining unpaid. Consequently, the loan (including rolled-up interest) amounting to 
£1 at June 30  2003 (December 31  2001: £1) has been reduced to the book value of the relevant property.
Overdrafts bear interest at rates of 1% over LIBOR or foreign equivalents.

Fair values
There are no material differences between the book value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities and the fair value
as at June 30  2003.
Foreign currency hedges
The Group enters into certain forward foreign currency contracts and ship fuel forward purchase contracts with a view to
hedging future contracted payments and purchases. Gains and losses on these are not recognised until the exposure being
hedged is itself recognised. The Group had outstanding ship fuel forward purchase contracts at a capped commitment of
$1,994k subject to a minimum commitment of $1,494k floor in respect of the equivalent quantity of fuel. There were no
unrecognised or deferred gains or losses at the year-end. The contract expires on December 31  2003.
Undrawn committed borrowing facilities
At June 30  2003 the Group had undrawn ongoing committed facilities, expiring within one year, of £4,837k 
(2001: £3,015k) to fund the Group’s operations.

29. PENSION COMMITMENTS
The Group operates both a defined contribution and two defined benefit schemes covering all eligible employees and

independently administered funds. The total pension cost of the Group in respect of the defined contribution schemes was
£405k (2001: £610k).
COMPOSITION OF GROUP SCHEMES
The Group operates two defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom. A full actuarial valuation was carried out at
September 30  2002 and December 31  2002 for the respective schemes and updated to June 30  2003 by a qualified
independent actuary. Since November 30  2001 both schemes were closed to new entrants and have no active members.

The value of insured annuity liabilities and assets had not previously been included in these statements, on the basis that
the amount added to the value of liabilities would equal the value of the corresponding asset. However, it has now been
decided to incorporate these values in order to give a clearer indication of the funding level of the scheme. Thus, the
market value of the scheme assets and the present value of the scheme liabilities, as previously disclosed, have both been
increased by £8,771k at December 31  2001.

financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for
the preparation of the other information contained in the annual report including the directors’ remuneration report. Our
responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been
audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial
statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with
the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with
the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors’ report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above period as described in the
contents section including the unaudited part of the directors’ remuneration report and consider the implications for our report if
we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and
the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud
or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information
in the financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report described as having been audited.

An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether 
any changes may have occurred to the financial statements since first published. These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control 
procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.  St Ives is a unique group of market-leading companies that come together to create the most 
comprehensive and diverse range of marketing services and print solutions available in the UK.
Equipped with a wealth of experience in the retail, publishing and commercial markets, our

By following our focused strategy over the next three years we aim to grow , diversify and 
reshape the business to enable us to enhance our customer value propositions. Our goal is 
to provide publishing and marketing solutions which are second to none whilst adding value 
for our stakeholders.

Chairman’s Statement
This is the first statement since I took over the 
Chairmanship from Miles Emley who stood down 
at the end of April.
Miles Emley
Miles had been on the board of St Ives since 1992. For 
most of his 19 years on the board he was either Executive 
or Non-Executive Chairman. The board and the Company 
owe him an enormous debt of gratitude for his exemplary 
service and contribution to the Company.
Strategic Development and Performance
The last 12 months have seen important strides forward 
for St Ives. The board continues to re-affirm the strategy 
for the Company of strengthening our position in more 
attractive and higher growth marketing services activities 
where our strong customer relations can be reinforced by 
offering a focused portfolio of high added-value print and 
marketing services, and of moving away from commoditised 
print markets.
Our acquisition of Tactical Solutions in February and 
our divestment of the Magazine printing business in 
April were important milestones in changing the shape  
of the business. Since the financial year end two further 
acquisitions – Response One and Pragma – have further 
advanced the creation of a significant and differentiated 
marketing services offering. We anticipate further strong 
evidence of the implementation of the strategy over the 
next few years.
Investing in  
our business
“ Great efforts have been 
made to concentrate 
on those segments 
of the market where 
customers’ needs 
match our capabilities.”
Richard Stillwell
Chairman  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 5
 
The Executive team has made excellent progress in 
delivering important strategic changes whilst at the same 
time improving the performance of the Group’s remaining 
print activities, and this will remain their key area of focus 
in the foreseeable future.
The Board and Staff
Tony Stuart joined the board as a non-executive director 
in January. For many years Tony worked with Rothschild 
and for part of that time acted as advisor to St Ives.  
He has retired from Rothschild and is therefore an 
independent director. We welcome him to the board  
and look forward to his contribution. In April he was 
appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Mike Butterworth remains as Chairman of the 
Audit Committee and Simon Marquis is Senior 
Independent Director.
During the year the board established a Nomination 
Committee, which I shall chair, and approved terms of 
reference for it. The board also re-affirmed the strong 
ethical standards expected throughout the Company 
in the context of a code for compliance with the recently 
enacted Bribery Act.
The board takes a particular interest in the health  
and safety of all the Group’s employees. There is an 
unequivocal message from the board that health and 
safety is the number one priority. The executive directors 
are constantly ensuring that this message is understood 
and acted upon throughout the organisation.
On behalf of the board I would like to thank all members 
of staff for their ongoing support and commitment.  
Periods of economic uncertainty and structural change 
bring particular challenges and the loyalty of the 
workforce is much valued.
Current Trading and Outlook
The UK economy remains in the doldrums. Print demand 
as a whole remains sluggish. However, as some of our 
customers take initiatives to generate demand there are 
some bright spots. Solutions provided by our newly 
acquired marketing services businesses are in demand. 
A new multi-million pound print and services contract  
with HSBC, won against strong competition, is coming on 
stream in the next few months. The Olympics are likely to 
provide a backdrop for significant marketing initiatives in 
a number of sectors which will lead to enhanced demand 
for products and services provided by St Ives.
Our intention is to use our strong balance sheet to 
continue to acquire and invest in quality businesses to 
reinforce our enhanced marketing services offering and  
to ensure robust and resilient performance in the long 
term. At the same time, management are continuing  
to focus on cost and manufacturing efficiencies in our 
print operations.
The board remains confident that the reshaping of the 
business around a differentiated marketing services 
business will generate stronger returns, with the drive 
for increased efficiencies in the retained print businesses 
further underpinning performance.

Chief Executive’s Performance Review
Expanding  
our capabilities
“ The Group continues to 
restructure its activities  
and implement plans to 
reposition the business.”
Patrick Martell
Chief Executive
We are pleased to report further significant financial 
progress, the continued development of our marketing 
services capabilities and the ongoing success in 
repositioning the business away from commoditised  
print markets.
We have again taken action to reduce our costs and 
improve efficiencies in our print operations whilst  
investing for growth in our marketing services businesses. 
Further to the recent acquisition of Tactical Solutions  
we are delighted to have announced the acquisition 
of Response One and Pragma Consulting. As with our 
previous acquisitions they are strong businesses with 
excellent management teams, have potential to grow  
and are a great fit with our strategic reshaping.
We finished the year with a cash balance of £16.3 million 
despite the cash cost of the ongoing restructuring and  
the acquisition of Tactical Solutions. In addition, we are 
pleased to have once again further strengthened the 
balance sheet with net assets increasing by £6.7 million  
to £136.6 million.
The board recommends a final dividend of 3.50p making 
a full year dividend of 5.25p (3.50p in 2010). If approved, 
the final dividend will be paid on 23 December 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at 2 December 2011, with  
an ex-dividend date of 30 November 2011.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 7
 
Trading conditions during the year continued to be 
very tough as the economic climate remained subdued. 
Underlying Group revenue of £296.8 million was 1.8% 
higher compared to the previous year as our marketing 
services segment offset the decline in print revenues.  
We have made further significant progress in improving 
the underlying operating profits of the business to  
£21.3 million (2010 – £18.8 million) and we are pleased 
that progress has been made in both reporting segments 
due to the actions taken to reduce costs and improve 
manufacturing efficiencies in the print operations  
and the investment made to grow our marketing  
services segment. 
Print
Our Print operations represented 95.3% of Group  
external sales for the year. This comprises the Books; 
Exhibition and Events; Point of Sale and Direct Response 
and Commercial print businesses.

Print total revenue before

Print operating profit before  
non-underlying items 20,870 18,966 
Books
The Group’s book business accounted for 27.3% of  
the Print segment revenues. Sales were down by  
3.3% compared to the previous year at £77.1 million  
(2010 – £79.7 million) but once again we benefited from  
increased market share and growth in our added value 
and distribution services. Actions taken to improve 
manufacturing efficiencies and reduce costs mitigated  
the impact of lower revenues and the business continues 
to perform very well. 
The investments into digital print and print-on-demand 
continue to be very successful and we are delighted to 
have made a further strategic and unique investment  
in digital production. Working with our technology 
partners, we have invested in an integrated digital  
system which significantly extends the run length  
at which digital production is a better solution than 
conventional manufacture. 
Our strategy is to provide services that enable our 
customers to profitably produce physical books in smaller 
quantities, ensure their availability, deliver them directly 
and in so doing minimise the risk associated with holding 
stock. We continue to assess the impact upon volumes 
from eBook sales which remain at levels lower than  
those reported in the US. We are very confident that our 
ongoing investment in this business will ensure we remain 
the market leader, are able to respond to the dynamic 
changes in this market place and continue to increase  
our market share. We have renewed a number of our 
contracts during the year including that with Hachette.
Being able to provide extensive conventional and digital 
production, an integrated warehouse facility and post 
production services from a single point enables us to 
provide a unique service whilst reducing the cost and 
time of fulfilment. As a result of our superior levels of 
service and reliability, we have again produced the 
majority of the bestselling books which included the 
following titles:
For Penguin ‘How hard can it be?’ by Jeremy Clarkson 
and ‘Life and Laughing’ by Michael Macintyre; for Hodder 
‘One Day’ by David Nicholls; for Headline ‘The Family’ by 
Martina Cole; for Little, Brown ‘Post Mortuary’ by Patricia 
Cornwell; for Transworld ‘Madeleine’ by Kate McCann; for 
HarperCollins ‘The Corrections’ by Jonathan Franzen; for 
Bloomsbury ‘The Finkler Question’ (Booker prize winner) 
by Howard Jacobson; for Random House ‘A journey’ by 
Tony Blair; and for Orion ‘The Tiger’s Wife’ (Orange prize 
winner) by Téa Obreht.
Exhibitions and Events
Sales for the exhibitions, events and outdoor media 
business represented 12.3% of Print segment sales.
Sales of £34.8 million (2010 – £31.3 million) were 11.4% 
ahead of last year but the margins were impacted by the 
short-term cost and disruption caused by the move of our 
principal site from Wandsworth to Chessington. The move 
has been completed successfully and the business is  
well placed to benefit from this new facility and ahead of 
the increased activity associated with the 2012 London 
Olympics. In addition to the new facility, we have invested 
in additional digital output and implemented a new IT 
system for the business. 8 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Chief Executive’s Performance Review continued
Point of Sale
Point of sale material for the UK retailers and international 
brands represented 30.3% of Print segment sales at 
£85.7 million (2010 – £81.8 million). Demand continued  
to be resilient albeit the pressure on margins remained 
intense. We have invested in additional digital output 
capacity during the year and remain the market leader.
Direct Response and Commercial
Direct response and commercial printing accounted for 
30.1% of sales in the Print segment. Market conditions 
continued to be extremely challenging and excess 
capacity and a trend to marketeers spending on alternative 
media again exerted downward pressure on prices. As a 
result we have taken action to reduce our costs, improve 
efficiencies and reduce capacity.
Sales in the direct response and commercial businesses 
fell significantly compared to the previous year at  
£85.1 million (2010 – £97.8 million). The impact upon 
operating profit was mitigated by the actions taken to 
reduce costs. We continue to keep this business under 
close review given its exposure to commoditised  
print markets.
Marketing Services
Marketing Services, which accounted for approximately 
4.7% of external sales, includes our data management 
business, Occam, our recently acquired field marketing 
business, Tactical Solutions, and our organically grown 
consultancy offerings.

Occam is a leading supplier of marketing management 
software and innovative data-driven solutions for direct 
marketing. Occam represented 48.5% of Marketing 
Services sales at £6.8 million (2010 – £0.9 million) of 
revenue. We have invested significantly in this business 
during the financial year to ensure that we have a stronger 
base both in terms of people and infrastructure that will 
support our growth plans. We have recently secured  
new contract wins with the RAC, Albemarle & Bond and  
a partnership agreement with IBM as a reseller.
Our strategic

Our goal is to grow and 
diversify the business  
while adding value to all

We continue to invest to build this business and our 
overall capabilities within the market for data-driven 
insight and business intelligence. We are delighted 
with the acquisition of Response One, completed on 
14 September 2011, which will add further scale and 
capability in this growing market. Established in 1998, 
Response One is one of the UK’s leading and fastest 
growing data marketing businesses. The business helps 
its clients to design and deliver effective customer and 
prospect communications through more intelligent use of 
data. Principal services include specialist media buying 
and sales; improving data quality and insight; strategic 
campaign planning; and print management. By integrating 
these services into one solution, Response One has created 
a unique offering that has transformed multi-channel 
marketing activities for organisations across the UK.
Field Marketing
Tactical Solutions was acquired in February 2011 and 
represented 51.5% of Marketing Services revenue at  
£7.2 million. The business is one of the UK’s leading  
and fastest growing field marketing companies working 
with major brands and retailers to drive sales in store.  
Its ability to deploy a nationwide team of highly skilled 
sales professionals enables the business to deliver 
measurable return on investment for its clients within  
the retail and FMCG sector. 
Consultancy Services
Our acquisition of Pragma on 20 September 2011,  
a leading high growth consultancy specialising in  
retail and consumer markets, is a further step to extend 
our services within these markets. We believe there  
are opportunities for the Group to provide products  
and services that help drive sales by understanding, 
predicting and influencing consumer behaviour.  
Pragma are unique in combining rigorous analytical work 
with innovative ideas and commercial implementation 
skills. Their key strength is in understanding how 
customers behave and what motivates them to buy. 
Pragma will add significant strength to our organically 
grown consultancy offerings where we have invested 
during this financial year. 
St Ives will grow its marketing services, print and book production businesses through a strategy to develop a range of 
services and a toolbox of delivery capabilities that will cover all aspects of the supply chain for below-the-line marketing 
activity and all aspects of production and distribution of digital and physical books.
Utilising our unique breadth of capability in marketing solutions and publishing solutions we will deliver improved return 
on investment for our customers. 10 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Chief Executive’s Performance Review continued
Balance sheet
The balance sheet has been further strengthened during 
the year and the Group continues to be very well invested; 
as a result, capital expenditure was again lower than 
depreciation at £8.9 million. Underlying cash flow remains 
robust and the year ended with a positive cash balance of 
£16.3 million (2010 – net debt £2.7 million), an excellent 
performance given the impact on cash of funding the cost 
reduction actions and the acquisition of Tactical Solutions, 
partially offset by the proceeds on the sale of the 
Magazine printing business.
We disposed of sites in Edenbridge and our London  
head office during the year and continue to hold a surplus 
property for sale in Crayford. 
The Group’s strong financial position, even after the 
recent acquisitions of Response One and Pragma, 
ensures we have the necessary flexibility to invest to 
improve our business and take advantage of further 
suitable acquisition opportunities to deliver our strategy.
Strategy
Our results this year show that we have made further 
progress in restructuring our current business, developing 
our marketing services segment, and improving 
efficiencies in our existing print businesses. We have 
invested in those businesses where we will continue to 
generate acceptable margins and exited markets where 
we do not believe it will be possible to generate a 
satisfactory return on investment, thereby reducing our 
exposure to commoditised markets. Most importantly we 
are making significant progress in building a different 
business model and revenue stream in marketing 
services following the acquisition of Occam, Tactical 
Solutions, Response One and Pragma in addition to  
our ongoing investment to build our organically grown 
non-print offerings. Our businesses are well invested and 
given the changed business model, capital expenditure 
going forward will remain at these lower levels. 
The Group benefits from strong relationships with blue 
chip organisations across a number of markets. Within the 
Print segment we continue to invest to extend the offering 
to our book publishers beyond just manufacture, to 
enable us to produce only in quantities that need to be 
printed and made available for sale, when and where 
required. In addition, we have invested in print to support 
our marketing services offering but not where print is 
differentiated by price alone. 
We will continue to build upon our offering of non-print 
services both through acquisition and organic 
development. We are very pleased with the quality and 
Key performance indicators
The board uses a range of key 
performance indicators (‘KPIs’) to 
measure past performance and as 
a basis for future planning. The 
most significant KPIs used by the 
Group are financial which are set 
out below and reflect the priorities 
and focus of the board. Those KPIs 
in respect of environmental and 
employee matters are referred to in 
the report on Corporate and Social 
Responsibility included within the 
consolidated financial statements.

range of our services that provide efficient and effective 
execution of marketing campaigns across a number of 
markets and for blue chip organisations. Our ability to 
provide products, services and insight that influence 
consumer behaviour and drive sales is essential to being 
able to demonstrate a return on investment to marketeers, 
retailers and brand owners. 
The recently won contract with HSBC supports our 
decision to invest in building a Group sales team able  
to provide a range of services from a single point. 
Outlook
The Group has made good progress in improving the 
performance of those print businesses that support our 
marketing services offering whilst reducing its exposure  
to commoditised markets. Through acquisition we have, 
and will continue to build, a significant and broad offering 
that drives the effectiveness of multi channel marketing 
across a range of markets. Trading conditions within our 
traditional print markets, as a result of both cyclical and 
structural changes, remain extremely difficult and we do 
not expect these pressures to ease in the foreseeable 
future. We will keep the cost base and performance of 
these businesses under review and will not hesitate to 
take further action if required.
We are very pleased with our progress and performance 
in the current economic climate as we continue to invest 
to reposition the business for the future. We start the  
new financial year having again improved our financial 
performance and have made good progress in executing 
our strategy. We are confident that the actions we have 
taken to date and the strategy we are pursuing will ensure 
the Group continues to prosper. Our financial strength  
will enable us to continue to invest and reposition the 
business despite the current economic conditions  
and in the face of ongoing structural changes to our 
traditional businesses.
We believe that within the next three years 30 to 40% of 
the Group’s profit will derive from our Marketing Services 
segment and that, despite the challenging climate, we will 
be able to continue to invest for the long term benefit of 
our shareholders.

Reshaping our business
We are refocusing and reorganising our business. Today we are a unique group of 
market-leading companies that combine to provide the UK’s most diverse range of

Our businesses complement each other perfectly: specialists in their own right but 
there to support the Group and create a portfolio of marketing services unequalled  
in the UK.
The following pages illustrate how we are reshaping our business through our growth 
strategy initiatives and developing the Group’s publishing and marketing services in 
line with our customer value proposition.

Bacardi (Brown Forman Br B ands) sought to 
develop a flexible Point of Sa ale le (POS) solution
for two product lines, Eristof ff f Vo Vodk dka and 
Bacardi Breezer . The brand w wis ishe hed d to to 
increase message engagemen ent t at at t the h 
point of purchase and promote a a hi high gher r 
awareness of the products. Bacar ardi 
employed St Ives Digital Media to pr provide 
a more efficient alternative to static P POS O 
which would be more effective at cap ptu turi ring n 
audiences’ attention.
Response
Digital Media’s response was to provide an innovat tiv v i e 
way of engaging shoppers in a retail environment b by y 
deploying its latest e-paper technology which provides es s 
animated imagery and messaging at POS. The display ys s s 
can hold a range of changeable data and are ideal 
for communicating price promotions; the ability to 
change price data quickly and simply, was believed 
to be very beneficial to both Bacardi and the retailer. 
The lightweight e-paper displays have very low power 
consumption and are powered by rechargeable lithium 
ba atteries, providing five months’ of power at a time.
Outc t ome
The campaigns were carried out with Wineflair st stores in 
No N rt rthern Ireland and were regarded as very successful 
by by t he chain’s Marketing Manager, Andrea Carson, 
“T The he e e-p paper campaigns have demonstrated clear 
sa sales  an nd operational benefits. The technology require res s
littl le m man anag a ement whilst the price-change capability 
ha has al llo lowe wed us u to react more quickly to market demand d

Up to a 79 79% % in increase s in sales of Eristoff was achieved, 
whilst Bacard di B Bre r ezer has increased category share

‘Through the Wall’ is a project designed
byNational Museums Liverpool (NML) to 
showcase Liverpool’s cultural riches in pu p blic 
areas around the city. NML were keen to 
create as much impact as possible and
therefore employed Service Graphics to 
create a series of large murals which would
draw attention to the city’s cultural venues. 
Service Graphics were asked to produce and install 
la la larg rg r rge e scale graphics onto the walls within the Liverpool 
Arena an n an an and d d Convention Centre in order to create the 
illusion that th th h h he e e e e vi vi v ewer w was looking through the wall into 
an anot o her space. The he t t t tea ea e e m m had to combat great technical 
is issues w wit ith h regards to the he e e s s s s siz ize of the graphics and
surfac aces es. The e gi gian a t images req q qui ui u ui u re r d fell outside the 
standard rigid id s she heet s siz ize e and it was s i i imp mp mp mperativ ve that

technique known as ‘trompe l’oeil’ (trick k of of o t the eye).

Service Graphics ove verc rcam ame e th t e challenges presented 
by the huge surface area: plain bo b ar ards ds w wer e e mounted 
and a single piece of printed fabric was attached. d T The 
length of fabric was large enough to cover the boards

Tesco Bank is the UK’s most successful

cu u c st stom omer er accounts. Until recently Tesco 
Bank nk w as o owned by RBS and utilised RBS’s 
infrastruc ucture re and database systems. Once 
Tesco acqu uir ired d do own n wn w er e ship from RBS a huge 
project was im mpl plem emented to overhaul all IT 
sy ystems. A solution was needed to improve
sy syst stem ems, drive efficiency and increase 
ca amp mpai a gn n resul lt ts. 
Occam m offered a solution that met Te Tesco Bank’s 
objectives s b by y delivering g ins nsi igh ht, analysis and a single
customer view.
Response
Occam’s data management solution provided Tesco
Bank with the immediate benefit of being able to analyse 
and interrogate its data instantly. This capability enables 
the data team to run marketing campaigns with greater 
efficiency and powerful insight to ensure that customer 
communication is relevant and timely.
Although securely hosted by Occam, it was deemed 
essential that the Tesco team had full access to its 
customers’ contact history and marketing preferences, 
for regular and ad-hoc communication. As well as
enabling delivery of relevant communicatio ion v via direct 
marketing, post campaign analysis tools s provid de e 
in-depth evaluation. 
Outcome
The system has enabled Tesco Bank to imple leme m nt 
a comprehensive customer contact strategy wh hic ich 
ensures that customers are only contacted by the eir ir 
preferred means and at a specified frequency to 
im impr prov ove e c customer services standards. 
The ere has been a significant improvement nt in the

Financial Review
Overview of revenue
Underlying revenue for the Group from continuing 
operations increased by £5.4 million (1.8%) to  
£296.8 million. Revenue of £7.2 million is included  
for Tactical Solutions, acquired 9 February 2011.
Revenue from the Print segment decreased by  
£7.8 million (2.7%). Revenue decreased by 3.3% in the 
Books business but market share increased. Exhibitions 
and Events revenue increased by 11.4% although this 
growth slowed towards the end of the financial year as 
general economic sentiment deteriorated. Revenue 
for the Point of sale business increased by £3.9 million  
(4.8%) but Direct Response and Commercial revenue 
declined by 13.0%, partly due to planned reductions 
in capacity and the removal of less profitable work from 
the overall mix.
Revenue for the Marketing Services segment increased 
significantly due to the acquisition of Occam at the end of 
the previous financial year and the acquisition of Tactical 
Solutions during the year.
From a geographical point of view, 95.8% of our Print and 
Marketing Services’ revenue is generated within the UK.
Gross profit margin and underlying profitability
Underlying gross profit margin has increased from 
25.5% to 26.8%. Despite the revenue decline within 
the Print segment gross margins in the segment have 
been maintained due to improved work mix, lower levels 
of outsourced work, improved production efficiencies, 
successful procurement initiatives and the labour cost 
reductions resulting from restructuring activities. Gross 
margins within the Marketing Services segment are 
significantly higher than those within the Print segment 
and therefore the growth of this segment has lead to 
the overall improvement in margin at the Group level.
Underlying sales and administrative overheads increased 
by £2.4 million driven by acquisition related overheads of 
£4.5 million partially offset by headcount related overhead 
reductions within the Print segment of £2.1 million.
As a result of these management actions, underlying  
profit before taxation for the Group from continuing 
operations increased from £17.8 million to £20.9 million 
(6.1% to 7.0% of revenue).
Non-underlying items
The Group has undergone further restructuring during  
the year in order to mitigate the effects of the economic 
downturn, remove excess capacity and improve 
operating performance.
The £4.0 million net charge (2010 – £4.6 million), before 
tax, primarily relates to: the costs associated with the 
relocation of our principal exhibitions and events site  
to Chessington of £1.5 million; redundancy, asset 
impairment and other re-structuring related costs within 
our head office and the Books, Point of Sale and Direct 
Response and Commercial businesses of £5.0 million; 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition of 
Tactical Solutions of £0.6 million; and the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles for Occam and Tactical Solutions 
of £1.1 million; partially offset by gains of £4.2 million  
on the sale of our previous head office and properties  
at Edenbridge.
Balance sheet
The balance sheet has strengthened with net assets 
increasing to £136.6 million (2010 – £129.9 million).  
The movement reflects the loss after taxation of  
£4.8 million; dividends of £3.6 million; actuarial gains on 
the defined benefits pension scheme (net of deferred tax) 
of £12.0 million; and the impact of the issue of shares of 
£3.1 million.
Net debt
Net debt decreased during the year from £2.7 million to  
a cash balance of £16.3 million. The major contributing 
factors to the movement are an improvement in underlying 
profitability, a further reduction in capital expenditure,  
and the proceeds of disposal of excess property and 
non-core activities, partially offset by acquisition-related 
cash requirements.
The Group maintains a £55.0 million committed 
revolving multicurrency credit agreement which expires 
31 October 2012. 
Capital expenditure and depreciation
Capital expenditure in cash flow terms on property, 
plant and equipment, together with additions to intangible 
assets, other than in the context of acquisitions, was 
£8.9 million (2010 – £12.1 million) and cash receipts from 
asset disposals were £9.3 million (2010 – £4.6 million). 
Depreciation, amortisation and impairments charged in 
the year was £35.0 million (2010 – £20.2 million) including 
a £13.5 million impairment charge in respect of the 
Magazine printing business disposed of in the period.   St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 33
 
Our businesses are very well invested and we are 
therefore able to operate at reduced levels of capital 
expenditure versus historic levels without any 
deterioration in our competitive advantage. We will, 
however, continue to invest in those businesses that 
present opportunities for growth.
Acquisitions
On 9 February 2011, the Group acquired Tactical 
Solutions (UK) Limited, one of the UK’s leading field 
marketing companies. The total consideration payable  
for the business is £18.6 million.
Subsequent to the end of the financial year the Group 
acquired Response One Holdings Limited for a maximum 
consideration of £19 million and Pragma Holdings Limited 
for a maximum consideration of £6.3 million.
Disposal
On 6 April 2011, the Group disposed of its Magazine 
printing business for £18.8 million, net of selling costs. 
The impairment of property, plant and machinery 
associated with the disposal, before tax, was 
£13.5 million. The business has been treated as 
a discontinued operation.
Tax
The Group’s tax rate on profit before non-underlying items 
was 27.6% (2010 – 31.5%).
Dividends
The board is recommending a final dividend of 3.50p, 
bringing the total dividends for the year to 5.25p, resulting 
in an underlying dividend cover of 2.8 times.
The Group remains cash generative and was debt free 
at the end of the financial year. Retained earnings in the 
Group balance sheet at 29 July 2011 were £76.4 million 
(2010 – £73.4 million).
Pensions
The deficit (on an IAS 19 basis) in the defined benefits 
pension scheme at the end of the year, excluding 
the related deferred tax asset, was £12.3 million 
(2010 – £32.9 million). The decrease of the deficit 
is due, primarily, to an increase in the value of the 
scheme assets.
The charge to underlying operating profit for this scheme 
was £0.2 million (2010 – £0.2 million) which represents the 
costs of administering the scheme. The income statement 
also includes a net financing credit of £0.6 million 
(2010 – £0.4 million charge) which reflects the expected 
return on assets of the scheme based on market rates 
available at the start of the financial year less the effect of 
the fact that the benefits are one year closer to being paid.
The Group contributes £2.2 million per annum in order to 
meet its obligations regarding the current level of deficit 
within the scheme. The next triennial valuation for the 
scheme is scheduled for April 2013.
Financial risk management and treasury policies
The main financial risks of the Group relate to interest rate, 
liquidity, foreign exchange and credit (in relation to its 
trade receivables).
The Group introduced an internal audit function in 2007. 
The Group’s policy is to test all the business’s trade 
cycles over a three-year period.
The Group’s treasury function is responsible for managing 
the Group’s exposure to financial risk and operates within 
a defined set of policies and procedures approved by  
the board.
The overall objective of the treasury policy is to use 
financial instruments to manage the financial risks that 
arise from the specific activities of the business. It follows, 
therefore, that the Group does not enter into speculative 
financial transactions for which there is no underlying 
business requirement.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s borrowings are at floating interest rates. 
Interest as a proportion of profits before tax is relatively 
small and changes in interest rates have a low impact  
on profits. The Group keeps this situation under  
constant review.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains a £55.0 million committed 
revolving multicurrency credit agreement which 
expires 31 October 2012. At the year end the Group 
had unused facilities of £55.0 million. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Group’s trading, including purchases of property, 
plant and equipment, is principally in Sterling. Currency 
risk management relating to transactional business, if 
significant, is dealt with by the use of currency derivatives, 
which are mainly foreign currency forward contracts.
Credit risk (trade receivables)
The majority of sales of the Group to its customers are 
made on credit. The Group maintains credit insurance 
covering its larger trade debtors. It is Group policy that all 
customers are granted credit subject to credit verification 
procedures. A rigorous system of credit control is applied 
and receivables are continually monitored. Bad debt 
provisions represented 3.6% (2010 – 4.6%) of gross trade 
debtors at the year end.

Corporate and Social Responsibility
Relations with customers and suppliers 
The Group deals with all of its customers and suppliers  
on an arm’s length, commercial, basis and applies ethical 
trading values that make it a disciplinary offence for any 
employee or director to offer gifts, bribes, or clearly 
excessive entertainment to customers in order to secure 
work. Employees and directors are not permitted to 
accept similar inducements from suppliers. The Group’s 
‘whistle-blowing’ policy provides an avenue for detecting 
any breaches of its ethical trading policy. 
Payment terms granted to customers are negotiated 
according to the amount at risk and the financial strength 
of the customer concerned. Work is either part billed as  
the work progresses or is invoiced when the work or 
service is completed.  
Where it is considered to be appropriate and available, 
long-term supply agreements of between one and three 
years are sought for paper, ink and other consumables.  
In some cases the Group’s interests are best served by 
purchasing goods and services on a spot purchase basis 
rather than pursuant to a long-term supply agreement. 
Reports on procurement matters are presented to the 
Company’s board of directors on a monthly basis. The 
Group may only be committed to agreements in excess  
of twelve months’ duration or having an annual value in 
excess of £2.0 million with the authority of the board. 
Customers have the final decision on which substrate  
they wish their work to be printed and, indeed, many of  
the larger book publishers prefer to supply their own 
paper for use in producing their work. 
The Group’s policy for retaining customers is to deliver 
consistency and reliability of service and quality: no 
customer is tied in to an agreement that cannot be 
terminated in the event of under-performance.  
Employees 
The Group is an Equal Opportunities Employer and no job 
applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment 
on the grounds of age, sex, marital status, race, colour, 
religion or belief.  
It is the policy of the Group that individuals with 
disabilities, whether registered disabled or not, should 
receive full and fair consideration for all job vacancies  
for which they are suitable applicants. Employees who 
become disabled during their working life will be retained 
in employment wherever possible and will be given help 
with any necessary rehabilitation and retraining. The 
Group is prepared to modify procedures or equipment, 
wherever this is practicable, so that full use can be made 
of an individual’s ability. 
A ‘dignity at work’ policy operates to ensure, so far as  
is practicable, that the Company and its subsidiaries 
provide a working environment free from harassment  
and bullying and in which employees do not behave  
in a manner which may be offensive to others.  
Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are 
regularly consulted by local managers and kept informed 
of matters affecting them and the overall development of 
the Group. 
Details of the Group’s pension schemes are set out in  
note 26 to the financial statements; all of the schemes are 
independently managed. Group companies contribute to 
a number of defined contribution schemes, the principal 
one of which is the St Ives Defined Contribution Pension 
Plan, which is available for all eligible employees to join 
and which was established in 2002 on the closure of the 
Group’s defined benefits scheme to new membership.  
The investments of the defined benefits scheme are 
managed separately, partly passively and partly actively 
under the direction of a trustee company (‘the Trustee’). 
The fund managers of the actively managed portfolios are 
proscribed from holding any investment in, or lending to, 
the Group. The number of directors of the Trustee is split 
equally between member-nominated and Company-
nominated Trustee directors, subject to casual vacancies 
which may arise from time to time.  
Those employees who were active members of the 
defined benefits scheme on 1 September 2009 were each 
offered an invitation to participate in an alternative defined 
contribution Group Personal Pension Plan administered  
by Prudential. 
In respect of employment matters, the Group uses 
statistics of accidents resulting in three days’ or more 
absence and total number of working days lost from all 
accidents as key performance indicators of the safety of  
its employees. In 2011 the total number of accidents at  
the Group’s sites which resulted in at least three days’ 
absence each was 17 (2010 – 14) and the number of 
days’ work lost from all accidents at work was 230 days 
(2010 – 386.5). These data relate to the Company’s 
subsidiaries at 29 July 2011. 
Charitable and political donations 
The Group’s cash donations to charities were modest 
during the preceding two years but were increased during 
2011 and, following the agreement of the Company to 
match the Chairman’s contributions, made from foregoing 
a proportion of his fees, included payments to registered 
charities nominated by the Chairman. It is the board’s 
policy otherwise to favour charities serving communities  
in which the Group operates or to which employees or 
customers have a particular affinity. The amount allocated 
to these will be kept under review. No political donations 
were made in the year and the board has no intention to 
seek shareholders’ approval to permit the board to do so.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 35
Shareholder relations 
The board attaches considerable importance to 
maintaining good relationships with shareholders. 
Effective two-way communication with institutional 
shareholders and analysts is established through regular 
presentations, sometimes at production sites, involving 
the Chief Executive and the Finance Director. Major 
shareholders are given the opportunity to meet with the 
senior non-executive director.  
The board receives an investor relations report at each  
of its regular meetings. 
The Annual General Meeting is regarded as an 
opportunity to communicate directly with shareholders 
and the chairman of the Audit and of the Remuneration 
Committees will each be available at the Annual General 
Meeting to answer shareholders’ questions.  
St Ives and the environment 
St Ives is committed to continuous improvement in  
its environmental performance and accepts that its 
responsibilities with regard to environmental protection 
rank equally in importance with other key business 
objectives. The board is responsible for the 
implementation of this policy and senior management 
throughout the business is responsible for the day-to-day 
implementation of the policy at each operating unit with 
assistance and guidance from the Group’s full time health, 
safety and environmental adviser supported by an 
appropriate number of site-focused qualified health, 
safety and environmental managers. 
An ISO14001:2004 – certified Environmental Management 
System (‘EMS’) has been established at each of the 
Group’s sites, with the exception of Occam and Tactical 
Solutions. A review of these businesses’ existing 
management systems was undertaken during the year, 
which will result in an EMS being introduced at their sites 
during 2012. 
These EMSs include procedures and systems aimed  
at managing and minimising the adverse environmental 
impacts of the following:  
 Energy consumption/carbon emissions; 
 Waste management; 
 Water consumption; 
 Raw materials procurement and usage; 
 Materials recycling; and 
 Use of volatile organic compounds (‘VOCs’). 
Key performance indicators have long been established 
for managing energy consumption and carbon emissions, 
waste sent to landfill and water consumption. 
Energy consumption and carbon emissions 
For 2011 the Group targeted to achieve a 2 per cent 
reduction in the total amount of energy (electricity and 
gas) used per square metre of substrate at all St Ives sites 
compared with 2010. The actual reduction was 3 per cent 
(0.049 to 0.047 KWHr per square metre). Since 2006 this 
figure has fallen by 8.7 per cent (0.051 to 0.047 KWHr  
per square metre). This improvement in the overall energy 
efficiency of the Group has been achieved against a 
background of reduced throughput and a consequent 
reduction in utilisation of plant. Factors that have helped 
achieve these improvements are the disposal of the 
Group’s Magazine printing businesses and the 
consolidation of plant at fewer sites in the direct  
response and commercial business resulting in the  
more efficient use of that plant. 
In absolute terms, the total amount of energy (electricity 
and gas) used at all the Group’s sites has fallen by  
21 per cent compared with 2010 (145 million to  
114.3 million KWHr ) and by 38 per cent when compared 
with 2006 (178.1 million to 114.3 million KWHr)
The total carbon emissions arising from the combined 
usage of energy (electricity and gas) used at all sites fell 
by 20 per cent compared with 2010 (56,781 to 45,649 
Tonnes CO
2
). Since 2006 this figure has fallen by  
33.5 per cent (67,500 to 45,649 Tonnes CO
2
).

The Group is obligated under the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (‘CRC’) and has successfully prepared and 
submitted its first annual report and footprint report.  
The Group pursues a Carbon Management Programme  
to help reduce its carbon footprint through the use of low 
energy lighting, compressed air management systems 
and variable speed drives. There is no intention at present 
to offset carbon at a Group level. The Group has, 
however, developed the capability to calculate the carbon 
footprint of individual print jobs so that the carbon can be 
offset, if desired, by its customers. 
St Ives Westerham Press has maintained its carbon 
neutral status.  
Waste management 
Recycling programmes are in place at all sites, as 
appropriate, for paper (office and process waste), 
cardboard, wood (pallets etc.), aluminium printing plates, 
plastic packaging, inks and solvents. The quantity of 
waste sent to landfill fell by 10 per cent compared with 
2010 (2,264 to 2,006 Tonnes). Since 2006 the quantity of 
waste sent to landfill has fallen by 65 per cent (from 5,695 
to 2,006 Tonnes). The quantity of waste generated per 
square metre of substrate rose by 9 per cent, compared 
with 2010 (from 0.763 to 0.832 grams per square metre). 
Since 2006, this figure has fallen by 48 per cent (from 1.6 
to 0.832 grams per square metre). The increase, year  
on year, in the quantity of waste per unit of production is 
partly due to an increase in the proportion of point of sale 
work. This work utilises non-paper substrates, several of 
which e.g. PVC-based products, are difficult to recycle. 
The Group is currently working with suppliers, customers 
and waste management companies to resolve this issue. 
Furthermore, Occam and Tactical Solutions do not utilise 
paper substrate, but still generate waste. Over the course 
of 2011 several sites switched to waste management 
companies that operate Materials Recycling Facilities 
(MRFs) so that waste that cannot be recycled is sent to 
‘energy from waste’ facilities.

Water usage 
The total amount of water used at all sites fell by 5 per 
cent compared with 2010 (108,719 to 103,317 cubic 
metres). Compared with 2006, water consumption has 
fallen by 9 per cent (113,098 to 103,317). The quantity of 
water used per square metre of substrate rose by 17 per 
cent compared with 2010 (336.6 to 42.8 ml per square 
metre) and, since 2006, this figure has risen by 34.8 per 
cent due, in part, to a growth in the proportion of water 
used in office-based activity, rather than production-
based activity.

Raw materials procurement and usage 
So far as is reasonably practicable, the Group is 
committed to not utilising paper and board products that 
may incorporate wood from illegally harvested sources; 
wood which has originated from forests in regions of 
serious social conflict; genetically modified product; or 
which may originate from uncertified High Conservation 
Value forests. We endeavour to purchase paper and 
board from sources which utilise pulp derived from 
sustainable forests or recycled post-consumer waste. All 
sites that use paper and board as their principal substrate 
(nine in total) have achieved Forest Stewardship Council 
(‘FSC’) Chain of Custody certification. Three of these sites 
have also attained Programme for the Endorsement of 
Forest Certification (‘PEFC’). During the year procedures 
and systems of work will be implemented at all nine sites 
so that they can achieve multi-site certification to both 
FSC and PEFC standards. An environmental performance 
steering group has been established to analyse the 
marketplace and seek sustainable alternatives to the  
non-paper substrates most commonly used by the Group; 
coordinate procurement and testing of new products;  
and advise the board on sustainability issues. Due to 
technology and quality limitations our lithographic printing 
sites normally use mineral oil-based inks, however, our 
sheet fed printing sites can print using vegetable oil-based 
inks at our customers’ request. The front section of this 
Annual Report and Accounts is printed on paper made 
from virgin wood fibre sourced from well-managed forests 
independently certified according to the rules of the FSC. 
The rear section is printed on paper made from 100 per 
cent de-inked post-consumer waste and the inks used in 
printing the document as a whole are all vegetable-based. 
Use of VOCs 
All inks that we use are free of VOC emissions when 
stored and used at room temperature. The oils, whether 
mineral or vegetable-based, used in heat-set web offset 
inks become classified as VOC emissions as the product 
passes through drying ovens which operate at high 
temperatures, typically between 130 and 150 degrees 
Centigrade. The VOC content of such inks is typically 
between 30 and 35 per cent. The VOC emissions from the 
heat-set web offset press ovens are abated using thermal 
oxidisers. The Group’s web offset printing sites are each 
compliant with their Environmental Permits which place 
limits on the permitted VOC emissions. The use of 
isopropyl alcohol (‘IPA’) has been eliminated from the  
web printing processes and from the majority of sheet  
fed presses used by the Group.

Corporate Governance
Compliance statement 
The Company is required to comply with the 2010 UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’), to the extent 
that it applies to ‘small-cap’ companies, or explain the 
reasons for non-compliance. The Code is the corporate 
governance code to which the Company is subject  
and a copy can be found on the FRC’s website 
(www.frc.org.uk/corporate/combinedcode.cfu). 
With the exception of Provision B.2.1 of the Code (which 
refers to the formation of a Nomination Committee), in the 
opinion of the board throughout the year ended 29 July 
2011 the Company has been in compliance with the Code 
Provisions contained in Section 1 of the Code. The board 
agreed during the year to form a Nomination Committee, 
which held its inaugural meeting after the year end.  
The following section, together with the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 46 to 55, describes  
how the board has applied the other Principles and 
Supporting Principles contained in the Code and, where 
appropriate, it has adopted elements of corporate 
governance good practice. 
Board of directors 
The board meets at regular intervals and is responsible to 
the shareholders for overall Group strategy, acquisitions 
and divestments, major capital projects, risk and financial 
matters. All directors receive agendas and papers in 
advance of each meeting, detailed minutes are recorded 
and actions followed up. 
The board’s membership throughout the year and the 
directors’ attendance at pre-arranged meetings of the 
board is set out on page 42.  
It is the opinion of the board that, throughout the year, 
each of the Company’s non-executive directors was 
independent for corporate governance purposes and  
free from any business or other relationship which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of his judgement. In 
reaching this opinion, the board has carefully considered 
the balance between applying good practice and what it 
believes is in the shareholders’ best interests. The non-
executive directors each have a clear understanding of 
their roles and responsibilities, which are appropriately 
documented. The non-executive directors met during the 
year, with no Group executive being present. Simon 
Marquis fulfilled the role of senior independent director. 
During the year, the board carried out a review of matters 
reserved to it for decision. These matters include the 
approval of annual budgets of individual trading subsidiaries, 
major individual items of capital expenditure, acquisitions 
and major procurement and supply contracts; the 
management of risks that could potentially disrupt the 
ability of the Group or any subsidiary to carry on business 
or which might damage the reputation of the  
Group as a whole in the eyes of its shareholders or the 
general public; and the management of matters which 
might result in a substantial unplanned financial risk to the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
The executive directors bring together and meet regularly 
with the managing directors of the businesses within the 
Group’s business segments to discuss major customers, 
sales growth (including cross selling opportunities), 
people issues and Group-wide procurement initiatives. 
In view of the number of appointments and resignations 
which have occurred and changes made to the board’s 
and committees’ memberships during the year, the annual 
processes for evaluating the effectiveness of the board,  
its committees and individual directors, was postponed 
until 2012.  
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate 
and distinct and an appropriate division of responsibilities 
between the two has been set out in writing and approved 
by the board. 
All directors have full and timely access to all relevant 
information needed to enable them properly to discharge 
their responsibilities. A procedure exists for directors to 
seek independent professional advice in the furtherance 
of their duties and to be reimbursed their reasonable legal 
fees and each has access to the advice and services of 
the Company Secretary. All directors also have 
unrestricted access to other executives within the 
business to discuss any matter of concern to them. Senior 
executives within the Group make regular presentations to 
the board on issues affecting their businesses, future 
challenges and how they propose to address them. 
On appointment, each director receives an induction 
appropriate to their previous experience as a director and 
their knowledge of the industry. 
The Company’s articles of association require all directors 
to retire and offer themselves for re-appointment by 
shareholders at least once every three years.  
Board committees 
Audit and Remuneration Committees of the board existed 
throughout the year, each with written terms of reference 
which were reviewed and revised during the year. 
Towards the end of the year the board agreed terms  
of reference for a Nomination Committee. Copies of the 
terms of reference for these committees can be obtained 
from the Company Secretary and may be viewed on the 
Group’s corporate website (www.st-ives.co.uk). 
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to these 
committees and ensures that committee members receive 
agendas and papers in advance of each meeting so that 
they are adequately prepared to transact the business  
in hand.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee carries out the functions required by 
DTR 7.1.3R. The board is of the opinion that throughout 
the year the Audit Committee had sufficient relevant 
financial experience and that its membership was made 
up of independent non-executive directors. 
The Committee’s membership throughout the year and its 
members’ attendance at three pre-arranged meetings of 
the Committee is set out on page 42.  
In addition to the pre-arranged meetings the Committee 
held an ad-hoc meeting during the year principally to 
receive a briefing on new regulations, standards and 
technical issues.  
In the opinion of the board, the Committee met sufficiently 
frequently to properly discharge its responsibilities. The 
Committee’s role and responsibilities are set out in its 
terms of reference, referred to above.  
During the year, the Audit Committee discharged its 
functions by: 
 reviewing the findings of the external annual audit for 
2009/2010; 
 receiving a report at the half year end from Deloitte  
on agreed procedures they had undertaken to review 
certain subsidiaries’ balance sheets and income 
statements and controls;  
 reviewing the Group’s Interim Management Statements 
and Half Year Report prior to release; 
 considering reports from the Group’s Head of Internal 
Audit on work carried out during 2010/2011 and 
agreeing an internal audit plan for 2011/2012; 
 reviewing annual internal controls questionnaires 
completed by the Group’s operating sites and the 
controls over key business risks; 
 agreeing the nature and scope of the external annual 
audit for 2010/2011; 
 reviewing and safeguarding the independence of 
Deloitte and reviewing their performance; 
 recommending Deloitte’s reappointment as auditors;  
 approving Deloitte’s fees for their audit and non-audit 
services within the policy set by the Committee; and 
 reviewing the Group’s ‘whistle-blowing’ policy. 
The Finance Director, the Chief Executive and the Head of 
Internal Audit were also invited to attend some of the 
meetings to ensure that Committee members were fully 
informed and supported in carrying out their duties. 
The members of the Audit Committee have been given 
specific approval by the board to meet with the Group’s 
external auditors whenever they, or the auditors, consider 
it appropriate. During the year, the Committee’s members 
had private meetings with representatives of Deloitte and 
with the Head of Internal Audit. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Committee’s membership throughout the year and its 
members’ attendance at four pre-arranged meetings of 
the Committee is set out on page 42.  
In the opinion of the board, the Committee met sufficiently 
frequently to properly discharge its duties.  
During the year the Committee: 
 approved the payment of bonuses to certain directors 
for 2009/2010; 
 approved the Directors’ Remuneration Report for 
2009/2010; 
 approved the structure of the directors’ bonus scheme 
for 2010/2011; 
 approved the proposed Rules of the St Ives plc Long-
Term Incentive Plan 2010 (the ‘LTIP’) to be put before 
the shareholders for approval; 
 approved the grant of awards under the LTIP to certain 
executives and the performance conditions attached to 
their vesting; 
 approved the executive directors’ salaries for 2011/2012;  
 considered the ramifications of the Government’s 
legislation on disguised remuneration;  
 reaffirmed the policy on the approval and reporting of 
directors’ business expenses; and 
 reaffirmed the Company’s policy that directors’  
service contracts should make no specific provision  
for the payment of compensation in the event of 
termination payments.  
Nomination Committee 
During the year the board formed a Nomination 
Committee which held its inaugural meeting after  
the year end. The Committee is chaired by Richard 
Stillwell. The majority of members of the Committee are 
independent non-executive directors, including the senior 
non-executive director. The directors will report further 
next year on the membership of the Committee and  
its proceedings. 
Other board issues 
The Company has made qualifying third party provisions 
for the benefit of its directors (as defined by Section 234 
of the Companies Act 2006) which continue in force at the 
date of this report. The Company has entered into deeds 
of indemnity in favour of each of its directors (on identical 
terms) who served during the year, under which the 
Company has granted directors an indemnity, to the 
extent permitted by law, in respect of liabilities incurred  
by virtue of their office.  42 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Corporate Governance continued
In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006, the Company has procedures in place to deal with 
the situation where a director has a conflict of interest and 
regularly reviews conflict authorisation. Directors take no 
part in discussions on matters in which they are interested 
and they may be requested to leave a meeting at which a 
matter in which they are interested is to be discussed. 
Details of directors’ attendance at board and committee 
meetings based on their maximum possible attendance 
during the year are as follows:

pre-arranged annual meeting calendar. Other ad-hoc meetings, 
including a meeting of the full board to discuss strategic issues  
and board succession, were held during the year. The Nomination 
Committee did not meet during the year. 
Throughout the year at least three independent non-
executive directors served on each of the Audit and 
Remuneration Committees. 
Internal control and risk management 
The board is responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control, including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management, and for 
reviewing its effectiveness. A workable and realistic 
system can only be designed to manage and mitigate, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and, therefore, can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.  
The directors consider themselves collectively 
responsible for ensuring that risks arising from social, 
environmental and ethical factors and the health and 
safety of the Group’s employees are suitably managed  
and are referred to the board, as necessary. The board 
has identified and assessed those regulatory, financial, 
social, environmental and ethical issues which may 
present a significant risk to the business. 
The principal regulations affecting the Group’s day-to-day 
business and markets it serves have been identified by 
the board as those covering Employment, Health and 
Safety, the Environment, Planning, Data Protection, Taxation, 
Defamation, Bribery and Competition Law. The board 
each year reviews the impact that these might have on the 
business and how to manage the risks to the business. 
During the year the board considered the level of risk 
arising from new offences introduced by the Bribery Act 
2010 and agreed and implemented changes to the 
Group’s policies and procedures proportionate to the 
bribery risks faced by the Group. 
The internal audit team focused on the Group’s internal 
controls; reviewing the control environment and the testing 
of those controls. Controls testing of procurement, estimating, 
payroll, fixed assets, stock, treasury and credit control 
cycles took place at selected sites. The process by which 
the board exercises control is by monthly meetings with 
senior management within each of the Group’s business 
segments. These meetings are chaired by a parent board 
executive director, and are also attended by the Finance 
Director. Regular items for discussion encompass any 
areas of significant risk to the businesses, which are then 
raised at the next meeting of the parent board if appropriate. 
Appropriate due diligence was carried out on Tactical 
Solutions, Response One and Pragma immediately prior 
to their acquisition. Annual internal control questionnaires 
are completed by the Group’s other businesses and any 
inconsistencies with the Group’s established corporate 
governance and authority limits regimes which are 
identified are disclosed to the Audit Committee. 
Risk is reported on and monitored at the monthly 
meetings held with senior management referred to  
above in accordance with the board’s agreed risk 
management process.

Directors’ Report
The directors present their Directors’ Report and the 
audited financial statements for the fifty two weeks  
ended 29 July 2011. 
Principal activities 
The principal activities of the Group are set out on pages  
7 to 9 of the Chief Executive’s Performance Review.  
The subsidiaries principally affecting the profits or net 
assets of the Group in the year are listed in note 33 of  
the consolidated financial statements. 
Business and operating review 
A detailed review of the performance of the Group and  
its future prospects can be found in the Chief Executive’s 
Performance Review and the Financial Review which 
should be read in conjunction with the Chairman’s 
Statement on pages 4 and 5 and the report on Corporate 
and Social Responsibility on pages 34 to 37, all of which 
are incorporated by reference in to and forms part of this 
Directors’ Report. 
This Directors’ Report covers the year under review and 
the period up to the date of signature. 
Certain sections of this Annual Report and Accounts 
contain forward-looking statements with respect to the 
strategy, financial condition, results, operations and 
businesses of the Group or markets in which the Group 
operates. These statements and forecasts involve risk  
and uncertainty because they relate to events and 
depend on circumstances that occur in the future and 
relate to events, not all of which are within the Group’s 
control. Although the Group believes that the expectations 
reflected in such forward-looking statements are 
reasonable, there are a number of factors that could 
cause actual results or developments to differ materially 
from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking 
statements. The Group undertakes no obligation to 
update any forward-looking statement. 
Results and dividends 
The Group loss for the year before taxation from 
continuing and discontinued operations amounted to 
£882,000 (2010 – profit £8,104,000). The directors 
propose a final dividend of 3.50 pence for each ordinary 
share payable on 23 December 2011 to holders on the 
register as at 2 December 2011. If approved, the final 
dividend will make total dividends for the year of 5.25 
pence per ordinary share: 
£’000
Ordinary dividends  – interim 1,811
– proposed final 3,749
Share capital 
Details of the Company’s share capital are set out in  
note 28 to the financial statements. The Company’s share 
capital is comprised of one class of ordinary shares of  
10 pence each. The shares carry no rights to fixed income 
and each share carries the right to one vote at general 
meetings. All shares are fully paid. There are no specific 
restrictions on the size of a shareholding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both covered by the provisions 
of the articles of association and prevailing legislation. 
Major interests in shares 
As at 29 July 2011 the Company had been notified, in 
accordance with chapter 5 of the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules, of the following voting rights as 
shareholders of the Company: 
Number of 
voting rights %
Silchester International Investors 
Limited and its subsidiaries 16,250,906 15.35
Delta Lloyd NV and subsidiaries 13,661,073 12.91

Legal & General Group plc and  
its subsidiaries 3,979,783 3.84
Majedie Asset Management Limited 3,804,459 3.59
On 19 September 2011 Sanderson Asset Management 
Limited notified the Company that it no longer holds a 
notifiable interest in the Company and, on the same date, 
Standard Life Investments Limited notified the Company 
that it had an interest in the voting rights of 8,975,354

as at that date). On 22 September 2011 Silchester 
International Investors Limited and its subsidiaries notified 
the Company that it had an interest in the voting rights  
of 16,158,999 shares (14.62% of the issued share capital 
in the Company as at that date). On 3 October 2011

in the voting rights of 5,594,902 shares (4.99 per cent of 
the issued share capital in the Company as at that date).  44 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Report continued
Directors 
The present membership of the board is set out on  
page 39.  
David Best and Miles Emley also served during the year 
before retiring, respectively, as non-executive directors  
on 30 November 2010 and 25 April 2011. David Best 
served on both the Audit and Remuneration Committees, 
performing the role of chairman of the Audit Committee, 
and Miles Emley served as the Chairman of the board:  
he is succeeded as chairman by Richard Stillwell.  
Richard Stillwell holds a number of external non-executive 
directorships (set out on page 39) which, in the opinion of 
the board, does not prevent him from devoting sufficient 
time to his responsibilities as chairman of the board.  
Mike Butterworth and Tony Stuart were appointed  
non-executive directors during the year, respectively  
on 1 August 2010 and 31 January 2011. The directors’ 
interests in shares of the Company are set out in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 52.  
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of Annual General Meeting 2011, included with 
the copy of the Annual Report and Accounts mailed to 
shareholders on 27 October 2011, sets out the following 
non-routine business in addition to routine business: 
Allotment of share capital 
The board will seek to renew the shareholders’ authority  
to permit it to allot relevant securities within the limits laid 
down by the Companies Act 2006 and the December 2008 
guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers. 
Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights 
The directors also seek authority to allot shares in the 
capital of the Company pursuant to the foregoing authority 
granted, subject to certain stringent conditions. 
Authority for the Company to purchase its own 
ordinary shares 
It will also be proposed to renew the shareholders’ 
approval for the directors to effect market purchases of 
the Company’s ordinary shares on behalf of the Company 
under the authority of the Companies Act 2006 and 
subject to certain limits and restrictions. 
Notice for calling a general meeting 
It will be proposed that a general meeting, other than an 
annual general meeting, may be called on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice. 
New ‘Sharesave’ plan 
Finally, it will be proposed to establish a new all-employee 
sharesave plan – the St Ives Sharesave Plan – to replace 
the SAYE scheme which expires on 29 November 2011.  
Full explanations of the foregoing non-routine business 
are given in the Chairman’s letter which accompanies the 
notice of Annual General Meeting. 
Employment policies 
The Group is committed to providing equal opportunities 
with regard to employment, free from discrimination and 
harassment and in a healthy and safe working 
environment. Details of how we deliver on these 
commitments are provided in the Report on Corporate 
and Social Responsibility.  
Charitable and political donations 
The Group made charitable donations of £16,031 during 
the year (2010 – £1,808). Further details are given in the 
report on Corporate and Social Responsibility. No political 
donations were made in either year. 
Creditor payments 
It is the Group’s normal practice to agree terms of trading, 
including payment terms, with all suppliers. Provided 
suppliers perform in accordance with the agreed terms,  
it is the Group’s policy that payment should be made 
accordingly. The average creditor days outstanding at  
29 July 2011 for the Group and the Company were 83  
and 56 days, respectively (2010 – 79 and 60 days).  
Auditors 
The Audit Committee has considered the effectiveness of 
the external audit undertaken by Deloitte LLP (‘Deloitte’) in 
the light of their internal quality control procedures, the 
promptness and accuracy of their work, and other 
services obtained from them. The Committee also 
considered the robustness of Deloitte’s safeguards and 
procedures to counter threats or perceived threats to their 
objectivity, the application of their independence policies 
and their adherence to the Ethical Standards published 
by the Auditing Practices Board. In all these respects the 
Committee was satisfied with Deloitte’s objectivity and 
independence. During the year, the Committee satisfied 
itself that the Company’s policy on the provision by the 
Group’s external auditors of non-audit services had been 
appropriately applied. 
Based on a review of Deloitte’s performance during 
2010/2011 and after reviewing their independence, the 
Committee has recommended to the board that Deloitte 
be re-appointed. The recommendation was accepted and 
therefore a resolution to re-appoint them as the Group’s 
auditors will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief 
Executive’s Performance Review and report on Corporate 
and Social Responsibility. The financial position of the 
Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Financial Review. In addition, 
note 27 to the financial statements includes the Group’s 
objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk and capital risk. The foregoing statement, 
review and report are to be found on pages 4 to 42 and 
note 27 to the financial statements on pages 93 to 95. 
As highlighted in note 23 to the financial statements, the 
Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through an overdraft facility of £15 million that is part of an 
overall funding facility of £55 million which falls due for 
renewal on 31 October 2012.  
The current economic conditions create uncertainty, 
particularly over the level of demand for the Group’s 
products, but the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group should be able to 
operate within the level of its current facility and obtain 
further financing when the current facility expires.  
After making enquiries, the directors consider that the 
Group has adequate resources and borrowing facilities  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Consequently, they have continued to adopt the 
going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. 
Directors’ disclosures to the auditors 
Each of the directors of the Company as at 4 October 2011 
has confirmed that: 
 So far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware; and 
 The director has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information.  
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in 
accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant conditions of the 2010 UK Corporate Governance  
Code (‘the Code’) relating to directors’ remuneration and the Companies Act 2006. The relevant legislation requires  
the auditors to report to the Company’s members on certain disclosures contained in this Report and to state whether 
in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.  
The Report has therefore been divided into separate sections containing audited and unaudited information. 
In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting on Tuesday, 29 November 2011. Details of the resolution may be found in the Notice 
accompanying this Annual Report. The vote will be advisory but will be considered carefully by the members  
of the Committee and the board in the formulation and approval of the Company’s future remuneration policies. 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the board the overall remuneration 
strategy and individual remuneration packages and contractual arrangements for the executive directors, senior 
management and the Chairman of the board. 
The membership, the number of meetings held, attendances and a description of the business transacted by the 
Committee during the year are detailed in the corporate governance section on pages 40 to 42. 
When undertaking its duties, the Committee ensures that due account is taken of pay and employment conditions 
throughout the Group by keeping abreast of matters such as (i) the general level of salary increases (if any) applied 
throughout the Group, (ii) the levels of bonuses paid (and bonus opportunity offered) to the workforce as a whole and 
(iii) any widespread changes that are proposed to Group-wide employment conditions. 
The full terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website (www.st-ives.co.uk). 
Committee’s advisers 
Throughout the year, the Committee and the Company were advised by AonHewitt Limited (operating through the 
brand Hewitt New Bridge Street (HNBS)). Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, neither AonHewitt Limited, 
nor any other part of the Aon Corporation group provided other services to the Company.  
The Committee recognises that, although the Committee fully accepts the independence of HNBS, there may be 
occasions when there could be a conflict of interests when proposals are put by management on the recommendation 
of HNBS. It therefore retains PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’) to act solely for the Committee to review proposals 
where appropriate.  
PwC has provided pensions consulting services to the Company in relation to the Group’s defined benefits scheme 
and due diligence work in respect of potential acquisitions. The Committee is satisfied that the provision of these 
services to the Company does not affect PwC’s ability to comment on proposals for remunerating its executive 
directors and certain members of senior management.  
During the year under review, the Committee also, where appropriate, sought advice and assistance from the 
Company Secretary and members of the board, including the Chairman of the board, the Chief Executive and the 
Finance Director in connection with carrying out its duties. None of these persons took part in decisions relating 
specifically to their own remuneration. 
Remuneration policy 
The Committee’s policy for the remuneration of the Company’s executive directors is that it should be structured so as 
to attract and retain executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company 
successfully. It aims to recommend strategies which support the creation of value for shareholders and reflect and 
support the delivery of the Company’s strategic priorities while taking due account of market and best practice.  
When determining levels of remuneration, the Committee periodically reviews the remuneration practices adopted by 
appropriate comparator companies both in the market generally and in the same business sector as the Company.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47
The Committee believes that a significant portion of the remuneration package of senior executives should be linked  
to performance, while ensuring that an appropriate balance is struck between (i) fixed and variable pay (ii) short-term 
and long-term variable pay and (iii) the delivery of rewards in cash and shares. The Committee will regularly review the 
Company’s remuneration policies to ensure that these polices neither encourage nor reward inappropriate operational 
risk-taking that may be to the detriment of shareholders’ interests and that these remuneration policies are, therefore, 
compatible with the Company’s general risk policies and systems. 
With regard to the core elements of executive directors’ remuneration to feature in the forthcoming year, the Committee 
has taken the following approach: 
 Base salaries remain frozen at the levels payable at the end of 2009/2010; 
 Any bonus awarded shall be capped at 125 per cent of basic salary;  
 Any bonus earned which is in excess of 50 per cent of basic salary shall normally be satisfied by the award of 
shares in the Company which shall be held in trust for two years. Such shares are subject, in specified 
circumstances, to a ‘clawback’ from any deferred bonus paid going forward; 
 A second award will be made under the St Ives plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for which shareholder approval 
was obtained at the 2010 Annual General Meeting; and 
 The Committee’s share ownership guideline for executive directors will be retained, requiring executive directors 
over a five year period to build up and retain a shareholding equal to 100 per cent of their basic salaries. 
 It is currently intended that 50 per cent of the net number of shares received under any bonus share deferral or LTIP 
award will normally be retained by the executive director until the share ownership guideline is met. The Committee 
may take account of progress towards achieving this target when determining LTIP awards and/or the proportion of 
annual bonus that is subject to share deferral. 
The main components of the remuneration package for executive directors are: 
Basic salary 
In setting the basic salary for each executive director, the Committee takes into account the performance of each 
individual director, any changes in position or responsibility, market competitiveness, as well as pay and conditions  
in the Group as a whole. Basic salary is the only element of pay that is pensionable. 
The basic salary of each executive director for year under review, and for the forthcoming year is: 
Matt Armitage £248,000
Patrick Martell £350,000
Lloyd Wigglesworth £248,000
Save for a modest correctional adjustment in the base salary of Matt Armitage in the 2009/2010 financial year, this will 
be the third consecutive year of a base salary freeze at executive director level. 
Benefits in kind  
Executive directors may receive benefits in kind, which may include the provision of a car, fuel and medical expenses 
insurance costs, or their cash equivalent.  
Pension arrangements 
Matt Armitage and Lloyd Wigglesworth each participated during the year in the Group’s defined contribution pension 
scheme to which the Company also contributes. 
Patrick Martell is entitled to a deferred pension from the Group’s defined benefits pension scheme and he has not 
participated in the Group’s defined contribution scheme. 
The defined contribution and defined benefits schemes have a normal retirement age of 65.   48 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Annual bonus 
Bonuses for 2010/2011  
At the beginning of the year the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate for the second year running to  
set a collective target for the executive directors to improve the Group’s cash-adjusted normalised profit before tax 
(‘CANPBT’). For 2010/2011 the executive directors were set a demanding CANPBT target of £19.4 million, on the 
achievement of which 50 per cent of the maximum possible bonus would be payable (i.e. 62.5 per cent of basic 
salary), with a maximum bonus (125 per cent of basic salary) being earned if CANPBT of £21.4 million or more was 
achieved. No bonus would be earned for achieving improved CANPBT, however, if the Group’s underlying profit 
before tax from continuing operations for 2010/2011 failed to reach £15.4 million. All calculations of bonus were to be 
made after charging the cost of the relevant bonus against profit. 
The Group’s underlying profit before tax from continuing operations was £20.9 million and the Committee has 
determined from audited figures that CANPBT was £23.7 million for 2010/2011. Therefore, both conditions were  
met and accordingly each director earned the maximum bonus for the year of 125 per cent of basic salary. 
Bonus earned by directors in excess of 50 per cent of basic salary would normally be satisfied in the form of shares in 
the Company; however, taking into account each director’s progress towards achieving the share ownership guideline 
(referred to above), the Committee has decided to split the total bonus paid in the proportions: 70 per cent in cash and 
30 per cent in shares for Matt Armitage and Patrick Martell and 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in shares for Lloyd 
Wigglesworth. Dependent on the open market price at which the shares are purchased, this should take the directors’ 
shareholdings to approximately 40 per cent of their basic salary. 
The shares deferral element of the bonus shall be purchased from net pay by the directors in the market or from the 
Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘the EBT’), to be held under the rules of the Directors’ and Senior Executives’ Deferred 
Bonus Scheme (‘the DBS’). In accordance with the rules of the DBS these shares shall, inter alia, vest immediately, but 
be held on trust during a holding period, for release to the director in November 2013, provided that he remains 
employed by the Group at that time. During the holding period, the executive will be entitled to vote the shares and 
receive dividends on them but will be unable to sell, transfer, assign or charge any interest in the shares during the 
holding period without the consent of the Committee. In addition, part or all of the deferred portion of the bonus can be 
forfeited if it becomes apparent during the holding period that the bonus was paid by reference to materially misstated 
results. 
Details of the 2010/2011 bonuses paid to executive directors are disclosed on page 51.  
Bonuses for 2011/2012 
The Committee has taken the view that prioritising cash generation has been an important element of the Company’s 
remuneration strategy, with the Group having made significant progress during the past two years, in returning the 
Group to a non-geared position. Upon reviewing the directors’ priorities for 2011/2012, however, the Committee 
concluded that growth in earnings per share, supported by personal objectives based on sales growth and the 
integration of the Group’s acquisitions, would be more appropriate drivers for annual bonuses for the executive 
directors. Therefore, for the forthcoming year directors may again earn a bonus of up to 125 per cent of basic salary 
and their bonus opportunity will be split as follows: 
Director Portion of bonus relating to EPS targets Portion of bonus relating to personal targets 
Patrick Martell 125% of basic salary 0% of basic salary 
Matt Armitage 112.5% of basic salary 12.5% of salary 
Lloyd Wigglesworth 62.5% of salary 62.5% of salary 
As before, in the event that the total bonus earned exceeds 50 per cent of basic salary, the excess, again, normally  
will be satisfied in shares under the rules of the DBS. Part, or all, of the deferred portion of the bonus, however, can  
be forfeited if it becomes apparent during the holding period that the bonus was paid by reference to materially

The Company now operates the St Ives plc Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’) as the sole long-term incentive plan 
for senior executives. The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting. 
In line with current practice the LTIP provides for the award of ‘performance shares’ up to a maximum potential award 
limit of 125 per cent of basic salary (200 per cent in exceptional circumstances). The Committee takes the view that 
this limit allows for market competitive grants to be made whilst applying challenging performance conditions. The 
performance conditions set for the initial awards made in the year under review were based on (i) Earnings Per Share; 
(ii) the increase in ‘added value’ attributable to non-print activities; and (iii) relative Total Shareholder Return as 
described more fully on pages 53 and 54. 
The Committee is aware that the use of three different performance metrics is not common, but is firmly of the belief 
that the LTIP should be operated with the Group’s specific circumstances and challenges in mind. The adoption of 
three metrics was finally determined after consultation with a number of major shareholders. Consequently, and having 
reviewed the operation of the LTIP, it is intended to make awards under the LTIP in the forthcoming year. It is currently 
intended to apply the same three performance metrics as last year and, whilst the exact targets have not yet been 
finalised, these will be no less challenging than last year’s. 
The Committee does not currently consider it necessary to apply any “clawback” provision to LTIP awards (noting that 
a clawback feature does form part of the annual bonus), but will keep this matter under review. 
The Company has in the past operated two discretionary share-based incentive plans. These plans expire shortly after 
the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and were replaced last year by the LTIP (and, as a result, no awards were 
made under these plans last year). 
A summary of the expiring plans are as follows: 
Discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 (‘ESOS 2001’) 
The ESOS 2001 (which has both HMRC ‘approved’ and ‘unapproved’ elements) provided for the grant of options to 
participants over shares having a market value of up to 150 per cent of salary in any year (400 per cent in exceptional 
circumstances). Options granted and outstanding under the ESOS 2001 are capable of exercise three years after 
grant, subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of performance conditions. The final award of options to 
executive directors under this plan was made on 3 November 2009, further details of which are set out on page 52. 
Equity Partnership Plan 2001 (‘EPP 2001’) 
Executive directors and certain members of senior management have also in the past been invited to participate  
in the EPP 2001, under which awards could have been made over shares subject to an initial investment in shares  
by participants.  
No invitations have been made under the EPP 2001 since November 2004 and no participant has an outstanding 
entitlement to matching shares under the terms of the Plan.  
Save As You Earn Scheme (‘SAYE scheme’) 
The Company has also in the past operated a standard all-employee SAYE scheme, under which eligible employees, 
including executive directors, were from time to time invited to participate. No options remain outstanding under this 
scheme, which will also shortly expire. 
Dilution 
Under the LTIP, awards over no more than 10 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital may be granted over 
new issue shares in any rolling ten year period (with awards made under any other share plan also being counted). 
As at 29 July 2011, awards over 3,429,000 shares (3.24 per cent of the Company’s issued share capital) count 
towards this limit that may be satisfied by new issue shares under the LTIP, the 2001 ESOS, the EPP and the  
SAYE scheme.   50 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Non-executive directors’ fees 
The Company’s policy on setting non-executive directors’ remuneration, which is decided by the board (but with the 
non-executive directors not voting where it affects their personal position) is to offer fees sufficient to attract and retain 
individuals of appropriate calibre such that they are able to apply an independent view based on their experience and 
skills. These fees, which have been unchanged since 2007, comprise a base responsibility fee of £30,000 per annum 
plus additional fees of £8,000 per annum for the post of Senior Independent Director and £4,000 per annum for 
chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees respectively. The board has acknowledged that the non-executives 
directors’ fees are now out of line with market rates, but it has been decided, for the time being, not to increase the 
fees paid. 
The fee paid to the Chairman is set separately by the Committee. Miles Emley’s fee was £130,000 per annum. On the 
appointment of Richard Stillwell the Committee took advice and the annual fee payable to the Chairman has been set 
by the Committee at £120,000 per annum. On his appointment, Mr. Stillwell elected to forego £10,000 per annum from 
this fee. The Company shall donate the sums so withheld to registered charities nominated by Mr Stillwell, with such 
contributions being matched by contributions by the Company.  
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Group’s cash or share-based incentive arrangements. 
Service contracts and letters of appointment 
It is the Company’s policy that executive directors should serve under rolling service contracts of twelve months’ 
duration or less and that there should be no special provisions for compensation in the event of termination (neither  
in the normal course nor following a change in control of the Company) and that any compensation payments made 
should take account of the executive’s duty to mitigate his loss. This policy was confirmed during the year and the 
service contracts and letters of appointment disclosed below comply with this policy.  
The policy on non-executive directors’ letters of appointment is that they shall be for an initial period of no more than 
three years, but subject to notice at any time. During the year the notice periods for non-executive directors were 
extended after consideration of market practice and the time involved to recruit suitable candidates: to six months’ 
notice in the case of the Chairman and to three months’ notice in the case of the other non-executive directors 
(previously three months’ and one month’s notice, respectively). 
Summaries of the directors’ contracts are disclosed below and brief biographical details are set out on page 39. 
Directors’ contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection in accordance with Provision A.4.4 of  
the Code.

In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association Richard Stillwell and Lloyd Wigglesworth each retire by 
rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Tony Stuart was appointed to the board on 31 January 2011 and 
holds office until the next Annual General Meeting. The board supports their re-elections and, being eligible, they offer 
themselves for re-election. 
External appointments 
Executive directors may accept appointments outside the Company with the permission of the board. The extent to 
which any fees are retained by the individual or are remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case 
basis. No executive director held an external appointment during the year.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 51

profit before tax as it considers appropriate to take account of: (a) any increase or variation of the share capital of the 
Company; (b) any change to accounting standards practices affecting the calculation of profit before tax; or (c) any  
other factors considered by the Committee to be relevant.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 53

The vesting of awards made on 5 January 2011 is subject to performance conditions set by the Committee over a 
three year period as follows:  
(a) The EPS target  
One half of the total number of shares over which an award is granted is subject to an absolute adjusted earnings per 
share (‘EPS’) target. For these purposes the EPS target will be calculated by reference to the adjusted EPS as set out 
in the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for the 2012/2013 financial year, (subject to such further adjustments 
as the Committee considers fair and reasonable). No part of the award subject to the EPS target will vest unless EPS 
for the 2012/2013 financial year is equal to or greater than 14 pence, with full vesting for EPS of 16 pence or more,  
as follows: 
EPS for the 2012/2013  
financial year 
Percentage of the total number of shares subject to the EPS target that 
will vest 
16 pence or more 100% (i.e. 50% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
From 14 pence to 16 pence Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis (i.e. between 12.5% and  
50% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
Less than 14 pence 0% 
(b) Non-print added value target 
One quarter of the total number of shares over which an award is granted is subject to a target based on the increase 
in ‘added value’ attributable to non-print activities for the 2012/2013 financial year and an absolute EPS underpin. For 
these purposes added value attributable to non-print activities for the 2012/2013 financial year will be defined as sales 
less the costs of materials and bought-in costs attributable to non-print activities such as database marketing, pre-retail 
services and retail consultancy. No part of the award subject to the non-print added value target will vest unless the 
added value attributable to non-print activities for the 2012/2013 financial year is equal to 16 per cent, with full vesting 
for added value attributable to non-print activities of 20 per cent or more, as follows: 
Added value attributable to  
non-print activities for the  
2012/2013 financial year 
Percentage of the total number of shares subject to the non-print added 
value target that will vest, subject to satisfaction of the EPS underpin 
20% or more 100% (i.e. 25% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
From 16% to 20% Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis (i.e. between 6.25% and 
25% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
Less than 16% 0% 
In addition, no part of the award subject to the non-print activities condition described above will vest if EPS for the 
2012/2013 financial year is less than 12 pence (unless the Committee, in its discretion, determines otherwise).  54 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
(c) Relative TSR target 
One quarter of the total number of shares over which an award is granted is subject to a target measuring the relative 
Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) of the Company against a comparator group comprising those companies listed in the 
FTSE All-Share Support Services sector (excluding FTSE100 companies) on the award date and the satisfaction of an 
absolute EPS underpin. 
The TSR condition will be measured over a fixed three-year period and TSR will normally be averaged over the  
three-month period immediately prior to the commencement of the performance period and the three month period 
immediately preceding the end of the performance period. 
No part of the award subject to the TSR target will vest unless the Company’s TSR at the end of the performance 
period is at least the median as follows: 
Rank of the Company’s TSR  
against the comparator group at  
the end of the performance period 
Percentage of the total number of shares subject to the TSR target that 
will vest, subject to satisfaction of the EPS underpin 
Upper quartile or above 100% (i.e. 25% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis (i.e. between 6.25% and 
25% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
Median 25% (i.e. 6.25% of the total number of shares subject to the award) 
Below median 0% 
In addition, no part of the award subject to the TSR condition described above will vest if EPS for the 2012/2013 
financial year is less than 12 pence (unless the Committee, in its discretion, determines otherwise). 
The market price of St Ives plc ordinary shares of 10 pence each at 29 July 2011 was 92.38 pence and the range 
during the financial year was 69.5 pence to 110 pence.

Notes 
1. The transfer values have been calculated on the basis agreed by the Trustee of the St Ives Pension Scheme. The transfer values disclosed above  
do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director. Instead they represent a potential liability of the defined benefits pension scheme.  
2. The increase in the accrued pension during the year shown above excludes any increase arising from the statutory revaluation in deferment up to 
normal retirement age.  
3. The accumulated total accrued pension entitlements shown are calculated on service completed to 31 August 2008, the date the scheme ceased 
the accrual of further benefits and then increased to 30 July 2010 and 29 July 2011 in line with increases granted by the scheme. Total service  
to 31 August 2008 was 23 years 5 months, including 5 years 2 months’ service purchased from transfers-in to the Company’s defined benefits 
pension scheme.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year.  
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the 
Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law, the directors must not approve 
the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Company for that period.  
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors: 
 properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;  
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with 
the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
financial position and financial performance; and 
 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
 state whether applicable United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and 
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Group’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge 
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or 
loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and the management 
report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ Report, 
includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that 
they face.

4 October 2011  Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of St Ives plc 
  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 
 
We have audited the Group financial statements of St Ives 
plc for the 52 weeks ended 29 July 2011 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, 
the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and 
the related notes 1 to 34. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members,  
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of  
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Group financial statements and for 
being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (‘APB’s’) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied  
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the annual report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.  
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
affairs as at 29 July 2011, and of its loss for the year 
then ended; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and  
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB 
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, 
the Group in addition to complying with its legal obligation 
to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with 
IFRSs as issued by the IASB. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the Group 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the directors’ statement contained within the Directors’ 
Report in relation to going concern; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of St Ives plc for the 52 weeks ended 
29 July 2011 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having  
been audited.

Note 
An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether 
any changes may have occurred to the financial statements since first published. These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control 
procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.  58 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) 
adopted by the European Union and IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial 
instruments. The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.  
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made judgements as to the policies 
that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The accounting 
estimates and assumptions that management considers to be its critical accounting estimations are detailed and 
explained in the Financial Review. 
Going concern 
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is 
contained in the Business Review on page 11. 
(a) Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled  
by the Company (its subsidiary undertakings) for each period. Control is achieved where the Company has the  
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.  
The consolidated income statement does not consolidate line by line the trading of operations classified as 
discontinued operations. These are shown on a single line under ‘Profit/(loss) from discontinued operations’  
in the consolidated income statement.  
Certain balance sheet comparatives have been restated to reflect changes in presentation.  
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with 
those of the Group. All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
(b) Columnar classification in the income statement 
Income statement items are presented in the middle column under the heading ‘non-underlying items’ if they are 
significant in size and do not occur in the normal course of business, or if they comprise the operating results of  
a site arising after a formal decision on its closure has been taken where that site does not meet the definition of a 
discontinued operation under IFRS 5 – Assets held for sale and discontinued operations (in which case the site and 
its activities are referred to as a ‘non-continuing operation’), or if they comprise amortisation charges on acquired 
intangible assets. 
(c) Revenue recognition 
Revenue 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and comprises amounts receivable  
for goods and services, net of trade discounts, up-front payments, VAT and other sales-related taxes. Revenue is 
recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the 
customer, normally on shipment of the product. 
Income from advance billings is deferred and realised to revenue when conditions for its recognition have been fulfilled. 
Interest income 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest  
rate applicable.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 65
(d) Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the net 
fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary at the date of the acquisition.
Fair value is finalised within 12 months of the date of the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for 
impairment annually in accordance with the impairment of goodwill policy set out below. 
Other intangible assets – computer software 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment is classified as an intangible asset 
and is held on the balance sheet at cost. These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is 
generally two to five years. 
Other intangible assets – customer relationships  
Customer relationships identified as separable intangible assets in the context of business combinations are 
capitalised at their fair value at the date of acquisition. They are amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is 
eight years.  
(e) Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment held for use in the production or supply of goods, or for administration purposes is 
stated in the balance sheet at deemed cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. 
Costs are recognised as an asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will 
flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance are charged to the 
income statement during the period in which they are incurred.  
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes 
professional fees. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is charged, other than on freehold land and assets under the course of construction, so as to write off 
the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: 
Freehold buildings 2% – 4%
Long leases Period of lease
Plant and machinery 10% – 33
1
/
3
%
Fixture, fittings and equipment 10% – 33
1
/
3
%
Motor vehicles 20 – 25%
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement. 
(f) Impairment of property, plant and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. 
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the assets belongs. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have not been adjusted.   66 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately as an expense in the income statement.  
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the  
asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years.  
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately in the income statement. 
(g) Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from  
the synergies of the combination. A cash-generating unit represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored  
by the Group’s board of directors for internal management purposes. The recoverable amount of the group of  
cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date 
during each financial year, or more frequently when such events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may  
be impaired. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement. Impairments of goodwill are not  
subsequently reversed. 
(h) Assets held for sale 
Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current 
assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is 
available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale which should be 
expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. 
(i) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those production overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is valued on a first in, first 
out (‘FIFO’) basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completion and costs 
to be incurred in selling and distribution. 
(j) Tax 
The tax expense in the income statement comprises tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported 
in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and 
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit; and is accounted for using the balance sheet 
liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which 
deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary 
differences arise on goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than business combinations) of other assets or 
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 67
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is reduced to the extent that  
it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except where it relates to items 
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.  
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current assets against 
current liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends  
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  
(k) Government grants 
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the 
income statement over a period to match the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate. Grant income  
is recognised separately from the related expense. 
(l) Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable 
that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and its value can be reliably estimated. When a provision 
needs to be released, the provision is taken back to the income statement within the line where it was initially 
booked. 
Provisions for repairs 
Provisions for repairs are made where the Group is committed under the terms of the lease to make repairs to 
leasehold property. The provision is made for the estimated cost over the period of the lease. 
Provisions for restructuring costs 
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring  
that has been communicated to affected parties. 
(m) Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies other than Sterling are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated to Sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign currency differences arising on translation or settlement of monetary items are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  
are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and not retranslated each period end. Non-
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to 
Sterling at exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined. Exchange gains and losses arising on 
the retranslation of non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.  
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into Sterling at the rates 
prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items and the cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated at the average exchange rates for the period, except for individually material items which may be 
translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on retranslation of  
non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.  
Such translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the foreign operation  
is disposed of. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.  68 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

2. Significant accounting policies continued
(n) Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are 
assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the 
cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on 
qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
(o) Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a 
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate 
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Allowances are recognised in the income statement when there  
is objective evidence that their asset is impaired. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits. 
Bank borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds receivable, net of direct issue costs. 
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate 
method and are included in creditors to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Unsecured loan notes 
Floating Rate Guaranteed Loan Notes are recorded at their nominal value. Interest payable is accounted for on an 
accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and is included in creditors to the 
extent that it is not settled in the period in which it arises. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange for the 
purchase of capital equipment denominated in foreign currencies and the sale of goods similarly denominated. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges  
of forecast transactions are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
income statement. 
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, 
then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurements of the asset or liability. For the hedges 
that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income 
statement in the same period on which the hedged item affects the net profit and loss. 
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion of a net investment hedge is recognised in 
equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated  
in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operations are disposed of.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 69
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until  
the forecast transition occurs. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when 
their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts are not 
carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement. 
Those derivatives which are not designed as hedges are classified as held for trading and gains and losses on 
those instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(p) Retirement benefits 
The Group operates both defined benefits and defined contribution schemes for its employees. Payments to the 
defined contribution schemes are expensed to the income statement as they fall due. 
For the defined benefits pension scheme full actuarial calculations are carried out every three years using the 
projected unit credit method and updates are performed for each financial year end. Actuarial gains and losses  
are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and 
presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined 
benefits obligations and unrecognised past service costs, and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme’s assets. 
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds 
and reductions to the scheme. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
(q) Share-based payments 
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value  
at the date of the grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments  
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. The fair value of share options issued is measured using a binomial model, for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
(r) Leases 
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement in equal amounts over the terms  
of the lease. 
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present 
value of the minimum lease payments; each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to 
the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between 
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. 
(s) Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for 
each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities 
incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. 
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.  70 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
2. Significant accounting policies continued
(s) Business combinations continued
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values  
are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below).  
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are 
accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified  
as equity are not recognised. 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously-held interests in the acquired entity are 
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, 
if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that 
have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such 
treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3(2008) are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: 
 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised 
and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively; 
 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree’s share-based payment 
awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment; and 
 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held 
for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard. 
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. 
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or 
liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the 
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. 
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete 
information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of 
one year 
The value of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries is calculated initially as their share of identifiable net assets,  
and is subsequently adjusted by their share of comprehensive income.  
(t) Critical accounting judgements 
In the course of applying the Group’s accounting policies the following estimations have been made which could  
have a significant effect on the results of the Group were they subsequently found to be inappropriate. 
Impairment of goodwill 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-in-use of the cash-generating units  
for which goodwill has been identified. In arriving at the value in use an estimation of the future cash flows of  
cash-generating units and selecting appropriate discount rates is required to calculate present values, a process 
which involves estimation. The recoverability analysis indicates that the carrying amount of goodwill will be 
recovered in full. The situation will be monitored closely should future developments indicate that adjustments are 
appropriate. The carrying value of goodwill at the balance sheet date was £67.4 million (2010 – £54.4 million).  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 71
Impairment of plant and machinery 
The Group considers the recoverability of plant and machinery which is included within the balance sheet at  
£64.8 million. The key areas of judgement when assessing the recoverability of these assets are in relation to the 
forecast growth rates and discount rates to be applied to forecast cash flows. The recoverability analysis at the end  
of the period indicated that an impairment of £3.5 million was required in respect of assets located at the Blackburn, 
Bradford and Leeds sites, recorded within the Print segment, following a continued decline in the markets served  
by these sites. 
Retirement benefits obligations 
The calculation of retirement benefits obligations requires estimates to be made of discount rates, inflation rates, 
future salary and pension increases and mortality. The net liability in the balance sheet for retirement benefits 
obligations is £12.3 million (2010 – £32.9 million). 
Allowances against amounts receivable  
The Group considers the recoverability of certain customer and other receivable balances. Determining whether  
an allowance against these balances is required involves an assessment of the ability of counterparties to make 
required payments. If the financial positions of the counterparties were to deteriorate, affecting their ability to make 
payments, additional allowances may be required in future periods. The Group maintains credit insurance covering 
its larger trade debtors, a rigorous system of credit control is applied and amounts receivable are continually 
monitored. Management specifically monitors historical bad debt, counterparty creditworthiness, current economic 
trends and changes in payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances in place.

4. Segment reporting 
The Group manages its business on a market segment basis. Following a change in the way resources are allocated 
by the board, the Group’s chief operating decision maker, and in light of the increased proportion of investment in  
non-print businesses, the reporting segments were redefined in the period as Print and Marketing Services. The Print 
segment comprises the Group’s Books business previously reported within the Media Products segment and all the 
business that were reported within the Commercial Products segment except Occam, the database marketing 
services business. Occam is now reported within the Marketing Services segment together with Tactical Solutions,  
the field marketing services business acquired in the period. The results of the Group’s Magazine printing business 
previously reported under the Media Products segment are reported within discontinued operations. The nature of 
the market segments is described in the Business Review.   72 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
4. Segment reporting continued
The changes noted above did not result in any misstatement of the prior period reported balance sheet. Inter-
segment sales are charged at arm’s length prices. Corporate costs before non-underlying items are allocated to 
revenue-generating segments as this better reflects their profitability.

Operating losses from non-continuing operations classified as non-underlying items relate to operating results 
arising after the decision to close a site. In the period, these arose in respect of the Edenbridge site. Amortisation  
of acquired intangibles relates to customer relationships acquired with Tactical Solutions in the period as well as to 
customer relationships and in-house developed software acquired with Occam in the prior year. Costs associated 
with the acquisition of subsidiaries of £608,000 relate to the Tactical Solutions acquisition, principally professional  
advisers’ fees.  
Prior year 
In the prior year, operating losses from non-continuing operations arose in the Andover site and the Hayes site both  
of which are recorded within the Print segment. Amortisation of acquired intangibles relates to customer relationships 
and in-house developed software acquired with Occam in the period. Costs associated with the acquisition of 
subsidiaries of £418,000 relate to the Occam acquisition, principally professional advisers’ fees. Remaining other 
non-underlying costs relate primarily to the settlement of a health-related legal claim from a former employee.  
Tax 
In the current year, the tax credit relates to the items discussed above, and to the revaluation of deferred tax 
liabilities following the substantial enactment of the reduction of the UK statutory corporate income tax rate from  
27% to 25%. 
In the prior year, as well as the tax effects of the items noted above of £1,653,000, the tax credit of £4,106,000 
includes a credit of £2,453,000 comprising the release of a deferred tax liability in respect of rolled over capital 
gains, the current tax effect of a carryback and offset of unrecognised trading losses in The Netherlands and the 
revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities following the substantial enactment of the reduction of the UK statutory 
corporate income tax rate from 28% to 27% from April 2011.  78 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

The deferred consideration is payable in two tranches which are dependent upon the level of EBITDA achieved by 
Tactical Solutions in calendar year 2011 and calendar year 2012, the amounts of which are capped at £4 million and 
£5 million respectively. The Group received an option to purchase the remaining 10% of the single class of ordinary 
shares from August 2013 at a price dependent on the level of EBITDA achieved by Tactical Solutions in the financial 
year preceding the date of the exercise of the option. A nominal value of £1 has been attributed to this option at the 
balance sheet date.  
Had Tactical Solutions been acquired at the beginning of the financial year, it would have had the following 
incremental impact on the Group’s operating results:

Revenue 5,785 
Operating profit 747 
12. Discontinued operations 
On 6 April 2011, the Group completed the disposal of the four operating subsidiaries that made up the Group’s 
Magazine printing business, namely St Ives Peterborough Limited, St Ives Plymouth Limited, St Ives Roche Limited 
and St Ives Web Limited (‘the Magazine printing business’). Consideration receivable comprised £15,000,000  
in cash and £5,000,000 in loan notes secured on certain items of plant and machinery within the Magazine printing 
business. At the date of disposal the loan notes were scheduled to be repaid in 24 equal monthly instalments.  
All but the initial payment were subsequently rescheduled, with repayments due to recommence in December 2011. 
The monthly repayments have been increased such that that the full value of the loan notes are still due to be repaid 
within 24 months of the date of disposal. The loan notes do not bear interest and the nominal amounts receivable  
were discounted to their present value as at the date of disposal. The Magazine printing business is classified as  
a discontinued operation and prior period figures have been restated accordingly. 
The loss after tax for the prior period from the discontinued operation is analysed below:

The impairment of property, plant and equipment in the Magazine printing business was recorded in light of  
the decision to dispose of this business and was established by reference to the fair value less costs to sell of  
the assets.  
The US promissory loan note, receivable as deferred consideration in respect of the sale of the Group’s US segment 
in January 2009, was fully impaired in the period following a continued downturn in the US business, resulting in a 
charge of £3,454,000. 
The defined benefits pension scheme curtailment credit arose as a result of the change in membership status of 
employees of the Magazine printing business from in-service members to deferred members following the disposal  
of this business in the period. 
Other non-underlying items recorded in the period comprise redundancy and other restructuring charges arising  
in the group’s Magazine printing business. The sale of the four operating subsidiaries that make up the Magazine 
printing business was free of tax.  
The net assets of the Magazine printing business at the date of disposal, 6 April 2011 were as follows:

At 29 January 2011, following the decision to dispose of the Magazine printing business, impairment charges  
of £14,232,000 were recorded against plant and equipment in the Peterborough, Plymouth and Roche sites.  
The recoverable amount of the plant and equipment was calculated by reference to the estimated portion of  
the anticipated consideration receivable attributable to these assets. Following the completion of the disposal 
transaction on 6 April 2011, and the deconsolidation of the Magazine printing business as of that date, the final 
allocation of the consideration receivable indicated that the portion attributable to this plant and equipment  
(and hence its recoverable amount), was higher than the original estimate, and so £738,000 of the impairment  
loss booked at 29 January 2011 was reversed, reducing the impairment recorded in the period to £13,526,000.  
The disposal calculation shown in note 12 above includes plant and machinery at its carrying value net of these 
impairment charges.   St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 85
Impairment losses of £3,392,000 arose on plant and machinery at the Blackburn, Bradford and Leeds sites,  
following the continued decline in the markets served by these sites. The impairments have been recorded within  
the Print segment. Impairment losses have been measured by reference to value-in-use and have been recorded  
as non-underlying items.  
The Group has freehold land, included within property, plant and equipment and, in the prior period, assets  
held for sale, with a book value of £5,325,000 (2010 – £6,175,000) which has not been depreciated. The amount  
of fully depreciated property, plant and equipment and, in the prior period, assets held for sale is £54,722,000  
(2010 – £107,207,000). 
Included in the Group’s cost of plant and machinery are items in the course of construction amounting to £nil  
(2010 – £517,000). 
The carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment in respect of assets held under finance lease  
are £nil (2010 – £nil).

SP Group and Service Graphics are reported within the Print segment. Occam and Tactical Solutions are reported 
within the Marketing Services segment. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might  
be impaired. 
Tactical Solutions’ recoverable amount was tested by reference to market value at 29 July 2011. The recoverable 
amounts of the other cash generating units (‘CGUs’) are determined using value-in-use calculations. The key 
assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected 
changes to selling prices and direct costs (and therefore profits and losses) during the forecast period. Management 
estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money  
and the risks specific to the CGUs. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and 
expectations of future changes in the market. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent 
medium-term business forecasts with a terminal value calculation. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use 
calculations as well as the sensitivities to the key revenue growth assumption are detailed below.  86 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

In October 2009, the Group entered into at three-year £70 million revolving multicurrency loan agreement, which was 
reduced to £55 million in the period following the sale of the Magazine printing business. Up to £15 million may be 
drawn on as an overdraft facility. Interest on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies 
between 2.25% and 2.75%, depending on the ratio of the Group’s net debt to EBITDA excluding non-underlying 
items. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. As at 29 July 2011, the Group’s 
outstanding loans, within this agreement, were £nil (2010 – £10 million and US$5 million). The undrawn portion  
of this facility at 29 July 2011 was £55 million (2010 – £56.8 million).  
As at 29 July 2011, there was no loan or overdraft secured against the assets of the Group (2010 – £nil).

Provision for repairs 
Where the Group is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, provision for 
repairs is made for these estimated costs over a period of the lease. It is anticipated that these liabilities will 
crystallise between 2012 and 2021. 
Provision for reorganisation 
The provision for reorganisation relates primarily to the remaining costs in respect of plant closures and relocation 
and comprises severance payments, plant relocation, onerous property and other costs, which are expected to be 
settled by the end of the 2012 financial year. The charge in the period relates principally to the closure of the Hayes 
and Salisbury sites within the Exhibitions and Events business, as well as to restructuring activities in the Direct 
Response and Commercial, Books, and Point of Sale businesses, all of which are included within the Print segment.   St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 91
26. Retirement benefits 
Defined contribution schemes 
The Group operates defined contribution schemes for all qualifying employees. The assets of the schemes are held 
separately from those of the Group in funds under control of the trustees. Payments to the schemes are expensed  
to the income statement as they fall due. The total expense recognised in the income statement for continuing 
operations of £1,634,000 (2010 – £2,481,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at 
rates specified in the rules of the schemes. At 29 July 2011, contributions of £215,000 (2010 – £183,000) due in 
respect of the 2011 reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. The amounts were paid over 
subsequent to the balance sheet date, within the requisite time limits. 
Defined benefits scheme – St Ives Group 
The Group operates the St Ives defined benefits pension scheme, with assets held in separate trustee administered 
funds. This scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, and closed to future benefit accruals with effect 
from 31 August 2008.  
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefits 
obligations were carried out in April 2011 by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, Punter Southall  
& Co Ltd, (‘the actuary’) who is independent of the Group. This valuation was updated at 31 July 2011. The present 
value of the defined benefits obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured 
using the projected unit credit method. 
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 
2011
 per
annum
2010
 per
annum
Discount rate 5.50% 5.40%
Expected rate of inflation 3.50% 3.30%
Expected rate of salary increases 0.00% 0.00%
Future pension increases 3.25% 3.15%
Post-retirement mortality in the 2011 calculation is in accordance with the S1PA tables with an allowance of 1% 
lighter mortality for females. Future improvements from 2004 have been assumed in line with the 2009 CMI model 
and a long term improvement of 1% per annum. No adjustment has been made to the base table for males. 
Post-retirement mortality in the 2010 calculation was in accordance with the PA00 tables with future mortality 
improvements from 2002 in line with the ‘92 series’ year of birth projections allowing for the medium cohort effect and 
a minimum level of improvements of 1% per annum. The base table was adjusted to assume 6% greater mortality for 
males and 4% greater mortality for females.

The current service cost was allocated to functional cost lines in the income statement. The curtailment credit arises 
due to the disposal of the Magazine printing business and is included as a non-underlying item under discontinued 
operations. Expected return on assets is recorded under investment income and interest on obligation is recorded 
under finance costs. The actual return on scheme assets was a profit of £32,673,000 (2010 – £29,698,000).

The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or 
other assets used by, the Group. The expected rates of return on the individual categories of the scheme assets are 
determined following actuarial advice. The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual 
rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the scheme’s investment portfolio.

27. Financial risk management 
The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for managing the Group’s exposure to financial risk and operates within 
a defined set of policies and procedures reviewed and approved by the board. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group carries a cash flow risk where there are changes in the interest rate levied on the Group’s interest rate 
borrowings as currently interest on the Group’s borrowings is at floating rates. The Group finances its operations 
through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings. Group policy is to constantly review the exposure  
risk to interest rate fluctuations in relation to the risk as a proportion of Group earnings and wherever possible with 
matching short-term deposits of surplus funds. The Group is not subject to fair value interest rate risk as all debt  
is at floating rate. 
Interest rate management 
An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below:

date was outstanding for the whole year. 
2011 
£’000 
2010
£’000
100% movement in Sterling LIBOR – 65
The changes would not have impacted other equity reserves as all interest bearing financial assets and liabilities are 
subject to floating interest rates and their fair values do not fluctuate with changes in interest rates. 
Foreign exchange risk 
Following the full impairment of the US loan note receivable, the Group’s balance sheet is not significantly exposed 
to movements in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts 
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments and receipts 
and to manage the risk associated with anticipated sale and purchase transactions. Basis adjustments are made to 
the carrying amount of non-financial hedged items when the anticipated sale or purchase transaction takes place. 
The following table details the forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end:

Sell US dollars (up to 12 months) 1.56 232 149 8
Sell Euros (up to 12 months) 1.14 2,242 1,959 (4)
The Group has entered into contracts to supply goods to customers trading in continental Europe at prices 
denominated in Euros and to customers trading in the USA at prices denominated in US Dollars. Forward foreign 
exchange contracts have been used to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these commitments which are 
designated as cash flow hedges. As at 29 July 2011, the aggregate amount of unrealised profits under forward 
foreign exchange contracts deferred in the hedging reserve relating to the exposure on trade receivables and 
anticipated sale transactions amounted to £4,000. It is anticipated that the sales will be made in the 12 months 
following the balance sheet date.  
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, which represent the 
Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets. The Group’s credit risk is primarily 
attributable to its trade receivables. The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful 
receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current 
economic environment. The Group’s credit risk is relatively low as the Group maintains credit insurance up to a 
maximum aggregate claim in any one year of £3 million. In addition, its UK subsidiaries’ sales are principally with a 
large number of counterparties and customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling. 
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential 
customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers are 
reviewed regularly. Trade receivables include an amount with a single large customer which represents more than 
10% of the total balance. This customer has the highest credit score attributable under the credit scoring method 
used by the Group. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivables are debtors with a carrying value for which the Group has not provided as 
there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The 
Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are 
debtors with a carrying amount of £19.4 million (2010 – £15.4 million) which are past due at the reporting date for 
which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are 
still considered recoverable.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 95

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade 
receivable from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is 
limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and being covered by credit insurance arrangements. 
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for 
doubtful debts.

Liquidity risk 
The Group’s policy is to maintain flexibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short-term cash deposits 
and, where necessary, short-term bank borrowings for working capital and longer-term borrowings for capital 
expenditure requirements. The £70.0 million, three year revolving multicurrency agreement entered into in the prior 
period was reduced to £55.0 million following the sale of the Magazine printing business. The agreement includes an 
overdraft facility of £15.0 million to fund short-term working capital requirements. The contractual maturities of drawn 
down borrowings, as well as undrawn facilities, are detailed in note 23. 
Capital risk management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure 
of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 23, cash and cash equivalents, and 
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as 
disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.  96 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

31. Share-based payments 
The Company operates a number of share-based payment schemes for certain employees of the Group. IFRS 2 – 
Share-based Payment has been applied to all share-based rewards made after 7 November 2002 that did not vest 
before 31 July 2004 as detailed below: 
Discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme (‘2001 Scheme’) 
Executive directors and certain members of senior management have been granted share options under the 
Company’s discretionary share option schemes. Details of the 2001 Scheme are included on pages 52 and 53  
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report.  
Long-term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) 
Executive directors and certain members of senior management have been granted nil-cost share options under  
the Company’s long-term incentive plan. Details of the LTIP are included on pages 53 and 54 of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
A reconciliation of the movement in the number of share options is shown below:

The fair value of the options granted in the period under the LTIP was measured using a Black-Scholes options 
pricing model. The inputs to the model are: 
Weighted average mid-market share price 97.75p 
Weighted average exercise price £0.00
Expected life 3 years 
Expected volatility 30.00%
Risk free rate 2.00%
Dividend yield 5.00%
The Group recognised a total charge of £284,000 (2010 – £60,000) relating to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions. The exercise price of options outstanding at 29 July 2011 ranges between nil and 66.17 pence.  
Deferred Bonus Scheme 
On 1 November 2010, pursuant to the Directors and Senior Executives Deferred Bonus Scheme outlined on page 48 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, a portion of the net bonus payable to Patrick Martell, Matt Armitage and Lloyd 
Wigglesworth in respect of the 2010 financial year was used to purchase 201,163 shares in the Company from the 
Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘the EBT’) on behalf of these directors at 81 pence per share. An ESOP reserve was 
set up when the EBT originally purchased these shares at a price of 383 pence per share. When the shares were 
purchased on behalf of the directors in the period, an amount equivalent to their original cost of £769,000 was 
released from the ESOP reserve with the difference of £607,000 between the price paid on behalf of the directors 
and the original cost to the EBT of the shares taken directly to retained earnings. 
32. Related party transactions 
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on 
consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. No material related party transactions have been entered into  
during the year, which might reasonably affect the decisions made by the users of these financial statements. 
On 1 November 2010, shares in the Company were purchased from the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust on behalf  
of Matt Armitage, Patrick Martell and Lloyd Wigglesworth as outlined in note 31.  
No other executive officers of the Company or their associates had material transactions with the Group during  
the year.

of the consideration payable in cash and shares. The total consideration is capped at £6.0 million.  100 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of St Ives plc 
 
We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of St Ives plc for the 52 weeks ended  
29 July 2011 which comprise the parent company 
Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 15. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of  
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company 
and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit 
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors  
and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view. Our responsibility is to audit the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards  
for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused  
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to  
the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation  
of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the parent company financial statements: 
• give a true and fair view of the state of the parent 
company’s affairs as at 29 July 2011; 
• have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
• have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Opinion on matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company 
financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
• the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
are not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit. 
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the Group financial 
statements of St Ives plc for the 52 weeks ended  
29 July 2011.

Note 
An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may 
have occurred to the financial statements since first published. These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in 
this area. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
1. Accounting policies 
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom 
accounting standards. 
Going concern 
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is 
contained in the Business Review on page 11. 
(a) Accounting convention 
The financial statements of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation  
of certain land and buildings and financial instruments. 
(b) Accounting period 
The financial statements are prepared for the fifty two weeks ended 29 July 2011 (‘the financial year’). Comparative 
figures are for the fifty two weeks ended 30 July 2010. 
(c) Tangible fixed assets 
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction. On other assets it is provided 
on cost or revalued amounts in equal annual instalments over the estimated lives of the assets. The annual rates of 
depreciation are as follows: 
Freehold buildings  2% – 4% 
Long leases Period of lease 
Plant and machinery  10% – 33
1
⁄
3
% 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment  10% – 33
1
⁄
3
% 
Motor vehicles  20% – 25% 
As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 − Tangible Fixed Assets (‘FRS 15’), those freehold buildings valued 
at 31 July 1985 continue to be carried at that value, subject to depreciation. 
(d) Investments 
Investments are stated at historical cost, less any provision for impairment. 
(e) Tax 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) 
using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on 
current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax 
computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. 
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment 
to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings where there is no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
(f) Provision for repairs 
As the Company is committed under the terms of a lease to make repairs to leasehold premises, provision is made 
for the estimated cost of repairs over the lease period.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 103
(g) Foreign currencies 
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in 
overseas subsidiaries, exchange gains or losses on the borrowings have been offset in reserves to the extent that 
they do not exceed the associated exchange differences arising on the retranslation of net investments. 
The transactions of the Company denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Amounts receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet 
date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. These exchange differences are included in profit on ordinary 
activities before tax. 
(h) Share-based payments 
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, which are measured at fair value  
at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is 
expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will 
eventually vest. The fair value of share options issued is measured using a binomial model. The expected life used  
in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 
(i) Derivative financial instruments 
The Company’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and 
interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange for the 
purchase of capital equipment denominated in foreign currencies and the sale of goods similarly denominated. 
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the board of directors, which 
provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. 
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges  
of forecast transactions are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the 
profit and loss account. If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition 
of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the 
derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or 
liability. For the hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are 
recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised,  
or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedge transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit and loss 
account for the period. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives  
when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the host contracts  
are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the profit and loss account. 
Those derivatives which are not designated as hedges are classified as held for trading and gains and losses on 
those instruments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.  104 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

(j) Pension costs 
The Company operates a defined benefits pension scheme and a defined contribution pension scheme.  
The Company accounts for the defined benefits pension scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme  
under the provisions of FRS 17. Pension costs for the Company’s defined contribution scheme are charged

(k) Leases 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the 
periods of leases. 
(l) Cash flows 
A statement of cash flows has not been prepared for the Company as, in accordance with Financial Reporting 
Standard 1 (Revised): ‘Cash Flow Statements’ (‘FRS 1’), cash flow information has been shown in the financial

Bank overdrafts and loans 
In October 2009, the Company entered into a £70.0 million committed revolving multicurrency facility which  
was reduced to £55 million in the period following the disposal of the Magazine printing business. The facility 
terminates on 31 October 2012. Within the facility, up to £15.0 million may be drawn as an overdraft. Interest  
on loan drawdowns is charged at LIBOR plus a margin which varies between 2.25% and 2.75%, depending  
on the ratio of the consolidated net debt to EBITDA, excluding non-underlying items, of the Company and its 
subsidiary undertakings. Interest on overdraft drawdowns is charged at 2.00% over UK base rate. 
The Company’s overdraft is guaranteed by certain United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings and the Company 
guarantees the loans and overdrafts of those United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings. At 29 July 2011, the 
aggregate liability for the Company under this guarantee amounted to £11,765,000 (2010 – £83,557,000).  
The aggregate value of the Company’s loans and overdraft liabilities guaranteed by certain United Kingdom 
subsidiaries amounted to £18,677,000 (2010 – £43,746,000). 
As at 29 July 2011, there was no loan or overdraft secured against the assets of the Company (2010 – £nil).  
The directors consider that the carrying amount of the loans and overdrafts approximates their fair value. 
The Company has guaranteed amounts payable to certain suppliers of one of its trading subsidiaries.  
The maximum aggregate liability under these guarantees is £1,112,000.   108 St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011

On 1 November 2010, pursuant to the Directors and Senior Executives Deferred Bonus Scheme outlined on page 48 
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, a portion of the net bonus payable to Matt Armitage, Patrick Martell and Lloyd 
Wigglesworth in respect of the 2010 financial year was used to purchase 201,163 shares in the Company from the 
Group’s Employee Benefit Trust (‘EBT’) on behalf of these directors at 81 pence per share. An ESOP reserve was  
set up when the EBT originally purchased these shares at a price of 383 pence per share. When the shares were 
purchased on behalf of the directors in the period, an amount equivalent to their original cost of £769,000 was 
released from the ESOP reserve with the difference of £607,000 between the price paid on behalf of the directors 
and the original cost to the EBT of the shares taken directly to retained earnings.  St Ives plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 109

14. Retirement Benefits 
The Company participates in both the defined benefits and defined contribution schemes operated by St Ives plc. 
The defined benefits scheme is a multi-employer scheme, the assets and liabilities of which are held in separate 
trustee-administered funds. The pension costs are based on pension costs across the Group as a whole. For the 
defined contribution scheme, the profit and loss charge represents contributions payable. 
The pension costs of the Company are disclosed in note 4. 
For the purpose of FRS 17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the 
defined benefits scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis. Accordingly, the Company accounts for the defined 
benefits scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.  
The defined benefits scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002 and closed to future benefit 
accrual from 31 August 2008. There are no contributions to fund future defined benefit accrual after 31 August 2008. 
Contributions of £2,200,000 were made in the period and the Company expects to contribute £2,200,000 to the 
scheme in 2012. 
The Group is required to account for the defined benefits scheme under International Accounting Standard  
19 − Employee Benefits (‘IAS 19’). The IAS 19 disclosures, included in note 26 of the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements, have been based on the results of the actuarial valuation of the defined benefits scheme  
as at 6 April 2007 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19 and  
updated to 29 July 2011 by the scheme’s actuary. These disclosures show that the scheme’s assets represented 
95.2% of the scheme’s liabilities (2010 – 86.5%).

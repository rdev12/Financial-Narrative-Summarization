Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 A YEAR OF PROGRESS
PROGRESS IN 2015
Last year we maintained the focus on 
investing in enhancing our product ranges 
to meet the rapidly changing needs of 
customers and to address new areas for 
growth. The increase of 4 per cent in 
revenue to $477.1 million and the increasingly 
large number of new solutions launched, 
particularly in the second half, are evidence 
of good progress being achieved.
Networks & Applications, representing 
over half of our revenue, performed 
notably well with revenue growing by 9 per 
cent. On the other hand the market served 
by our Wireless business contracted causing 
revenue to fall. To meet this challenge 
decisive action was taken in the fourth 
quarter to reshape the operational cost base. 
It was good to see a stronger than expected 
finish to 2015 across the whole Group.
DIVIDEND
Although investment has been high over 
the last two years, this has been undertaken 
from a strong financial position. The 
Company has no debt and cash balances 
of $102.0 million as at 31 December 2015. 
The final dividend recommended by the 
Board is 2.21 cents, resulting in a total 
dividend for 2015 of 3.89 cents per share.
BOARD CHANGES
We have made a number of changes to the 
composition of the Board in 2015. In May 
we welcomed Tom Lantzsch to the Board 
as a non-executive director; Tom brings 
a wealth of technology experience to the 
Board, currently serving as the Executive 
Vice President of Strategy at ARM Holdings 
Plc. He has also held senior positions at 
a range of leading technology companies. 
Ian Brindle stepped down from the Board 
in August 2015 after having served since 
December 2006. We miss his knowledge, 
wisdom and counsel. In June this year we 
were pleased to welcome Jonathan Silver 
to the Board, and Jonathan has now taken 
Ian’s place as the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Jonathan brings over 25 years 
of experience as the Chief Financial Officer 
of Laird plc, together with valuable 
experience as a non-executive director. 
We announced in November that Rachel 
Whiting, our Chief Financial Officer had 
decided to retire and would step down 
from the Board at this year’s AGM. On 
behalf of the Board I would like to express 
our gratitude for all her hard work and 
her contribution to the Board and to the 
success of the Group. The search for 
Rachel’s replacement is underway and 
we will make an announcement in due 
course about the identity of her successor.
BOARD VISITS
Members of the Board visited a number 
of our offices this year and met with 
the management teams of many of our 
business units. We have been impressed 
by the dedication, flair and inventiveness 
demonstrated by our employees which 
enables us to deliver the complex solutions 
customers seek. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank everyone in the Group 
for their contribution this year and we look 
forward to continuing momentum in 2016.
OUTLOOK
The Board is confident that we are set 
on the path to achieve overall order 
and revenue growth for Spirent as our 
R&D focus on the most attractive market 
segments continues to deliver and as 
we begin to see the returns from our sales 
and marketing investments accelerate.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT –  
DELIVERING ON OUR INVESTMENTS
2015 saw further structural changes in the 
test and measurement industry driven by 
shifts in technological developments, such 
as the move from lab-based testing to live 
deployments; heightened emphasis on 
virtual products and cloud infrastructure; 
the maturity of the market for smartphones 
in developed regions; and continued 
consolidation of major customers. The 
relentless growth in data volumes continues, 
requiring higher speed Ethernet deployments 
to provide enhanced capacity and resilience 
against a background of an increasing 
cyber security threat. 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Group revenue grew by 4 per cent in 
2015 to $477.1 million (2014 $457.2 million), 
whilst the order intake for the Group 
was 3 per cent higher at $482.0 million 
(2014 $469.4 million) with a book to bill 
ratio of 101 (2014 103).
Revenue growth was strong in Networks & 
Applications, up 9 per cent, and in Service 
Assurance, up 16 per cent. Wireless & 
Service Experience revenue decreased 
by 6 per cent, as it was impacted by the 
change in demand for smartphone 
development and validation testing. 
Regionally the Americas and APAC were 
strong, with EMEA somewhat weaker.
The year started slowly with first half 
revenues down $2.3 million compared 
to 2014. Momentum improved during 
the second half with revenue growing 
$22.2 million, up 9 per cent over the 
same period last year. This was even 
more exaggerated at the level of adjusted 
operating profit: first half profit decreasing 
by $14.6 million to $6.0 million, but the 
strong revenue growth combined with 
expense constraint in the second half year 
delivered a $10.7 million increase in profit 
to $36.1 million, up 42 per cent over the 
second half of 2014. This resulted in full 
year adjusted operating profit of 
$42.1 million.
In 2015 the increased level of product 
development was maintained at 
$118.3 million (2014 $115.4 million), 
with a marked increase in sales and 
marketing activities at $127.2 million 
(2014 $113.5 million). Spirent delivered 
23 new product solutions to market in the 
year, created a new platform for big data 
analytics, delivered leading 100G Ethernet 
and SDN protocol test solutions, and 
significantly enhanced its cyber security 
capabilities. The expansion in sales and 
marketing delivered growth in major 
accounts and resulted in the addition 
of 498 new customers in the year.
Return on sales was 9 per cent for the 
year, a reduction against the 10 per cent 
recorded for 2014, reflecting the significant 
increase in sales and marketing efforts to 
create new market opportunities for the 
longer term. 
Basic earnings per share for the Group 
decreased in 2015 to 2.18 cents per share 
(2014 3.35 cents). Adjusted basic earnings 
per share was 5.00 cents (2014 5.82 cents).
Free cash flow generation was strong at 
$35.3 million in 2015 (2014 $10.7 million), a 
cash conversion ratio of 2.7 times reported 
earnings (2014 0.5 times). The Company 
has no debt and cash balances were 
$102.0 million at 31 December 2015 
(2014 $99.8 million).
The final dividend recommended is 
2.21 cents per share, unchanged from 
2014. The total dividend for 2015 is also 
unchanged at 3.89 cents per share.
“ 
Momentum improved in the 
second half with revenue 
growth up 9 per cent over 
the same period last year

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 STRATEGY
The second year of implementing our 
strategy to invest for long term growth has 
delivered a record range of new products, 
solutions and services to address the 
radically changing requirements for 
verification, assurance and security of 
data communications. Investments have 
been made in customer service and 
support, product development, marketing 
and in acquiring new technologies. The 
aim is to enhance Spirent’s competitive 
differentiation, to expand the solutions 
set to gain market share and to win new 
customers. A long term objective is to 
expand revenues through software 
subscription, services and royalties in 
addition to our core business providing 
capital equipment as part of the sale of 
test systems.
Customers come to Spirent when they have 
a need to test a network, device or service 
they supply, either prior to or during 
deployment and we develop a wide range 
of innovative solutions to make that happen. 
We remain committed to our strategy and as 
explained below have made progress in all 
areas of our strategic priorities during 2015. 
Those priorities are to:
• expand the markets we serve;
• establish and maintain technology 
leadership;
• deepen our customer relationships;
• acquire new capabilities 
and technologies;
• invest in our people; and
• maintain financial strength and flexibility. 
STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT 
AND GROWTH INITIATIVES
Spirent is recognised as an expert in test 
methodologies and the provision of new 
efficient and effective solutions for live, 
virtual and high speed, high density 
network deployment utilising a wide range 
of access technologies. As experts we 
work closely with industry thought leaders, 
standard setting bodies and researchers. 
This sets the priorities for investment in the 
business to adapt and change in order for 
it to remain competitive and sustainable.
There continue to be a number of themes 
which are driving change in our industry 
and where we see opportunities for  
Spirent to build revenue streams that 
are sustainable with long term growth 
potential. The following major themes 
remain the key objectives for our strategic 
development throughout 2016.
HIGH SPEED ETHERNET
Order intake grew 10 per cent year-on-year 
in 2015. Spirent offers leading test solutions 
for 100G and 400G Ethernet and is well 
positioned for the continued exponential 
growth in network bandwidth. The latest 
innovation to increase capacity in data 
centers is through the development of high 
speed Ethernet variants based on 25G, 
which will stimulate growth in our core 
business operations. Spirent was first to 
launch 2.5G and 5G based Ethernet switch 
testing solutions and in the fourth quarter 
of 2015 was first to market with a 50G test 
solution. In addition, we added Wi-Fi test 
capability to Spirent TestCenter
TM
; and 
updated and enhanced the user interface 
to support software as a service (“SaaS”) 
and web-based applications. 
CLOUD AND VIRTUALISATION
This represented 2 per cent of our 
business in 2015 and is an area expected 
to grow rapidly. We have developed and 
launched new solutions for testing cloud 
infrastructures and virtualisation. Proof of 
concept trials are in progress at major 
service providers, web services companies 
and e-commerce providers. The trials 
address the needs for telecom operators to 
test, measure and validate the migration of 
network functions and services to run in a 
cloud infrastructure. This is an important 
part of our strategy to expand our served 
customer base. These offerings include a 
SaaS solution, running multiple application 
methodologies, such as Cloud Stress.
MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE
Order intake grew 31 per cent in 2015. 
We have accelerated development to 
continue to grow in the lab test market 
for mobile core, Wi-Fi, IMS, Diameter and 
virtualisation. There are a large number 
of proof-of-concept trials in progress and 
we have secured new contract wins across 
the world with major service providers. 
Landslide EDGE has been developed 
to facilitate cell site turn-up and deliver 
remote and end-to-end validation 
in live networks. We have also added 
a key partnership for network visibility 
making a $5 million investment to take 
a 28 per cent stake in Jolata, Inc. The 
increasing trend for data usage driven

”
by video requirements is being satisfied 
with a new acceleration module to offer a 
massive increase in data test performance. 
Channels to market have been expanded, 
as has the technical capacity to support 
many more customer engagements. 
CYBER SECURITY
This represented 6 per cent of our 
business in 2015, and is expected to grow 
rapidly. More and more breaches are 
reported on a daily basis with increasing 
levels of damage impacting commercial, 
government and infrastructure networks 
and services. Aspects of security and 
safety concerns for connected vehicles are 
demanding new security test processes to 
which Spirent is actively responding. 
Security consulting has been added to 
provide threat detection services to test, 
measure and manage security risks, initially 
prioritising networks, wireless, applications, 
Internet of Things and automotive. We are 
utilising our expertise to supplement 
research efforts for the addition of new 
malware threat and fuzzing capabilities 
to our solutions. It is planned to enhance 
marketing initiatives to help expand our 
served markets to include enterprise 
customers in the financial services, 
healthcare and hospitality industries.
Vulnerability of the signals emanating 
from satellite navigation constellations 
is of increasing concern in critical safety, 
infrastructure and commercial systems. 
Further resources are being applied to 
offer test systems, including a cyber threat 
intelligence library, to allow customers to 
deliver robust position, navigation and 
timing metrics to their applications and 
infrastructure networks. 
ANALYTICS
Big data analytics and virtualisation 
are changing the landscape of service 
provision and assurance. Advances here 
have opened up the possibility not only to 
find errors rapidly but also to predict them 
so that issues can be averted. In addition, 
virtualisation enables test probes to be 
cost effectively inserted at any point in the 
network. Spirent’s leadership position in 
the service assurance market, along with 
our field proven analytics platform, 
presents a unique opportunity in the 
analytics market. In 2015 we developed 
and launched our first virtual probe and 
won a first contract with our new high 
performance analytics solution, InTouch 
CNA. This is a more versatile, easier to 
use and cost effective implementation 
of our powerful Customer Experience 
Management software system to address 
the rapid growth market in the next-
generation service assurance market. 
The objective is to expand our served 
customer base in carriers worldwide and 
to give additional competitive advantage 
to the deployment of Spirent technologies 
in live networks.
ADJACENT MARKETS (LONG TERM 
GROWTH INITIATIVES):
Internet of Things 
Our Internet of Things (“IoT”) initiatives 
combine capabilities across the Spirent 
portfolio as well as the specific 
development of new capabilities. As 
billions of devices become connected, 
mobile network operators and service 
providers face major challenges to 
manage service provision and quality 
levels. Spirent has products and services 
to enable and accelerate the development, 
launch and operations of devices, network 
management and optimisation. We plan 
to supply embedded software, test and 
assurance tools and systems to enable 
the development of the IoT. The initial 
offerings, to be announced from early 
2016, will be software as a client, 
connectivity and analytical tools.
Automotive
Our strategy to enter the test market for 
automotive data networks is to utilise 
Spirent’s expertise in Ethernet testing to 
focus initially on the development and 
deployment of Ethernet for in-vehicle 
system communications. We will also 
continue to serve automotive needs 
through positioning technologies and 
tools to test emergency call requirements.

UNDERSTANDING OUR MARKET  
AND GLOBAL TRENDS
revenues of $984 billion in 2018; this is a 
CAGR (2013-2018) of 21.5 per cent; the device 
and installation revenue will grow at a CAGR 
of 23 per cent and the service revenue will 
grow at a CAGR of 21 per cent
3
. 
As service providers strive to do more than 
offer larger pipes, their ability to leverage 
customer data becomes a key competitive 
advantage. Spirent entered this market 
with the acquisition of DAX technologies in 
2014. Using analytics, service providers are 
able to get actionable insight that will help 
them increase revenues, reduce capex, 
improve customer experience and build 
customer loyalty. 
ETHERNET SPEEDS
The past four decades of Ethernet has seen 
a steady increase in speeds from 1G Ethernet 
through 10G, 40G, 100G and Spirent was 
first-to-market with a 400G Ethernet test 
solution. However it’s not all about the highest 
absolute bandwidth as purpose-specific 
speed increases will drive multiple refresh 
cycles across the Ethernet spectrum. Cloud 
providers, Telco Network Virtualisation and 
leading enterprise data centers will be the 
driving force behind a rapid transition from 
servers with multi-core processors and 10G 
connections to 25G and 50G Ethernet in 
the next few years. While in the enterprise 
campus area the bandwidth increases and 
reliance on Wi-Fi are the driving force behind 
the move from 1G to 2.5G and 5G Ethernet for 
Wi-Fi access point connectivity. Spirent leads 
development in this area with new 25G and 
50G Ethernet test solutions released in 2015 
and 2.5G/5G planned for early 2016.
CLOUD AND NETWORK 
VIRTUALISATION
The agility and efficiency with which cloud 
providers launch new applications and 
services, has been a driving force of 
innovation in the telecom industry for the last 
four years. Service providers have gone from 
small trials, network functions virtualisation 
(“NFV”) to run on cloud infrastructure 
with software defined networks (“SDN”), 
to deployments of complete virtualised 
enhanced mobile packet core (“vEPC”) 
networks for new mobile data services for 
connected cars. IHS Infonetics expects the 
total service provider NFV market will grow 
from $950 million in 2014 to $11.6 billion in 
2019, with a 2014-2019 CAGR of 65 per cent
4
. 
Spirent leads the market with performance 
and scale validation solutions for dozens 
of virtual network functions as well as 
benchmarking solutions for the underlying 
NFV infrastructure. 
SECURITY BREACHES 
GETTING PERSONAL
Recent headlines announce the critical 
nature of network security and the importance 
of protecting customer data from harm. 
According to data from the Identity Theft 
Resource Center, during 2015 there were 
over 780 major breaches in the US, and nearly 
170 million records exposed
5
. The Ponemon 
Institute claims an average cost to business 
of $6.5 million per data breach. No sector 
remained untouched as breaches impacted 
all sectors including government, technology, 
healthcare and entertainment
6
. 
Fuelled by the ever-changing nature of 
cyber security attacks, Spirent customers in 
the network equipment development, service 
providers and enterprise space are investing 
in advanced network threat prevention. 
According to IHS Infonetics, network 
advanced threat prevention spend is set to 
reach $1.3 billion in 2019, a 2014-2019 CAGR 
of 22 per cent
7
. Innovation is happening at 
multiple levels, from leveraging analytics 
to detect zero day attacks quicker to new 
network security services operated from 
the cloud. With its network application 
performance and security threat detection 
validation solutions, Spirent is providing the 
industry with the latest up-to-date and most 
relevant attack simulation capabilities. 
THE CHANGING REQUIREMENTS 
OF MOBILE CONNECTIVITY 
Consumers are using new services in ways 
that drive mobile operators to increase 
capacity and reduce latency. The industry 
is moving beyond debating the benefits 
of voice over LTE (“VoLTE”) to face the 
challenges of launching and managing these 
services. GSA reported 30 operators have 
commercially launched VoLTE high definition 
voice in 21 countries, and 111 operators are 
investing in VoLTE deployments, trials or 
studies in 52 countries (21 October 2015)
1
. 
The opportunity for carrier Wi-Fi hotspots 
is heating up, as mobile operators seek ways 
to integrate Wi-Fi with their mobile network, 
either by offering hotspots or offloading some 
mobile data traffic to a Wi-Fi network. Recent 
technology advances (802.11ac) and newly 
freed up Wi-Fi spectrum (5GHz) enable new 
service configurations, including in-home 
video networks and voice over Wi-Fi 
(“VoWi-Fi”) calling with handoff to the external 
cellular network. Infonetics Research predicts 
the carrier Wi-Fi equipment market will grow 
from $609 million in 2014 to $2.6 billion 
in 2019, which represents a compound 
annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 34 per cent  
(27 April 2015)
2
. 
The communications industry surged ahead 
towards an age of hyper-connectivity with 
the Internet of Things (“IoT”). IoT will bring 
new opportunities and challenges as large 
numbers and a wide variety of devices will 
be connected to networks. This will drive a 
need for faster, cheaper ways to connect to 
the network to securely and cost-effectively 
communicate information, and to manage 
the networks to provide the level of service 
required for these applications to run 
efficiently. Machina Research estimated there 
would be 5.5 billion connections at the end of 
2015 and forecasts there will be 10.8 billion 
connections at the end of 2018; this is a CAGR 
(2013-2018) of 24.5 per cent. They estimated 
revenues of $563 billion in 2015 and forecast

network infrastructure. Networks are 
also becoming oversaturated as the 
volume of data center traffic jumps 
more than 10X, calling for next-
generation firewall appliances with  
core network bandwidth capabilities 
approaching 100 GbE and beyond. 
Spirent TestCenter and Avalanche 
were used for performance evaluation 
of the world’s first 100Gbps Ethernet, 
Data Center Firewall Appliance.
“Fortinet is enabling organisations to deploy  
core firewalling in high speed, high data volume  
environments, without compromising overall performance

SCALING 
THE MOBILE 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The “always on” Internet of Things 
(“IoT”) and other connected devices are 
driving huge levels of signalling traffic 
in the mobile network. Surges or 
storms, congestion, service degradation 
and inter-carrier issues can lead to slow 
or dropped connections, lost billing 
data, dissatisfied customers, and in 
the worst case network wide outages.
Landslide Diameter is a comprehensive 
solution that tests signalling protocols 
at extreme scale so carriers can ensure 
efficient and optimised services.
“As more operators deploy LTE VoLTE and enhanced IP 
services the amount of Diameter messages within and 
between operators is growing. Optimising the signalling 
plane has become a necessity. Solutions such as Spirent’s 
Landslide Diameter enable operators to ensure efficient 
and optimised Diameter signalling.”

REASON FOR MEASUREMENT The 
ratio of orders booked to revenue billed 
is a measure of the visibility of future 
revenues at current levels of activity and 
provides an indication of the underlying 
trend in Spirent’s future revenue stream.
PERFORMANCE The Group aims 
to maintain a book to bill ratio of 100 
or higher. The 2015 ratio of 101 is a 
positive result.
RELEVANCE TO STRATEGY The book 
to bill ratio is an indicator of whether 
future activity levels are rising or

UNDERPINS EVERYTHING WE DO 
THE PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CURRENTLY 
FACED BY THE SPIRENT GROUP
Principal risks and uncertainties
Like all businesses, Spirent is exposed to 
a number of risks and uncertainties. These 
risks may arise from internal factors, but 
some will be a result of external factors 
over which the Group has little or no direct 
control. It is the effective management 
of these risks that supports Spirent in 
delivering on its strategic objectives, 
safeguards the Group’s assets and, over 
time, will also enhance shareholder value. 
The process to identify and manage the 
principal risks and uncertainties of the 
Spirent Group is an integral component 
of the internal control system.
The risk assessment process starts in 
the businesses, where up-to-date risk 
registers are maintained and updated as 
part of the normal operating and control 
procedures. Each business identifies its 
key risks and nominates a risk owner. The 
impact and the likelihood of occurrence of 
each risk is ranked, which assists the Group

GROUP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
AUDIT COMMITTEE
BOARD
Executive Committee in assessing the 
importance of each risk to the Spirent Group 
as a whole. Once risks have been assessed, 
an appropriate risk mitigation response is 
determined for each risk identified. The 
individual businesses are required to update 
their risk registers as new or emerging risks 
are identified.
It is not possible to identify every risk that 
could affect the business and the actions 
described below to mitigate those risks 
cannot provide absolute assurance that 
the risk will not occur or adversely affect 
the operating or financial performance 
of the Group.
The Board has classified the principal risks 
by the impact the risk would be expected 
to have on the Group should it occur, and 
the anticipated likelihood that that risk may 
occur using the following classifications:
Risk Impact
Impact High 
Medium 
Low
Likelihood of occurrence Likely
Possible
Unlikely
The Board takes the view that a High 
impact risk could lead to a 10 per cent 
or more reduction in turnover, a Medium 
impact risk a 5 to 10 per cent reduction 
in turnover and a Low impact risk a 
reduction of up to 5 per cent of turnover.
The Audit Committee reviews and monitors 
the Group’s risk processes and reports to 
the Board on their effectiveness. Risk is 
considered by the Audit Committee at least 
three times per year, at which time risk 
registers for both the Group and the 
material business units within the Group 
are reviewed. The Audit Committee 
challenges and debates the risks with 
reference to risk tolerance and appetite, 
as set by the Board. Progress made and 
any further actions to be taken regarding 
mitigation plans, as well as any changes 
to the risk profile, are discussed in detail.
22
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 RISK APPETITE AND DEVELOPING THE VIABILITY STATEMENT
Provision C.2.2 of the 2014 UK Corporate 
Governance Code requires the Board to 
assess the viability of the Group over a 
suitable period. It was determined that a 
three year period should be used when 
assessing viability, as explained on page 
76 of this Annual Report.
This new Code Provision has acted as a 
catalyst for the Board to more clearly 
articulate its risk appetite. The Board has 
sought to frame its risk appetite in terms 
of the markets and technologies in which 
it is prepared to make significant 
investments, and those in which it would 
expect its scale of investment to be more 
modest. Except where very attractive 
opportunities were to present themselves 
to achieve greater scale in well-known 
markets, the Board would expect to 
maintain a significant net cash position.
Management, together with members 
of the Board, considered which of 
the principal risks, either alone or in 
combination, might threaten the Group’s 
viability. The impacts of Technology 
change, Competition, Customer 
dependence and Macro-economic 
change were modelled. A severe but 
plausible combination of those risks 
was considered for the purposes of 
deciding what turnover and free cash flow 
scenarios should be stress-tested. The 
impacts were modelled over the three 
year period, with emphasis on a stressed 
scenario in years two and three, given the 
management’s view that such risks were 
unlikely to materialise in year one, as the 
Group had just completed a detailed full 
year budget for 2016. Assumptions were 
made about the ability of the Group to 
take successful mitigation actions, 
including the ability to make significant 
reductions in its non-fixed operating 
costs. The Board took into account the 
Company’s significant cash balance of 
$102.0 million as at 31 December 2015 
and the ability of the Company to continue 
to generate positive free cash flow even 
in stressed scenarios.
The Board reviewed and discussed 
with management:
• the process undertaken by 
management to decide which 
scenarios to stress test;
• the results of the stress testing 
performed, including an illustration 
on the reduction in turnover and 
availability of cash; and
• the ability of management to 
successfully take the mitigating 
actions identified.
The resulting Viability Statement is set 
out in the Directors’ report on page 76.
The Board had identified the following principal risks, each of which is discussed below:
Risk Impact Likelihood Change*
Macro-economic High Likely 
Technology change High Likely 
Customer dependence / Customer investment plans Medium Likely 
Competition Medium Possible 
Acquisitions Medium Possible 
Business continuity High Possible 
Employee skillbase Medium Possible 
* The Board’s view of the likelihood of occurrence and/or impact has changed (combined) compared with the prior year.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Principal risks and uncertainties continued
RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION ACTIONS
MACRO-ECONOMIC
Spirent is a global business exposed to current world 
economic conditions over which it has no control. 
The business is also exposed to government 
spending priorities, principally in the United States.
Deterioration in economic conditions  
may lead to a reduction in the level  
of demand for Spirent’s products and 
services and cause customers to delay 
their purchasing decisions.
The Group closely monitors both market 
and geographic trends in order to respond 
to changes in demand and be in a position 
to take timely actions to protect profitability 
where possible.
In addition, Spirent has a large number 
of geographically diverse customers, 
which may mitigate the impact.
TECHNOLOGY CHANGE
Spirent sells complex solutions in industries that can 
be subject to rapid technological changes. Testing 
new technologies drives our business, but the 
opportunity also brings high risk since keeping at 
the forefront of these key future technologies is 
critical to our success and to ensuring that we 
remain competitive in our markets.
It is critical that our product development investment 
is directed at the right areas in order to deliver the 
solutions that our customers need, when they 
need them.
Spirent’s success is dependent in part on proprietary 
technology which may be infringed by others. 
Protecting the Group’s proprietary technology is 
important to enabling Spirent to compete successfully.
If product development investment does 
not keep pace with the speed of change 
in technologies, or if it is not directed at the 
right key areas, our competitive position and 
financial performance will suffer.
If Spirent’s solutions take longer to develop 
than anticipated or longer to develop than our 
competitors then our competitive position and 
financial performance will also suffer.
Changes in technologies may lead to a short 
term pause by our customers investing in 
our solutions.
Intellectual property claims can result in 
significant defence costs, and may affect 
Spirent’s ability to market its products.
All Spirent’s businesses work very closely 
with customers and remain focused on 
their requirements.
Each business makes investment decisions 
specifically related to their solutions portfolio 
based on market needs. This happens 
through our formalised Gate Process.
Spirent continues to make a significant 
investment in product development. 
In 2015 the investment was $118.3 million 
(2014 $115.4 million).
Spirent has active intellectual property 
protection programmes in place to obtain 
appropriate protection in a cost-effective 
manner.
CUSTOMER DEPENDENCE / CUSTOMER INVESTMENT PLANS
The Group sells its products and services to a wide 
range of companies and continually seeks to expand 
its customer base. In 2015, no one customer accounted 
for more than 10 per cent of Group revenue, although 
the top 10 customers represented 39 per cent of Group 
revenue (2014 35 per cent). In some of our markets 
certain customers have a dominant market share, 
which makes doing business with these customers and 
their suppliers critical to the success of our business.
In addition, many of the companies with which 
we do business are some of the largest global 
telecommunications corporations. Therefore 
meeting our development obligations, producing 
high quality products, and being on time are vital to 
Spirent’s reputation and success.
Changes in our major customers’ priorities in 
technology investments can also have a significant 
impact on their spending on Spirent products and 
by those in the customers’ supply chain.
The industry continues to experience consolidation 
which can disrupt the spending patterns of 
affected customers.
Loss of one or more of Spirent’s major 
customers could have a significant impact 
on Spirent’s financial results.
Spend on Spirent’s products is often capital in 
nature and so customer spend can fluctuate 
significantly from year-to-year.
Significant failings in either quality or being 
able to deliver in the appropriate timescale 
could cause long lasting damage to Spirent’s 
reputation and relationships.
Customer consolidation could result in delays 
in spending thereby reducing demand for 
Spirent’s solutions and services and also 
reduce the potential number of customers 
to whom those solutions and services could 
be sold.
Changes in our customers’ technology 
investments can result in reduced spending 
on our existing solutions before customers 
and those in the customer’s supply chain 
ramp up spending on new technologies.
Strong customer relationships are critical 
to Spirent. We aim to provide innovative 
solutions which meet customers’ needs 
and we place great emphasis on providing 
professional service and support.
One of the Group’s strategic objectives 
is to invest in deepening our customer 
relationships. We place engineers on-site 
with our customers, undertake site surveys 
of the use and intended plans for the use 
of test solutions in their business. 
We seek to establish thought leadership 
in our industry through participation in 
standards bodies and industry forums, 
which in turn creates additional links with 
customers. Our approach is to play a key 
part in the wider supply chain to our key 
service provider customers by aligning 
with early adopters of technology.
COMPETITION
Spirent operates in a range of highly competitive niche 
markets which experience rapid technological change. 
In order to compete effectively it is necessary to 
establish and maintain technological differentiation in 
our solutions.
The Group faces competition from new market 
start-ups as well as more established and well-
resourced companies.
Industry consolidation amongst our direct competitors 
may bring about a shift in competitive advantage.
Actions by competitors and increased 
competition can bring about pressure 
on Spirent’s gross margin. These factors 
could also affect Spirent’s competitive 
position, thereby reducing revenue and 
consequently affecting financial results.
The Group’s broad solution portfolio, 
market-leading capabilities and customer 
focus continue to address this risk.
Spirent aims to maintain market-leading 
positions through significant investment 
in the development of differentiated 
products.
Competitor activity is closely monitored 
with a view to maintaining clear 
differentiation based on Spirent’s 
products, services and global reach.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 RISK POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION ACTIONS
ACQUISITIONS
A key element of Spirent’s strategy is to develop 
new capabilities and technologies, sometimes 
through acquisition.
Integration of acquisitions can be a complex process 
and the results expected from acquisitions may not be 
achieved due to problems encountered in integration, 
changes in market conditions or sometimes 
deficiencies arising in the due diligence processes.
Underperformance by acquisitions will impact 
the Group’s results and may lead to impairment 
of goodwill and/or intangible assets.
Rigorous strategic and financial 
evaluations of all acquisition opportunities 
are carried out. Detailed financial and 
commercial due diligence is performed. 
The Board will only authorise transactions 
after all due diligence has been successfully 
completed and where the financial hurdles 
are within the agreed guidelines.
Integration plans and processes are 
carefully considered prior to acquisition.
The Board reviews post-acquisition 
performance.
BUSINESS CONTINUITY
Operational risks are present in the Group’s 
businesses, including the risk of failed internal and 
external processes and systems, human error and 
external events, such as a natural disaster. For 
example, a significant portion of our communications 
operations are located in California which has in the 
past experienced natural disasters, including 
earthquakes and wildfires.
Contract manufacturers are used for the manufacture 
of a substantial amount of Spirent’s products. Spirent’s 
major contract manufacturer is located in Thailand.
The incidence of cyber crime is on the rise. Spirent is 
dependent on its information technology systems for 
both internal and external communications as well as 
for its day-to-day operations.
A significant natural disaster could disrupt 
the Group’s ability to conduct business 
and adversely impact revenue and 
operating results.
Disruption, financial problems of contract 
manufacturers or limitations in their 
manufacturing capacity could limit supply  
and/or increase cost.
If a cyber attack were to be successful it could 
result in loss of data, confidential information 
and damage to Spirent’s intellectual property, 
causing major disruption to the business. 
There would also be a potential impact to 
Spirent’s image, especially as we raise our 
profile in the security market.
An important component of Spirent’s 
corporate governance is its risk 
management strategy. IT disaster recovery 
plans are in place for all core business 
systems and ensure that the wider 
operations are all fully covered.
Regular meetings are held with contract 
manufacturers and a regular on-site 
presence is maintained. In addition, the 
Group’s largest manufacturing subcontractor 
has multiple worldwide sites and 
comprehensive business continuity plans. 
During 2015 we improved our processes 
and procedures encompassing cyber 
security diagnostics and we implemented 
training and awareness campaigns. 
EMPLOYEE SKILLBASE
Spirent is its employees. Attracting and retaining 
highly qualified and skilled employees is essential 
in enabling the Group to deliver on its strategy and 
to the success of the business.
Intense competition is faced for personnel 
from other companies and organisations and 
the loss of key employees, the failure to attract 
and retain other highly skilled employees,  
or the failure to adequately plan for succession 
may impair Spirent’s ability to run and expand 
the business effectively.
Investing in people is at the core of  
the Group’s strategy. The aim is to find, 
keep and engage the highest calibre  
of employees and encourage their 
contribution and development. An 
environment that fosters innovation  
and collaboration is critical to Spirent’s 
success, as is ensuring incentive plans 
are competitive.
Succession planning for senior posts  
in the Company is regularly reviewed  
by the Board.
Appropriate career paths and internal 
recognition programmes are developed 
for both technical and non-technical staff. 
Regular reviews are performed to 
ensure that all elements of compensation 
across the Group are competitive with 
the market.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 providers as well as scale and performance 
demands for mobile networks, driving 
demand for innovative wireless infrastructure 
test solutions. Service providers and 
enterprises are spending on network security 
in response to high profile incidents. This has 
led to increased demand for security testing 
solutions in areas such as new 100G firewalls. 
The internet protocol network industry is in 
the midst of a revolutionary technology 
transformation, with virtualisation enabling 
technologies such as SDN and NFV becoming 
mainstream. This is driving new processes for 
developing and delivering the products and 
services customers demand. Processes and 
best practices around Agile development 
have spawned an increase in DevOps, the aim 
of which is to create tighter linkages between 
developers, operations and testers through 
the use of automation and communication.
REVENUE
Revenue was up 9 per cent to $241.9 
million (2014 $221.5 million) driven by 
growth in high speed Ethernet testing. 
High activity levels at the end of the period, 
particularly in the mobile infrastructure 
space, helped to increase order intake 
by 10 per cent to $249.8 million from 
$227.5 million in 2014. The increase in 
the order book of $7.9 million resulted in 
a book to bill ratio of 103 (2014 103). From 
a regional perspective, revenue grew 
strongly in North America and APAC, 
more than offsetting weakness in EMEA.
PROFITABILITY
Gross margin improved to 69.2 per cent 
(2014 68.3 per cent) due to the increased 
sales volume and a positive product mix. 
Operating profit before exceptional items 
increased significantly to $18.4 million, 
compared with $7.6 million in 2014, 
notwithstanding increased investment in 
product development of $1.0 million and  
in sales and marketing of $4.4 million. 
Exceptional items of $2.6 million were 
charged in 2015 (2014 $2.3 million).
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Spirent grew its leadership in high speed 
Ethernet, winning a major industry award 
for the industry’s first public interoperability 
demonstration of 400G Ethernet 
implementations, in conjunction with 
Huawei. In addition, we launched a 100G 
test solution supporting the latest optical 
transceivers, helping drive further 100G 
adoption with a small form factor and 
support of 25G lanes.
In the area of cellular and Wi-Fi convergence 
we expanded our market with a Wi-Fi radio 
frequency interface and voice over Wi-Fi 
(“VoWi-Fi”) capability on Spirent Landslide, 
enabling carriers to validate VoWi-Fi to VoLTE 
handovers. We increased our focus on the 
important issue of predicting and preventing 
signalling storm outages, caused by “always-
connected” applications and smartphones 
that disconnect to save battery life, with the 
release of a Diameter performance and scale 
testing solution for mobile operators.
A major software release of our Avalanche 
security performance test solutions, 
focused on ease-of-use of security test 
methodologies, now enables service 
providers and enterprises to validate 
their network perimeter devices’ 
security performance.
The release of our CLEAR DevOps 
Continuous Test solution for accelerating 
product development and delivery has 
been met with great enthusiasm, including 
recognition from CIO Review as one of the 
“20 Most Promising DevOps Companies 
of 2015”. 
STRATEGY
For 2016, we will continue to invest in test 
solutions for rapidly advancing Ethernet 
markets. In the enterprise campus market, 
higher Wi-Fi speeds are driving new 2.5G 
and 5G Ethernet standards. In the data center 
market, cloud providers are driving the need 
for 50G, 100G, 200G and 400G Ethernet 
and enterprise from 10G to 25G Ethernet. 
In the automotive market we also see a move 
to Ethernet as a single efficient and lighter 
weight infrastructure. Spirent’s support for 
these new Ethernet speeds began in the 
middle of 2015 and will continue into 2016.
Building on Spirent’s award-winning virtual 
test solutions we will further enhance our 
software solutions with features and test 
methodologies enabling service providers 
to successfully deploy NFV and enterprises 
to optimise their data centers and make 
them software-defined. In 2015 we 
supported successful tests for vendors 
and mobile operators of virtual evolved 
packet cores, which are being deployed to 
handle the increased number of machine-
to-machine connections. We expect 
network virtualisation rollouts to increase 
in 2016 with additional use cases such as 
virtual customer premises equipment, for 
which Spirent’s Performance and Security 
virtual test solutions are well positioned.
Further advances to our mobile and security 
infrastructure test solutions are also planned 
for 2016. The addition of Spirent Landslide 
EDGE and CORE to our mobile infrastructure 
test solution, which enables mobile operators 
to take a smarter approach to network 
performance management to minimise 
network outages, are the first example 
of our 2016 strategy in this area.
SAFEGUARDING 
THE NETWORK 
AGAINST OUTAGES 
WITH LANDSLIDE 
EDGE/CORE
Network congestion and overload is the 
second biggest reason for outages in 
the mobile network, especially given 
the explosive growth in the numbers 
of subscribers using connected devices, 
applications, and services. Spirent’s 
Landslide EDGE and CORE suite of 
solutions uses a proactive approach that 
gives operators performance visibility 
across their networks and detects 
degradations before they impact 
customers. The end result is faster time 
to market for new services and improved 
network performance for better 
customer service, which ultimately 
drives loyalty from existing customers.
“According to industry sources, mobile 
operators are spending around  
$15 billion a year globally dealing with 
all kinds of network degradation and 
outages, including those related to 
congestion and overload,” said John 
Baker, General Manager of Spirent 
Communications’ Mobility group. 
“By using Landslide CORE and EDGE, 
carriers can greatly improve the 
real-time visibility of the network 
control and data plane as well as 
validate the impact of each node 
in the network on individual services 
from a quality of experience 
perspective.”

MARKET CONDITIONS
Spirent targets a wireless test market focused 
on development and deployment of new 
mobile devices and services. The market has 
annual revenues close to $1.0 billion, but with 
low single-digit growth. Economic pressure 
and consolidation of top-tier global 
smartphone, chipset and network equipment 
vendors continued in 2015, resulting in a 
fiercely challenging, competitive market. 
Spirent benefited from the development 
phase of 4G LTE services, such as VoLTE, 
and voice over Wi-Fi (“VoWi-Fi”) and the 
focus on the user experience. 
Spirent also targets the market for test 
systems for GNSS with a focus on expert 
users in military, government and commercial 
applications. The market is in the region of 
$100 million with low single-digit growth, 
with peaks of incremental revenue driven 
by government spending or the introduction 
of new constellations. 2015 saw growing 
awareness of the vulnerabilities and potential 
threats to GNSS receivers, systems and

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 applications, creating opportunities for 
solutions that can detect, analyse and deal 
with these threats. 
The importance of wireless IoT connectivity 
continues to rise in a variety of segments 
from connected vehicles, homes and 
industry to smart cities. This results in 
challenges in developing, connecting 
and operating IoT devices and applications 
on mobile and non-cellular networks, 
resulting in an attractive new market 
opportunity for Spirent.
REVENUE
Revenue was down 6 per cent at 
$168.7 million (2014 $178.6 million). 
Demand for positioning products and 
service experience solutions was strong 
but this was more than offset by weakness 
in Wireless. Revenue from wireless device 
test products and service experience 
solutions has been affected by significant 
changes in the smartphone market and in 
particular a major customer in Asia did not 
repeat the high level of spend we saw in 
2014. Although we saw reduced spend at 
many wireless customers, our business 
with Asian technology and chipset providers 
grew, especially in the Greater China 
region. Positioning revenue benefited from 
US Government procurement of high-end 
tailored solutions. Service Experience 
opened a new Fit4Launch Lab in Beijing 
which helped to increase revenue from 
the China region. Book to bill ratio grew 
to 103 (2014 102).
PROFITABILITY
Gross margin was lower at 67.5 per cent 
(2014 68.0 per cent) due to product and 
services mix and the lower sales volume. 
Operating profit before exceptional items 
was lower at $15.5 million compared with 
$24.0 million in 2014 as a result of the 
lower sales volume and reduction in gross 
margin. Cost reduction actions resulted 
in an exceptional charge of $9.4 million 
in 2015 (2014 $0.9 million). The cost 
reduction actions were primarily focused 
on improving profitability in response to 
changes in the wireless device test and 
carrier acceptance market. The most 
significant action taken was to outsource 
engineering services in Wireless & Service 
Experience to provide a more cost 
effective and flexible resource in future.  
 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 
We continued to develop innovative 
solutions for testing connected devices 
that address challenges to accelerate time 
to market and reduce test time for new 
services and applications, like VoLTE 
and VoWi-Fi.
We invested in our Elevate Test 
Framework, designed to address the 
increasingly complex challenges and scale 
demands of wireless devices and services, 
expanded our 8100 carrier acceptance 
and conformance test portfolio, and 
launched our next-generation fader. 
The latter emulates the radio frequency 
channel between transmitter and receiver 
to test performance of the latest complex 
antenna and receiver designs. 
We expanded our leadership in user 
experience solutions for evaluating any 
internet protocol-based device or service 
by opening a new Fit4Launch Lab in Beijing 
and deploying user experience servers 
that link to live mobile networks across the 
Asia Pacific region.
In the Positioning business, we invested 
in solutions to detect and analyse 
vulnerabilities in GNSS. The robust PNT 
Test Framework enables threats to be 
detected in the field, taken into the lab and 
re-synthesised along with GPS and other 
GNSS signals. 
STRATEGY
Our strategy focuses on accelerating time 
to market and reducing cost to develop 
and launch new devices and services, 
while helping to ensure the highest service 
quality and user experience. 
We are investing in new products 
and services for the IoT to accelerate 
the development of connected devices, 
to test and qualify devices to ensure they 
can connect to the network and operate 
reliably, and to monitor, analyse and 
troubleshoot IoT networks and applications.
We are building leadership in testing 
user experience of converged services 
and devices that support them, including 
video, data and voice, from development 
to deployment, to issues that arise in 
operation. Spirent’s powerful analytic 
capabilities enable correlation of user 
experience metrics with IP-layer 
performance metrics to accelerate 
resolution of issues and improve the 
user experience. We are expanding our 
served markets by providing industry-
leading products for new challenges facing 
the positioning, navigation and timing 
industry. We have expanded into the 
GNSS vulnerabilities market to enable 
development of robust receivers, 
equipment, applications and systems 
and to detect interference or spoofing 
in operational environments. 
MOBILE USER 
EXPERIENCE 
CAPABILITIES 
EXTENDED TO 
ASIA PACIFIC
Spirent enables operators and their 
device supplier ecosystems to 
collaborate and improve the user 
experience of voice, data and video 
services. Spirent invested in a new 
Fit4Launch Lab in Beijing and in the 
deployment of user experience servers 
that link to live mobile networks across 
the Asia Pacific region.
Before launch, each new mobile device 
model is ranked relative to all previously 
released device models for metrics such 
as speech quality, call success and 
retention, web browsing speed, video 
quality and battery life, in both live 
network and lab-based evaluation. If a 
device ranks poorly, the manufacturer 
and Spirent work together to implement 
and evaluate improvements.
“Fit4Launch has helped multiple tier-1 
operators measurably improve the 
user experience of their devices and 
services,” said Des Owens, General 
Manager of Service Experience and 
Assurance at Spirent. “At one US 
operator, more than 15 major user 
experience issues were identified 
and fixed in just 12 months. At another 
operator, speech quality across all 
devices was improved by nearly  
10 per cent over a two year period.”

and opex costs and radically accelerate the 
time to launch new services, provision new 
subscribers, and troubleshoot problems.
Service provider spending remained 
cautious as the shift continued from legacy 
networks to virtualisation and how best to 
realise potential benefits. Continued growth 
in the complexity of networks and services, 
coupled with intense competition between 
service providers and the fear of customer 
churn, has led to greater emphasis on 
customer experience management and 
on the exploitation of big data analytics. 
We address three market segments: 
service assurance, customer experience

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Spirent targets the mobile service 
management, performance management 
and probe-based systems sub-segments, 
with an addressable market of 
approximately $340 million in 2015. The 
customer analytics and big data market 
had an estimated size of $3 billion in 2015. 
We sell analytics solutions primarily into the 
wireless market, with a focus on network 
engineering groups at top-tier operators 
in North America and EMEA. Spending 
is shifting towards solutions that predict 
and avoid network service issues, calls 
to customer care, or customer churn. 
We enjoy a market-leading position in 
mobile device management solutions for 
mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”). 
The MVNO market is expected to continue 
to grow rapidly, from 1,200 service providers 
in 2015 to 4,000 in 2020.
REVENUE
Revenue increased by $9.4 million to 
$66.5 million in 2015 from $57.1 million 
in 2014. The main reason for this increase 
was the full year contribution from our 
2014 acquisitions, Device Intelligence 
and Customer Experience Management 
(“CEM”). They added $6.9 million of 
revenue in 2015 compared to the post 
acquisition period in 2014. Our core 
Service Assurance business benefited 
from the fulfilment of the final phase of the 
major contract for hand-held test tools of 
$16.0 million.
PROFITABILITY
Gross margin was down slightly at 
75.8 per cent (2014 76.2 per cent) due 
to a different product mix. 
Operating profit before exceptional 
items was $14.0 million compared with 
$20.7 million in 2014. The decrease was 
due to the investments we are making 
in our 2014 acquisitions and in the core 
Service Assurance business to expand 
our served markets. Exceptional costs 
of $0.6 million and $0.2 million were 
charged in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
We invested in a broad portfolio to assure 
the whole service, covering the core, 
backhaul, home, mobility locations and 
devices from the physical to the service 
layers. Our service assurance system 
TestCenter Live, for assuring Ethernet 
services is used by service providers to 
turn-up and monitor Ethernet networks. In 
2015, we completed the development of our 
TestCenter Live virtual probe and 100G 
probe, which is in trials at leading operators.
We provide a customer and network 
analytic software system, InTouch, to 
telecom operators, enabling them to 
analyse the quality of their customers’ 
experience and identify network 
improvements. In 2015 we invested in a 
new flagship analytics solution, InTouch 
CNA, focused on customer experience 
assurance and troubleshooting with 
support for 2/3/4G technologies, including 
VoLTE and the Internet of Things (“IoT”). 
To address the challenges in assuring 
carrier Wi-Fi services, we acquired Epitiro, 
a pioneer and leader in the rapidly growing 
Wi-Fi experience monitoring market. 
This transaction builds on the success 
of a strategic partnership which led to 
multiple deployments, including at a  
tier-1 US service provider. 
STRATEGY
Our strategy focuses on radically reducing 
the time and cost to turn-up new services 
and to diagnose, troubleshoot and resolve 
issues with production networks and 
services. We cover the network topology 
and support legacy and new technologies 
and services. TestCenter Service Live and 
InTouch CNA are product lines that 
highlight our commitment to this strategy.
We enable our customers to radically reduce 
time to characterise network performance 
and to identify and resolve user experience 
problems through end-to-end visibility and 
real-time analytics. 
We will continue to develop new solutions 
that capitalise on the benefits that 
virtualisation enables. We will enhance 
the field portable test tools, reducing the 
need to dispatch technicians and enabling 
problems to be resolved more quickly 
and effectively. This improves customer 
satisfaction and retention while reducing 
the cost and complexity of operating and 
managing the network. We will provide 
systems to enable IoT devices and 
applications to connect to the network 
seamlessly, reducing the time and cost of 
pre-deployment qualification, and using 
analytics to manage the on-boarding and 
scaling of IoT devices and applications on 
the network.

REVENUE
Group revenue increased by 4 per cent to 
$477.1 million (2014 $457.2 million). Growth 
was driven by Networks & Applications, up  
9 per cent and by Service Assurance, up 
16 per cent. Wireless & Service Experience 
revenue declined by 6 per cent where 
weakness in wireless device test revenue 
more than offset growth in revenue from 
our Positioning products driven by US 
government spend. 
Order intake for the Group was 
3 per cent higher at $482.0 million 
(2014 $469.4 million) with a book to bill 
ratio of 101 (2014 103).
Geographically, the Americas are our 
largest market accounting for 56 per cent 
of Group revenue. Revenue grew by 9 
per cent in this region due to increased 
demand in Networks & Applications and 
US government orders in Positioning more 
than offsetting weakness in wireless 
device test. Asia Pacific was unchanged 
as a percentage of Group revenue but in 
dollar terms increased by 4 per cent 
compared to 2014. Highlights in the Asia 
Pacific region were China, where we 
experienced 16 per cent growth, driven 
predominantly by Wireless & Service 
Experience, and also India due to 
Networks & Applications, which together 
more than offset a reduction in spending 
by some of our major customers in Korea 
and Japan. EMEA represents 13 per cent 
of Group revenue, down from 15 per cent, 
as we continued to experience weakness 
in this region.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 COST OF SALES AND 
OPERATING EXPENSES
Gross margin increased to 69.5 per cent 
(2014 69.2 per cent) buoyed by the 
performance of Networks & Applications 
where gross margin was up one per cent. 
In Wireless & Service Experience and 
Service Assurance gross margin was down 
slightly due to volume and product mix. 
The investment in product development 
was maintained at $118.3 million (2014 
$115.4 million) and selling and distribution 
costs increased to $127.2 million (2014 
$113.5 million). Some of this can be attributed 
to the overheads of the 2014 acquisitions 
but we also made some additional 
investments in sales and marketing, 
specifically to support new product 
releases and expand our customer base.
It is planned to maintain the overall 
underlying rate of investment in product 
development and in sales and marketing 
in 2016.
Administration expenses were $44.2 million 
in 2015 compared with $41.4 million in 2014 
before charging the items added back for 
the purposes of the calculation of adjusted 
operating profit, being exceptional items, 
acquisition related costs, acquired 
intangible asset amortisation and 
impairment, goodwill impairment and 
share-based payment, amounting to 
$32.0 million in total (2014 $22.3 million).
Total reported administration expenses 
were $76.2 million compared with 
$63.7 million after charging these items.
OPERATING PROFIT
Reported operating profit was $10.1 million 
compared with $23.7 million in 2014. 
Adjusted operating profit, which is 
the measure of profit the Group uses to 
evaluate performance, decreased by 
8 per cent to $42.1 million compared 
with $46.0 million in 2014, primarily as 
a result of the planned increase in sales

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND 
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
As a result of the changes in the wireless 
device test and carrier acceptance market, 
which impacted revenues in 2015 and we 
expect to further impact revenue in 2016, 
targeted cost reduction actions were taken 
in the fourth quarter. The most significant 
action taken was to outsource engineering 
services in Wireless & Service Experience 
to provide a more cost effective and 
flexible resource for the future. The full 
cost of these actions of $13.1 million, net 
of the release of $0.6 million of the 2014 
exceptional restructuring provision, has 
been taken as an exceptional item of 
$12.5 million in the year. We expect them 
to deliver annualised cost savings in the 
order of $25.0 million from 2016, which are 
being utilised to invest in growth areas.
Also in 2015 a goodwill impairment charge 
of $3.8 million was incurred in respect 
of the Device Intelligence business as a 
result of a change in our expectations 
for market expansion with tier-2 mobile 
network operators.
CORPORATE COSTS
Corporate costs are those expenses 
which cannot be attributed to the Group’s 
operating segments and comprise the 
costs of the Board and other corporate 
activities. These costs were $5.8 million 
(2014 $6.3 million) before an exceptional 
credit of $0.1 million (2014 $0.7 million 
exceptional cost) for the year. 
CURRENCY IMPACT
The effect of fluctuating exchange rates is 
relatively minimal as the Group’s revenue 
and profits are primarily denominated in 
US dollars or US dollar-linked currencies.
FINANCE INCOME AND COSTS
Finance income for 2015 was unchanged 
compared to 2014 at $0.4 million. Surplus 
funds are held principally in the United 
Kingdom and United States and earn market 
rates of interest which remain minimal. 
Finance costs of $0.5 million in 2015 
comprised the interest cost on the defined 
benefit pension plan (2014 nil). 
SHARE OF LOSS OF ASSOCIATE
During the year, Spirent acquired 28 per 
cent of the share capital of Jolata, Inc. 
(“Jolata”) (see below). The 2015 consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s 
share of the total comprehensive income of 
Jolata from the date of acquisition. Spirent’s 
share of post-acquisition results of Jolata 
amounted to a loss of $0.4 million (2014 nil).
TAX
Taxable profits for the Group principally 
arise in the United States. The tax charge 
for the Group in 2015 was a credit of 
$3.9 million (2014 $3.5 million charge), 
representing a current year effective tax 
rate of 25.0 per cent (2014 22.0 per cent) 
of pre-tax profit, excluding a prior year tax 
credit of $6.3 million (2014 $1.8 million). 
At 31 December 2015 deferred tax assets 
amounting to $25.6 million (31 December 
2014 $20.5 million) have been recognised 
on the balance sheet. At 31 December 
2015 there are deferred tax assets 
amounting to a tax value of $22.0 million 
(31 December 2014 $17.1 million) which 
remain unrecognised.
For 2016 it is expected that the effective 
tax rate will continue to be in the region 
of 25.0 per cent.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The key objective of the Group’s treasury 
department is to manage the financial risks 
of the business and to ensure that 
sufficient liquidity is available to the Group. 
All treasury activity operates within a 
formal control framework. The Board has 
approved treasury policies and guidelines 
and periodically reviews treasury activities. 
Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that 
speculative treasury transactions are 
expressly forbidden.
Spirent’s financial risk management 
objectives and policies and its exposure 
to risks are discussed in note 27 of Notes 
to the consolidated financial statements.
ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT 
IN ASSOCIATE
On 7 October 2015 Spirent made a 
$5.0 million investment to take a 28 per cent 
stake in Jolata, Inc., a pre-revenue company 
based in San Jose, California, which aims to 
develop a market leadership position in 
network visibility for latency management. 
The Group has significant influence, but 
not control, over the financial and operating 
policies and therefore the investment 
in Jolata will be equity accounted and 
reflected as an investment in associate 
in Spirent’s financial statements.
On 16 November 2015 Spirent acquired 
Epitiro Group Limited (“Epitiro”) for an initial 
cash consideration of $1.7 million. Deferred 
consideration of up to $0.3 million is 
payable one year after acquisition based 
on the achievement of certain orders targets 
and product development milestones. 
The product development milestones 
were achieved in December 2015 and 
Spirent paid $0.1 million of the deferred 
consideration in January 2016. Epitiro, 
based in Cardiff, is a pioneer and leader 
in the rapidly growing Wi-Fi experience 
monitoring market and the acquisition builds 
on the success of an existing strategic 
partnership. This acquisition is reported 
within Service Assurance.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 FINANCING AND CASH FLOW
The Group is cash generative, and this gives Spirent the financial flexibility to invest in organic growth, pursue strategic acquisitions 
and pay sustainable dividends to shareholders. 
Cash and cash equivalents were $102.0 million at 31 December 2015 compared with $99.8 million at 31 December 2014 with no debt. 
Cash and cash equivalents are held as cash on demand or in short term bank deposits and 60 per cent of the balance at 31 December 
2015 was denominated in US dollars. 
Cash generated from operating activities was higher in 2015 at $57.8 million (2014 $48.9 million) as we benefited from the unwind of the 
working capital increase we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2014. This resulted in a net decrease in working capital of $2.1 million 
for the full year (2014 increase of $6.7 million). Free cash flow conversion represents 2.7 times (2014 0.5 times) reported earnings. 
Free cash flow is set out below:
$ million 2015 2014
Cash flow from operations 57.8 48.9
Tax received/(paid) 2.6 (7.2)
CASH INFLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 60.4 41.7
Interest received 0.4 0.6
Net capital expenditure (25.5) (31.6)
FREE CASH FLOW 35.3 10.7
Cash generated from operations includes 
a cash outflow of $1.8 million for the 
implementation of the exceptional cost 
reduction actions taken in 2015. The total 
cash cost of these actions is $8.8 million 
with the balance to be paid in 2016. 
Net capital expenditure was lower by 
$6.1 million than in 2014 which included the 
move to new improved leasehold facilities 
in the United States on the expiry of the 
previous lease terms. For 2016 capital 
expenditure is expected to be in the region 
of $20 million.
In 2015 the final dividend for 2014 and 
an interim dividend for 2015 totalling 
$23.5 million (2014 $22.2 million) were 
paid. There were no share repurchases 
during 2015 (2014 $16.4 million outflow). 
Cash consideration for acquisitions and 
investment in associate amounted to 
$6.7 million (2014 $85.9 million).
DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS
The Group operates two funded defined 
benefit pension plans which are in the 
United Kingdom. Both of these schemes 
were closed to new entrants some time 
ago and the principal plan now has fewer 
than ten active members.
The accounting valuation of these plans 
at the end of 2015 showed a net deficit of 
$19.1 million compared with a net deficit 
of $13.7 million at 31 December 2014. The 
higher deficit was principally due to a 
decline in the fair value of plan assets as a 
result of market conditions. The accounting 
valuation is based on the preliminary 
results of the actuarial valuation dated 
1 April 2015 which will be finalised in 2016.
The Group has also reported a liability 
of $0.7 million (31 December 2014 
$0.8 million) in respect of United 
Kingdom unfunded plan liabilities.
CAPITAL STRUCTURE 
Spirent’s policy on capital structure is to 
maintain a strong balance sheet to support 
operational flexibility and fund investment 
for long term growth. 
No share buybacks were transacted in 
2015. In 2014 the Company repurchased 
9.7 million shares at a cost of $15.6 million. 
All shares repurchased in 2014 were 
cancelled. No further buybacks are 
currently planned.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending the payment 
of a final dividend for 2015 of 2.21 cents 
(1.59 pence) per share which, together 
with the interim dividend of 1.68 cents 
(1.08 pence) per share paid in September 
2015, brings the full year dividend to 
3.89 cents (2.67 pence) per share. The 
dividend is covered 1.3 times by adjusted 
earnings. This maintains the full year 
dividend for 2015 at the same level as 
2014 which was also 3.89 cents per share.
Subject to approval by the shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting, the final 
dividend will be paid on 6 May 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 4 March 
2016. Payment to ADR holders will be 
made on 16 May 2016.
CHANGE IN OPERATING SEGMENTS 
There will be a change in operating 
segments effective 1 January 2016. 
See note 4 to Notes to the consolidated 
financial statements for an explanation of 
the change.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Corporate responsibility
PRINCIPLES AND THEMES
The way we behave when we do business 
is central to our long term success. 
Conducting our business responsibly 
enables us to meet our obligations to our 
stakeholders and delivers real business 
benefits, creating long term value for 
shareholders by:
• protecting our reputation and ability 
to grow;
• helping us to win business from 
customers who value strong 
Environmental, Social and 
Governance (“ESG”) performance;
• enhancing our efficiency;
• enabling our people to work 
productively in a safe and ethical 
environment;
• helping us to attract and retain talent, 
and encouraging employees to take 
pride in working for us; and
• reducing the risk of incidents 
and their associated costs.
SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT 
AND POLICY
Our sustainability management is 
governed by an overarching sustainability 
policy. The policy can be found at 
http://corporate.spirent.com.
The policy commits all Group business 
units to compliance with high standards 
of ethics and business integrity, 
environmental management and employee 
and community welfare.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible 
for the sustainability policy and the Board 
has appointed external advisers to support 
the design and implementation of 
improvement programmes.
PROMOTING A CULTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY
FOCUSING ON KEY ISSUES: STRATEGY 
AND MATERIALITY ANALYSIS
Our sustainability strategy is focused 
on the material ESG issues for the Group. 
These issues have been identified through 
a materiality assessment based on the 
AccountAbility AA 1000 5-part materiality 
methodology. This analysis is reviewed 
biannually.
SUSTAINABILITY: OUR PROGRESS IN 2015
In 2015 we launched FuturePositive, our 
sustainability improvement programme. 
The objectives are to embed sustainability 
management across our organisation and 
to create value by supporting customers 
to address their sustainability challenges.
Building on the improvements in energy 
and carbon management in 2014, the 
FuturePositive launch has introduced new 
sustainable product design standards, 
supply chain sustainability audits and 
enhanced stakeholder communication 
and transparency.
Further details can be found in our 2015 
ESG report, which is available to download 
at http://corporate.spirent.com.
Environmental
Our industry faces a wide range of 
environmental challenges including climate 
change, the use of hazardous materials, and 
increasing environmental legislation. Our 
programme of environmental management 
in 2015 included audits of environmental 
performance and management at our new 
sites in Frederick, MD and Calabasas, CA, 
a pilot of energy monitoring software at 
our Low Carbon Centre of Excellence in 
Paignton, UK, and environmental audits 
of the Group’s main contract manufacturer.
ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 
AND POLICY
The Group Environmental Policy commits 
the Group to prevention and control 
of pollution, minimising environmental 
impacts, eco-efficiency, and adoption 
of responsible environmental practices.
The Group is also committed to compliance 
with all applicable environmental 
regulations in each of the jurisdictions 
in which it operates. To meet these 
objectives, the Group endeavours to 
continuously improve environmental 
performance and to make robust 
environmental management integral to its 
overall strategy. External consultants are 
periodically used to assist in this area.
COMPLIANCE
The Group’s business units comply with the 
EU’s Waste Electrical and Electronic 
Equipment Regulations 2013 and Batteries 
Directive and the California Electronic 
Waste Recycling Programme. 
Although Spirent Communications’ 
hardware products are classified as 
Category Nine (Monitor and Control 
Equipment) and are out of scope with 
the RoHS Directive until June 2017, new 
products are designed to meet the EU’s 
Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
Directive (“RoHS”). Measures are in place to 
ensure the Group’s hardware products will 
be in compliance with the RoHS Directive at 
such time as they are brought into scope.
The Group is not directly required to comply 
with or report under Section 1502 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act, the US Conflict Minerals 
Law. However, it has robust procedures in 
place to ensure that it would be in 
36
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 compliance if it were brought in within the 
scope of this legislation. The Group will be 
subject to the EU Directive on Conflict 
Minerals when it is enacted in national 
legislation in the UK and other European 
countries. We are monitoring the 
development of compliance requirements 
and are confident our existing practices will 
meet the standards required.
The Group is not required to comply with 
the UK Energy Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (“ESOS”) Regulations 2014.
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Carbon emissions are a material 
sustainability issue for the Group and we 
remain committed to reporting emissions 
and taking action to combat climate 
change. The Group once again responded 
to the Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”) in 
2015, completing both the Climate Change 
and Supply Chain questionnaires for the 
calendar year 2014.
Improved sustainability reporting has been 
a key theme this year, and we increased 
our CDP performance band to a C and 
have improved our disclosure score to 95, 
having achieved year-on-year improvement 
since 2013 as shown in the table on 
page 38.
PERFORMANCE AGAINST TARGET
The Group set a target to reduce carbon 
emissions in absolute terms, as well as 
in relation to revenue and internal area. 
We have not achieved these targets. 
Energy use and absolute emissions have 
increased by 3.9 per cent and 3.4 per cent 
respectively, whilst carbon emissions per 
$m of revenues decreased by one per 
cent. Fifteen of our 46 sites have however 
achieved absolute reductions in GHG 
emissions of 5 per cent or more.
There are two principal reasons for these 
increases: improved data availability, which 
allowed us to use actual rather than 
estimated energy use for a number of our 
sites, including our engineering facility in 
Frederick, USA, with 2015 emissions 
materially higher than estimates; and 
business growth and expansion in research 
and development, which also increased 
energy usage.
METHODOLOGY
Reporting on emission sources is 
required under the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) 
Regulations 2013 and these sources fall 
within our consolidated financial statements. 
We are not responsible for any emission 
sources that are not included in our 
consolidated financial statements. We report 
under the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised 
Edition), with data gathered under these 
Regulations and emission factors under the 
UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors 
for Company Reporting 2015.
Greenhouse gas emissions for both 2014 
and 2015 have been assured using the AA 
1000 AS (2008) standard. The assurance 
statement can be found in our 2015 ESG 
report at http://corporate.spirent.com.
2015 CASE STUDY
Product
A core objective for 2015 was to determine 
how best to measure product sustainability 
performance and how to formally embed 
sustainability considerations into 
product development.
A pilot project was run in our Positioning 
business unit in the UK to develop 
standardised protocols to measure the 
sustainability performance of products and 
to incorporate sustainability criteria into the 
product development Gateway Process.
Protocols have been defined to measure 
key product metrics of energy use, noise, 
size, and weight and the performance. 
Significant improvements have been 
identified in the new GSS9000 product, 
especially when a large number of 
channels are under test.
SOCIAL
HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Board has designated the Chief 
Financial Officer as responsible for 
health and safety performance within the 
Group and procedures are in place for 
incidents to be reported through the Audit 
Committee to the Board as necessary.
The health and safety risk profile for the 
Group remained low during 2015, with very 
low accident rates and no incidents which 
required hospitalisation.
GSS9000: SUSTAINABILITY IN PRODUCT DESIGN
Spirent supply a market-leading range of Global Navigation Satellite System 
(“GNSS”) simulators for R&D, integration, verification and product testing. The 
reliance on a growing number of GNSS constellations for both generic navigation 
requirements and Location Based Service applications has meant that designers, 
manufacturers and systems integrators need increasingly comprehensive and 
sophisticated testing systems.
Spirent launched the GSS9000 to meet these significant increases in testing 
complexity and incorporated key product sustainability improvements to reduce 
material and energy use across the product’s lifespan.
The more capable GSS9000 is 69 per cent lighter, 74 per cent smaller and has 
a 54 per cent reduction in maximum power demand than the comparable 
GSS8000 system specification.

DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY
The Group employs a diverse workforce 
and prides itself in providing equal 
opportunities for all. High value is placed on 
rewarding our people for their commitment, 
their integrity and their service. We aim to 
ensure that no employee is discriminated 
against, directly or indirectly, on the grounds 
of colour, race, ethnic and national origins, 
sexual orientation or gender, marital status, 
disability, religion or belief, being part time 
or on the grounds of age.
The Board supports the aims, objectives 
and recommendations outlined in Lord 
Davies’ report “Women on Boards” and 
it continues to be the Board’s policy to 
make new appointments based on merit, 
recognising that gender remains an 
important aspect of the overall diversity 
which is crucial to creating an optimal 
board in terms of balance and composition. 
TRAINING
The Group provides a wide variety of 
learning and training opportunities, 
ranging from workshops and mentoring to 
online resources and internal and external 
training courses. Personal development 
planning and identification of training and 
development needs form a key part of our 
annual performance review process.
ENGAGEMENT
The Group conducted an all employee 
survey in 2014 and benchmarked results 
against global norms for our industry sector. 
One of the action points that arose from the 
2014 survey was a desire to improve 
information sharing and collaboration across 
the Group. To build on the existing 
communication tools available, a new 
intranet platform, InsideSpirent has been 
developed and has received extremely 
positive feedback from employees.
DISABILITY
Disabled persons, whether registered 
or not, are accorded equal opportunities 
when applying for vacancies, with due 
regard to their aptitudes and abilities. 
In addition to complying with legislative 
requirements, we are committed to 
ensuring that disabled employees are fairly 
treated in respect of training and career 
development and promotion. With regard 
to employees who become disabled during 
the course of their employment, the Group 
is supportive and will take all reasonable 
steps to ensure that they can remain in 
employment wherever practicable.

CHARITABLE GIVING 
AND VOLUNTEERING
Spirent encourages employees to 
participate in charitable programmes within 
their communities, supporting their efforts 
financially in some cases, but also in North 
America and Europe through a Voluntary 
Time Off policy, which allows employees 
to donate up to two working days each 
year to a charitable organisation close 
to their hearts.
Making a commitment to our local 
communities takes many forms at Spirent, 
from running in the Beijing Marathon 
to cycling in the American Diabetes 
Association’s Tour de Cure in Hawaii. 
Our New Jersey employees continue their 
commitment to help with the rebuilding

GOVERNANCE
ETHICS
The Group’s core values and principles and 
the standards of behaviour to which every 
employee across the Group is expected to 
work, are set out in the Group’s Ethics Policy, 
which has been approved by the Board and 
is available on our website at http://corporate.
spirent.com. These values and principles are 
applied to all dealings with our customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders.
The Group has a zero tolerance approach 
to all forms of bribery and corruption. As a 
UK company, Spirent Communications plc 
is bound by the laws of the UK, including 
the Bribery Act 2010, in respect of our 
conduct both at home and abroad. In 
addition, we will uphold all laws relevant 
to countering bribery and corruption in 
all jurisdictions in which we operate.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Spirent seeks to uphold all internationally 
recognised human rights wherever its 
operations are located. Within this 
framework, we comply with the requirements 
of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the 
California Transparency in Supply Chains 
Act 2010. We require slavery and human 
trafficking to be eradicated from our direct 
supply chain for the products we sell.
DATA PROTECTION
Spirent takes data security and privacy 
seriously and we continually review the 
security of our data systems and procedures 
in order that we can react to areas of 
heightened risk promptly and effectively.

Ian’s place as the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee. Jonathan brings over 25 years 
of experience as the Chief Financial Officer 
of Laird plc, together with valuable 
experience as a non-executive director. 
We announced in November that Rachel 
Whiting, our Chief Financial Officer had 
decided to retire and would step down 
from the Board at this year’s AGM. Rachel 
has been with the Group for 30 years and 
in that time has served in a number of 
senior roles. On behalf of the Board I would 
like to express our gratitude for all her hard 
work and her contribution to the Board and 
to the success of the Group. The search for 
Rachel’s replacement is underway and we 
will make an announcement in due course 
about the identity of her successor.
EXTERNAL EVALUATION OF 
BOARD PERFORMANCE
This annual evaluation is an important 
means of ensuring that the executive and 
non-executive directors are working 
closely and effectively together. This year 
we have undertaken an external review 
which has provided insight into our 
priorities for 2016. In particular, we will 
continue to focus on effectively selecting 
the investment opportunities which we 
believe are most likely to deliver the 
maximum returns for our shareholders.
RISK APPETITE
It is a stated aim of the Group to seek to 
acquire new technologies in our core and 
adjacent markets. Whilst looking for the 
best opportunities for the Group, the Board 
has always been conscious of the longer 
term risks that any significant acquisition or 
partnership may bring. The new Corporate 
Governance Code requirement to 
make a statement regarding the longer 
term viability of the Group has been 
the catalyst for the Board to more fully 
articulate our risk appetite with the 
executive team. This has helped 
to progress the framework within which 
we consider future investment decisions.
I look forward to meeting shareholders 
who are able to attend our AGM in May.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE UK 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE
As a premium listed company on the 
London Stock Exchange, the Company 
is reporting in accordance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
published in September 2014 which sets 
out standards of good practice in relation 
to board leadership and effectiveness, 
remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders. The Code is published 
by the UK Financial Reporting Council 
(“FRC”) and a copy of the Code is available 
from the FRC website at www.frc.org.uk.
The Board confirms that the Company has 
complied in full with the Code throughout 
the period under review.
LEADERSHIP
THE BOARD
The Board of Directors is collectively 
responsible to the Company’s shareholders 
for the direction and oversight of the 
Company to ensure its long-term success.
The Board met regularly throughout the 
year to approve the Group’s strategic 
objectives, to lead the Group within a 
framework of effective controls which 
enable risk to be assessed and managed 
and to ensure that sufficient resources 
are available to meet the objectives set.
There are a number of matters which 
are specifically reserved for the Board’s 
approval. These are set out in a clearly 
defined schedule which includes: matters 
relating to the Group’s strategic plan; 
approving the annual business strategy 
and objectives; the nature and extent of 
principal risks to be taken to achieve the 
strategic objectives; changes relating to 
structure and capital; approval of trading 
statements, half-year results, final results  
and annual report and accounts; declaring 
interim dividends and recommending 
final dividends; the Group’s policies 
and systems of internal control and risk 
management, approving capital projects, 
acquisitions and disposals valued at over 
$2 million; and provision of adequate 
succession planning. 
The schedule of matters reserved for the 
Board was reviewed during the year and 
approved and adopted at the February 
2015 Board meeting.
Certain specific responsibilities are 
delegated to the committees of the  
Board, notably the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, which operate 
within clearly defined terms of reference 
and report regularly to the Board. For 
further details, please see the reports of 
each Committee that follow this statement.
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF  
EXECUTIVE OFFICER
The roles of the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive Officer are separately held  
and the division of their responsibilities  
is clearly established, set out in writing,  
and agreed by the Board to ensure that  
no one has unfettered powers of decision. 
The Chairman, Alex Walker, is responsible 
for the operation and leadership of the 
Board, ensuring its effectiveness and 
setting its agenda. The Chief Executive 
Officer, Eric Hutchinson, is responsible  
for leading and managing the Group’s 
business within a set of authorities 
delegated by the Board and the 
implementation of Board strategy  
and policy.
Authority for the operational management 
of the Group’s business has been 
delegated to the Chief Executive Officer 
for execution or further delegation by him 
for the effective day-to-day running and 
management of the Group. The Executive 
Vice President of each business division 
within the Group has authority for that 
business and reports directly to the Chief 
Executive Officer.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Following the retirement of Ian Brindle  
on 7 August 2015, Sue Swenson is now the 
Company’s recognised Senior Independent 
Director. The role of Senior Independent 
Director is to act as a sounding board  
for the Chairman and to serve as an 
intermediary for other directors as 
necessary. She is also available to 
shareholders should a need arise to 
convey concerns to the Board which  
they have been unable to convey through 
the Chairman or through the executive 
directors. During the year, led by the Senior 
Independent Director, the non-executive 
directors have met without the presence  
of the Chairman (including to appraise the 
Chairman’s performance).
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
In addition to their responsibilities for 
strategy and business results, the non-
executive directors play a key role in 
providing a solid foundation for good 
corporate governance and ensure that no 
individual or group dominates the Board’s 
decision-making. They each occupy, or 
have occupied, senior positions in industry, 
bringing valuable external perspective to 
the Board’s deliberations through their 
experience and insight from other sectors 
enabling them to contribute significantly 
to Board decision-making. The formal 
letters of appointment of non-executive 
directors are available for inspection 
at the Company’s registered office.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established three principal 
Board committees, to which it has delegated 
certain of its responsibilities. These are the 
Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee 
and the Remuneration Committee. The 
membership, responsibilities and activities 
of these committees are described later 
in this corporate governance statement and, 
in the case of the Remuneration Committee, 
in the Report on directors’ remuneration 
beginning on page 55. Membership of 
these committees is reviewed annually and 
minutes of committee meetings are made 
available to all directors on a timely basis.
The chairmen of the Audit, Nomination  
and Remuneration Committees intend to 
be present at the Annual General Meeting 
to answer questions on the work of their 
respective committees.
The written terms of reference for the 
Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees, all of which were reviewed 
and updated during the year, are  
available on the Company’s website 
at http://corporate.spirent.com.
DIRECTORS’ INDEMNITY PROVISIONS
In accordance with its Articles of Association, 
the Company has granted a qualifying third 
party indemnity, to the extent permitted 
by law, to each director. The Company 
also maintains directors’ and officers’ 
liability insurance.
These provisions are qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions as defined in section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006. Neither 
the Company’s indemnity nor the insurance 
provides cover in the event that a director 
is proven to have acted dishonestly  
or fraudulently.
BOARD ACTIVITIES DURING 2015
At each Board meeting, the Chief Executive 
Officer presents an update on the 
performance, strategy and business issues 
across the Group and the Chief Financial 
Officer presents a detailed analysis of the 
financial performance of the business units. 
Senior executives below Board level attend 
relevant parts of Board meetings in order 
to make presentations on their areas of 
responsibility; this gives the Board access 
to a broader group of executives and helps 
the directors make ongoing assessments 
of the Group’s succession plans. The Board 
has a rolling programme of visits to 
business unit locations to deepen its 
appreciation of the different opportunities 
and challenges that each unit faces.
ELECTION AND RE-ELECTION OF 
DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Code’s 
recommendations, all directors will be 
proposed for election or re-election at the 
2016 Annual General Meeting to be held in 
May with the exception of Rachel Whiting 
who, as previously announced, will be 
stepping down from the Board prior to 
the meeting. 
COMPANY SECRETARY
Angus Iveson joined Spirent as Company 
Secretary & General Counsel in October 
2014. The Company Secretary is 
responsible for advising and supporting 
the Chairman and the Board on corporate 
governance matters as well as ensuring 
that there is a smooth flow of information 
to enable effective decision making. 
All directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary 
and can take independent professional 
advice in respect of their duties, at the 
Company’s expense.
BOARD MEETINGS
The Board held a total of seven meetings 
during the year, including a two-day 
strategy meeting held at the Company’s 
premises in Frederick, MD.
Senior executives below Board level  
are invited, when appropriate, to attend 
Board meetings and to make presentations 
on the results and strategies of their 
business units. Papers for Board and 
Committee meetings are generally 
provided to directors a week in advance  
of the meeting.
The attendance of the directors at Board 
and Committee meetings during the year 
under review is shown in the table below. 
Where a director is unable to participate 
in a meeting either in person or remotely, 
the Chairman solicited their views on 
key terms of business in advance of the 
relevant meeting, so that that these 
could be shared with the meeting and 
contribute to the debate.

The Chairman holds regular discussions 
with the non-executive directors without 
the executive directors present to ensure  
a free and frank exchange of views on the 
effectiveness of the executive directors 
and senior management.
INDEPENDENCE
The independence of each non-executive 
director is reviewed on appointment and 
at least annually. The Board determined 
that the current non-executive directors 
are each independent in character and 
judgement, save for the Chairman who was 
deemed independent by the Board at the 
date of his appointment. None have been 
employed by the Company previously in 
any capacity or have any material business 
relationship with any Group company.

BOARD COMPOSITION
At the date of this Report, the Board 
comprises a non-executive Chairman, five 
independent non-executive directors and 
two executive directors.
The Chairman and the non-executive 
directors contribute entrepreneurial 
leadership and external expertise and 
experience in areas of importance to the 
Company, such as strategic investments, 
corporate finance, general finance  
and corporate governance. They also 
contribute independent challenge and 
rigour to the Board’s deliberations and 
assist in the development of the 
Company’s strategy, scrutiny of the 
performance of management in meeting 
agreed goals and targets, and satisfying 
themselves of the integrity of the 
Company’s internal controls and risk 
management systems. The Board believes

than their fees (detailed in the Report on 
directors’ remuneration on page 58) and

that they do not represent any significant 
shareholder in the Company. No individual

requirement stating that at least half of  
the Board (excluding the Chairman) should 
comprise independent non-executive 
directors is satisfied.

operations and activities of the Group, the 
role of the Board and the matters reserved 
to its decision, the Group’s corporate 
governance practices and procedures and 
their duties, responsibilities and obligations 
as directors of a listed public limited 
company. This is supplemented by visits 
to key locations and meetings with and 
presentations by senior executives.
BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
An evaluation to assess the performance 
of the Board as a whole, its committees 
and that of the individual directors is 
conducted annually.
In accordance with the Code requirement 
that the evaluation should be conducted 
by an external facilitator at least every 
three years, Useful Thinking Limited 
(“UTL”) was engaged to undertake a 
review of the Board and its Committees. 
UTL is independent, with no other 
connection with the Company. The 
review took place in the final quarter 
of the year. 
PROCESS 
Following a scoping exercise with the 
Chairman and the Company Secretary  
to agree the priority areas and issues to  
be addressed in the review, the directors 
completed an online questionnaire 
compiled by UTL, centring on themes 
including the strengths and values of the 
Board, the quality of succession planning, 
the interaction of the Board members 
with the Group’s various business units, 
the process of management strategic 
planning and the management of risk.
During the year, the implementation of  
a number of recommended action points 
arising from the 2014 evaluation was 
overseen by the Chairman and included 
the following actions:
2015 ACTIONS
• Further developed understanding of 
strategic positioning and competitive 
issues facing the Group in view of 
ongoing changes in our market sectors;
• Gain further insight into performance 
metrics on acquisitions and organic 
investments;
• Focus on strengthening the Board with 
non-executive directors with specific 
industry sector and relevant geographic 
business knowledge; and
• Increased visibility on depth of 
management bench strength below 
Board level given changes to the 
management team in 2014.
Based on the outcome of the 2015 review, 
it was concluded that the Board continues 
to work very effectively as a cohesive 
body with a good balance of support, 
challenge and mutual trust between the 
executive and non-executive directors.
It was also the Board’s view that, overall, 
the principal committees continued to 
function efficiently and effectively. Each 
of the directors was considered to be 
making a valuable contribution and with 
proper commitment, including of time, 
to their respective roles.
A list of action points arising from the  
2015 review on how the Board can 
become even more effective was offered 
by UTL and subsequently agreed by the 
Board. These agreed action points in the 
form of a Board development plan are 
being implemented under the direction 
of the Chairman and include the 
following actions:
2016 OBJECTIVES
• Prioritisation of resources on market 
segments which provide greatest 
growth opportunities;
• Provision of increased visibility on the 
progress of the most significant product 
development & acquisition investments;
• Focus on Board succession in light 
of Non-executive director and 
Chairman tenure; and
• Further assess senior leadership 
bench strength.
Further training for directors is available 
as required and can be provided by means 
of external courses, internal computer-
based training, briefings from specific 
consultants or in-house presentations. In 
addition, directors’ knowledge of the legal 
and regulatory environment is updated 
through the provision of information by the 
Group’s advisers and by means of regular 
updates from the Company Secretary.
New directors are encouraged to take 
advantage of opportunities to meet  
with major shareholders and attend 
presentations to analysts where possible.
INFORMATION FLOW
The Company Secretary & General 
Counsel manages the provision of 
information to the Board at appropriate 
times in consultation with the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer. In addition to 
formal meetings, the Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer maintain regular contact 
with all directors. The Chairman also holds 
informal meetings with non-executive 
directors, without any of the executives 
being present, to discuss any issues 
affecting the Group, if this is thought 
necessary. Regular management updates 
are sent to directors to keep the non-
executive directors informed of events 
throughout the Group between Board 
meetings and to ensure that they are 
kept fully advised of the latest issues 
affecting the Group.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST PROCEDURES
The Company has procedures in place, 
which were reviewed and updated during 
the year, to deal with the situation where  
a director has a conflict of interest. As part 
of this process, the Board:
• considers each potential conflict situation 
separately on its particular facts;
• considers the potential conflict situation 
in conjunction with the rest of the 
individual directors’ duties under the 
Companies Act 2006;
Directors’ statement on corporate governance continued
46
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 assets. The directors recognise that they 
are responsible for providing a return to 
shareholders, which is consistent with the 
responsible assessment and mitigation  
of risks.
Effective controls ensure that the Group’s 
exposure to avoidable risk is minimised, 
that adequate accounting records are 
maintained, that the financial information 
used within the business is reliable and 
that the consolidated accounts preparation 
and financial reporting processes comply 
with all relevant regulatory reporting 
requirements. The dynamics of the Group 
and the environment within which it 
operates are continually evolving, together 
with its exposure to risk. Internal controls 
can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The directors confirm that there is an 
ongoing, robust process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Group and the operational 
effectiveness of the related controls, which 
has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the 
annual report and accounts. They also 
confirm that they have regularly reviewed 
the system of risk management and 
internal controls utilising the review 
process set out below.
The directors confirm that a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing the 
Company has been carried out, including 
those risks that would threaten its business 
model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. More details are set out in the 
Group’s Principal risks and uncertainties 
on pages 22 to 25 of this Annual Report.
STANDARDS
There are guidelines on the minimum 
Group-wide requirements for health  
and safety and environmental standards. 
There are also guidelines on the minimum 
level of internal control that each of the 
divisions should exercise over specified 
processes. Each business has developed 
and documented policies and procedures 
to comply with the minimum control 
standards established, including procedures 
for monitoring compliance and taking 
corrective action. The management of 
each business is required to confirm twice 
yearly that it has complied with these 
policies and procedures.
HIGH LEVEL CONTROLS
All businesses prepare annual operating 
plans and budgets which are updated 
regularly. Performance against budget  
is monitored at operational level and 
centrally, with variances being reported 
promptly. The cash position at Group and 
operational level is monitored constantly 
and variances from expected levels are 
investigated thoroughly.
Clearly defined guidelines have been 
established for capital expenditure and 
investment decisions. These include the 
preparation of budgets, appraisal and 
review procedures, and delegated 
authority levels.
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Detailed management accounts are 
prepared every month, consolidated  
in a single system and reviewed by  
senior management and the Board.  
They include a comprehensive set  
of financial reports and key performance 
indicators covering commercial and 
operational issues. Performance against 
budgets and forecasts is discussed 
regularly at Board meetings and at 
meetings between operational and  
Group management. The adequacy  
and suitability of key performance 
indicators is reviewed regularly.
INTERNAL AUDIT
All of the internal audit activities are 
co-ordinated centrally by the Group’s  
VP, Finance, who is accountable to the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee 
keeps this approach under review and is 
satisfied with the current arrangement.
All Group businesses are required to 
comply with the Group’s financial control 
framework that sets out minimum control 
standards. A key function of the Group’s 
internal audit resource is to undertake 
audits to ensure compliance with the 
financial control framework and make 
recommendations for improvement 
in controls where appropriate.
The VP, Finance meets with the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee as appropriate but 
at least annually, without the presence of 
executive management, and has direct 
access to the Chairman.
• keeps records and Board minutes as to 
authorisations granted by directors and 
the scope of any approvals given; and
• regularly reviews conflict authorisation.
ACCOUNTABILITY
FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTING
The Board recognises its responsibility 
to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of Spirent 
in all of our reporting obligations. This 
responsibility covers the Annual Report 
and extends to the half-year report and 
other regulatory announcements. The 
Directors consider this Annual Report, 
taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and 
understandable, providing the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy. In arriving at this position, 
the Board asked the Audit Committee to 
review and confirm the process is in place 
to support this assessment. The Audit 
Committee confirmed that a robust 
approach is in place to support the fair, 
balanced and understandable assessment, 
details of which can be found in the Audit 
Committee’s report on pages 50 to 54. 
BUSINESS MODEL
A description of the Company’s business 
model for sustainable growth is set out in 
the Group business model and strategy 
section on pages 12 to 19. These sections 
provide an explanation of the basis on 
which the Group generates value and 
preserves it over the long term and its 
strategy for delivering its objectives.
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the directors  
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, and consistent with the 
guidance contained in the document  
titled ‘Guidance on Risk Management, 
Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting’ published by the FRC, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the annual financial 
statements.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND  
RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board acknowledges its responsibilities 
for the Group’s system of internal control  
to facilitate the identification, assessment 
and management of risk, the protection of

the Nomination Committee’s key duties 
include:
• leading the search process and making 
recommendations to the Board for the 
appointment of new directors;
• regularly reviewing the Board structure, 
size and composition (including the skills,

non-executive directors. A quorum  
consists of two members being either two 
independent non-executive directors or 
one independent non-executive director 
and the Chairman.
Only members of the Committee have 
the right to attend Committee meetings. 
Other individuals such as the Chief 
Executive Officer and external advisers 
may be invited to attend meetings 
when appropriate.
When dealing with the appointment of the 
Chairman, the Committee is chaired by 
an independent non-executive director 
elected by the remaining members.
The terms of reference of the Nomination 
Committee, which were updated and 
approved during the year, are available  
on the Company’s website at

for potential candidates. These are then 
considered on the basis of their skills, 
experience and fit with the existing 
members of the Board. Procedures for 
appointing a non-executive or an executive 
director are set out in the Committee’s 
terms of reference.
MEETINGS
The Nomination Committee met four times 
during the year under review.
COMMITTEE ACTIVITIES DURING 2015
APPOINTMENT OF NEW INDEPENDENT 
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
During the year, the Chairman led the 
process for the appointment of two new 
independent non-executive directors 
as part of the progressive refreshing 
of the Board.
The services of external executive 
consulting firm, JCA Group (“JCA”),  
were retained to identify candidates. JCA 
is independent, with no other connection 
to the Company, and is a signatory to the 
“Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms” on gender diversity and 
best practice.
Following a rigorous process of 
interviews and assessments and, on 
the recommendation of the Nomination 
Committee, the Board approved the 
appointments of Tom Lantzsch with effect 
from 11 May 2015 and Jonathan Silver with 
effect from 25 June 2015.
APPOINTMENT OF NEW  
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
Following the announcement in November 
2015 of Rachel Whiting’s intention to retire 
from the Board prior to the 2016 AGM, a 
search for a replacement was initiated. The 
services of external executive search firm, 
Odgers Berndtson, were retained to assist 
with the process. Odgers Berndtson is 
independent, with no other connection 
to the Company and is a signatory to the 
“Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms” on gender diversity and 
best practice. The Company will report 
on progress in due course.
DIVERSITY POLICY AT BOARD LEVEL
The Board recognises that diversity is  
key for introducing different perspectives 
into board debate and decision-making.  
A genuinely diverse board comprises 
individuals with a range of personal 
attributes, perspectives, skills, experience 
and backgrounds, as well as representing 
differences in nationality, race and gender.
It continues to be the Board’s policy to 
make new appointments based on merit, 
recognising that gender remains an 
important aspect of the overall diversity 
which is crucial to creating an optimal 
board in terms of balance and composition. 
Candidates for future board appointments 
will be considered from the widest  
possible pool.
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Committee reviewed the results of the 
annual Board performance evaluation that 
related to the composition of the Board 
and  whether the time needed to fulfil the 
roles of Chairman, Senior Independent 
Director and non-executive director was 
appropriate. It was satisfied that all members 
of the Board are devoting sufficient time 
to their duties and remain independent 
in nature.
The Committee considered the re-election 
of directors prior to their recommendation 
for approval by shareholders at the AGM. 
The Committee was particularly mindful 
of the independence of longer-serving 
members of the Board.
PERFORMANCE REVIEW
The performance of the Committee was 
evaluated as part of the annual Board 
performance evaluation and it was 
found to be operating effectively.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
I am delighted to have taken on the role 
of Chairman of the Audit Committee (the 
“Committee”) in August this year. I would 
like to thank Ian Brindle for his eight years 
of leadership of the Committee, during 
which time he has skilfully guided the 
Board through numerous developments 
in financial and governance regulations.
2015 saw the introduction of the new 
requirement to make a viability statement 
concerning the Group. The Committee 
has worked closely with the executive 
management team to adapt and enhance 
robust processes to assess the viability 
of the Group over the three year period 
selected and make an appropriate 
recommendation to the Board.
2016 will see the retirement of Rachel 
Whiting and the appointment of a new 
Chief Financial Officer. Rachel has been of 
great help to me since my appointment and 
I am sorry that our time working together 
could not have been longer. She leaves 
behind a cohesive and effective finance 
team and she can be proud of playing her 
part over a career of 30 years with Spirent. 
I wish her well.
I will be available at the 2016 AGM to 
respond to any questions that shareholders 
may have on this report or on the 
Committee’s activities.

and procedures for maintaining 
independence, agreeing the scope  
of their work and fees paid to them  
for audit, assessing the effectiveness

HOW THE COMMITTEE OPERATES
All Committee members are expected 
to be financially literate and to have an 
understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, and developments  
in, financial reporting including 
applicable accounting standards and 
statements of recommended practice;
• key aspects of the Company’s 
operations including corporate 
policies and the Group’s internal 
control environment;
• matters which may influence the 
presentation of accounts and  
key figures;
• the principles of, and developments in, 
company law, sector-specific laws and 
other relevant corporate legislation;
• the role of internal and external auditing 
and risk management; and
• the regulatory framework for the  
Group’s businesses.
The Committee invites the Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Group VP 
Finance and senior representatives of the 
external auditors to attend its meetings in 
full, although it reserves the right to request 
any of these individuals to withdraw.
During the year, the Committee held three 
meetings with the external auditors without 
any executive members of the Board  
being present.
The Committee has unrestricted access to 
Company documents and information, as 
well as to employees of the Company and 
the external auditors.
The Committee’s effectiveness is reviewed 
on an annual basis as part of the Board’s 
performance evaluation process.
The terms of reference of the Audit 
Committee were reviewed and updated 
during the year and can be viewed  
on the Company’s website at 
http://corporate.spirent.com.
MEETINGS
The Audit Committee met three times 
during the year, with the Committee 
agenda linked to events in the Group’s 
financial calendar. 
ACTIVITIES DURING 2015
The Audit Committee’s activities principally 
related to financial reporting, internal 
control and risk management, the 
preparation for publishing a viability 
statement and the external audit. In 
addition, the Audit Committee considered 
other specific matters such as the Group’s 
approach to IT controls and cyber security.
MEMBERS

this report:
• Ian Brindle (Committee Chairman until 
retirement 7 August 2015)
• Tom Lantzsch (appointed 11 May 2015)
• Duncan Lewis
• Tom Maxwell
• Jonathan Silver (appointed 25 June 2015, 
appointed Committee Chairman

The Audit Committee comprises a 
minimum of three members, all of whom 
are independent non-executive directors 
of the Company who have the necessary 
range of financial and commercial 
expertise to challenge management. 
Two members constitute a quorum. 
The membership of the Audit Committee

Jonathan Silver, appointed to the Committee 
on 25 June 2015, became Chairman of the 
Committee on 7 August 2015 on the 
retirement of Ian Brindle.
The Code requires the inclusion of 
one financially qualified member 
(as recognised by the Consultative 
Committee of Accountancy Bodies) with

Currently, the Committee Chairman fulfils 
this requirement. 
KEY DUTIES
In accordance with its terms of reference, 
the Audit Committee’s key duties include:
• monitoring the integrity of the Group’s 
financial statements and any formal 
announcements relating to the 
Company’s performance, reviewing 
significant financial reporting 
judgements contained in them before 
their submission to the Board for 
approval;
• on matters of financial reporting 
reviewing and challenging where 
necessary the consistency of and any 
changes to accounting and treasury

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
During the year, the Audit Committee:
• reviewed the full year and half-year 
financial statements, trading updates, 
key accounting policies and significant 
financial reporting judgements contained 
therein (with particular reference to the 
critical accounting assumptions and 
judgements as set out in note 2 of the 
consolidated financial statements) and 
recommended the financial statements 
to the Board for approval;
• reviewed whether the Annual Report 
taken as a whole is fair, balanced and 
understandable and formed an opinion 
thereon prior to recommending it to  
the Board;
• reviewed and considered assumptions  
in relation to the going concern basis  
for preparation of financial statements; 
and
• reviewed the external auditor’s report  
on the interim review and year end audit 
and management’s responses to the 
issues raised.
The Committee Chairman reports 
any significant findings or identified 
weaknesses to the Board.
SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL 
ISSUES CONSIDERED
The Audit Committee has reviewed each  
of the following key significant financial 
risks by:
• reviewing papers and management 
updates;
• holding discussions with management 
and key finance staff to challenge 
assumptions made;
• debating alternative treatments;
• receiving periodic reports on key areas 
of judgement;
• discussing with external auditor; and
• considering presentations to analysts 
to assess for inconsistencies or areas  
of bias.
The Committee noted that Ernst & Young 
LLP (“EY”) had included these areas of 
significant risk in the Auditor’s Report on 
pages 78 to 83 of this Annual Report and 
was satisfied with the results of the 
procedures followed.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Committee is aware that the potential 
complexity of accounting, as well as the 
pressure on management to meet certain 
targets, may result in inappropriate 
recognition of revenue and associated 
balances. Additional training and a 
programme of awareness-raising has been 
rolled out across the business units. As 
part of their audit procedures agreed with 
the Committee, EY would examine the 
allocation of revenue and review specific 
large and complex transactions to ensure 
that revenue has been recognised 
appropriately.
TAX ACCOUNTING
The Committee recognises that by 
operating in a number of jurisdictions with 
differing tax regulations, there is a risk that 
the Group may incorrectly recognise tax 
charges in the income statement for the 
period and deferred tax assets. The 
Committee noted that EY would be 
performing a detailed review of the 
deferred tax recognised and tax provisions 
to ensure the appropriateness of tax 
disclosures in the Group accounts as  
part of their audit review.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT
As indicated in 2014, the Committee was 
aware of limited headroom in the Device 
Intelligence business unit and would keep 
this under review. After considering various 
scenarios, the Committee have concluded 
that the Company should make a $3.8 million 
goodwill impairment charge due to a change 
in market expectations with tier-2 mobile 
network operators. The Committee remains 
of the view that management’s assessment 
of goodwill in the other acquired business 
units is not overstated.
RESTRUCTURING COSTS
The Committee recognises that it is 
important that restructuring costs arising 
from decisions taken in December 2015 
are properly accounted for. Although a 
high degree of judgement is involved in 
identifying the appropriate accounting 
treatment, the Committee is satisfied that 
this has been done appropriately.
MISSTATEMENTS
Management reported to the Committee 
that they were not aware of any material  
or immaterial misstatements made 
intentionally to achieve a particular 
outcome. The auditors reported to  
the Committee the misstatements that  
they had found in the course of their work. 
After due consideration, the Committee 
concurred with management that no 
adjustments were required.
INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK 
MANAGEMENT
During the year, the Audit Committee:
• monitored and reviewed internal control 
and risk management systems;
• reviewed and approved the internal  
audit programme for 2015;
• reviewed the Company’s Ethics Policy 
and anti-bribery and corruption 
procedures; and
• reviewed regular reports on taxation, 
treasury operations, health and safety 
and cyber security.
The Board has overall responsibility for  
the Group’s system of internal control  
and risk management and for reviewing  
its effectiveness. The Board, assisted  
by the Audit Committee, has reviewed  
the effectiveness of this system and this 
review did not reveal any significant issues 
or weaknesses. The Board confirms that  
this system of financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
was in place throughout the year under 
review and up to the date of approval  
of this Report.
The primary aim of the Group’s internal 
controls is to operate a system which is 
appropriate to the business and which can 
support the Group in delivering its strategic 
objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets 
and, over time, enhance shareholder value. 
The system is designed to identify, 
evaluate and manage the significant risks 
faced by the Group rather than to eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.  
Audit Committee continued
52
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 provide an objective view and continual 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control and risk management throughout 
the Group. Detailed updates on specific 
areas, such as cyber security or business 
continuity, are provided by the Group VP, 
Finance at the Committee’s request.
The Board and Audit Committee consider 
that having the following key elements  
in place are critical to underpinning the 
overall internal control environment:
OPERATING STRUCTURE  
AND CONTROLS
An organisational structure with clear 
operating procedures, defined lines  
of responsibility and delegated levels  
of authority.
FINANCIAL CONTROL STRUCTURE
A comprehensive strategic planning, 
financial control and budgeting system 
which is properly documented and 
regularly reviewed.
ETHICS POLICY
A policy that sets standards of 
professionalism and integrity for all 
employees and operations. The Ethics 
Policy includes sections relating to bribery 
and corruption to ensure that all of 
Spirent’s systems, controls and training 
comply with the anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation in the countries where we 
operate and that a culture of prevention 
and detection of all forms of bribery and 
corruption is in place.
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTMENTS
A disciplined due diligence process and 
post-acquisition integration programme.
WHISTLEBLOWING AND FRAUD
The Group’s “whistleblowing” policy, which 
forms part of the Ethics Policy, contains 
arrangements for a confidential reporting 
facility for reporting to the Audit Committee 
as appropriate. The Audit Committee 
reviews any reports and the actions 
arising therefrom.
The Group’s anti-fraud policy has been 
communicated to all employees and states 
that all employees have a responsibility for 
fraud prevention and detection. Any suspicion 
of fraud should be reported immediately 
and will be investigated vigorously.
EXTERNAL AUDIT
During the year, the Audit Committee:
• reviewed and recommended to the 
Board the re-appointment of EY as 
external auditor and approval of their 
fees, in particular in light of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code’s 
recommendations regarding the tender 
of the external audit contract; and
• reviewed the policy on the engagement 
of EY to supply non-audit services.
The Committee places great importance 
on ensuring that high standards of quality 
and effectiveness are maintained within 
the external audit process. It considers a 
number of areas in relation to the external 
auditor: their performance in discharging 
the audit and interim review of financial 
statements, their independence and 
objectivity, and their re-appointment  
and remuneration.
AUDITOR APPOINTMENT
The Committee is aware of the Competition 
and Markets Authority’s Order (“CMA 
Order”) relating to its investigation of the 
statutory audit services market for large 
companies published in 2014. EY, or its 
predecessor firms, have acted as the 
Company’s auditor for more than 25 years. 
As such, under the transitional provisions 
contained within the CMA Order, the 
deadline for the appointment of a new 
auditor as a result of a tender process is set 
as 2021.
The Committee members consider that, 
given the appointment of a new Committee 
Chairman in 2015 and with a new Chief 
Financial Officer to be appointed in 2016, 
it would be preferable for operational 
reasons to recommend to shareholders 
that EY be re-appointed as auditors of the 
Company at the 2016 AGM. The Committee 
will keep this matter under review on an 
annual basis.
There are no contractual obligations in 
existence that restrict the Company’s 
choice of auditor.
This is in accordance with the Guidance  
on Risk Management, Internal Control and 
Related Financial and Business Reporting 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council 
in September 2014. The Group consists of  
a limited number of entities and the Board 
and Audit Committee continue to consider 
that currently there is no need for a 
dedicated internal control and risk 
management department.
The Group VP, Finance is responsible  
for ensuring that the finance department 
employs a level of management and 
specialists appropriate for maintaining 
financial records and processes that 
provide financial information that is 
relevant, reliable, complies with the 
applicable laws and regulations, and is 
distributed both internally and externally  
in a timely manner. A review of the 
consolidation and financial statements  
is undertaken by senior management  
to ensure that the financial position and 
results of the Group are appropriately 
reflected. All financial information 
published by the Group is subject to the 
approval of the Audit Committee prior  
to it being approved by the Board. 
An individual has been identified as 
responsible for monitoring each principal 
risk or uncertainty.
The Group Executive Committee meet with 
each business unit periodically to 
challenge and debate the assessment of 
risk within each business unit, who then 
submit local risk registers for analysis and 
ranking together with Company-wide risks 
to form a robust corporate risk register. 
This corporate risk register is then 
presented to the Audit Committee three 
times each year. Actions arising from the 
Audit Committee’s review of the corporate 
risk register can then be fed back to the 
business units for their management.
Day-to-day responsibility for effective 
internal control and risk management and 
monitoring rests with senior management 
at business unit level. The Group VP, 
Finance attends all Audit Committee 
meetings to report on internal control and 
risk management and to apprise the 
Committee of any control weaknesses, 
control failings and risks, their impact and 
the actions taken to deal with the issues. 
The Group VP, Finance, is independent of 
any business unit and is therefore able to

AUDITOR EFFECTIVENESS
To assess the effectiveness of the external 
auditors, the Committee reviewed:
• the external auditors’ fulfillment of the 
agreed audit plan and variations from it;
• reports highlighting the major issues that 
arose during the course of the audit;
• feedback from the businesses evaluating 
the performance of each assigned audit 
team; and
• a report from the Audit Quality Review 
Team of the Financial Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee holds private 
meetings with the external auditors after 
each Committee meeting to review key 
issues within their sphere of interest  
and responsibility.
To fulfil its responsibility for oversight  
of the external audit process, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
• the terms, areas of responsibility, 
associated duties and scope of the  
audit as set out in the external auditors’ 
engagement letter;
• the overall work plan and fee proposal;
• the major issues that arose during the 
course of the audit and their resolution;
• key accounting and audit judgements;
• the level of errors identified during the 
audit; and
• recommendations made by the external 
auditors in their management letters and 
the adequacy of management’s response.
The Committee reviewed and appropriately 
challenged the basis for these before 
agreeing the proposed approach and 
scope of the external audit identified.
As part of the review, the external auditors 
was questioned and challenged by the 
Committee about the work undertaken,  
its findings and what key assumptions  
had been made during the audit,  
especially with regard to the key  
areas of audit risk identified.
AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE
The Committee has formally reviewed 
the independence of its auditors. EY has 
provided a letter confirming that it believes 
it remained independent throughout the 
year, within the meaning of the regulations 
on this matter and in acordance with their 
professional standards.
To fulfil its responsibility to ensure the 
independence of the external auditors, 
the Committee reviewed:
• changes in external audit executives 
in the audit plan for the current year;
• a report from the external auditors 
describing their arrangements to identify, 
report and manage any conflicts of 
interest; and
• the extent of non-audit services 
provided by the external auditors.
POLICY ON NON-AUDIT SERVICES
The Committee’s responsibility to monitor 
and review the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors are 
supported by a policy relating to the 
provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditors. Taking into account 
relevant ethical guidance, this policy 
precludes a number of non-audit services, 
including those relating to the accounting 
records and financial statements, internal 
audit, IT consulting, legal and investment 
services and other services deemed by 
regulators to be precluded. The Committee 
accepts that certain work of a non-audit 
nature may be best undertaken by the 
external auditors. The policy is reviewed 
and financial limits for the provision of 
non-audit services, including audit-related 
fees, tax-related fees and other fees, are 
set on an annual basis (2015 $0.6 million 
(2014 $0.6 million)). Any amounts in excess 
of this limit must be approved in advance 
by the Audit Committee.
The Committee considers that 
notwithstanding the non-audit services 
provided during the year totalling 
$0.1 million (2014 $0.2 million), 
EY’s objectivity and independence 
as external auditors was not impaired.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Report on directors’ remuneration
DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
As Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”), I am pleased 
to present our Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 31 December 2015. This Report 
has been prepared on behalf of the Board 
by the Committee and has been approved 
by the Board.
In 2015 the Committee has focused on:
• designing a new long-term incentive 
plan (“LTIP”);
• placing more emphasis on profitability 
in the 2016 annual cash incentives; and
• updating our Remuneration Policy to 
incorporate the new LTIP while retaining 
flexibility for the Company.
LONG-TERM SHARE INCENTIVES
When drawing up our new LTIP, the 
Committee aimed to ensure that rewards 
only accrue as value is delivered to 
shareholders. The Committee concluded 
that it would take the opportunity to 
simplify arrangements, but retain the 
existing performance metrics as they 
provide strong alignment between 
management and shareholders. We 
consulted with major shareholders and 
shareholder representatives on our plans 
for the new LTIP as it remains the wish of 
the Committee to retain strong shareholder 
support for our approach to remuneration.
PERFORMANCE METRICS
The Committee proposes to continue using 
Target EPS and Absolute TSR performance 
targets for LTIP awards. We believe that 
these measures provide an appropriate 
balance between rewarding successful 
strategy execution and creating value for 
our shareholders. The proposed targets 
set out on page 57 reflect a significant 
increase from prior years as we seek to 
encourage delivery of profitable growth. 
The Committee is confident that only 
exceptional performance above typical 
market growth will be rewarded with the 
targets we have set.
QUANTUM
To reflect the significant increase in stretch 
targets, we have increased the quantum of 
awards for 2016 to 150% of base salary for 
the CEO (2015 125%). Our market review 
also demonstrated that our current award 
level to the CFO was behind market and 
we expect to make awards at a level 
of 100% (2015 60%) when a new CFO 
is appointed.
The Committee is satisfied that the 
additional upside this makes available to 
executive directors will be directly linked to 
performance, achievable only in a scenario 
where the Company attains outstanding 
results for shareholders.
SIMPLIFICATION
Under previous plans, the Company 
was able to grant a range of awards to 
management. While Spirent continues to 
compete for talent with sector peers based 
in the US (where practices differ from the 
UK general market), under the new LTIP, 
executive directors will be granted 
conventional performance shares only, 
in line with practice at the vast majority 
of FTSE-listed companies.
HOLDING PERIODS
The Committee considered post-vesting 
holding periods and also whether the 
shareholding guideline for executive 
directors was still appropriate. We 
concluded that in an industry with a pace 
of change such as ours, the three year 
vesting period was sufficiently long. 
Although it is important for directors 
to have a significant shareholding, our 
market review of similarly sized companies 
suggested our existing guideline as set out 
on page 59 was appropriate. 
ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVES
In line with the Company’s strategy for 
2016 of focusing on driving profitability 
across the Group, the annual cash 
incentives for executive directors this year 
have stretching targets that are weighted 
70% on trading profit and 30% on order 
intake (2015 20% and 80% respectively). 
REMUNERATION POLICY
As the Company will be seeking 
shareholder approval for the new LTIP at 
the 2016 AGM, we will also be seeking 
approval for a revised Remuneration Policy. 
While changes were necessary to reflect 
the new LTIP, we have also taken the 
opportunity to make changes to ensure 
that we have a workable policy over its 
three year lifespan and also to clarify 
certain issues, such as Committee 
discretion, where market practice has 
developed since our existing Policy was 
approved in 2014.
I hope you find this Report clear and 
informative. I will be available at the 2016 
AGM to respond to any questions that 
shareholders may have.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES
During 2015, cash incentives were only available to executive directors on an annual basis, with a maximum total cash incentive available 
for Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting of 150 per cent and 75 per cent of base salary respectively.
Growth targets in the Company’s order intake and trading profit, representing 80 per cent and 20 per cent of the incentive respectively, 
determined the maximum incentive which could be earned in respect of the annual incentive element. Minimum performance thresholds 
were set for order intake at $462.0 million and trading profit at $43.7 million. As the minimum trading profit was not achieved, no cash 
incentive awards were earned by the executive directors. In the prior year, targets were also not achieved, with no awards earned.
TOTAL PENSION ENTITLEMENTS
Eric Hutchinson receives a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension of 20 per cent of base salary. For 2015, the allowance paid 
was £80,000 (2014 £80,000). Rachel Whiting receives a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension of 14 per cent of base salary. For 2015, 
the allowance paid was £34,999 (2014 £32,083).

£40,000 per annum for 2016. Fees for the Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee, would remain at £160,000 
per annum for 2016, having been frozen since 1 January 2009. The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive 
additional fees of £11,000 and £9,000 per annum respectively and the Senior Independent Non-executive Director receives an 
additional fee of £7,500 per annum in recognition of the increased time commitment of these roles.

awards which may be built up over time following appointment as an executive director. The table below sets out the holdings of the

1  Key to share plan and type of award:
 EIP CSOP-A – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan HMRC-Approved Company Share Options
 EIP SAR – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Stock Appreciation Rights.
 EIP PS – 2005 Employee Incentive Plan Performance Shares awarded as conditional share awards.
2 The awards of EIP Performance Shares granted on 21 March 2012 were due to vest on 21 March 2015. However, after the testing of performance 
conditions attached to these awards the Remuneration Committee confirmed that the performance condition thresholds had not been met, 
resulting in the lapsing of the awards in full.
3  The market price on date of grant is the price of an Ordinary Share at the close of business on the day before the date of grant.
4  There is no exercise price payable for a Performance Share upon vesting.
5  Awards which have passed the date first exercisable have vested and are unfettered, having passed the relevant performance conditions.
6  Rachel Whiting was appointed to the Board on 1 February 2014; some of the awards shown were awarded prior to her appointment as Chief  
Financial Officer.
7 Rachel Whiting will be retiring from the Board prior to the 2016 AGM and outstanding share incentive awards will be dealt with in accordance 
with the Remuneration Policy effective on the date she leaves the employment of the Company.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 SCHEME INTERESTS AWARDED DURING THE YEAR
In 2015, the Committee approved an award of Performance Shares to Mr Hutchinson and Mrs Whiting equivalent to 125 per cent and 
60 per cent of base salary respectively.
The performance conditions for Performance Shares awarded in 2015 under the EIP are calculated over a three year performance 
period as set out in the following table:
50 per cent of award:
Growth in EPS
1
 over the performance period (%) Proportion of Performance Shares vesting (%)
Below 15 0
15 30
Above 15 and below 30 On a straight line basis between 30 and 100

Absolute TSR Proportion of Performance Shares vesting (%)
Up to 25% growth 0
At 25% growth but below 65% growth On a straight line basis between 30 and 100
At or above 65% growth 100
In determining TSR for the Company, share prices will be averaged over the 90 day period immediately prior to, and at the end of, 
the performance period.
SHARE INTERESTS VESTING DURING 2016
Awards which are due to vest on 8 May 2016 and are subject to an EPS performance condition have not passed that condition and will 
lapse on that date.
Awards which are due to vest on 8 May 2016 and are subject to a TSR performance condition will have that performance condition 
tested on 8 May 2016.
No new shares were issued during the year, with all exercises of share incentives being satisfied by the transfer of shares held by the 
Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”). At the date of this Report, the ESOT holds 0.6 million Ordinary Shares for the 
purpose of satisfying the exercises of current and future awards by employees and former employees of the Group. 
DILUTION
Overall shareholder dilution resulting from the Company’s share incentive plans (on a rolling ten-year basis) has fallen by 0.9 per cent 
when comparing the positions at 31 December 2015 (7.4 per cent) and 31 December 2014 (8.3 per cent). The overall number of share 
incentives outstanding has increased by 3.1 million during the year to 9.7 million at 31 December 2015 (2014 6.6 million).

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
RESPONSIBILITIES
The Remuneration Committee is responsible to the Board for determining:
• remuneration policy for the executive directors and Chairman taking into account remuneration trends across the Company;
• specific terms and conditions of employment of each individual executive director;
• overall policy for remuneration for the executive directors’ direct reports;
• design and monitoring of the operation of any Company share incentive plans;
• setting stretching incentive targets to encourage enhanced performance;
• determining an approach that rewards fairly and responsibly contribution to the Company’s long-term success; and
• other provisions of the executive directors’ service agreements and ensuring that contractual terms on termination, and payments 
made, are fair to the individual and the Company and that failure is not rewarded and loss is mitigated.
The Committee’s remit is set out in detail in its terms of reference, which are reviewed regularly and were approved in February 2015. 
They are available on the Company’s website at http://corporate.spirent.com.
COMPOSITION OF THE COMMITTEE
At the date of this Report, the Remuneration Committee comprises five independent non-executive directors, one of whom acts as 
Committee Chairman. The Company Secretary serves as Secretary to the Committee. All members are considered independent within 
the meaning of the 2014 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”).

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
During the year the Committee also consulted with the Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the 
Company Secretary & General Counsel but not on matters relating to their own remuneration.
Kepler Associates Limited, who were acquired in June 2015 by Mercer Limited, were appointed by the Committee some years ago to 
provide the results of TSR testing to determine the vesting of share incentives. The Committee has retained Mercer Limited in this role 
because it values the robust data provided and continuity of advice from the consultants involved. The Committee is satisfied that 
Mercer Limited is independent, thoughtful and challenging. Mercer Limited is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and 
complies with its voluntary Code of Conduct in respect of the provision of remuneration consulting services, details of which can be 
found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com and has no other connection to the Company. The Committee considers them to 
be independent in their approach.
The fees paid to Kepler Associates Limited and, after June 2015, to Mercer Limited to carry out work during the period under review  
for the Remuneration Committee totalled £3,300 (2014 £2,850) and were based on time and materials.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Committee in 2015 to undertake a market review of executive remuneration practices and assist with 
the design of a new long-term incentive plan. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte LLP is independent, thoughtful and challenging. 
Deloitte LLP is also a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its voluntary Code of Conduct in respect of 
the provision of remuneration consulting services, details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com and has 
no other connection to the Company. The Committee considers them to be independent in their approach.
The fees paid to Deloitte LLP to carry out work during the period under review for the Remuneration Committee totalled £27,300 
(2014 £nil) and were based on time and materials.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION POLICY (UNAUDITED)
This section sets out a revised Remuneration Policy for executive and non-executive directors. This Remuneration Policy is subject to a 
binding vote at the 2016 AGM on 4 May 2016 and, if approved at the 2016 AGM will become effective on 5 May 2016. The Policy will be 
put to shareholders again no later than the 2019 AGM.
The most significant change from the policy approved at the Company’s 2014 AGM is the introduction of the new Spirent Long-term 
Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), details of which are set out on page 57 and also in the Company’s Notice of AGM.
Our previous Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2014 AGM held on 23 April 2014 with 99.02 per cent 
of all votes cast in favour and it had a binding effect on the Company from 24 April 2014.
COMPONENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
The Committee’s policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that executive directors are fairly and responsibly rewarded in return 
for high levels of performance. The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to promote value creation through transparent 
alignment with the agreed corporate strategy, supporting performance and encouraging the underlying sustainable financial health 
of the business while promoting sound risk management for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Committee believes that the aims of 
the policy are achieved by ensuring that a significant proportion of executive remuneration is tied to the achievement of the agreed 
corporate strategy and long-term value creation.

Base salaries are normally reviewed annually, with changes 
effective from 1 January 
Set at levels to recruit and retain the high calibre talent needed 
to deliver the Group’s strategy without paying more than is 
considered necessary 
Salaries are typically set after considering various factors 
including the salary levels in companies of a similar size and 
complexity, the responsibilities of each individual role, 
progression within the role, individual performance and an 
individual’s experience and with regard to market salary levels in 
the country in which the executive resides. Our overall policy, 
having had due regard to the factors noted, is normally to target 
salaries at the median market level
While there is no defined maximum salary, any increase in salary 
will ordinarily be (in percentage terms) in line with those of the 
wider workforce, having particular regard to the increases in 
the country in which the individual resides 
Increases beyond those granted to the wider workforce 
(in percentage terms) may be awarded in certain circumstances,

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS FOR AWARDS UNDER THE SPIRENT LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”)
The Committee reviews the appropriateness of performance parameters for each award under the LTIP and sets stretching performance 
conditions in the light of the Company’s current and expected performance over the performance cycle.
2016 POLICY ON SHARE INCENTIVE AWARDS
The Committee expects to approve an award of Performance Shares to the CEO equivalent to 150 per cent of annual base salary. 
The Committee expects to make an award equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary to the new Chief Financial Officer when appointed.
APPROACH TO RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION
In the event that the Company recruits a new executive director (either from within the organisation or externally), when determining  
the appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors, (including but not limited  
to quantum, the type of remuneration being offered and the jurisdiction which the candidate was recruited from) to ensure that 
arrangements are in the best interests of both shareholders and the Company without paying more than is necessary to recruit  
an executive of the required calibre.
The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered with our Remuneration Policy outlined in the table 
above. However, the Committee retains discretion to make proposals on hiring a new executive director which are outside the standard 
Policy. In the first year of appointment, the Committee may offer additional remuneration arrangements that it considers appropriate and 
necessary to recruit and retain the individual. Such remuneration may be in the form of cash or share-based awards which may vest 
immediately or at a future point in time. Vesting may be subject to performance conditions selected by the Committee.
The Committee may make awards on appointing an executive director to “buy-out” remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving  
a previous employer on a like-for-like basis. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors, including any performance 
conditions attached to those awards, the form in which they were granted and the time over which they would have vested. 
In the event of recruitment, the Committee may also grant an award to a new executive under Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the 
granting of awards, specifically to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment or retention of an executive director, without 
seeking prior shareholder approval.

PURPOSE AND LINK TO STRATEGY KEY FEATURES MAXIMUM POTENTIAL VALUE PERFORMANCE METRICS
ANNUAL INCENTIVE
To reward and incentivise the achievement of annual financial 
and strategic goals which are selected to align the strategy of 
the business and support enhancement of shareholder value
The annual incentive is normally payable in cash and is 
not pensionable
The Remuneration Committee may, in exceptional circumstances, 
amend the payments should this not, in the view of the 
Committee, reflect overall business performance or individual 
contribution. Any such amendment would be reported to 
shareholders
Clawback provisions apply to any annual incentive payments 
made. Prior to payment of any cash incentive, the Committee 
could exercise its discretion and make no payment due to 
a malus event
The annual incentive starts accruing from threshold levels 
of performance
CEO: On target opportunity of 100 per cent base salary, subject 
to cap of 150 per cent base salary
CFO: Details of the annual cash incentive available to the 
incoming CFO will be disclosed in due course
Annual incentives may be based on a mix of financial and 
individual and business objectives with the majority of the 
weighting being given to financial metrics 
Measures, weightings and targets are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee each year taking into account the 
Group’s key strategic priorities and the approved budget for 
the year and are set out in the Annual report on remuneration

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new executive directors would normally be in line with the maximum level 
of variable pay set out in the policy table above but in any event would be limited to 400 per cent of base salary, excluding any buy-out 
awards. Any additional cash or share-based awards on recruitment of an executive director which may fall outside the policy statement 
would be performance-related and would therefore be regarded as variable remuneration and fall within the Company’s standard 
400 per cent cap.
For an internal appointment, any remuneration terms awarded in respect of the previous role may either continue on its original terms 
or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered would normally be in line with those paid to existing 
non-executive directors, details of which are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
In normal circumstances, it is the Company’s Policy that service contracts for executive directors have no fixed term and are capable  
of termination on no more than 12 months’ notice from either the Company or the executive director. It is intended that this policy would 
also apply to new appointments of executive directors. 
Both Eric Hutchinson and Rachel Whiting currently have a service agreement with Spirent Communications plc, and, being UK residents, 
both their contracts are in line with UK employment practice and are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Rachel Whiting’s 
service agreement, dated 1 February 2014 was terminated by Mrs Whiting giving six months’ notice on 4 November 2015. Eric 
Hutchinson’s service agreement dated 8 December 2014 may be terminated on 12 months’ notice from the Company and six months’ 
notice from Mr Hutchinson.
The Company recognises that its executive directors may, from time to time, be invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company. Details of any 
such appointments are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.
The service agreements of executive directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection at the  
2016 AGM.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
All non-executive directors have a letter of appointment with the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the 
Company’s Articles of Association. However, since 2011 and in accordance with the Code, all directors stand for re-election at each AGM.
The letters of appointment of non-executive directors are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection  
at the 2016 AGM. An example of a letter of appointment for a non -executive director is available on the Company’s website at  
http://corporate.spirent.com
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Board aims to recruit high calibre non-executive directors, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
The Company’s Remuneration Policy with regard to fees for non-executive directors, including the Chairman, is to pay fees which are in 
line with market practice for companies of a similar size and complexity. Individual fees reflect responsibility and commitment. Additional 
fees may be paid for further responsibilities, such as chairmanship of committees.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in cash incentive or share incentive arrangements and their service does not 
qualify for pension. No element of their fee is performance-related. Travel and other reasonable expenses (including fees incurred in 
obtaining professional advice in the furtherance of their duties and any associated taxes) incurred in the course of performing their 
duties may be paid by the Company or reimbursed to non-executive directors.
When recruiting non-executive directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line with those set out above.
EXIT PAYMENT POLICY
The Committee is committed to ensuring that it does not pay more than is necessary when executives leave Spirent and its policy  
on exit payments is and will continue to be in line with market practice in the country in which the executive director resides. The current 
exit payment policy is:
• Service contracts contain provisions for the removal of the director without compensation for not performing their duties to the 
standard required by the Board or material misconduct
• Payment in lieu of notice may be paid under service contracts if the relevant notice period is not given to the director or if, having 
received notice from the director, the employer does not wish him/her to serve it
• Unless provided for in the service contract, the Company would seek to apply practical mitigation measures to any payment of 
compensation on termination, for example by reducing payments to reflect payments received in respect of alternative employment, 
taking into account all relevant circumstances
• Service contracts do not contain provision for additional compensation on termination following a change of control (as detailed in the 
Change of Control provisions set out in the Report of the directors on page 74)
• Service contracts do not contain provision for liquidated damages of any kind
• Service contracts contain appropriate provisions to protect the legitimate interests of the Company with respect to preventing any 
terminated director from working in a business which competes against the Company
• Incentives:
•  Cash incentives: Unless otherwise provided in the service contract to be consistent with market practice in the country in which 
the executive resides, executives are not entitled to accrued cash incentives payable following termination unless the individual is 
determined by the Committee to be a good leaver (defined as an individual leaving employment due to redundancy, ill-health, injury 
or disability, retirement, death, the individual’s employing company ceasing to be under the control of the Group, a transfer of the 
undertaking in which the individual works (“Good Leaver”));
• Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan: Subject to approval by shareholders at the 2016 AGM, unvested awards will generally lapse at the 
time of exit. For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, the Committee has discretion to either (i) assess 
performance conditions at the point of exit by testing the performance conditions up to the date of exit for TSR performance and to 
the end of the most recent financial period for EPS performance, or (ii) assess performance conditions at the end of the applicable 
vesting period or such earlier date as may be appropriate. Any shares which vest would then normally be pro-rated to reflect the 
proportion of the vesting period actually served by the individual;
• Employee Incentive Plan (EIP): Leaver provisions were approved by shareholders when they approved the EIP in 2005 and 2015. 
Unvested awards generally lapse at the time of exit. For individuals determined by the Committee to be a Good Leaver, 
performance conditions are assessed by the Committee at the point of exit by testing the performance conditions up to the date 
of exit for TSR performance and to the end of the most recent financial period for EPS performance. Vesting is then pro-rated for 
the proportion of the performance period actually served and the individual has 12 months following the date of termination of 
employment in which to exercise them.
CONSIDERATION OF EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THE GROUP 
When setting the policy for directors’ remuneration, the Committee has regard to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere within 
the Group, particularly in the jurisdictions in which the executive directors are based. The Committee is kept informed on a regular basis 
of salary increases for the general employee population and takes these into account when determining salary increases for executive 
directors. No salary increase has been awarded for the role of either Chief Executive Officer or the current Chief Financial Officer for 2016.
Report on directors’ remuneration continued
70
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 While the Committee does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does 
receive updates and feedback through employee engagement surveys and takes these into account when reviewing executive pay. 
An employee engagement survey was undertaken in 2014 and the results reviewed by senior management; it is expected that further 
employee engagement surveys will be undertaken every two years.
CONSIDERATION OF THE VIEWS OF SHAREHOLDERS IN SETTING REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee is mindful of the views of shareholders in determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in ensuring that 
shareholder and director interests are aligned. The Committee is committed to an ongoing dialogue with shareholders and seeks 
shareholder views when any significant changes are proposed to remuneration arrangements. In particular, the Committee consulted 
with major shareholders and shareholder representatives in January 2016 regarding the introduction of the new LTIP.
LEGACY MATTERS
For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this Remuneration Policy, authority is given to the Company to make payments and honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors (such as the payment of pension or the unwinding of legacy share schemes) 
where the terms were agreed either prior to 24 April 2014 (the effective date of the first directors’ remuneration policy) or at a time when 
a previous remuneration policy was in force. Details of any payments will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2016
The charts below show an illustration of the proportion of total remuneration made up of each component of the Remuneration Policy 
and the value of each component.
Three scenarios have been illustrated for each executive director:
Minimum performance – Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
– No payment under the Annual Cash Incentive
– No vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan
On target performance – Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
– On-target payment under the Annual Cash Incentive (two-thirds of maximum)
– 25 per cent vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan
Maximum performance – Fixed remuneration (salary, benefits and retirement benefits)
– Maximum payment under the Annual Cash Incentive
– Full vesting under the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 DILUTION
The Committee is strongly committed to managing shareholder dilution in a responsible manner. Details of the Company’s dilution is set 
out in the Annual report on remuneration on page 62.
COMMITTEE DISCRETION
The Committee has powers delegated by the Board under which it operates. In addition, it complies with rules which have either been 
approved by shareholders (the long-term incentive plans) or previously by the Committee (annual cash incentives). These rules provide 
the Committee with certain discretions which serve to ensure that the implementation of the Remuneration Policy is fair both to the 
individual director and to shareholders, taking overall performance and the position of the Company into account. The Committee also 
has discretions to set components of remuneration within a range from time to time. The extent of such discretions are set out in the 
relevant rules or in the maximum opportunity and performance metrics sections of the Policy Table.
The Committee may make adjustments to awards to reflect corporate events, such as a change in the Company’s capital structure. 
The Committee may adjust the calibration of performance measures and vesting outcomes, or substitute or amend any vesting condition 
(eg due to a significant acquisition or disposal) provided that the resulting condition is appropriate.
The Committee may make minor amendments to the Remuneration Policy to aid its operation or implementation without seeking 
shareholder approvals (eg for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes).
In addition, the Committee requires discretion to deal with genuinely exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. This form of discretion 
will only be applied in the best interests of the Company and when, in the view of the Committee, it would be disproportionate to seek 
specific approval from shareholders in general meeting. It is intended that this discretion be used only in the event of changed 
circumstances or strategy that has not been provided for in the Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not exercise discretion to reward failure and will report on any exercise of discretion that changes  
the amount of remuneration paid in any year.
The Remuneration Committee can confirm that no discretion was used either during the period or to the date of this Report and 
in particular that it does not envisage any cash payment being offered which could be construed as a “golden hello”.

on 11 September 2015, this amounts 
to 3.89 cents for the period. Dividends 
are detailed on page 104.

EMPLOYEES
The average number of Group employees 
during 2015 was 1,754 people worldwide 
(2014 1,727). While the Group’s approach 
to human resource management is 
decentralised, with flexibility given to each 
of the businesses, as a Group it strives to 
maintain the following principles:
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
The Group is committed to offering equal 
opportunities in recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion to all 
people, including those with disabilities, 
having regard for their particular aptitudes 
and abilities. As a matter of policy, full and 
fair consideration is given to applicants 
with disabilities and every effort is made 
to give employees who become disabled 
whilst employed by the Group an 
opportunity for retraining and continuation 
in employment. It is Group policy that 
the training, career development and 
promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be the same as that 
of other employees.
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Health and safety are considered as equal 
in importance to that of any other function 
of the Group and its business objectives 
and the Group is committed to providing 
a safe and healthy workplace to protect 
all employees, visitors and the public 
from foreseeable work hazards.
HARRASSMENT
Sexual, mental or physical harassment 
in the workplace will not be tolerated. 
It is expected that incidents of harassment 
are reported to the appropriate Human 
Resources director.
HUMAN RIGHTS
The Group provides opportunities that 
promote human rights and dignity every 
day through the employment created, 
both directly and indirectly in its global 
supply chains and through the positive 
contribution its products make to people’s 
lives. Further details on the Group’s 
approach to human rights can be found 
in the Corporate responsibility report on 
pages 36 to 39.
COMMUNICATION
Employees are briefed on all relevant 
matters on a regular basis to achieve a 
common awareness of all the financial 
and economic factors affecting the 
performance of the Group. Information 
relevant to employees will be provided 
to them.
Employees are provided with information 
on the performance of their business 
unit and their involvement is encouraged 
in a variety of ways, such as through 
engagement surveys, “town hall” meetings 
and management presentations.
The Group encourages an open culture in 
all its dealings between employees and 
people with whom it comes into contact. 
The Group’s whistleblowing procedure 
sets out guidelines for individuals who feel 
they need to raise issues in confidence 
with the Company or their own business 
unit. Every effort is made to protect the 
confidentiality of those who raise concerns 
and employees may come forward without 
fear for their position.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has a single class of share 
which is divided into Ordinary Shares of 
3⅓ pence each. Each Ordinary Share 
carries one vote and all of the Ordinary 
Shares rank pari passu. There are no 
special control rights relating to any of the 
Ordinary Shares. At the date of this Report, 
611.7 million Ordinary Shares of 3⅓ pence 
each had been issued which are fully paid 
up and are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. The Company also operates 
a Level 1 American Depositary Receipt 
(“ADR”) programme with each ADR 
representing four Ordinary Shares. The 
ADRs trade on the US over-the-counter 
market and BNY Mellon is the authorised 
depositary bank for the programme. 
Further details on share capital are set out 
in note 29 to the consolidated financial 
statements and note 13 to the parent 
Company financial statements. The rights, 
including those relating to voting, obligations 
and any restrictions on transfer relating to 
the Company’s Ordinary Shares, as well 
as the powers of the Company’s directors, 
are set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association, a copy of which can be found 
on our website at http://corporate.spirent.
com/ or can be obtained from Companies 
House or by writing to the Company 
Secretary. The Company’s Articles of 
Association may only be amended by a 
special resolution at a general meeting of 
shareholders. The most recent changes to 
the Articles of Association were approved 
at the 2010 AGM and became effective at 
the close of that meeting on 5 May 2010.
The Company has established two 
employee benefit trusts in connection with 
the operation of the Company’s share 
incentive plans: the Spirent ESOT and the 
Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”). The 
trustees of both trusts have waived their 
right to receive dividends on any Ordinary 
Shares held by them except for a nominal 
amount of 1 pence other than for those 
Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT which 
are the beneficial property of an employee/
shareholder. For further details on the 
employee benefit trusts see “Investment 
in own Ordinary Shares” in note 29 to 
the consolidated financial statements and 
note 13 to the parent Company financial 
statements. Trustees of both trusts do not 
vote their Ordinary Shares, except for 
those Ordinary Shares held in the ESOT 
that are the beneficial property of an 
employee/shareholder, which the trustees 
will vote in accordance with the instructions 
received from the beneficial owner.
RESTRICTIONS ON SHARE TRANSFERS
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the 
Company other than certain restrictions 
which may from time to time be imposed 
by law, for example insider trading law. 
In accordance with the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Conduct Authority, certain 
employees are required to seek the 
approval of the Company prior to dealing 
in its securities.
The Company is not aware of any 
agreements between shareholders that 
may result in restrictions on the transfer of 
securities or on voting rights. The Company 
is also not aware of any contract of 
significance between itself or any subsidiary 
undertaking and a controlling shareholder.
POWERS FOR ISSUE OF NEW SHARES
During the year to 31 December 2015 and 
to the date of this Report, no new Ordinary 
Shares have been allotted as a result of the 
exercise of options and rights pursuant to 
the Company’s share incentive plans.
At each AGM, the directors seek authority 
to allot shares for cash and to disapply 
pre-emption rights within prescribed limits. 
At the 2016 AGM, authority will be sought 
to allot new Ordinary Shares up to a 
nominal value of £6,797,132, which is equal 
to approximately 33.3 per cent of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 
4 March 2016.
RETURN OF CAPITAL
The Company was first authorised to 
repurchase up to 14.99 per cent of its own 
issued Ordinary Shares, within certain 
limits and as permitted by the Company’s 
Articles of Association, at the 2006 AGM. 
This authority has been renewed at each 
subsequent AGM, reducing to 9.99 per 
cent at the 2010 AGM and subsequent 
AGMs. The authority from the 2015 AGM 
remains valid until the earlier of the 2016 
AGM or 30 June 2016. Since the Company 
began returning capital to shareholders in 
May 2006, a total of £270.2 million has 
been returned, through the repurchase 
of 397.6 million Ordinary Shares.
No shares were repurchased during 2015 
or to the date of this Report.
The Company will seek authority to 
repurchase up to 9.99 per cent of its 
own Ordinary Shares at the 2016 AGM 
to facilitate any further return of capital 
if the Board concludes that it is in the 
best interests of shareholders to do so.
POLITICAL DONATIONS
In accordance with the Group’s Ethics 
Policy, no political donations were made 
during the year (2014 nil).
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Details of the Group’s use of financial 
instruments, together with information 
on our risk objectives and policies and 
our exposure to price, credit, liquidity, 
cash flow and interest rate risks, can be 
found in note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries and 
taking into account the matters set out in 
the Principal risks and uncertainties section 
on pages 22 to 25 of this Annual Report, 
the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For 
this reason, they continue to adopt the 
going concern basis on preparing the 
financial statements.

VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the 
2014 Code, the directors have assessed 
the prospects of the Company over a 
period of three years.
This period was selected for the 
following reasons:
• the Group’s strategic planning cycle 
covers a three-year period;
• the Board reviews a three-year financial 
corporate plan; and
• when considering a major investment 
in product development, three years 
is considered by the Board to be a 
reasonable time horizon in which 
the product should achieve 
meaningful sales.
The Board’s assessment has been made 
with reference to the Company’s current 
position and prospects, the Group’s 
strategy, the Board’s risk appetite 
and the Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties as set out on pages 22 to 25 
of this Annual Report.
The Board has reviewed plausible and 
severe stress tests based on the occurrence 
of a mix of the principal risks to which the 
Company is exposed, considering the 
potential impact of these risks on the 
business model, future performance, 
solvency and liquidity over the period.
Based on this assessment and the 
expected successful impact of mitigating 
actions, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three 
year period.
POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
No post balance sheet events are required 
to be disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 
TO AUDITOR
Each of the directors of the Company at the 
date of this Report confirms that:
• so far as the director is aware, there is 
no information needed by the Company’s 
auditor in connection with preparing 
their Report of which the Company’s 
auditor is unaware; and
• he (she) has taken all the steps that he 
(she) ought to have taken as a director 
in order to make himself (herself) aware 
of any information needed by the 
Company’s auditor in connection with 
preparing their Report and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

of the Audit Committee report, the Board 
will be proposing a resolution to re-appoint 
EY as auditor at the 2016 AGM.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, the Report on directors’ 
remuneration, the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group and the financial 
statements of the parent Company.
Company law requires the directors to

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(including FRS101) and applicable law.
The consolidated financial statements of 
the Group are required by law and IFRSs to 
present fairly for each financial period the 
financial position and performance of the 
Group; the Companies Act 2006 provides, 
in relation to such financial statements, that 
references in the relevant part of that Act 
to financial statements giving a true and 
fair view, are references to their achieving 
a fair presentation.
The parent Company financial statements 
are required by law to give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the 
parent Company.
In preparing each of the consolidated 
financial statements of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;

that are reasonable and prudent;

statements whether applicable UK 
Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent Company financial 
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements 
on a going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume the Group 
and the parent Company will continue 
in operational business for the 
foreseeable future.
The directors confirm that they have 
complied with the above requirements 
in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and the 
parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, for the 
Group, Article 4 of the International 
Accounting Standards (“IAS”) Regulation. 
They have general responsibility for taking 
such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, 
the directors are also responsible for 
preparing a strategic report, a directors’ 
report, a directors’ remuneration report 
and a statement on corporate governance 
that comply with the law and those 
regulations. They are also responsible 
for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website.
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual 
Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model 
and strategy.

Disclosure and Transparency Rules 
(“DTR”) of the Financial Conduct Authority 
in respect of the requirement to produce 
an annual financial report.
The Annual Report and consolidated 
financial statements are the responsibility 
of, and have been approved by, 
the directors.
Each of the directors confirms that, to the 
best of their knowledge:
• the consolidated financial statements of 
the Group and parent Company financial 
statements, prepared in accordance 
with the applicable set of accounting 
standards, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and the profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the Annual Report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
Company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole,

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Risks of material misstatement • Revenue recognition.
• Recoverability of deferred tax assets.
• Carrying value of goodwill and investments in subsidiary undertakings  
(parent Company only).
• Appropriateness of the accounting for restructuring costs.
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of five components and audit 
procedures on specific balances for a further four components.
• The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for  
64 per cent of adjusted profit before tax used to calculate materiality and 85 per cent of 
revenue. The adjusted profit before tax coverage has been impacted by one full scope 
component being loss making in the year.
Materiality • Overall Group materiality is £1.31 million which represents 5 per cent of adjusted profit 
before tax

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISK OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the 
allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing these risks, we have performed the 
procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any 
opinion on these individual areas.
Risk Our response to the risk What we reported to the Audit Committee
Revenue recognition
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 50); Accounting policies (page 
89); and Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Group has reported revenues of 
$477.1 million (2014 $457.2 million). 
There is a risk in relation to incorrect 
allocation to components for multi-
element contracts and inappropriate 
cut off.
We performed full and specific scope 
audit procedures over this risk area in 
six locations, which covered 85 per 
cent of reported revenue.
For significant revenue streams at each full and 
specific scope audit location:
• We performed walkthroughs of each significant 
class of revenue transactions and assessed the 
design effectiveness of key controls;
• We have tested revenue in relation to sales 
contracts specifically focusing on the accounting 
for the service element of multiple element sales 
contracts as well as allocation of revenue in 
contracts with separate components consisting of 
hardware and subsequent software upgrades;
• In addition we have selected for testing the large 
and complex transactions and a representative 
sample of regular transactions at each location;
• We have tested deferred revenue and other 
revenue associated balances to ensure they have 
been recognised in accordance with Group 
accounting policies and IFRS; and
• We have tested cut off in relation to revenue on 
contracts recognised close to the year end. This 
was a particular focus in China and India where 
our testing included direct confirmations of 
customers where considered necessary.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s 
disclosures in respect of the accounting policies for 
revenue recognition in note 2 to the consolidated 
financial statements.
We concluded that revenue 
recognised in the year, and deferred 
as at 31 December, is materially 
correct on the basis of our 
procedures performed both at Group 
and by component audit teams.
Recoverability of deferred tax assets
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 50); Accounting policies 
(page 89); and Note 2 of the 
Consolidated Financial Statements
The Group has deferred tax assets of 
$25.6 million (2014 $20.5 million). 
There is a risk that inappropriate use 
of brought forward tax losses and 
volatility in forecast sales may result in 
incorrect recognition of deferred tax 
assets. This risk is further heightened 
due to performance in the year to date 
as well as the continued integration of 
a number of prior year acquisitions 
in the year resulting in an increased 
complexity within the business.
We have performed the following procedures over 
the Group deferred tax assets as at 31 December:
• We have performed detailed testing over the 
recognised deferred tax assets to ensure 
recognition is in accordance with IFRS;
• In addition, we have reviewed and challenged the 
future profit forecasts, underlying assumptions 
and utilisation of unrecognised brought forward 
losses; and
• We have challenged the accuracy and 
appropriateness of related disclosures in the 
Group financial statements.
We concluded that deferred tax 
assets recognised in the year, 
and deferred tax assets as at 
31 December, is materially correct 
on the basis of our procedures 
performed both at Group and by 
component audit teams.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Risk Our response to the risk What we reported to the Audit Committee
Carrying value of goodwill and 
investments in subsidiary 
undertakings (parent Company only)
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 50); Accounting policies (page 
89); and Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Group has goodwill of $216.9 
million (2014 $223.2 million) and 
investments in subsidiary 
undertakings of £347.2 million (2014 
£346.2 million). Given the continuing 
uncertain economic environment and 
the performance of the business in the 
year, there is an increased risk that 
goodwill in the Group financial 
statements and investments in the 
parent Company accounts may be 
overstated.
In addition we focused our audit effort 
on the DI CGU due to the impairment 
charge of $3.8 million recognised in 
the current year (2014 impairment 
charge of $ nil). The remaining 
carrying value in relation to DI is  
$10.5 million at 31 December 2015.
Goodwill was subject to full scope 
audit procedures by the primary 
audit team.
We challenged management’s assumptions 
used in its impairment models for assessing 
the recoverability of the carrying value of 
goodwill. We focused on the appropriateness 
of CGU identification, forecast cash flows, 
methodology applied to estimate 
recoverable values and discount rates. 
Specifically:
• We have reviewed the allocation of the 
respective goodwill to groups of cash 
generating units for impairment testing 
purposes;
• Together with our valuations experts we 
have reviewed the annual impairment 
calculations prepared by management, 
including appropriate challenge of 
underlying assumptions and cash flow 
forecasts;
• We have reviewed the performance of 
recent acquisitions against plan for 
indicators of impairment; and
• In addition for DI, we performed sensitivity 
analyses by testing key assumptions in the 
model to recalculate a range of potential 
outcomes in relation to the impairment 
charge to be recognised in the year.
We considered the appropriateness of the 
related disclosures provided in note 14 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
We concluded that goodwill 
and investments in subsidiary 
undertakings (parent Company only) 
as at 31 December, is materially 
correct on the basis of our procedures 
performed both at Group and by 
component audit teams.
Appropriateness of the accounting 
for restructuring costs
Refer to the Audit Committee Report 
(page 50); Accounting policies (page 
89); and Note 2 of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
The Group has restructuring 
provisions of $7.0 million and total 
exceptional costs of $12.5 million (2014 
$2.6 million with total exceptional 
costs of $4.1 million). The risk is due to 
the high degree of judgement 
involved in the identification and 
accounting treatment of the various 
restructuring activity which took place 
in December. In addition there is a risk 
over the incorrect allocation of the 
restructuring costs between the 
current year, and 2016.
We have performed the following procedures over 
the restructuring provisions as at 31 December:
• We have reviewed the underlying support and 
held discussions with both Group and local 
management to gain comfort over the 
identification and accounting treatment 
of the restructuring costs
• We have read the significant contracts and 
assessed management’s accounting for the 
financial matters. We have considered the 
accounting in light of performance and the 
changes to the business in the year.
• We held discussions around judgemental areas 
with senior members of the Company including 
the CFO, internal legal counsel, Group and local 
finance and local operational management. We 
corroborated the discussions with supporting 
documentation.
We have assessed managment’s classification 
of costs as restructuring and as exceptional.
We concluded that the restructuring 
costs recognised in the year, and 
the restructuring provisions as at 
31 December, is materially correct 
on the basis of our procedures 
performed both at Group and by 
component audit teams.
In the prior year, our auditor’s report 
included a risk of material misstatement 
in relation to acquisition accounting which 
included the risk over the carrying value 
of goodwill. In the current year, this has 
been re-defined to address the specific 
risk over carrying value of goodwill and 
investments in subsidiary undertakings 
(parent Company only) in light of the 
absence of any significant acquisitions 
but challenging performance in the year. 
In the prior year, our auditor’s report also 
included a risk of material misstatement in 
relation to tax accounting. In the current 
year, this this been re-defined to address 
the specific risk over the recoverability of 
deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty 
over future performance. The resolution in 
the year of a significant tax provision 
results in a reduced risk over uncertain tax 
positions. Lastly there is a new significant 
risk in respect of the appropriateness of 
accounting for restructuring costs as 
a result of the scale and complexity 
of the arrangements.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
TAILORING THE SCOPE
Our assessment of audit risk, our 
evaluation of materiality and our allocation 
of performance materiality determine our 
audit scope for each entity within the 
Group. Taken together, this enables us 
to form an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements. We take into account 
size, risk profile, the organisation of the 
Group and effectiveness of group-wide 
controls, changes in the business 
environment and other factors when 
assessing the level of work to be 
performed at each entity.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement 
to the Group financial statements, and to 
ensure we had adequate quantitative 
coverage of significant accounts in the 
financial statements, of the reporting 
components of the Group, we selected 
components covering entities within UK, 
North America and Asia which represent the 
principal business units within the Group.
Of the nine components selected, we 
performed an audit of the complete financial 
information of five components (full scope 
components) which were selected based 
on their size or risk characteristics. For 
the remaining four components (specific 
scope components), we performed audit 
procedures on specific accounts within 
that component that we considered had 
the potential for the greatest impact on 
the significant accounts in the financial 
statements either because of the size 
of these accounts or their risk profile.
For the current year, the full and specific 
scope components contributed 85 per cent 
(2014 87 per cent) of the Group’s revenue. 
The audit scope of specific components may 
not have included testing of all significant 
accounts of the component but will have 
contributed to the coverage of significant 
accounts tested for the Group. The coverage 
obtained in relation to individual expense 
accounts ranged from 77 per cent to 100 per 
cent of the total individual expense amounts. 
The coverage obtained in relation to 
individual balance sheet accounts ranged 
from 81 per cent to 100 per cent of the total 
individual balance sheet amounts. The Group 
audit risk in relation to revenue recognition 
was subject to audit procedures at each of 
the full and specific scope locations with 
revenue. The Group audit risk in relation 
to the carrying value of goodwill and 
investments in subsidiaries (parent Company 
only), as well as deferred tax assets and 
restructuring costs was subject to audit 
procedures by the primary audit team on the 
STARTING BASIS
ADJUSTMENTS
MATERIALITY
• Profit before tax – $9.6 million
• Adjusted for non-recurring items:
– Exceptional items of $12.5 m illion
– Goodwill impairment of $3.8 million
– Acquisition costs of $0.1 m illion
• Totals $26.0 million
• Materiality of $1. 31 m illion  
(5 per cent of materiality basis)
entire balance. For the current year, the full 
and specific scope components contributed 
64 per cent (2014 80 per cent) of the Group’s 
adjusted profit before tax measure used to 
calculate materiality. The adjusted profit 
before tax coverage has been impacted 
by one full scope component being loss 
making in the year.
Of the remaining components, we performed 
review scope procedures in respect of two 
additional components which accounted for 
21 per cent of the Group’s adjusted profit 
before tax and 12 per cent of the Group’s 
revenue. For all remaining components, 
we performed other procedures, including 
analytical review procedures and testing 
of consolidation journals, intercompany 
eliminations and foreign currency translation 
recalculations to respond to any potential 
risks of material misstatement to the Group 
financial statements.
INVOLVEMENT WITH COMPONENT TEAMS
In establishing our overall approach to the 
Group audit, we determined the type of 
work that needed to be undertaken at each 
of the components by us, as the primary 
audit engagement team, or by component 
auditors from other EY global network firms 
operating under our instruction. Of the five 
full scope components, audit procedures 
were performed on three of these directly 
by the primary audit team and two by the 
component audit team. For the four 
specific scope components, where the 
work was performed by component 
auditors, we determined the appropriate 
level of involvement with the component 
teams to enable us to determine that 
sufficient audit evidence had been 
obtained as a basis for our opinion 
on the Group as a whole.
At the start of the audit, a global team 
planning event was held in the UK with 
representatives from all full and specific 
scope component audit teams in attendance. 
Detailed instructions were sent to all auditors 
in these locations. These instructions 
covered the significant areas that should be 
addressed by the component team auditors 
(which included the relative risks of material 
misstatement detailed above) and set out the 
information to be reported back to the Group 
audit team. In addition, the Group audit team 
continued to follow a programme of planned 
visits that has been designed to ensure that 
the Senior Statutory Auditor visits certain 
material or high risk locations on a rotational 
basis. During the current year’s audit cycle, 
visits were undertaken by the primary audit 
team to the component teams in North 
America and Paignton. These visits involved 
discussing the audit approach with the 
component team and any issues arising from 
their work, meeting with local management, 
attending closing meetings, and reviewing 
key audit working papers on the Group risk 
areas. The primary team interacted regularly 
with the component teams where 
appropriate during various stages of the 
audit including attendance at close meetings, 
reviewed key working papers and were 
responsible for the scope and direction of 
the audit process. This, together with the 
additional procedures performed at Group 
level, gave us appropriate evidence for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements.
OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY
We apply the concept of materiality 
in planning and performing the audit, 
in evaluating the effect of identified 
misstatements on the audit and in 
forming our audit opinion.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
81
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 MATERIALITY
The magnitude of an omission or 
misstatement that, individually or in 
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users 
of the financial statements. Materiality 
provides a basis for determining the nature 
and extent of our audit procedures.
We determined materiality for the Group 
to be $1.31 million (2014 $1.65 million), 
which is 5 per cent (2014 5 per cent) of 
adjusted profit before tax. We believe 
that adjusted profit before tax provides 
us with a consistent year on year basis 
for determining materiality and is the 
most relevant performance measure to 
the stakeholders of the entity. Detailed 
audit procedures are performed on 
material non-recurring items.
During the course of our audit, we 
reassessed initial materiality and the 
only change in final materiality was to 
reflect the actual reported performance 
of the Group in the year.
PERFORMANCE MATERIALITY
The application of materiality at the 
individual account or balance level. It is set 
at an amount to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate 
of uncorrected and undetected 
misstatements exceeds materiality.
On the basis of our risk assessments, 
together with our assessment of the 
Group’s overall control environment, 
our judgement was that performance 
materiality was 75 per cent (2014 75 per 
cent) of our planning materiality, namely 
$1.0 million (2014 $1.2 million). We used 
75 per cent rather than 50 per cent due 
to the historically low number of audit 
adjustments found in prior years. We 
have set performance materiality at this 
percentage to ensure that total detected 
and undetected audit differences do 
not exceed our planning materiality of 
$1.31 million for the financial statements 
as a whole.
Audit work at component locations for the 
purpose of obtaining audit coverage over 
significant financial statement accounts is 
undertaken based on a percentage of total 
performance materiality. The performance 
materiality set for each component is 
based on the relative scale and risk of the 
component to the Group as a whole and 
our assessment of the risk of misstatement 
at that component. In the current year, the 
range of performance materiality allocated 
to full and specific scope components was 
$0.9 million to $0.2 million (2014 $1.2 million 
to $0.2 million).
REPORTING THRESHOLD
An amount below which identified 
misstatements are considered as being 
clearly trivial.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we 
would report to them all uncorrected audit 
differences in excess of $0.07 million 
(2014 $0.09 million), which is set at 5 per cent 
of planning materiality, as well as differences 
below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected 
misstatements against both the 
quantitative measures of materiality 
discussed above and in light of other 
relevant qualitative considerations in 
forming our opinion.
SCOPE OF THE AUDIT OF THE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
An audit involves obtaining evidence 
about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: 
whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the 
parent Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the 
Annual Report 2015 to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the 
course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 
OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITOR
As explained more fully in the Directors’ 
responsibilities statement set out on page 
77, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the 
Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has 
been undertaken so that we might state to 
the Company’s members those matters we 
are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not 
accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS 
PRESCRIBED BY THE COMPANIES 
ACT 2006
In our opinion:
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report to be audited has been properly 
prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• The information given in the Strategic 
Report and the Directors’ Report for the 
financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Notes
1 The maintenance and integrity of the Spirent Communications plc website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors 
does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the 
financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
2 Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION
The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors 
on 25 February 2016. Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. 
The Company’s Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Union’s (“EU”) IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated 
financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU and issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). 
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. These are 
presented on pages 89 to 94 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 126 to 128.
2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been 
measured at fair value.
GOING CONCERN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
At 31 December 2015 the Group had cash balances of $102.0 million and no debt.
The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business 
plans for the 2017 and 2018 financial years. They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Group faces and its 
current financial position and are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern basis of accounting 
continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
No new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been applied by the Group which have resulted a significant 
impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December 
each year. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent 
accounting policies. Full list of subsidiary undertakings are listed on page 137.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, 
or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. 
The separable net assets, including intangible assets of newly acquired subsidiaries are incorporated into the consolidated 
financial statements based on their fair values at the effective date of control.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. 
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment includes goodwill 
identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share 
of the total comprehensive income from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases. 
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil 
and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of an associate.
Dividends received from associates reduce the carrying value of the associate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL
A business combination is a transaction or other event in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
At acquisition date the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including intangible assets, are measured at their fair values. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest 
in the acquiree. Non-controlling interests are measured at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Contingent consideration resulting from business combinations is valued at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business 
combination. When the contingent consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is subsequently re-measured to fair value 
at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. The determination of fair value is based on discounted 
cash flows. The key assumptions take into consideration the probability of meeting each performance target and the discount rate. 
Acquisition costs are expensed and included in administration costs.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired, 
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related 
cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying 
amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Separately identifiable 
intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance 
sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business. 
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis. The carrying value of intangible assets 
is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Acquired intangible assets, being customer list, current technology, database, brand names and non-compete covenant, are amortised 
on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and the charge is included within administration expenses in the income 
statement. Licences are amortised over their useful lives or term, and are expensed within cost of sales or selling costs.
The estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the amortisation expiry dates are as follows:
Useful life Expiry date
Customer list 2 to 7 years 2020
Current technology 5 to 7 years 2021
Database 2.5 to 7 years 2021
Brand names 5 years 2020
Non-compete covenant 4 years 2018
Licences 3 to 5 years 2018
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred. Intangible assets arising on the Group’s various product 
development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” are met. 
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has 
been established. Technological feasibility in Spirent’s circumstances occurs when a working model is completed. For software 
development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete. After technological 
feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not 
provided on freehold land. Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their 
estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset lives 
are as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
 Building installations 20 years or lease period if less
 Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years
 Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
 Business systems software 4 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may not be recoverable.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there 
is an indication that an asset may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least annually. 
When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the 
expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its 
recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised 
in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the 
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement. 
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances. 
LEASES 
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
INVENTORIES 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all costs 
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, 
including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity. 
PROVISIONS 
Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the 
obligation can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. 
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation. 
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group’s presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange differences are taken to 
the consolidated income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of 
historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Group’s operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro. On consolidation the assets and liabilities 
of the Group’s foreign operations are translated into the Group’s presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet 
date. The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates for the period. The exchange differences 
arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve. Such translation differences are 
recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of. The Group has elected to apply the exemption 
in IFRS 1 “First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” which allows the cumulative translation differences for all 
foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs, being 1 January 2003. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits which usually have 
an original maturity of three months or less. For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents 
consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount. 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
91
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held 
by the Group are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings. 
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments. 
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are 
subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The Group has not adopted the 
hedge accounting rules. Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. 
RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined 
contribution in nature. For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the employers’ contributions 
paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and 
updates are performed at each balance sheet date. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the 
asset ceiling (if relevant) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability or asset 
with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognised in 
other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of plan 
amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit pension 
liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period as a result of contribution 
and benefit payments. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as:
• service cost (including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements);
• net interest expense or income; and
• re-measurement.
The Group presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable. 
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered. Revenue from maintenance 
contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are 
no significant vendor obligations remaining. It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are 
transferred to the buyer. Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Revenue from sales or usage-based royalties is recognised as the subsequent sale or usage occurs.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that 
the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another 
and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of 
hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above. Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its 
contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration. 
GOVERNMENT GRANTS 
A government grant is recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be 
received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to it. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred 
are recognised as other operating income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred. Grants that 
compensate the Group for the acquisition of an asset are presented by deducting them from the acquisition cost of the related asset 
in accordance with IAS 20.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
92
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid 
in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
The Group operates various equity-settled share-based compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with 
a corresponding change in equity. The fair value is measured using the Hull-White trinomial model by reference to the share price, 
and taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, excluding non-market vesting conditions, at the date the awards 
were granted. The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, due to 
achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions. Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition or 
non-vesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition has been satisfied. 
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares in the Group held by the 
employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
TAX
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement 
except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (taxable temporary differences only) or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss; 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
DIVIDENDS PAID
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is 
approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS
The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual 
results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions 
and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below. 
Business combinations and goodwill
The fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on a number of assumptions and judgements by 
management. In establishing the fair value of intangible assets recognised at acquisition and their estimated useful lives the Group 
considers each entity acquired. Valuation estimates are used to determine the fair values of intangible assets and this includes 
estimation of future cash flows, weighted average cost of capital, external royalty rates and useful lives. 
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”) 
that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors 
goodwill. There have been changes in the identification of CGUs in the year which are disclosed in note 14.
The Group tests annually by CGU whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate 
that the current carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts of CGUs have been determined based on value in 
use calculations which require estimates and assumptions to be made in relation to management’s expectations of growth in adjusted 
operating profit before depreciation and amortisation; long term growth rates; and appropriate discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
93
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Changing the assumptions selected by management, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used in the cash 
flow projections, could significantly affect the Group’s impairment evaluation and hence reported assets and profits and losses. 
Further details, including sensitivity analysis, is included in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.
Defined benefit pension plans
The pension cost and the defined benefit pension obligation of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans are based on a number 
of selected assumptions; these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth and longevity. Differences arising from actual 
experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods. The effect of changing these assumptions is described 
in note 10.
Revenue recognition
For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the 
commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being 
provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component. Management exercises 
a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised 
and the fair values allocated to each element. The fair values determined and allocated to each element may impact the timing of 
revenue recognition and the determination of fair values can involve complex judgements. The Group generally determines the fair 
value of individual elements based on prices at which the deliverable is regularly sold on a standalone basis after considering customer 
discounts where appropriate.
Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision 
for income taxes. There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain. For example liabilities are recognised 
for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known 
at the time the financial statements are prepared. Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the 
differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Recognition of deferred tax assets
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is more likely than not that there will be sufficient and suitable taxable profits in 
the relevant legal entity or tax group against which to utilise the assets in the future. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised 
is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management. A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different 
recognition outcome. Judgement is required when determining probable future taxable profits, which are estimated using the latest available 
profit forecasts. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are disclosed in note 23.
Provisions
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. The Group exercises 
judgement in recognising provisions. Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a liability will arise and to quantify the 
possible amount of any financial settlement. The inherent uncertainty of such matters means that actual amounts of transactions may 
differ materially from estimates provided. Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the actual amount is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT APPLIED
The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of these 
financial statements:

4. OPERATING SEGMENTS
The Group’s organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information 
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis. The Group’s 
operating segments follow this structure.
The Group’s reportable operating segments are Networks & Applications, Wireless & Service Experience and Service Assurance. 
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset amortisation 
and impairment, goodwill impairment and share-based payment. Finance income, finance costs and share of results of associated 
companies are not allocated to the reportable segments. Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported 
and not allocated to the reportable segments. 
Information on segment assets and segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Group’s Chief Executive Officer and is therefore not 
disclosed below.
The principal activities of each of the reportable operating segments are as follows:
• Networks & Applications develops innovative solutions for functional, performance and security testing of next-generation networks 
and applications that simulate real-world conditions in the lab, before a commercial launch and in the live network.
• Wireless & Service Experience develops solutions for functional and performance testing of 4G LTE and 3G mobile devices and 
services and satellite positioning devices, as well as products and services for assessing the service experience on live networks.
• Service Assurance provides solutions to enable service providers to turn-up new services and diagnose and troubleshoot network and 
customer issues, as well as systems for mobile device management, device analytics and intelligence solutions for mobile operators.
With effect from 1 January 2016 the following changes will be made to the operating segments:
• The Service Experience line of business will be combined with the core Service Assurance business and reclassified from  
Wireless & Service Experience to Service Assurance, following this change the operating segments will be renamed as follows: 
- The Wireless & Service Experience operating segment with be renamed Wireless & Positioning. 
- The enlarged Service Assurance operating segment will continue to be named Service Assurance. 
• The Testing Technologies line of business, acquired in February 2014, will be integrated into the Networks & Applications business 
and reclassified from Wireless & Service Experience to Networks & Applications.
The above changes reflect how these lines of business were organised and managed towards the end of the year with internal reporting 
changed with effect from 1 January 2016.

In 2015, as a result of changes in the wireless device test and carrier acceptance market Spirent undertook targeted cost reduction 
actions in order to protect profitability. The most significant action taken was to outsource engineering services in the Wireless & 
Service Experience operating segment to provide a more cost effective and flexible resource for the future. The cost reduction actions 
comprised employee severance of $6.9 million, accelerated amortisation charged on property, plant and equipment of $3.7 million, 
outsourcing fees of $1.7 million, lease provision on vacant space of $0.5 million and other costs of $0.3 million. Exceptional items 
charged in 2015 are net of provision releases of $0.6 million from 2014.
In 2014, following dynamic changes in Spirent’s markets and the need to ensure the Group was investing in the right areas to maximise 
its potential, Spirent undertook a series of steps to reallocate resources in its worldwide operations.
The tax effect of exceptional items is a credit of $4.2 million (2014 $1.2 million). The total cash outflow in respect of exceptional items 
charged in 2015 is anticipated to be $8.8 million with $1.8 million actually paid in the year (2014 $3.3 million).

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS
i) Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans
The Group sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & 
Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). These plans 
are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Both schemes are administered by a trustee board 
which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. The trustee board 
operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
• The Staff Plan is the Group’s most significant plan, and it provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary 
and length of service. The Staff Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2002.
• The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits (“Old Section”) 
that have been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19. Members who left service before 1992 
are entitled to a cash lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service. Members of the Old Section 
are entitled to defined contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service.
There is also a United Kingdom unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Group to top up certain former 
employees’ benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Group ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the 
defined benefit plans. These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the risks of members living longer 
than expected.
The plans hold a significant proportion of their assets in equity. Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Group’s 
future cash contributions (and vice versa).
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2016 are $7.6 million. This includes the contributions agreed with the funded 
plans’ trustees in accordance with UK legislation. Following the triennial valuations as at 1 April 2012, the Group has agreed to pay 
the following contributions in order to clear the funding deficit as assessed by the trustees’ independent actuary.
• Staff Plan: $3.9 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2019, plus a further contribution of up to $3.7 million by July 2016  
if the plan remains in deficit.
• Cash Plan: $0.3 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2015.
The latest triennial valuations, as at 1 April 2015, are in the process of being finalised.

%
2014
%
Inflation – RPI 2.9 2.9
Inflation – CPI 1.8 1.8
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.0

Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.8 3.6
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 10. PENSIONS CONTINUED
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are 
such that a member currently aged 65 (2014 aged 65) will live on average for a further 23.6 years (2014 23.5 years) if they are male and 
for a further 25.8 years (2014 25.7 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2035 (2014 in 2034) at age 65 (2014 age 65) the 
assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.5 years (2014 24.4 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 
26.9 years (2014 26.8 years) after retirement if they are female. 
iii) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: 
• Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by $3.8 million (2014 $4.1 million).
• Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by $1.3 million (2014 $1.7 million).
• Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by $11.0 million (2014 $11.7 million).
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.
The sensitivity figures have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation for each assumption change in 
isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date and may not be representative of the actual 
change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years (2014 15 years).
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
United Kingdom 
The Group maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees in the United Kingdom. Employer contributions into these plans 
for 2015 were $1.0 million (2014 $1.2 million). 
United States 
The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries. This plan, also known as 
a 401(k) Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement. The investment choices offered by the plan are 
a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk. In aggregate, 
the Group’s contributions to the US plan totalled $4.2 million for 2015 (2014 $3.7 million). Total assets in the defined contribution plan 
at the end of 2015 were $221.8 million (2014 $222.5 million). There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2015 or 2014.
Other jurisdictions 
Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with 
approved local practice and regulations. These arrangements are defined contribution plans. Total employer contributions for 2015 in 
respect of these plans amounted to $1.3 million (2014 $1.2 million).
Total employer contributions to defined contribution plans were $6.5 million (2014 $6.1 million).

AMORTISATION AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  
Goodwill is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The Group identifies CGUs at the lowest level at which cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 14. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
Goodwill has been allocated to seven CGUs as follows: 
2015
 $ million
2014 
$ million
Networks & Applications, an operating segment 85.3 85.0
Wireless & Positioning, product lines within the Wireless & Service Experience operating segment 56.2 51.5
Service Experience & Service Assurance Broadband, product lines within the Wireless & Service Experience 
 and Service Assurance operating segments 30.9 30.9

Customer Experience Management, a product line within the Service Assurance operating segment 23.8 23.8
Device Intelligence, a product line within the Service Assurance operating segment 6.1 10.9
Epitiro Group Limited, a product line within the Service Assurance operating segment 1.3 –
216.9 223.2
The Testing Technologies product line is no longer a separate CGU because following its integration into the Networks & Applications 
operating segment separately identifiable cash flows are no longer available. 
The Service Experience product line has been combined with the Service Assurance Broadband line of business and therefore is no 
longer a separate CGU as separately identifiable cash flows are no longer available.
$5.7 million of goodwill has been reallocated from the Developer Tools CGU to the Wireless & Positioning CGU on the basis of the 
relative fair values at the date of transition following the integration of a specific technology into the Wireless product portfolio.
ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST
Spirent engaged an external professional firm to perform an independent valuation of the CGUs on a value in use basis as at 30 
November 2015 (annual impairment testing date). The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations were: 
• revenue growth rates; 
• gross margin; 
• operating expenses; 
• discount rate; and 
• growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five-year period covered by management’s projections.
The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the Group’s 
three-year strategic plan. Cash flows for years four and five are then extrapolated based on long range plans. Cash flows in subsequent 
years have been extrapolated using a steady 2.5 per cent for all CGUs (2014 2.0 per cent for Developer Tools and 2.75 per cent for 
all other CGUs), which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which these 
units operate. Fundamentally this long term growth is based on a proxy for global long term inflation taking into consideration more 
developed and developing markets. The growth rates used in the value in use calculations are set at the same level for each CGU as all 
the CGUs operate within similar markets which share the same growth drivers and characteristics. The discount rates incorporate the 
specific risks relating to each CGU.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies by taking the risk 
free rate for 30-year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities. In making this 
adjustment, the inputs required are the equity market risk premium, beta, and the risk adjustment applied to reflect the systematic risk 
of Spirent and the specific CGUs, taking into account factors such as size and the territories in which each CGU operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using the following pre-tax discount rates:
2015
%
2014
%
Networks & Applications 14.8 14.3
Wireless & Positioning 14.9 14.5
Service Experience & Service Assurance Broadband 17.1 17.1

Device Intelligence 16.1 16.0
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
106
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 14. INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED
For Spirent the key factor in the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue. All CGUs operate in the data technology market 
and generate a high gross profit (gross margin); consequently changes in revenue can have a significant impact on the operating profit 
and cash flows. Revenue growth rates used in the projections are based on management’s estimate of growth in the markets served 
and take into account historic levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology, industry forecasts and 
macro-economic conditions in the territories in which the CGUs operate. Gross margin and operating expenses are based on historical 
values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth, recent acquisitions and cost reduction actions committed prior to year end. 
Networks & Applications and Customer Experience Management product line revenues are expected to continue to grow driven by 
demand for high speed Ethernet, cloud and virtualisation, mobility infrastructure and application security product offerings, and in the 
case of Customer Experience Management, the roll-out of the InTouch CNA platform. The Wireless product line has experienced a 
decline in revenues and profit due to a change in demand for smartphone development and validation testing. As such, the forecasts 
have been downgraded compared to the prior year and cost reduction actions have been implemented. In the mid term the benefit from 
new opportunities presented by IoT connectivity begins to deliver incremental revenue and profit. The Positioning product line revenue 
is expected to experience continued steady growth in existing core markets with incremental growth from addressing GNSS 
vulnerabilities. Management expects that Service Experience & Service Assurance Broadband revenue will decrease in 2016 due to the 
fact that significant one off revenue from 2015 will not repeat. Driven by new ecosystem opportunities, Service Experience & Service 
Assurance Broadband revenue is expected to increase in 2017 and 2018 and margins are expected to improve due to operational 
leverage combined with continued costs management.
The recoverable amount of each CGU was calculated on a value in use basis and was in excess of its carrying value for every CGU, 
except Device Intelligence, a product line within the Service Assurance operating segment. Consequently, an impairment loss of 
$3.8 million has been recognised for the Device Intelligence CGU and relates solely to goodwill. No impairment loss was recognised for 
the other CGUs. The impairment charge was driven by lower projected cash flows within the Device Intelligence business plan resulting 
in our reassessment of expected future business performance in the light of current trading and economic conditions. The impairment 
loss has been recognised in the consolidated income statement within administration expenses. As the Networks & Applications CGU 
satisfied the carry forward criteria as per IAS 36, no detailed value in use calculation was undertaken for this CGU.
The acquisition of Epitiro Group Limited was completed just prior to the year end and therefore the amount paid is provisionally considered 
to be reflective of the CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal. As such, no impairment testing was completed for the Epitiro CGU.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions 
The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used, in isolation, would cause the value 
in use of the Networks & Applications, Wireless & Positioning, Service Experience & Service Assurance Broadband and Customer 
Experience Management CGUs to fall below carrying value.
The headroom on the Developer Tools CGU was $2.2 million.
The Developer Tools CGU offers a complete test suite for voice and video over IP communications, including VoLTE. The forecasts 
have been updated to reflect changes in the CGU’s operating and reporting structure, as well as developing changes in product mix 
and related development strategy. Existing revenue streams are expected to benefit from prior investment and the development of 
new channels as well as growth in the markets served and there is expected to be revenue growth as a result of the IoT initiative. 
Trading margins are expected to improve due to changes in revenue streams that do not require significant incremental costs.
Sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions has indicated that for the Developer Tools CGU, the following changes in assumptions, 
in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value:
Year ended 31 December 2015

Long term growth rate No reasonable change 
Discount rate 1.4 percentage point increase to 15.6%
Note
1 Cumulative effect of a decrease in revenue in year one and continuing to apply the forecast growth rates to subsequent years.
The Device Intelligence CGU is a mobile device management business, which sells mobile carriers a system that helps smartphone 
subscribers optimally connect onto data networks. The business has not delivered on the expected forecasts outlined at acquisition  
as a result of difficult trading conditions and changes in markets and consequently the forecasts for the core business have been 
revised down. The business is expected to benefit from the MVNO element of revenue and growth from IoT.
The estimated recoverable amount of the Device Intelligence CGU, after the $3.8 million impairment loss, is equal to its carrying value of 
$10.5 million. Consequently, any adverse change in key assumptions would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.

Intangible asset impairment
Year ended 31 December 2015
There was no impairment loss in respect of the other intangible assets.
Year ended 31 December 2014
An intangible asset impairment charge of $1.0 million was incurred in respect of the R&D asset arising on the acquisition of NetGend. 
The asset had been acquired at a pre-production stage and, although the intention was to use this technology to enhance Spirent’s 
solutions, the extent and the means by which this would be achieved had not been determined at 31 December 2014, resulting in an 
impairment charge. Following this impairment the recoverable amount of NetGend was nil.
The impairment charge was expensed to administrative expenses in the income statement.

In relation to the acquisition of Testing Technologies IST GmbH in 2014 the minority stake of 42 per cent of the share capital is the 
subject of a put and call option which expires on 31 March 2016. The consideration is based on the 2015 revenue performance of  
Testing Tech and set at a minimum amount of Euro 1.4 million. The option was exercised in January 2016 which triggered payment  
of the minimum amount with the balance to be paid following agreement of 2015 revenue.
A financial liability of Euro 2.4 million ($2.6 million) has been recorded to reflect the fair value of the exercise price of the option, 
measured at recurring fair value through profit and loss and considered to be categorised within level 3 as no observable market  
data is available. 
The fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest has been measured using discounted cash flows with inputs derived 
from the actual financial performance in accordance with the agreement.

The lease provisions are for the continuing obligations under leases in respect of properties which have been vacated by the Group and 
property dilapidation and restoration provisions. Where material, lease obligations are discounted. The Group expects these provisions 
to be utilised over one to eight years.
Restructuring provisions relate to severance costs and outsourcing fees which are expected to be utilised within one year.
Other provisions are mainly environmental provisions related to property disposed of. The Group expects these provisions to be utilised 
in less than one year.
27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions, is to fund the 
Group’s liquidity requirements.
All of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables and these are shown in the following table:

The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Group’s foreign 
currency exposures when deemed appropriate. These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value; however, the fair 
values at 31 December 2015 and 2014 were immaterial to these accounts.
The key objective of the Group’s treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient 
liquidity is available to the Group. All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework. The Board has approved treasury 
policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities. Additionally, it is the Group’s policy that speculative treasury 
transactions are expressly forbidden.
A) MARKET RISK
The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk 
The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group’s excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on-demand or short term 
bank deposits. It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Group’s financial 
instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

Cash at bank and in hand 97.0 94.8
Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument. All fixed rate deposits mature 
within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
Interest receivable for the year was $0.4 million (note 7) (2014 $0.4 million) and is under the effective interest method. 
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are non-interest bearing and are therefore not 
subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2015 would increase or reduce interest 
income and equity by $0.1 million (2014 $0.2 million).
Exchange rate risk 
Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the 
operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars. 
The Company’s functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling; the Group also has operations  
in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in 
relation to the US dollar. The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net 
assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. 
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters using forward foreign currency exchange contracts. 
The main exposures arise in relation to US dollar receivables and cash balances held by non-US operations. Group treasury, by means 
of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out transaction hedging. A 10 per cent appreciation or depreciation of sterling 
and euro against the US dollar would increase or reduce profit before tax by $1.2 million (2014 $1.1 million) based on the balance at the 
reporting dates.
B) CREDIT RISK 
Investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board with pre-approved limits set for each bank to avoid any 
concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal  
to the carrying value of $102.0 million (2014 $99.8 million).
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable amounts 
where appropriate. Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise. Allowance is made for bad and doubtful 
debts based on management’s assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
114
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large 
number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue. The maximum credit exposure 
at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $111.1 million (2014 $107.8 million). 
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows:  
2015 
$ million
2014 
$ million
Neither impaired nor past due 68.5 68.2
Past due but not impaired:
 Less than 30 days overdue 20.7 20.5
 30 to 60 days 10.8 7.9
 Over 60 days 11.1 11.2
Trade receivables 111.1 107.8
The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and reviews of payment history 
and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits. Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those 
receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk. 
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 20. The value of impaired trade receivables is $1.4 million 
(2014 $1.1 million). For all other financial assets the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
C) LIQUIDITY RISK 
The Group’s objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements. Its operations are 
financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations. 
At 31 December 2015 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $102.0 million (2014 $99.8 million) of which $97.0 million 
(2014 $94.8 million) is available on demand and $5.0 million matures within three months (2014 $5.0 million matures within three months).
During 2015 the Group generated $60.4 million of cash from operating activities (2014 $41.7 million) and considers that with current cash 
resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within three months. The gross settlement 
amounts of these contracts are as follows:
2015 
$ million
2014 
$ million
Sale of US dollars against sterling 4.4 6.3
The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable. Financial liabilities are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all 
due to be settled within one year, and provisions (note 26). In addition, the Group has a liability in respect of a put and call option with 
a fair value of $2.6 million (2014 $2.7 million) which will be settled in 2016 (see note 25).
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
D) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value although the amounts at 31 December 2015 and 2014 were immaterial.
E) CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value. The Group’s 
capital is its total shareholders’ funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions. During 2014 
the Company operated an on market share repurchase programme and repurchased 9.7 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of 
$15.6 million. No share buybacks were transacted during 2015 and no further share buybacks are currently planned.
Spirent’s policy on the payment of dividends to shareholders is to maintain a sustainable dividend.

During 2015 and 2014 no Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Sharesave Trust (“SST”) to satisfy options exercised 
under the UK all employee share schemes and in 2015 0.1 million Ordinary Shares were transferred from the Spirent Employee Share 
Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) to satisfy options exercised under the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan and 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 
(2014 0.2 million Ordinary Shares). 
B) EQUITY AND RESERVES
The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:
• Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value;
• Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation;
• Other reserves: share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates 
of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves; and 
• Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements 
of foreign subsidiaries.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares
At 31 December 2015, the ESOT held 0.6 million Ordinary Shares (2014 0.7 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards under various share 
incentive plans. At 31 December 2015, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares (2014 0.5 million Ordinary Shares) to satisfy awards 
made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme. The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, 
being in total 1.1 million Ordinary Shares (2014 1.2 million Ordinary Shares), at 31 December 2015 was $1.2 million (2014 $1.4 million).
Capital redemption reserve
During 2014 the Company cancelled 9.7 million Ordinary Shares that had been the subject of the on market share repurchase 
programme, and transferred $0.5 million to the capital redemption reserve. No Ordinary Shares were cancelled in 2015.
Share repurchase
During 2014 the Company repurchased 9.7 million Ordinary Shares on market at a cost of $15.6 million which were subsequently 
cancelled. No Ordinary Shares were repurchased in 2015.

DISCRETIONARY PLANS
SPIRENT LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”)
The LTIP will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2016 AGM.
The LTIP will be available for selected employees, including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Full details of how the LTIP will be operated are available in the Report on directors’ remuneration and in the Notice of 2016 AGM.
2005 EMPLOYEE INCENTIVE PLAN (“EIP”)
The EIP will close for new awards following the 2016 AGM and will be replaced by the Spirent Long-term Incentive Plan.
The EIP, which was approved by shareholders and introduced in 2005, was available for selected employees, including executive 
directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company was able to grant share options, including HMRC-approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights 
(“SARs”) and Performance Shares. No price was payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have 
been met. For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”). For Performance 
Share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). For awards made since 2011, 
performance conditions relate to the Company’s EPS and TSR.
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 30. EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS CONTINUED  
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors’ remuneration.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or 
been exercised.
SPIRENT STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (“SSIP”)
The SSIP was introduced in 2000. This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by 
reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local 
market practice. Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis. Under the SSIP,  
the Company was able to grant share options and share settled SARs. At 31 December 2015 there are no remaining outstanding SSIP 
awards and the plan has therefore been closed.
ALL EMPLOYEE PLANS
UK EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN (“UK ESPP”)
The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC-approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2015 and is available to all 
UK employees. The UK ESPP offers four ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares, matching 
shares and dividend shares. The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using 
deductions from payroll.
US EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (“US ESPP”)
The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.  
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions 
from payroll. In November 2010, the Company commenced making six-monthly invitations to employees.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company using the 
proceeds of a savings contract. If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month contract 
to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month. No grants of this nature have been made 
since 2003.
GLOBAL ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE PLAN (“GAESPP”)
The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.  
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the US or UK to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company  
on market using deductions from payroll. In September 2011, the first such invitation was made to all employees in Canada, Hong Kong,  
France and Germany and subsequent invitations have been made on a six-monthly basis since 2012.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save  
up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit. No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.

payment charge and the fair value:

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 31. SHARE ‑BASED PAYMENT CONTINUED  
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two years 
which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The risk free rate is calculated 
by reference to UK government bonds.

33. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The following acquisition was completed in 2015. 
EPITIRO GROUP LIMITED (“EGL”)
On 16 November 2015, Spirent completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the share capital of Epitiro Group Limited, a company  
based in Cardiff, Wales, for an initial cash consideration of $1.7 million. Contingent consideration of up to $0.3 million is payable based 
on future bookings during the 12 month period following completion and also on the achievement of certain product development 
targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration has been estimated at $0.3 million. The product development milestone was 
met in December 2015 and $0.1 million of contingent consideration was paid in January 2016. Epitiro develops active Wi-Fi testing 
solutions for leading internet service providers, carriers and enterprises. Epitiro is reported within the Group’s Service Assurance division.
The carrier Wi-Fi market has strong growth enabled by technology innovation and strong customer demands. The recent growth has 
been largely driven by an explosion in demand from mobile operators using Wi-Fi to augment their 3G and 4G deployment and offload a 
portion of mobile data traffic to unlicensed spectrum. The acquisition of Epitiro will enable Spirent to fill a critical niche in our end-to-end 
service assurance strategy and better position our TestCenter Live product family. 
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2015, Epitiro did not contribute any revenue and contributed $0.2 million of loss before  
tax to the results of the Group before charging $0.1 million of acquisition related costs. If the combination had occurred at the beginning 
of the financial year revenue of $0.9 million and a loss before tax of $0.5 million would have been included in the Group result before 
charging $0.1 million of acquired intangible asset amortisation and $0.1 million of acquisition related costs.
The goodwill arising of $1.3 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of the 
entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place. The goodwill is not expected  
to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Notes to the parent Company financial statements
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework (“FRS101”). 
In these financial statements, the Company has adopted FRS101 for the first time.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply 
with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS101 disclosure exemptions have been taken. 
In the transition to FRS101, the Company has applied IFRS 1 whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance  
with FRS101. An explanation of how the transition to FRS101 has affected the reported financial position, financial performance and  
cash flows of the Company is provided in note 17.
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The following exemptions have 
been taken in these financial statements:
• Business combinations – business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2014 have not been restated.
• Share-based payments – IFRS 2 is being applied to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and that had not 
vested by 1 January 2014.  
• Use of previous GAAP carrying amounts as at date of transition as a deemed cost for investment in subsidiaries.  
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• A Cash Flow Statement and related notes;  
• Comparative period reconciliations for share capital, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets; 
• Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries; 
• Disclosures in respect of capital management; 
• The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; 
• Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; and
• Not presenting a transition balance sheet as primary statement and related notes. 
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS101 
available in respect of the following disclosures: 
• IFRS 2 in respect of Group settled share based payments;
• Certain disclosures required by IAS 36 in respect of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets; and
• The disclosures required by IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 regarding financial instrument disclosures have not been provided apart from  
those which are relevant for the financial instruments which are held at fair value. 
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a 
separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. Information on fees for non-audit services in 
respect of the parent Company accounts have not been disclosed as the Company prepares Group accounts which disclose information 
on fees for non-audit services on a consolidated basis.
ACCOUNTING CONVENTION
The financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis apart from certain financial instruments that have been measured  
at fair value.
GOING CONCERN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
The directors have reviewed the detailed financial projections for a period of 12 months from the date of this report and the business 
plans for the 2017 and 2018 financial years. They have also considered the principal risks and uncertainties that the Company faces and 
its current financial position and are satisfied that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report. Accordingly, the going concern basis of 
accounting continues to be used in the preparation of the financial statements.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND GOODWILL 
Acquisitions prior to 1 January 2014 
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs in the transition period. The Company elected not to 
restate business combinations that took place prior to 1 January 2014. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2014, goodwill is 
included at 1 January 2014 on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly 
comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and goodwill was amortised. The Company elected not to reverse  
the amortisation of goodwill that was charged to the profit and loss account prior to 1 January 2014. 
124
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
The UK Companies Act requires goodwill to be reduced by provisions for depreciation on a systematic basis over a period chosen by 
the directors, its useful economic life. However, under IFRS 3 goodwill is not amortised. Consequently, the Company does not amortise 
goodwill, but reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever there are indicators of impairment. The Company is therefore 
invoking a ‘true and fair view override’ to overcome the prohibition on the non-amortisation of goodwill in the Companies Act. 
Had the Company amortised goodwill a period of 20 years would have been chosen as the useful life for goodwill. The profit for the year 
would have been £0.6 million lower had goodwill been amortised in the year.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the net assets acquired, 
is capitalised as an intangible asset. Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management. Where the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in 
the profit and loss account. 
TANGIBLE ASSETS
Tangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Depreciation is not provided on freehold 
land. Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated 
useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location. Usual asset lives are as follows: 
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment
 Building installations 20 years or lease period if less
 Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years
 Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years
 Business systems software 4 years
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
value may not be recoverable.
IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS 
Tangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may  
be impaired. Goodwill with an indefinite useful life is assessed at least annually. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable 
amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash flows (value in use) of the relevant 
cash-generating unit or asset and the fair value less cost of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired 
and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the profit and loss account in those expense 
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change  
in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the  
extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation 
or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Such a reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account.
INVESTMENTS
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable.
LEASES 
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
STOCKS
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence. Cost includes all costs in 
bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all 
attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is 
probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation  
can be made. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures 
expected to be required to settle the obligation.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. All exchange gains and losses are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.
Trade debtors 
Trade debtors are non-interest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
Cash and cash equivalents  
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits which usually have 
an original maturity of three months or less. There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are non-interest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount. 
Loans and borrowings
Loans and borrowings are recognised initally at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, and in respect of financial assets, less any impairment losses. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held 
by the Company are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained 
earnings. Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign 
currencies relating to firm commitments. 
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and 
are subsequently re-measured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date. The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange 
contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The Company has not 
adopted the hedge accounting rules. Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and 
loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts. 
PENSIONS
The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans. All other pension plans are defined contribution in nature where the 
amount charged to the profit and loss account is the employer’s contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and 
updates are performed at each balance sheet date. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the 
asset ceiling (if relevant) and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the balance sheet liability or asset 
with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re-measurement recognised in 
other comprehensive income will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss in the period of plan 
amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit pension 
liability or asset, taking account of any changes in the net defined benefit pension liability during the period as a result of contribution 
and benefit payments. Defined benefit pension costs are categorised as:
• Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments or settlements);
• Net interest expense or income; and 
• Re-measurement.
The Company presents the first two components of defined benefit pension costs in profit or loss.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and 
when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, revenue is only recognised 
when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
A government grant is recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be 
received and that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to it. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses 
incurred are recognised as other operating income on a systematic basis in the same periods in which expenses are incurred. Grants 
that compensate the Company for the acquisition of an asset are presented by deducting them from the acquisition cost of the related 
asset in accordance with IAS20.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid  
in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the 
subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equity-settled transactions with a corresponding 
adjustment to reserves. Any payments received from the Company’s subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments result  
in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions 
are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the 
date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet 
recognised for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated  
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the 
original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees. Shares are held by the employee 
share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
TAX
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit and loss account 
except to the extent that it relates to items in other comprehensive income or equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts 
in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
• where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill (taxable temporary differences only) or of an asset or 
liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss; 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible 
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. 
STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION
127
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
DIVIDENDS PAID
The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is 
approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported. Such 
estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual 
results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates. The areas requiring high degree of judgement or where assumptions and 
estimates are significant to the parent Company financial statements are revenue recognition, defined benefit pension plans (note 3) and 
recognition of deferred tax assets (note 10). Please refer to note 2 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 93 for 
detailed disclosures.
2. EMPLOYEES
Please refer to the Report on directors’ remuneration on pages 55 to 72 and note 34 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on page 121 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS 
i) Characteristics and risks associated with the Plans
The Company sponsors two funded defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom: the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension 
& Life Assurance Plan (“Staff Plan”) and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan (“Cash Plan”). These 
plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) tax-exempt approval. Both schemes are administered by a trustee 
board which is comprised of representatives from the employer, member nominated trustees and an independent trustee. The trustee 
board operates in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules of each Plan and acts in the interests of all of its members.
The Staff Plan is the Company’s most significant plan, and it provides its members with retirement benefits based on their final salary 
and length of service. The Staff Plan was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2002.
The Cash Plan is primarily a defined contribution arrangement, although there are some legacy defined benefits (Old Section) that have 
been valued for the purpose of these accounts in accordance with IAS 19. Members who left service before 1992 are entitled to a cash 
lump sum on retirement that is based on their salary and length of service. Members of the Old Section are entitled to defined 
contribution benefits, but with an underpin based on salary and length of service.
There is also a United Kingdom unfunded plan, which consists of a contractual obligation for the Company to top up certain former 
employees’ benefits whose salaries exceeded the statutory earnings cap.
As with the vast majority of similar arrangements in the United Kingdom, the Company ultimately underwrites the risks relating to the 
defined benefit plans. These risks include investment risks and demographic risks, such as the risks of members living longer 
than expected.
The plans hold a significant proportion of their assets in equity. Strong future equity returns would be expected to reduce the Company’s 
future cash contributions (and vice versa).
Expected contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2016 are £5.1 million. This includes the contributions agreed with the funded 
plans’ trustees in accordance with UK legislation. Following the triennial valuations as at 1 April 2012, the Company agreed to pay 
the following contributions in order to clear the funding deficit as assessed by the trustees’ independent actuary.
• Staff Plan: £2.6 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2019, plus a further contribution of up to £2.5 million by July 2016 if the 
plan remains in deficit.
• Cash Plan: £0.2 million per annum from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2015.
The latest triennial valuations, as at 1 April 2015, are in the process of being finalised.
If the contributions currently agreed are insufficient to pay the benefits due, the Company will need to make further contributions.

f) The key financial assumptions 
The assumptions used for both plans using a weighted average were as follows:
2015
%
2014 
%
Inflation – RPI 2.9 2.9
Inflation – CPI 1.8 1.8
Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.0 3.0
Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6
Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.8 2.8
Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 2.0 2.0
Rate of increase in deferred pensions 1.8 1.8
Rate used to discount plan liabilities 3.8 3.6
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are 
such that a member currently aged 65 (2014 aged 65) will live on average for a further 23.6 years (2014 23.5 years) if they are male and 
for a further 25.8 years (2014 25.7 years) if they are female. For a member who retires in 2035 (2014 in 2034) at age 65 (2014 age 65) the 
assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.5 years (2014 24.4 years) after retirement if they are male and for a further 
26.9 years (2014 26.8 years) after retirement if they are female. 
Notes to the parent Company financial statements continued
130
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 3. PENSIONS CONTINUED  
iii) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: 
• Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by £2.6 million (2014 £2.6 million)
• Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans’ liabilities by £0.9 million (2014 £1.1 million)
• Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year (by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling 
factor) would increase past service liabilities by £7.4 million (2014 £7.5 million)
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to 
be insignificant. The sensitivity figures have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation for each 
assumption change in isolation, and assuming no other changes in market conditions at the accounting date and may not be 
representative of the actual change as the changes in assumptions may not occur in isolation.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 15 years (2014 15 years).
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS
The Company maintains defined contribution pension plans for employees. Employer contributions into these plans for 2015 were 
£0.6 million (2014 £0.7 million).

The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows:
2015 
£ million
2014 
£ million
2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.1 0.2
All schemes are equity-settled.
The fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at the date of grant using the Hull-White trinomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payment charge and the fair value:
2015 2014
Weighted average share price (pence) 86.8 101.3
Weighted average exercise price (pence) 7.5 12.2
Weighted average fair value (pence) 54.2 61.8
Expected volatility (%) 41.0 34.0
Option life (years)
 Performance Shares 3.0 3.0
 Options and SARs 10.0 10.0
Suboptimal exercise factor 1.5 1.5
Risk free rate (%) 1.6-2.1 2.8
Dividend yield (%) 2.6 1.7
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous two years 
which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility. The risk free rate is calculated 
by reference to UK government bonds.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 3G (Third Generation) Third generation of mobile communications that delivers data rates of hundreds of kilobits per second  
to tens of megabits per second.
4G (Fourth Generation) Fourth generation of mobile communications that delivers data rates of tens to hundreds of megabits  
per second. Future 4G technologies promise data rates in excess of one gigabit per second.
5G (Fifth Generation) The next major phase of mobile telecommunications standards beyond the current  
4G/IMT‑ Advanced standards.
Application A software programme designed to perform a specific function for the end user which uses the services 
of the computer’s operating system and other supporting programmes. Applications include database 
programmes, spreadsheets, web browsers, graphics programmes and word processors.
Backhaul The use of networks to get data from an end user to a node in a major network such as through the 
internet or a proprietary network.
Big Data Analytics Large amounts of structured or unstructured data that has the potential to be mined for intelligence.
Cloud A variety of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers connected through a real‑ time 
communication network such as the internet. Often used in reference to network‑ based services served 
up by virtual hardware, simulated by software running on one or more physical machines.
Connected Vehicles An internet‑ connected vehicle that provides additional benefits to the user including automatic 
notification of accidents and safety alerts as well as navigation and internet‑ based applications.
Core The central part of a telecommunications network that provides various services to customers who are 
connected by the access network. Functions include routing calls and data, managing user authentication 
and billing.
Cyber Security Protects networks, computers, applications and data from attack, damage or unauthorised access.
Data Center A centralised location where computing resources critical to an organisation are maintained in a highly 
controlled environment.
Ethernet A family of networking technologies originally developed for local area networks, which migrated to  
metro area networks and eventually became the dominant standard in wireline networks worldwide.
Firewall Part of a computer system or network that is designed to block and monitor unauthorised access while 
permitting outward communication
Global Navigation Satellite 
Systems (“GNSS”)
The standard generic term for satellite navigation systems that provide autonomous geo‑ spatial 
positioning with global coverage. GNSS allows users’ receivers to determine their location to within  
a few metres by employing a triangulation technique that uses information from multiple satellites.
Global Positioning System 
(“GPS”)
A global navigation satellite system operated by the United States government for determining a user’s 
location and height at any point on the earth’s surface. A receiver uses minute differences in measured 
time signals from clocks on satellites to calculate these positions and altitudes.
Internet of Things (“IoT”) A network of physical objects or “things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors and connectivity 
to enable data exchange with the manufacturer, operator and/or other connected devices. Each thing is 
uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system but is able to interoperate within existing 
internet infrastructure.
Internet Protocol (“IP”) The primary network protocol used on the internet and on other network devices to facilitate and control 
the flow of data.
Internet Protocol Multimedia 
Subsystem (“IMS”)
A standardised next‑ generation architecture for telecoms operators who want to provide mobile and  
fixed multimedia services.
Lanes Parallel electrical paths that handle the flow of data in high speed Ethernet applications, due to the 
inability of the interfaces in devices such as routers and switches to handle a single high speed data 
stream; for example, 10 lanes of 10 gigabits per second data in place of a single 100 gigabits per second 
data stream.
Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) An advanced wireless data communications technology standard (sometimes called “4G”) which  
is an evolution of 3G UMTS standards. In addition to a new wireless interface specification, LTE uses  
a simplified flat IP‑ based network architecture.
Machine‑ to‑ Machine  
(“M2M”)
A technology that enables automated wireless (or wired) communication between mechanical or 
electronic devices.

Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2015 Mobile Virtual Network 
Operator (“MVNO”)
A wireless communications services provider that does not own the wireless network infrastructure  
over which it provides services to its customers.
Network Functions 
Virtualisation (“NFV”)
An initiative to provide a new network production environment which lowers cost, raises efficiency and 
increases agility by hosting network functions previously carried out by proprietary, dedicated hardware 
on virtual machines running on industry‑ standard commodity hardware.
Rich Communication Suite 
(“RCS”)
Also known as Rich Communication Services, RCS is a platform intended to enable mobile network 
operators to deliver integrated communication services, beyond voice and SMS, over all‑ IP networks, 
including instant messaging or chat, live video and file sharing, across any device on any network.
Software as a Service  
(“SaaS”)
A way of delivering applications over the internet as a service instead of installing and 
maintaining software.
Software‑ Defined Network 
(“SDN”)
An approach to networking in which control is decoupled from hardware and given to a software 
application called a controller.
Virtual Customer Premises 
Equipment (“vCPE)
By leveraging NFV and vCPE, providers can rapidly introduce new services without deploying new 
hardware at customer locations. vCPE can also improve remote management capabilities and reduce 
operations costs.
Virtual Evolved Packet Core 
(“vEPC”)
A framework for providing virtualised converged voice and data on a 4G LTE network.
Virtualisation Technologies designed to provide a layer of abstraction from the physical characteristics of 
computing resources to simplify the way in which other systems, applications, or end users interact 
with those resources.
Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”) A standards‑ based scheme adopted by the GSMA, the cellular industry’s association, to provide voice 
service over data‑ only LTE networks. VoLTE’s use of an IP Media Subsystem enables voice to be offered 
as part of a rich communications solution, integrated with services such as messaging, live video sharing 
and file transfer.
Voice over Wi‑ Fi (“VoWi‑ Fi”) Transmission of IP‑ based voice communication (“VoIP”) over a Wi‑ Fi network.
Wi‑ Fi A mechanism that enables devices such as personal computers, video game consoles, smartphones  
or digital audio players to exchange data wirelessly over a computer network and connect to network 
resources, such as the internet. Coverage ranges from a few rooms to several square miles, depending  
on the number of access points used.
Wi‑ Fi Offload A technique that helps operators manage mobile data growth by seamlessly offloading subscriber traffic 
from their primary 3G and 4G networks to Wi‑ Fi networks.
Wi‑ Fi RF Interface The radio‑ frequency portion of a circuit between the cellular phone and the active base station, in this 
case a Wi‑ Fi access point as opposed to cellular.

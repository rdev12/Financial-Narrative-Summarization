At a glance
Ashley House plc designs 
and project manages the
construction of Primary Care
infrastructure for the NHS.
These buildings typically
comprise doctors’ surgeries
and medical centres often
with pharmacies on the 
same site.
The business has been established for some 
14 years and has been involved in over 200
Primary Care schemes in the UK. 
Ashley House has a healthy pipeline of schemes
currently under construction, schemes with
planning consent due on-site in the near future 
and schemes with planning applications submitted.
Ashley House Properties is a property investment
company which owns and develops Primary Care
buildings, leased to NHS Primary Care Trusts,
doctors and pharmacists.
Ashley House Properties owns a portfolio 
of properties which are complete and income
producing. A further number are on-site under
construction and others with planning consent
due to commence construction. All these new
projects have end users in place with agreed rental
levels. The total approximate gross asset value 
of £50 million is based on annual rents of some 
£3.5 million. Further schemes are being added 
to the portfolio constantly.
This document comprises the reports and
accounts for two companies, Ashley House plc 
and Ashley House Properties Ltd (with a
resolution to become a plc). These are separate
companies but by virtue of a stapled share
structure, have identical shareholders and 
only one trading facility.

1 23 The establishment of Ashley House Properties Ltd
in September 2004 as a separate company but with
its shares stapled to those of Ashley House plc 
was a significant step. Now shareholders in both
companies have an interest in an earnings driven
company in Ashley House plc and an asset based
company in Ashley House Properties Ltd. Ashley
House Properties Ltd’s annual report is enclosed
with this report so its initial progress is detailed
there separately.
Outlook and move to AIM
The fundraising relating to Ashley House Properties
Ltd’s acquisition of Medical Properties Ltd has
resulted in many new shareholders joining the
register of both companies and I welcome you all 
at a time when Ashley House is moving forward
well and has, we believe, a bright future. It is the
board’s intention to seek an AIM introduction for 
the company’s shares in the next 12 months and 
we shall communicate further with shareholders
once the specifics are clarified in this respect.
Ashley House is better positioned now in terms of
its balance sheet, pipeline of business and the team
to deliver than at any time in the last few years. I
would like to thank all the staff for their hard work,
support and commitment since it has been a team
effort in turning the business round.

Results & financial
The year to 30 April 2005 has been a progressive
one for Ashley House plc. Results show a return to
profitability with £716,000 post tax profit achieved
(2004: £466,000 loss) on turnover up 37% to £12.6
million (2004: £9.2 million). Earnings per share were
5.7p (2004: loss per share of 4.07p). At this time the
board does not intend to pay a dividend, but this
will be reviewed with a view to returning to
payment of dividends when appropriate.
These profits and the conversion of £925,000
convertible loan into equity in April 2005, have
transformed the balance sheet to a net assets
position of £2.5 million (April 2004: £781,000) 
with gearing reduced to 38% (2004: 250%). 
The business and Ashley House Properties
It should be noted that Ashley House plc does not
own the property assets it is involved in designing
and building, so whilst the strengthening of the
balance sheet is welcome and important, the value
of this business lies in its ability to generate
consistent and increasing profits. Income is mainly
derived from designing and building Primary Care
infrastructure for the NHS.
Other income streams from related fields such as 
the supply of mobile temporary accommodation and
exploiting opportunities represented by pharmacies
are being developed but with a clear focus in
relation to the business’ core market and skills.
Property and asset management income should be
materially higher in years to come given the close
relationship with Ashley House Properties Ltd,
whose portfolio Ashley House plc manages. With
rapid growth in that portfolio anticipated over the
coming year from schemes currently being built,
this income stream should continue to grow in line.

Officers’
statement
We look forward to the
coming year with confidence
based on the number of
schemes on site and in our
ability to manage the process.
The business
The design, project management and construction
business has seen more schemes move onto site
during the year under review, particularly in the
latter part. We are pleased to have completed
schemes in Bletchley, Braintree, Chellaston,
Edgware, Elvington, Haverhill, Oxford and 
Market Lavington during the last financial year. 
National coverage
The value of 15 years experience in over 200
schemes should not be underestimated. The
upgrading of the primary care estate has continuing
funding support from central government, and even
less political risk following the general election.
Our regional offices in Wales, the North East and 
East Anglia and the team based at head office in
the South East have proved vital in maintaining
excellent relations with various interested parties
involved in new primary care schemes including 
the doctors, the Primary Care Trusts, Planning
Authorities and other parts of local government. 
It is our team’ s experience and knowledge of such
schemes which is our greatest asset. We are
looking to strengthen our regional presence in 
the North of England where we already have a
number of actual and potential schemes.
The nature of the new schemes has also seen a
positive progression with more substantial schemes
coming through. A healthy number of schemes also
achieved planning consent and since by that stage
they all have funding agreed in principle with the
Primary Care Trusts, the outlook is positive for 
the immediate future of the business.
Margins
We have a keen eye on the margins at all times 
and are pleased that during the year in question 
we managed to maintain an acceptable level
notwithstanding the significant increase in
turnover. Anticipating continued growth in turnover
in the coming year, we are managing our growth
with close attention to the cost base, benefiting
from economies of scale as the business grows.
LIFT
Looking longer term we intend to participate in 
the next wave of NHS LIFT (Local Improvement
Finance Trust) bids in conjunction with partners. 
If we are successful, a participation in a LIFTCo
gives a long-term contract to deliver Primary Care
Schemes in a particular region. Our business
outside LIFT continues to thrive and it is clear that
LIFT will only cover certain areas of the country.
Conclusion
Sourcing new schemes is a function of excellence
of performance resulting in recommendations, in
conjunction with hard work and creative problem
solving for our end-users, namely the doctors 
and Primary Care Trusts. We look forward to the
coming year with confidence based on the number
of schemes on site and in our ability to manage 
the process.

Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing forecasts, the directors have, at the time of approving the financial
statements, concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these
financial statements.
Application of principles
Directors
The group supports the concept of an effective board, leading and controlling the group. The board is responsible
for approving group policy and strategy. It meets regularly and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to
it for decision. Management supplies the board with appropriate and timely information and the directors are free
to seek any further information that they consider necessary. All directors have access to advice from the
Company Secretary and independent professionals at the group’s expense. 
Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements
Company law in the United Kingdom requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year,
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the group and of the profit or loss of the
group for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
n select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently
n make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
n state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of the Company and group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply
with the Companies Act 1985, for safeguarding assets of the group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors are also responsible for the preparation of the directors’
report and other information in the annual report.
The board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the group maintains systems of internal control to provide 
it with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial information used within the business and for
publication and that assets are safeguarded. 
Remuneration policy
The group’s policy on executive directors’ remuneration is to:
n attract and retain high quality executives by paying competitive remuneration packages relevant to each director’ s
role, experience and the external market. The packages include contribution to private medical insurance
n give incentive to directors to maximise shareholder value through annual bonus schemes
Service agreements
No director has a service agreement with a notice period that exceeds three months.

creditors at the year-end amount to 53 days of average supplies for the year.

Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the
historical cost convention, with the exception of the revaluation of land and buildings. 
The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below. The policies have remained unchanged from the
previous year. 
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings. Profits or
losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. All of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities that existed
at the date of acquisition were recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Turnover
Turnover is the total of amounts for goods supplied and services provided, excluding value added tax.
In the case of long term contracts, turnover reflects the contract activity during the year and represents the
proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to total expected contract costs.
Turnover on long term contracts is only recognised where there is reasonable certainty that the contract will proceed
and planning permission has been obtained.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of all tangible 
fixed assets, other than freehold land, on the reducing balance basis over their expected useful economic 
lives. The periods generally applicable are:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Office equipment, furniture and fixtures 4 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Mobile surgeries 4 years
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provision for amounts written off.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of purchase cost and net realisable value.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the group an
obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is
measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Work in progress and long term contracts
Work in progress is valued on the basis of direct costs plus attributable overheads based on normal level of
activity. Costs associated with long term contracts are included in stock to the extent that they cannot be matched
with contract work accounted for as turnover. Long term contract balances included in stocks are stated at cost,
after provision has been made for any foreseeable losses and the deduction of applicable payments on account.
No element of profit is included in the carrying value of work in progress. Full provision is made for losses on 
all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
Leased assets
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis, and is credited 
or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill, representing the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated economic life of
twenty years.

Ashley House plc
Report and accounts 2005
Report of the independent auditors 
to the members of Ashley House plc
We have audited the financial statements of Ashley House plc for the year ended 30 April 2005, which comprise
the principal accounting policies, the consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets, the consolidated
cash flow statement, the note of historical cost profits and losses and notes 1 to 25. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified 
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
financial statements. This other information comprises only the report of the directors, the chairman’s statement
and the joint chief executive officers’ statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do
not extend to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion,
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
group at 30 April 2005 and of the profit of the group for the year then ended and have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

The freehold property was revalued in December 2001 by Peter Wilkinson FRICS of Aitchison Rafferty Property
Consultants, who are independent external valuers, as defined by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
Appraisal and Valuation Manual. The valuation, at £1,400,000, was based on the existing use. Subsequent
additions are added at cost. The directors consider that there has been no significant change in the value of the
freehold property since the revaluation having received an interim valuation from Aitchison Rafferty that this is
the case at the present time.
The value of the land was £705,000, which is not subject to a depreciation charge.
If freehold property had not been revalued, it would have been included on the historical cost basis at the
following amounts:

Financial instruments
The group finances its business in two ways; by way of trade and other creditors arising directly from its operations;
and by way of borrowings from the bank and related parties. The main risk arising from these sources of finance
is interest rate risk.
The interest rate exposure of the financial liabilities of the group and the Company as at 30 April 2005 was:

The fixed rate loans are at 6.5% and are convertible at any time at the election of the lender to ordinary shares in
the Company at an exercise price of 30p per share, which represented a significant premium to the share price at
the time.
At the end of the financial year, the Company had an unutilised overdraft facility of £150,000 with Lloyds TSB
Bank plc.
The floating rate liability carries interest at 2.5% over the Lloyds TSB Bank plc base rate.
There is no exchange rate risk, and the fair values of the assets and liabilities of the group are not materially
different from their net book values. Ashley House plc

Ashley House plc and Ashley House Properties Ltd are related as a consequence of the share stapling agreement
entered into in September 2004. As a result the two companies have identical shareholders registers. During
the year Ashley House plc made sales at an arms length basis of £4,648,545 to Ashley House Properties Ltd. 
At 30 April 2005 the balance due from Ashley House Properties Ltd was £1,909,235.

Ashley House plc made sales on an arm’s length basis to Medical Properties Ltd of £2,220,589.
All supplies made to Ashley House Properties Ltd and Medical Properties Ltd are related to the design and
construction of medical centres. In every case, the rent for the building which drives the value of the scheme, 
is set by the District Valuer acting for the Primary Care Trust(NHS). Transactions between Ashley House plc 
and Ashley House Properties Ltd are entered into on the basis of market equivalent pricing.
During the year the group made sales, at arm’s length, to Ashley House Investments Limited of £37,086

April 2004, totalling £300,000 to the Company which are still outstanding. The Ludgate 181 loan was made

Results
Ashley House Properties’ first period of trading 
since September 2004 shows significant progress
already. As at 30 April 2005, the fixed assets totalled
£19.9 million of which £13.1 million represents
completed income producing properties with the
balance being properties under construction. The
first period showed a small loss of £70,152. Following
the share issue to fund the acquisition of Medical
Properties Ltd, the net assets show £2.1 million
representing 9.9p per share as at 30 April 2005.
Acquisition
The acquisition of Medical Properties Ltd, completed
on 28 April 2005, gives the business a portfolio of 
nine completed properties producing rental income 
of approx. £1 million p.a. following positive recent
rent reviews on two of the properties purchased.
The equity fundraising, which accompanied the
acquisition, brought in new shareholders whom 
I am pleased to welcome.
Portfolio
In addition to the nine properties recently acquired,
six properties are under construction all of which
will achieve practical completion before the April
2006 year-end (except one which is due to complete
shortly after). All of these properties under
construction are pre-let to doctors’ partnerships
(whose rent is reimbursed by the Primary Care
Trust part of the NHS) or to Primary Care Trusts 
or pharmacies. The gross value of these properties
based on the current market on completion is
approximately £16.5 million.
A further ten schemes have planning consent,
agreements for lease and most are due to start on 
site by the end of this calendar year. Therefore the
portfolio will grow rapidly from the current base and
can all be pre-funded by debt finance. The implied
gross investment value of these 25 properties,
based on the agreed and anticipated annual rents 
of some £3.5 million is approximately £50 million.
Outlook and change to plc
Ashley House Properties should be valued, like
other investment property companies, in relation 
to its net asset value. From the existing base, the
portfolio will grow rapidly from the schemes already
on site and those with planning consent and due 
on site in the coming months. As with the Medical
Properties acquisition, Ashley House Properties 
will selectively acquire completed properties similar
in nature to the portfolio, where the board believes 
it will add to shareholder value. Now that this
company has had its first audit, we propose to
change its status to being a plc and the resolution
for this is included in the notice of AGM attached
which I urge you to vote in favour of.

Report of the independent auditors 
to the members of Ashley House Properties 
We have audited the financial statements of Ashley House Properties Limited for the period ended 30 April 2005,
which comprise the principal accounting policies, the consolidated profit and loss account, the balance sheets,
the consolidated cash flow statement, and notes 1 to 23. These financial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of the directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and United Kingdom auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors’
report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, 
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified 
by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the 
audited financial statements. This other information comprises only the report of the directors and the 
chairmans’ statement. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
Basis of opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by 
the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the
group at 30 April 2005 and of the loss of the group for the period then ended and have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Ashley House Properties
Report and accounts 2005
Principal accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting
standards and under the historical cost convention. 
The principal accounting policies of the group are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and of its subsidiary undertaking. Profits or
losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. All of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities that existed
at the date of acquisition were recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at that date.
Turnover
Turnover is the total of rental income, excluding value added tax. Turnover is recognised in accordance with
contractual terms.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation.
Finance costs on fixed asset additions are capitalised during the period of construction and written off as part 
of the total cost. No depreciation is charged during the period of construction.
Investments
Investments are included at cost less provision for amounts written off.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the group an
obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax 
is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Investment properties
The group’s properties held for long term investment are included in the balance sheet on the basis of market
value in accordance with SSAP 19. The directors assess the value of the investment properties every six months
with the benefit of input from valuation professionals. Formal valuations will be carried out every three years on
all investment properties. The surpluses or deficit on bi-annual valuations of such properties are transferred to
the revaluation reserve. Depreciation is not provided in respect of freehold investment properties. This policy
represents a departure from statutory accounting principles, which require depreciation to be provided on all 
fixed assets. The directors consider this policy necessary in order that the financial statements give a true 
and fair view, because current values and changes in current values are of prime importance rather than the
calculation of systematic annual depreciation. Depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual
valuation and the amount, which might otherwise be shown, cannot be separately identified or quantified.

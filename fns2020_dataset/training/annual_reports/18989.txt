6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 04 Total Shareholder Return (TSR)
Chairman’s statement
We measure Mapeley's performance by focusing on 
Funds From Operations (FFO), a metric commonly 
used by REITs to isolate cash ﬂow from real estate.
Although we are not a REIT, we are focused on providing
our investors with transparency into our operational
performance, and ensure this by paying out substantially
all our FFO as dividends. As a result, we will return
regularly to the equity markets to fund growth opportunities
such as the single asset acquisitions we are committed to
adding to our portfolio.
In addition to paying out dividends, it is our aim to
increase them – during 2006 we increased our dividend 
in every quarter. In 2006 we paid a total dividend of 168
pence per share, and our 2006 fourth quarter annualised
dividend of 180 pence per share represents a 22% increase
over the same period in 2005. 
Although we do not have control of the movement of
our stock price, we believe the markets have recognised
our performance in 2006. Mapeley's total return to
shareholders in 2006 was 55.6% as compared to the FTSE
250 Index, the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index and the FTSE
EPRA Index TSR of 30.2%, 49.2% and 48.4% respectively.
We at Mapeley are very proud that we have been able to
provide superior returns to our shareholders and it is our
goal to create long-term shareholder value. 
In 2007 we are well-placed to continue to drive shareholder
returns through executing our strategy of growing both
the real estate outsourcing business and DPI Portfolio 
and increasing returns from our existing portfolio. Our
strengths of in-depth local market knowledge, our strong
relationships with tenants, operational capability and
capacity, and our access to capital resources will be key 
to our performance in 2007.
We want to thank you for your continued support 
and conﬁdence in our Company. Through our dividends,
we will continue to provide our shareholders with a 
clear window into our ﬁnancial performance. We at
Mapeley value hard work, commitment and excellence,
and I believe these values are found throughout our
organisation. We believe strongly in our employees, our
assets and our strategy. We look forward to a great 2007.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 05 Chairman’s statement
Wesley R Edens
Chairman
2006 was a strong year for Mapeley, our ﬁrst full year 
as a public company. Mapeley has made great strides 
over the past year and today the Company is stronger in
virtually every respect. Our goal is to set the standard in
terms of earnings and dividend growth, and transparency
as the leading owner and operator of UK real estate. 
In the year and a half since we became a public company,
the liquidity of our stock has increased measurably 
as our equity market capitalisation has grown to
approximately £1.1 billion.
Mapeley's portfolio includes 1,683 properties spread
throughout the United Kingdom, covering over 2.3 million
square metres and valued at more than £2 billion.
Highlights of this year include: 
Strong ﬁnancial performance enabling dividend
growth 
The award of a new Government outsourcing 
contract with the Identity and Passport Service 
The acquisition of an additional £366 million 
of investment property assets 
Mapeley's presence in every major town and city in 
the UK, combined with our position of acting as both
landlord and tenant across a geographically diverse
portfolio, provides an excellent insight into the markets 
we operate in. This insight drives returns across the
business and unlocks future acquisition opportunities.

extremely successful 2006.

strong performance by
focusing on the straight-

of our business.

Jamie Hopkins Chief Executive
Strategy
Our aim at Mapeley is to become the leading owner and
operator of UK regional commercial real estate let to
Government or investment grade tenants. These tenants
tend to have predictable, long-term property requirements,
a dynamic well-suited to Mapeley’s business. Our business
is diverse, we own freehold assets, manage leasehold
assets, provide facilities management services and carry
out projects and refurbishment work for our clients.
Our Property Portfolio is valued at over £2 billion. 
We manage the payment of over £170 million in rental
payments each year to third party landlords through the
management of the leasehold assets we have contracted 
to control under our outsourcing contracts. In total we
own or manage over 2.3 million square metres of real
estate and our portfolio is spread throughout the entire
UK, in most towns and cities. 
The advantage Mapeley has is simple – more effective
management of property risk. Our scale and our in-depth
local market knowledge gained through acting as both
landlord and tenant, along with our operational expertise,
provides multiple opportunities for the Group to drive
returns for its shareholders.
Overview
Mapeley has had an extremely successful 2006 and has
delivered strong results in its ﬁrst full year as a public
company. In short, we have increased our Funds From
Operations (FFO) to £45.7 million, an increase of 79.2%
from last year, and this has enabled us to achieve good
dividend growth of 29.2% over 2006. In the year we paid
dividends equating to 168 pence per share, amounting 
to a fourth quarter annualised dividend yield of 4.5%*. 
We have achieved this strong performance by fully
deploying our nationwide operating platform and focusing
on the straight-forward fundamentals of our business
strategy; rigorous property and asset management of
our existing portfolio and a continued focus on acquiring
good quality assets at yields higher than our cost of capital. 
Whilst the UK real estate sector continued its strong rally
throughout 2006, evidenced by a 49.2% Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) from the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, I am
pleased to announce that Mapeley has out-performed not
only this index but also the FTSE 250 Index (30.2%) and
FTSE EPRA Index (48.4%) by producing TSR of 55.6% 
for the year.
*Based on a closing share price of £39.70 on 29 December 2006.
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 07 We are committed to further growing our portfolio by
acquiring good quality real estate through both outsourcing
contracts and one by one acquisitions. On the single asset
acquisitions our criteria from the outset is to maintain 
a spread between the net initial yield on the property 
and our costs of ﬁnancing that acquisition. We do not
base our investment assessments on strong rental growth
assumptions, rather we prioritise our ability to retain
tenants in the buildings we acquire. We ensure this through
focused stock selection, good property management and
through building and maintaining trusting relationships
with tenants throughout the term of their occupation. 
During 2006 we have maintained our low vacancy rate of
3%. This, combined with the fact that 93% of our revenues
are derived from Government and investment grade clients
endorses our secure and stable investment proposition.
Organic growth
In 2006, organic growth outperformed our expectations.
We generated organic FFO of £32.2 million (2005:
£21.4 million), representing 70.5% of total FFO, an
increase of 50.5% over 2005. The £10.8 million increase 
in organic growth represented more than half of the
increase in total FFO. The key driver in this area has 
been the strong performance of our existing outsourcing
contracts. Our expert property team and asset managers
continue to leverage their signiﬁcant knowledge and
experience to outmanoeuvre the market and to exploit
any optionality across the estate for the beneﬁt of
Mapeley and its tenants. 
In addition, cost savings generated from both our newly
signed facilities management services contract and the
reﬁnancing of our HMRC portfolio loan facility have 
also contributed to our strong FFO result.
Acquisitions – Outsourcing
Throughout 2006 we continued to broaden our regional
presence and further strengthened our extensive 
operating platform through the addition of a further
outsourcing contract with the Identity and Passport 
Service (an Executive Agency of the Home Ofﬁce).
Volumes of outsourcing deals are difﬁcult to predict, 
given the extent and degree of cultural change that these
deals often involve, however, we were delighted to add
another Government client to our portfolio. I believe this
deal further highlights our position as a leading provider 
of real estate outsourcing services in the UK. 
We remain focused on winning new business in this 
area when such opportunities arise as we see these
contracts as an excellent source of growth. Our key
competitive advantages of active property management
and our regionally spread operating platform are vital
tools for us to deploy when assessing and managing 
such opportunities.
Acquisitions – Direct Property Investments
The operating platform also enabled us to add a further
31 single assets worth £366.4 million, spread throughout
the UK regions from Newcastle to Southampton. Individual
assets ranging from £1.8 million to £68.8 million in price
were acquired at an average yield of 6.6%. Approximately
half of these acquisitions were made ‘off-market’ both
through Mapeley’s proprietary acquisition database and 
by direct approaches to landlords, highlighting the strength
of our team and operating platform. 
As predicted, weight of money continued to push prices 
up throughout 2006, albeit with most of the focus of this
demand being on London. Our ability to continue to source
such a high quantity of deals in the UK regions off-market
will be key in securing attractive opportunities going
forward. We are conﬁdent that our operating platform will
continue to provide us with a real competitive advantage 
in this area.
Results and dividend
At Mapeley our main focus is growing our FFO in order 
to pay a stable and growing dividend to shareholders.
During 2006 we grew our FFO by 79.2% to £45.7 million
(2005: £25.5 million). 
The strong operational and ﬁnancial performance of the
business has enabled us to make four successive increases
in our quarterly dividend during 2006 and in total we
have raised the dividend in every quarter since we ﬂoated
the business back in June 2005. Over the 12 months 
of 2006 we have grown our dividend by 29.2% and
produced a total shareholder return of 55.6%. 
EBITDA increased by 44.4% to £93.6 million 
(2005: £64.8 million) and as at 31 December our 
total Property Portfolio was valued at £2,046.2 million
(2005: £1,645.8 million).

Both issues were for the purpose of re-ﬁnancing single

for the support of both new and existing shareholders in
these share issues.
People
None of Mapeley’s success would have been possible
without the full effort, creativity and enthusiasm of
its staff. Our staff are shareholders in the business and 
are motivated to make a full contribution to the Group’s
performance. I would like to thank every member of
staff for their hard work and dedication in 2006.
Outlook
I believe Mapeley is extremely well placed to continue its
strategy and we are committed to maintaining a strong
performance through both organic growth and further
acquisitions.
Whilst the commercial property market remains
competitive and the pressure on ﬁnancing costs 
increases, we continue to ﬁnd good opportunities 
to invest. So far in 2007 we have acquired £95.1 million 
of assets and have a healthy pipeline currently under
evaluation. Our acquisitions database continues to grow 
as does our knowledge of the markets we operate in 
and intend to target. Both of these factors continue to
drive our competitive advantage in acquiring attractive
regional assets.
2007 promises to be another exciting year for the UK real
estate sector, particularly following the arrival of REITs.
At Mapeley, we do not currently intend to convert to REIT
status as we already beneﬁt from similar tax advantages
to that which the REIT regime conveys. 
Mapeley offers an attractive yield and a real growth
opportunity to invest indirectly in the UK regional
property market in a tax efﬁcient manner. Mapeley is
well-placed to further ﬂex its strengths of in-depth local
market knowledge, strong relationships with tenants and
its diverse regional operating platform to drive further
shareholder value in 2007.
I look forward to the year ahead.

payable. The balance are rack-rented leasehold interests
where Mapeley acts as tenant on behalf of its clients
through its outsourcing contracts (see ‘Outsourcing
Contracts’ below for further detail on these portfolios).
These rack-rented leaseholds do not carry any value in
Mapeley’s accounts, they are short leases where the rent
reserved under the lease is close to the market rent for 
the property and is subject to regular, usually ﬁve-yearly,
upward-only rent reviews. 
Mapeley beneﬁts from any difference between income 
it receives from its outsourcing clients as the unitary
charge and its outgoing rental payment obligations, 
which reﬂect the open market rent it pays to its landlords.
Mapeley’s income rebases each year whereas the outgoing
rents which Mapeley pays out to third party landlords 
are reviewed typically on a ﬁve-yearly basis. Mapeley
generates returns to the extent the Group achieves rental
uplifts (or nil rental increases) on rent reviews of Mapeley’s
leasehold interests lower than contracted rental income
growth of either 3% or RPI (in the case of Abbey and
HMRC respectively). In 2006, the annual growth in
outgoing rental liabilities paid by Mapeley since acquiring
these leases was 1.6% compared with income increases 
of 3.3% per annum on average.
Portfolio review
Portfolio overview
Mapeley Limited (Mapeley, the Company or the Group) 
is a Guernsey-based company which owns, manages 
and operates a diverse portfolio of properties located
throughout the whole UK covering some 2.3 million
square metres. Mapeley’s portfolio covers every major
town and city in the UK. 862 of the 1,683 properties
Mapeley owns are primarily ofﬁce or other commercial
use and 821 are primarily retail. Mapeley Estates Limited,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Mapeley provides a
complete range of management services to Mapeley’s
portfolio and its asset owning subsidiaries.
The Group’s real estate portfolio is split into two distinct
segments, namely Outsourcing Contracts and Direct
Property Investments however the characteristics of the
assets in both portfolios are very similar. They are all 
good quality regional assets, let to the same types of
high credit quality tenants. 
As at 31 December 2006, Mapeley owned and managed
1,683 properties with a Property Portfolio value* of
£2,046.2 million. This valuation covers only the 574
freehold and long leasehold properties which Mapeley
owns with at least 20 years unexpired at the time of
acquisition and with negligible or peppercorn rents

6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 11 Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) portfolio
The HMRC portfolio was acquired in 2001. The transaction
involved the acquisition of freehold and long leasehold
properties and rack-rented leasehold properties under 
a purchase and leaseback agreement for a 20-year
duration. This portfolio totalled 1.5 million square 
metres, representing the majority of HMRC's UK property,
including ofﬁces, customer contact centres and other
facilities located in 279 towns and cities across the UK. 
In addition, the Group provides comprehensive property
and facilities management services to HMRC. These
services include maintenance, life cycle replacement,
cleaning, help desk, security, catering, childcare, health
and safety, utilities, equipment management, management
of removals (churn), vending and landscaping. 
HMRC pays the Group a monthly facilities payment which
covers not only the charge for the accommodation, but
also all services that are provided. The Group has retained
responsibility for, but sub-contracted, the performance 
of all of its obligations to provide services (other than
property management services) on terms that reﬂect 
and are consistent with the Group's underlying obligations
to HMRC. To this extent Mapeley has maintained the
property risk in the outsourcing contracts but passed on
risks relating to the provision of facilities management
services, such as wage inﬂation. 
Due to the scale, specialist
knowledge and complex
nature of outsourcing
transactions, Mapeley 
is now one of very few
operators currently in 
the UK who can consume 
such large deals.
12 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Business review – portfolio review
HMRC portfolio
Total portfolio value
£560. 1million
The unique insight which Mapeley gains from acting 
as both landlord and tenant across its diverse regional
portfolio provides excellent in-depth market knowledge.
This enables the Group to perform well at rent reviews 
and lease renewals and other asset management events to
drive organic growth. Mapeley also leverages this insight
by using this information to enhance its ability to make
direct approaches to third party owners of property 
assets which it may wish to acquire. 
The effective management of the leasehold portfolio and 
a consistent focus on limiting and where possible reducing
costs such as rent, service charge, other property related
expenditure and facilities management services costs (in
the case of HMRC only) are key drivers of FFO growth 
for the outsourcing portfolio.
Outsourcing Contracts
Real estate outsourcing involves the transfer of an
organisation’s property and the risks associated with
occupying, managing and servicing that property, 
in return for occupational ﬂexibility and the payment 
of a single unitary charge. 
Entering into a real estate outsourcing contract with
Mapeley provides occupiers with real estate platform
solutions which enable:
1 Transfer of all risks relating to real estate leaving the 
occupier better placed to focus on its core business
2 Price certainty at pre-agreed costs
3 Release of capital where asset transfer occurs
4 Occupational ﬂexibility
5 Improved customer service
Real estate outsourcing deals are difﬁcult to predict and 
as such the Group does not have an annual target for 
new outsourcing transactions. However, due to the scale,
specialist knowledge and complex nature of outsourcing
transactions, Mapeley is now one of very few operators
currently in the UK with the capacity and ability to
undertake such large deals. So far in the UK the majority
of outsourcing deals have been transacted with either
public sector or major corporates which is well suited to
Mapeley’s capabilities, experience and platform.
Within the Outsourcing Contracts segment, the Group
holds three portfolios, as described below:
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 12 The Abbey portfolio
The Abbey portfolio was acquired in 2000. The transaction
involved the acquisition of freehold, long leasehold and
rack-rented leasehold properties under a purchase and
leaseback arrangement for a 20-year duration. At the 
time of acquisition, the portfolio totalled 595,000 square
metres of accommodation, representing substantially 
all of Abbey's UK occupational portfolio. The properties
included bank branches, ofﬁces (including Abbey's
headquarters) and call centres located in 520 towns 
and cities across the UK.
The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) portfolio 
In March 2006, Mapeley announced that it had won the
Identity and Passport Service Authentication by Interview
outsourcing contract. The Identity and Passport Service 
is an Executive Agency of the UK Government’s Home
Ofﬁce. This contract includes the acquisition, ﬁt-out 
and delivery of serviced ofﬁce accommodation for 69
interview ofﬁces throughout the UK. The contract is for 
up to ﬁve years. Work commenced on this contract in
early 2006. 
The Group expects to satisfy approximately 15% of
the property requirements under this contract by 
utilising vacant space in its existing portfolio, which
provides excellent synergies across Mapeley’s business.
The nationwide spread of the portfolio and Mapeley’s 
in-house operational expertise and experience of
operating similar contracts were key in both winning 
and mobilising this contract.
Direct Property Investments Portfolio
Mapeley also acquires single property assets and small
portfolios into its Direct Property Investments Portfolio
(DPI Portfolio). These assets are similar to the individual
assets Mapeley has acquired under its outsourcing
contracts; they are good quality, regional ofﬁce buildings
located throughout the UK. Acquisitions during 2006
ranged in cost from £1.8 million to £68.8 million. The key
acquisition criteria for these assets is the quality of the
building, the type of tenant, the strength of the tenant’s
covenant, the acquisition yield and Mapeley’s assessment
of whether the tenant is likely to remain in occupation of
the building. 
Mapeley targets £400 million of single asset acquisitions
for its DPI Portfolio each year. During 2006, the Group
acquired 31 freehold or long leasehold properties at a cost
of £366.4 million, and at an average net initial yield of
6.6% (6.8% excluding the Pearl Centre, Peterborough). 
As at 31 December 2006 the total DPI Portfolio was valued
at £903.7 million and the net initial yield on the portfolio
was 7.0%. 
Approximately half of the acquisitions made in 2006 
were sourced from either Mapeley’s proprietary acquisition
database or by direct approaches to existing owners. 
At the year end, properties in the DPI Portfolio were
97.9% let and income producing on fully repairing and
insuring leases to central and local Government and 
major corporate tenants. The average unexpired lease
length across the DPI Portfolio was 7.8 years.

6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 13 The fall in value in the HMRC portfolio results from 
the sale of six properties and a valuation deﬁcit for 
the year of £2.8 million in Savills’ valuation of the
portfolio (31 December 2005: surplus £19.4 million). 
The valuation deﬁcit arose as a consequence of the 
Group’s re-assessment during the year of the cost of
providing facilities management services to certain
properties as part of the HMRC contract following the
signing of a new facilities management contract.
Direct Property Investments Portfolio: The value increased
by 70.8% to £903.7 million (2005: £529.2 million).
The increase of £374.5 million arose largely from the
acquisition of properties into the DPI Portfolio during 
the year in line with the Group’s investment strategy.
On a like-for-like portfolio basis, the 38 properties which
Mapeley owned at 31 December 2005 and 31 December
2006, increased in value by £21.4 million, an increase 
of 4%, reﬂecting favourable market conditions.
Portfolio performance
As at 31 December 2006, the Group's total Property
Portfolio had a value of £2,046.2 million (2005: £1,645.8
million) generating total revenue of £387.0 million during
the year (2005: £339.4 million). Of this, £296.4 million 
of rental income was generated from the Group's portfolio
of 1,683 properties (2005: £255.3 million from 1,685
properties). Over 93% of income was generated from
Government and investment grade tenants.
The property portfolio, as valued by Savills 
Commercial Limited, CB Richard Ellis Limited and 
the Company’s Directors (see notes 10 and 1 1 to the
ﬁnancial statements for classiﬁcation of these assets),
increased to £2,046.2 million at 31 December 2006 
from £1,645.8 million at 31 December 2005. 
Abbey portfolio: The value increased by 5% 
to £575.7 million (2005: £546.5 million).
HMRC portfolio: The value decreased by 1% 
to £560.1 million (2005: £566.6 million).
The increase in value in the Abbey portfolio was
principally attributable to favourable market conditions
and the appetite in the market for high-quality 
investment grade assets.

Key facts
Acquisition of 69 properties 
(18,500 sq m)
3-5 year contract
Consistent high-quality ofﬁce
environment
All property occupation risks passed 
to Mapeley for a single ﬁxed fee
Scope
In March 2006 Mapeley and the Identity and Passport
Service (IPS) signed a property outsourcing contract
to acquire, ﬁt-out manage and maintain a portfolio 
of 69 interview ofﬁces throughout the UK 
Project delivery, planning, service charge, rent, 
rates, insurance and dilapidations risk have all been
transferred to Mapeley
Provision of estate management services ensuring
that IPS is not distracted from its core functions by
peripheral building, landlord, neighbour and service
provider issues 
Provision of comprehensive facilities management
services to each building through Mapeley's help desk
Integrated service includes all planned and reactive
maintenance as well as capital project works
Why Mapeley
IPS needed to establish a nationwide network of
ofﬁces to implement a new passport application
procedure for ﬁrst-time applicants
Mapeley is experienced in dealing with Government
clients (HMRC)
This transaction represented a major increase in the
size of IPS's existing operational property portfolio
and it considered the project would be most effectively
delivered through a single property partner
This complex task had to be completed within tight
timescales and within ﬁxed price parameters
Mapeley has an ideal geographic presence in every
major town and city in the UK to be able to fulﬁl the
requirements of this contract on a best-price basis
Key achievements
Mapeley can provide cost certainty in a moving
market
Mapeley aims to satisfy approximately 15% of the
property requirements of this deal by utilising vacant
space in its existing portfolio

acquisition, 
Peterborough
The Pearl Centre, Lynchwood Park,
Peterborough
Mapeley's acquisition of The Pearl
Centre was one of its largest
investments in 2006
Mapeley's reputation for reliability 
in closing transactions enables it to
access deals at attractive pricing 
This acquisition demonstrates how 
a willingness to look at innovative
ﬁnancial structuring enabled Mapeley
to unlock an exciting investment
opportunity
The property
An exceptionally high quality ofﬁce campus built 
in 1992 as a corporate HQ for Pearl Assurance Plc.
Approximately 32,052 sq m of ofﬁce accommodation
Excellent car parking ratio of 1:16.8 sq m
Attractive landscaped site of over 28 acres
It is believed to have cost circa £1 10 million to
construct this property which compares favourably
with a purchase price of £65 million
The lease
Let to Diligenta Limited on a full repairing and
insuring lease for 12 years from March 2006
Starting rent of £4.1 million per annum 
(£1.1 1 per sq m overall) 
Rent is subject to annual uplifts linked to RPI, with 
a minimum uplift of 2% and a maximum of 4% 
over the contractual term
The tenant
Diligenta use the premises as ofﬁces to provide
business process outsourcing services
Diligenta is a UK-based FSA regulated subsidiary 
of TATA Consulting Services Limited who provided 
a parent company guarantee in respect of the
leasehold obligations of Diligenta
TATA Consulting Services Limited is a global
operation and provides very secure investment
grade income
The deal
Following a marketing campaign which involved
signiﬁcant interest, Mapeley bid for this asset but 
was unsuccessful as its bid was lower than the 
other bids received
Two separate bidders both failed to complete the
acquisition in the seller's required timeframe so 
the agent approached Mapeley to see if Mapeley's 
bid still stood
Mapeley succeeded in acquiring the asset at its
original bid price because it was able to complete 
the deal quicker than other bidders
Financing
The length of income, quality of covenant and 
the annual guaranteed rental increases allowed 
an innovative ﬁnancing package which aligned
Mapeley's debt costs with the rising annual rental
ﬂow through a structured swap
By utilising ﬁnancial swap engineering, Mapeley was
able to acquire the asset at its target yield throughout
the lease duration notwithstanding a lower net initial
yield on purchase

These three ofﬁce buildings were
acquired in July and October 2006 
and October 2005, and serve as an
excellent example of how Mapeley can
effectively combine its core strengths 
of local market knowledge and strong
relationships with tenants to unlock
investment opportunities and further

All three properties are let to Barnsley Metropolitan
Borough Council and were acquired off-market through
targeted approaches to private property company
landlords.

Council's Estates Department that the property formed
‘an integral part of the accommodation strategy of the
Council and as such is an important element of usable
ofﬁce space'
In addition to these three properties Mapeley has two

Property management
National and regional estate strategies are regularly
reviewed in order to take advantage of opportunities to
match Mapeley’s property interests to the accommodation
requirements of its tenants. 
During 2006, Mapeley settled 187 rent reviews on
rack-rented properties in the portfolio as tenant
(2005: 230) with an annual rent roll of £30.4 million
(2005: £35.0 million). The average increase was 
1.4% per annum
During the year Mapeley also completed lease renewals
for 39 properties as tenant (2005: 53) with an annual
rent roll of £3.5 million (2005: £3.6 million). The
average annual increase in rent payable in 2006 
was 1%
During 2006 Mapeley settled 82 rent reviews as tenant
with nil increases
Mapeley let 44 (2005: 29) vacant properties during the
year, generating £1.6 million (2005: £0.9 million) of
additional income and maintained a low vacancy rate
of 3% across the whole portfolio
The agreements with Abbey and HMRC both provide 
for annual indexation, with a 3% per annum increase in
amounts payable by Abbey and an RPI-linked increase on
payments by HMRC. As a result, 76% (2005: 87%) of the
income Mapeley receives is subject to annual uplifts, with
virtually all of the balance of the income being subject to
ﬁve-yearly upward-only rent reviews.
To December 2006, the annual growth in rental liabilities
paid by Mapeley since acquiring these leases has been
1.6% per annum. Over the same period, the amounts paid
by Abbey have increased at 3% per annum (the ﬁxed rate)
and RPI, the basis for indexation in the HMRC portfolio
has increased by 3.3% per annum on average. 
By actively managing its lease obligations and matching
the lease terms to its tenants' occupational requirements,
Mapeley has been able to generate asset management
receipts to date of £100.3 million which partly offset
operating costs. There are some, albeit more limited,
further opportunities to generate such asset management
receipts within the existing portfolio. Mapeley expects 
that future real estate outsourcing contracts it enters 
into will bring additional opportunities of this nature.
During 2006 Mapeley
settled 187 rent reviews,
39 lease renewals, provided
£45.2 million of facilities
management services and
carried out £36.8 million
of capital projects.
2007 portfolio events
During 2007, Mapeley anticipates the following 
portfolio events:
Five lease breaks exerciseable on the DPI Portfolio 
on a rent roll of £0.5 million
Seven lease renewals on the DPI Portfolio on a rent
roll of £0.7 million
105 rent reviews as tenant in properties in the Group’s

Property services
Mapeley provides a wide range of facilities management
services through its wholly-owned subsidiary Mapeley
Estates Limited, to approximately 100,000 of its tenants'
employees in 636 buildings. Examples of these services
include maintenance and life cycle replacement, security
and cleaning, catering and childcare. 
The service provision is coordinated through Mapeley’s
24-hour help desk. In 2006, the help desk received 107,609
calls (2005: 128,037). Mapeley’s ability to offer such
services provides it with two important advantages: the
ability to pursue other similar transactions where such a
service requirement might exist and real time access to
and insight into its tenants' changing occupational needs
so that the Group is well positioned to provide them with
an appropriate solution and to manage the estate better
through being able to anticipate and predict their
occupational requirements.
Facilities management services contract 
In February 2006, Mapeley signed a facilities management
(FM) services contract with an FM provider in respect 
of the provision of services on behalf of Mapeley to 
the HMRC portfolio and other properties in Mapeley’s
portfolio. This contract will run until Spring 2021.
In the year ended 31 December 2006, Mapeley provided
services with a value of £45.2 million (2005: £51.0 million).
This decrease was due primarily to a reduction in the price
paid for facilities management services by Mapeley.
Projects
Projects and life cycle services
Mapeley has an extensive in-house projects team 
who are responsible for carrying out requested capital
works projects to the HMRC and IPS estates such as
refurbishments, ﬁt-out, space planning and life cycle
works. When providing these services Mapeley earns 
a margin in addition to the unitary charge receivable 
from HMRC and IPS for its professional services.
In addition, Mapeley manages the delivery of refurbishment
projects for Mapeley funded projects and for third party
clients. Our proven project management capabilities enable
Mapeley to inﬂuence and add value to the way its clients
utilise and refurbish their space.
Mapeley also has an in-house team dedicated to ensuring
that its life cycle programme is executed in a timely and
cost effective manner.
In the year ended 31 December 2006, Mapeley carried 
out repair, refurbishment and construction projects 
with a value of approximately £36.8 million (2005: 
£34.2 million). 
Our people
Mapeley employs a wide range of multi-skilled and
specialist employees as well as property professionals 
to operate its diverse estate. As at 31 December 2006
Mapeley had 131 employees (2005: 170). This reduction
arose primarily as a result of 49 employees being
transferred to Mapeley’s new facilities management
contractor in May 2006.
Mapeley staff are characterised by an entrepreneurial 
and hard-working style and are encouraged to accept 
high levels of personal responsibility in order to deliver
exceptional results. Employee share ownership is actively
encouraged and practically all Mapeley staff are
shareholders in Mapeley Limited.
Mapeley recognises that its success depends, in part, 
on the calibre and the motivation of the individuals it
employs. Mapeley aims to attract and retain the best
people for the job through competitive remuneration
packages which include a component of performance
related pay. All remuneration packages are externally
benchmarked against other property companies and 
other similar sized companies.
Mapeley’s employment selection criteria focus solely 
on experience and ability. Mapeley ensures equality 
of opportunity for all job applicants and employees,
irrespective of race, religion, political belief, sex, sexual
orientation, marital status, age or physical disability. 
Mapeley announced the appointment of Steve Cooke 
to the newly created role of Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
in January 2006. Steve joined Mapeley from Energis
where he was chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer.

Key facts
Leasehold asset in the outsourcing
portfolio
Refurbishment of 1960's ofﬁce
accommodation
Capital investment of £8 million
Jointly funded by the tenant, the
landlord and Mapeley
Improved user satisfaction, productivity
and the ﬂexibility of the accommodation
The scope of the project
The tenant's staff had suffered from a lack of ﬂexibility
offered by the building as well as a number of internal
environmental problems as a result of the poor building
design 
Mapeley worked with the tenant to improve the
ﬂexibility of the accommodation and remove the
environmental issues
Mapeley negotiated a capital contribution for the works
from the landlord and jointly funded the remainder of
the works with the tenant. This allowed a comprehensive
rolling refurbishment of the building to be completed 
The scope of the refurbishment works included:
Conversion from cellular to open plan space including
new internal ﬁnishes
New staff hospitality areas, welfare facilities and
security systems
Upgrading of all building services, safety and
communication systems
Window replacement, roof repairs and façade
improvements
Why Mapeley
Mapeley was able to work with the tenant and combine 
its projects, life cycle replacement and property capability
to deliver a truly joined up solution to the tenant's
accommodation issues.
Key achievements
Eliminated poor internal environmental conditions
Created ﬂexible accommodation enabling the tenant
to make use of more efﬁcient working practices
Business disruption was minimised through a rolling
refurbishment, decant and recant programme within 
the building

Our markets
Mapeley operates in the UK commercial property market
with a speciﬁc focus on acquiring commercial assets let 
to Government and investment grade tenants. 
As at 31 December 2005, the total value of commercial,
industrial and other buildings in the UK was £626 billion
as estimated by the Ofﬁce for National Statistics. 
Mapeley operates in every major town and city throughout
the UK, and its share of the market based on a portfolio
valuation of £2,046.2 million is 0.3%, representing a
signiﬁcant market opportunity.
Occupiers
According to the Ofﬁce for National Statistics the UK
Government is the largest single owner of occupied
commercial real estate, accounting for £189 billion or 
30% of the total commercial real estate stock. £381 billion 
or 61% is owned by private corporations, with the remaining
£56 billion or 9% owned by households.
Mapeley is positioned to beneﬁt from the declining trend
in the owner occupation ratio of UK commercial real
estate to US ratios of 30%. In 2002, 64% of commercial
real estate in the UK was owner-occupied. This ratio
decreased to 50% in 2003 and is expected to continue 
to trend downwards. Mapeley expects that the owner-
occupied ratio will continue to decline as a result of
property sales and that this trend presents a signiﬁcant
market opportunity for the business.
UK Government
In 2004 the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a
commitment to sell £30 billion of assets by 2010 
(although not all of this is related to real estate). 
A key factor in the sale of properties by the UK
Government is its recent drive to increase efﬁciency 
in the use of public sector assets. Known as the
Government Efﬁciency Reviews (including the Lyons,
Gershon and O’Donnell reviews), these initiatives 
may provide additional opportunities for Mapeley 
to increase its ownership and management of public 
sector property in the UK and are likely to be in 
the form of real estate outsourcing contracts.
The UK regional property market
Although Mapeley also has exposure to London and the
South East markets, Mapeley’s target market for new assets
is currently the UK regions.
Rents in the regions are more predictable than in London
and the South East, as is shown by the following research
produced by CBRE (below). This graph shows that rents 
in the regions are much less volatile than London and the
South East and trend to a fairly ﬂat trajectory not only
historically but also on a forward looking basis.
Impact of UK regional property markets on Mapeley
The acquisition criteria for single assets as regards pricing
are that from day one the yield on the asset is in excess 
of the cost of capital, thus creating a proﬁt spread to
contribute to the payment of Mapeley’s dividend. Mapeley
does not factor in strong rental increases in assessing the
asset as an acquisition target by applying the theory that
rents in the regions are ﬂat to stable. Signiﬁcant rental
inﬂation in certain regions will therefore provide organic
growth to Mapeley, but is not required to sustain the
projected return on the asset.
A ﬂat regional rental trend is also key for Mapeley to
beneﬁt from the management of the leasehold portfolio 
it controls. Whilst the income it receives is indexed 
on an annual basis, the outgoing rent Mapeley pays to 
the market is re-set on average on a ﬁve-yearly basis.
Mapeley’s ability to track or out-perform the market 
on rent reviews and lease renewals on the leasehold 
estate by achieving rental inﬂation at levels less than 
the contractual escalators of RPI (HMRC portfolio) 
and 3% (Abbey portfolio) produces good organic 
returns for the Group.
As at December 2006, the annual growth in rental
liabilities paid by Mapeley since acquiring its outsourcing
contracts has been 1.6% per annum. Over the same period,
the amounts paid by Abbey have increased at 3% per
annum (the ﬁxed rate) and RPI, the basis for indexation 
in the HMRC portfolio, has increased by 3.3% per annum
on average.

6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 29 Environment
Mapeley helped to reduce HMRC’s monthly CO2
emissions by 8,000 tonnes by using a variety of
methods from procurement of green electricity, 
better monitoring of energy use at site, site surveys
and actively managing plant on site to ensure it
performs efﬁciently
Mapeley’s ofﬁce in Milton Keynes is now supplied 
with 100% green electricity from wind and large scale
hydroelectric power. Mapeley’s London ofﬁce will be
supplied with green electricity by the end of the ﬁrst
quarter of 2007
Mapeley procures green electricity for the HMRC
estate; this energy is procured using Mapeley’s
expertise in energy management and procurement.
The energy sourced is from large scale hydroelectric
and wind generation
Mapeley has procured and is currently installing
automatic electricity meters across the HMRC estate.
This will enable Mapeley to accurately manage energy
use in buildings. Better data will help to reduce energy
use and assist HMRC in achieving its sustainability
targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as
carbon dioxide
Mapeley has recently tendered for plumbed in point 
of use water throughout the HMRC estate to eliminate
bottled water and reduce CO2. Point of use water helps
to reduce the impact of the indirect carbon footprint
and ecological damage associated with the manufacture
of plastic bottles and the water bottling process itself
In 2006 Mapeley changed its procurement of bottled
water. Mapeley’s ofﬁces in the UK use water bottles
made from 100% biodegradable and compostable plastic
Reusable shopping bags called Onyabags were issued
to all Mapeley staff, to reduce the quantity of plastic
carrier bag waste produced
Mapeley has purchased nearly 12,000 sq m of carpet,
all of which can be put through a unique recycling
programme at the end of its ﬁrst life and be reused,
therefore not going to landﬁll. 
Social
The health, safety and welfare of its employees, customers
and contractors is key to Mapeley’s continued success.
Mapeley’s commitment to health and safety continued 
in 2006. 
Health and safety training was increased through both 
the number of courses offered and the total hours invested
in training. Mapeley was also awarded the Royal Society
for the prevention of Accidents Gold Award for Health 
and Safety Performance in 2006.
Mapeley has appointed a Charitable Donations and
Community Support Ofﬁcer to take an active role in
community liaison and to co-ordinate Mapeley’s
charitable initiatives. Members of staff are also 
provided with sponsorship.
Mapeley actively supports a number of charities, such as
Comic Relief, Children in Need, Breast Cancer Awareness
and UNICEF.
Economic
Mapeley has used its inﬂuence in many areas. One of
the areas is procurement of Fairtrade products. Fairtrade
and sustainable products are now available from vending
machines at Mapeley and across the HMRC estate.
Mapeley uses local suppliers and produce wherever
practicable.
Future outlook
A number of measurable objectives, targets and key
performance indicators are being developed to ensure
Mapeley progresses towards sustainable development and
that it can demonstrate improvements in its performance.
It is intended that 2007 will be a baseline from which to
measure improvements to ensure Mapeley can fully assess
and monitor its activities. Regular reports will be published
documenting Mapeley’s performance against the baseline
from 2008.
It is also Mapeley’s intention to develop an integrated
management system to manage CSR alongside its existing
health and safety, environmental and quality assurance
management systems.
Mapeley’s CSR Committee will monitor Mapeley’s progress
towards sustainable development, to ensure targets are
met. The key areas of focus are:
Compliance with all applicable legislation and other
statutory requirements
Assessment of the impacts of all its operations on 
the environment to prevent and mitigate pollution
Maintaining on-going dialogue with stakeholders 
and clients to identify key environmental issues and
develop effective strategies to manage these
Reporting on progress through relevant environmental
reporting methods both internally and publicly
Moving towards sustainable development in a
strategic manner
Procurement
Encouraging environmentally responsible behaviour
throughout the workforce
Training the management team to IOSH Managing

Mapeley has the ability to inﬂuence a large number 
of organisations and individuals through the operation 
of its estate, especially with regard to its relationships 
with contractors in the provision of facilities management, 
life cycle and projects services.
Mapeley’s procurement policy addresses sustainable
procurement. Mapeley procures goods and services 
from suppliers that operate sound environmental 
policies and whose national and international practices 
are ethically sound.
Mapeley ensures that its supply chain adheres to 
its sustainability requirements by inﬂuencing their
business operations. Contractors’ terms and conditions
reﬂect Mapeley’s sustainability requirements and
incorporate a requirement for the provision for
management information to enable these to be 
monitored for example: the procurement of timber, 
green energy and recycling of waste.
Mapeley is proactive in its approach to sustainable
procurement and in initiating projects to improve 
the supply chain. Mapeley currently has partnerships 
with contractors who reuse, refurbish and recycle ofﬁce
furniture. The procurement team works closely with 
the environment team continually to review opportunities
to improve working practices. For example, procuring
recycled paper and bio bags which will replace standard
bin bags and signiﬁcantly reduce landﬁll.
Mapeley is a signatory of the London Mayor's Green
Procurement Code which was launched on 4 March 2001
to encourage businesses operating in London to purchase
goods made from recycled materials. It aims to stimulate
demand for recycled products and materials, creating a
business solution to the waste problem and thus helping
London become a more sustainable city. Mapeley is also
working with London Remade, who are responsible for
delivering the code on behalf of the Mayor, to assist 
with the development of the code for 2007.
Mapeley will measure its performance by the following
key performance indicators:
Environment

Funds From Operations (FFO)
FFO is a non-GAAP ﬁnancial management measure used
to demonstrate the underlying operating performance of
real estate businesses. It provides investors with information
regarding the Group’s ability to service debt and make
capital expenditure. Further information on FFO is set 
out in note 30.
FFO was £45.7 million for the year ended 31 December
2006, compared with £25.5 million for the year ended
31 December 2005. The increase in FFO of £20.2 million
was primarily driven by income generated by investment
properties acquired during the year and stronger
performance from the Group’s existing outsourcing
contracts driven by lower operating costs.
During the year the Group started to separately disclose
organic FFO which is deﬁned as the FFO generated
following the ﬁrst anniversary of the acquisition of
a property asset or commencement of an outsourcing
contract. In 2006, organic growth outperformed 
our expectations. We generated organic FFO of
£32.2 million (2005: £21.4 million), an increase of
50.5%. The £10.8 million increase in organic growth
represented more than half of the increase in total 
FFO. The key driver in this area has been the strong
performance of our existing outsourcing contracts.
Dividends
For the 12 months ended 31 December 2006, Mapeley
declared dividends aggregating to £1.68 per share
(31 December 2005: £1.30 per share) representing 
a fourth quarter annualised dividend yield of 4.5%.
At a Board meeting held on 7 March 2007, the Board 
of the Company declared a dividend for the quarter 
of £13.2 million, equating to £0.45 per share (year 
ended 31 December 2005: £8.3 million, equating to
£0.37 per share), (quarters ended 30 September 2006:
£1 1.4 million, equating to £0.43 per share, 30 June 2006:
£10.9 million, equating to £0.41 per share and 31 March
2006: £10.3 million, equating to £0.39 per share), 
an increase of 4.7% per share on the prior quarter,
reﬂecting the Company’s policy of paying stable 
and growing dividends. 
The record date for the dividend declared on 7 March 2007
is 16 March 2007 and the payment date is 30 March 2007.
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the dividends paid
and declared amounted to £45.8 million (31 December
2005: £25.3 million).
Proﬁt for the year
The proﬁt for the year ended 31 December 2006 was
£53.8 million (2005: loss £56.5 million). These results
include the following key points:
A £19.8 million (2005: £72.7 million) exceptional
charge arising on the reﬁnancing of the original
STEPS loan facility and the revolving acquisition
facilities, reﬁnanced during the year
Net valuation surplus on investment property was
£40.8 million (2005: £18.0 million)
Reversal of impairment of non-investment property
was £0.8 million (2005: impairment of £0.6 million)
Tax credit of £10.9 million (2005: £nil) relating to the
recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of prior
year losses and capital allowances
Excluding the above mentioned effects, the Group’s 
result increased from a loss of £1.2 million in 2005 to 
a proﬁt of £21.1 million for the year ended 31 December
2006. The main reason for this increase was the strong
and growing contributions from the Direct Property
Investments Portfolio and proﬁts from disposals of
non-investment property.
Revenue
Group revenue for the year ended 31 December 2006 
was £387.0 million, an increase of £47.6 million (14.0%)
over the same period last year. The increase was driven by
additional rental income of £34.4 million from the Direct
34 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Financial review
Steve Cooke Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 34 Property Investments P ortfolio from current year acquisitions
and the full year revenue effect of acquisitions in 2005.
There was an increase, net of vacations, of £14.9 million in
contractual income from outsourcing contracts principally
arising from the impact of revenues from the Identity 
and Passport Service (IPS). However, revenue from any
remaining property held for trading fell by £1.7 million. 
The key drivers of revenue growth are described below:
Direct Property Investments (DPI)
In the year to 31 December 2006, the Group purchased
investment property at an aggregate cost of £366.4 million
with an average net initial yield of 6.6% (6.9% excluding
the Pearl Centre, Peterborough) and continued to identify 
a signiﬁcant target pool of properties it may consider
acquiring in the future.
Included in this total was the acquisition of the Pearl
Centre, Peterborough for £65.0 million at a net initial 
yield of 6.1%. The Pearl Centre is let to Diligenta Limited, 
a UK-based subsidiary of TATA Consulting Services
Limited, for 12 years with annual RPI rental uplifts such
that the running yield in year 12 will be a minimum 
of 7.6%. Mapeley took out an interest rate swap that
matched the cost of debt to the income proﬁle, which 
was subsequently incorporated into the Gamma
acquisition facility term loan (see note 18), part of
which ﬁnances this property. 
Identity and Passport Service (IPS) Interview Centre
outsourcing contract
During the year Mapeley signed a contract with IPS for a
term of three years, with an option to extend for a further
two years. This contract provides for the acquisition, ﬁt-out
and servicing of 69 ofﬁces throughout the UK. The contract
contributed £12.4 million of revenue during the year.
Property operating expenses
The property operating expenses of the Group in the 
year to 31 December 2006 were £285.4 million (of
which £173.9 million was rentals payable) compared to
£268.3 million (£167.7 million rentals payable) for the
same period in the previous year, an increase of 6.4%. 
The increase was primarily driven by an increase in 
rental payments of £6.2 million and costs associated 
with the IPS contract.
Mapeley awarded a contract to a new facilities
management provider to manage and deliver facilities
management services to the HMRC portfolio and other
properties on 3 February 2006. This contract will 
run until Spring 2021 matching Mapeley’s contractual
obligations with HMRC and will reduce overall operating
costs going forward.
Net valuation surplus on investment property
The Group recognised a surplus of £40.8 million
(2005: £18.0 million) on revaluation of investment property
reﬂecting favourable market conditions and the appetite
for high-quality real estate investment assets.
Gain on disposal of non-investment property
The Group disposed of six non-investment properties 
in 2006 realising proceeds of £6.6 million and net gains 
of £3.2 million (2005: £nil). 
Administrative and other expenses
Administrative and other expenses were £20.7 million for
the year ended 31 December 2006 compared to £ 19.7 million
for the year ended 31 December 2005, an increase of 5.1%.
The increase was driven largely by bid costs on a potential
outsourcing contract. 
EBITDA
EBITDA (see note 29) was £93.6 million for the year ended
31 December 2006, compared to £64.8 million for the year
ended 31 December 2005, an increase of 44.4%. This was
a direct result of revenue growth of 14.0% outstripping
growth in property operating expense of 6.4%.

6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 35 Finance costs and ﬁnance income
Finance costs in the year ended 31 December 2006 
were £89.6 million (31 December 2005: £129.7 million).
The ﬁnance costs for the year ended 31 December 
2006 included exceptional break costs of £19.8 million
(31 December 2005: £72.7 million) relating to the
reﬁnancing of the STEPS loan facility, and the revolving
acquisition facilities in 2006 and the Abbey portfolio and
revolving acquisition facilities in 2005. Exceptional break
costs comprise a ﬁnance charge of £6.4 million resulting
from the change in the estimate of the timing of the
repayment of the original loan and £13.4 million 
relating to swap termination fees as a consequence 
of the reﬁnancing. Excluding exceptional break costs,
ﬁnance costs have increased by £10.4 million during 
the period due to higher interest costs arising as a result 
of the increased borrowings required for new investments. 
Finance income has beneﬁted from unrealised gains on
interest rate swaps in 2006 of £2.8 million (2005: unrealised
losses of £ 1.4 million). The gain on the interest rate swap of
£2.8 million has arisen as a result of a favourable movement
in long-term interest rates applicable to the portion of the
swap that was not terminated on the reﬁnancing of the
Gamma acquisition facility term loan in 2006. The swap
ﬁxed the Group’s anticipated long-term exposure to interest
rate risk on certain property acquisitions. 
Taxation
Certain Group companies are resident in Bermuda and are
classiﬁed as UK Non-resident Landlords for tax purposes.
Taxable proﬁts in these companies are subject to UK
income tax and are exempt from local Bermuda taxes.
The Group and its subsidiaries have not paid income or
corporation tax in either 2006 or 2005 in any of the
jurisdictions in which they operate due to their tax
residence and the availability of current and prior year tax
losses and other tax deductible allowances. The Group has
also re-evaluated its forecasts of future proﬁts of Group
companies. For the ﬁrst time, the Group has concluded
that it is sufﬁciently certain of its future proﬁtability to
recognise a deferred tax asset. As a consequence, the
Group recognised a deferred tax credit of £10.9 million
(2005: £nil) in the income statement (see note 7).
The Group has additional tax losses and deductions that
would be available indeﬁnitely for offset against future
taxable proﬁts of the companies in which the losses and
deductions arose. The Group has not recognised a deferred
36 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Financial review
income tax asset in respect of these losses and deductions
due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and
timing of utilisation.
In addition the Group recognised a deferred tax expense of
£4.6 million (2005: £nil) directly in equity on unrealised
valuation surpluses in respect of derivative ﬁnancial
instruments and certain property assets domiciled in the
United Kingdom. These deferred tax liabilities are unlikely
to be realised due to the availability of prior year tax losses.
Non-current assets
Non-current assets, comprising investment property,
property plant and equipment, premiums paid for
operating leases, non-current trade and other receivables,
ﬁnancial instruments and deferred tax assets, increased 
by £428.5 million between 31 December 2005 and
31 December 2006. Investment Property on the Balance
Sheet comprises the Abbey portfolio and the Direct
Property Investments Portfolio. 
Investment property (see note 1 1) increased to
£1,483.1 million from £1,077.4 million at 31 December
2005. This reﬂects the purchase consideration and 
related costs of acquisition of new investment property 
in the year to 31 December 2006 of £366.4 million 
plus a valuation surplus recognised in the year of
£40.8 million and transfers from inventories of
£0.8 million less transfers to non-current assets held 
for sale of £3.0 million. Investment property consists 
of the following two portfolios: 
The Abbey portfolio
As at 31 December 2006, the Abbey portfolio (see note 1 1)
had a value of £575.7 million (31 December 2005:
£546.5 million). It comprised 367 freehold or long leasehold
properties (31 December 2005: 367) and 698 rack-rented
leasehold properties with nil capital value (31 December
2005: 732 properties). Portfolio occupancy (based on 
area) was 90.3% at 31 December 2006 (31 December 
2005: 91.6%).
Direct Property Investments (DPI) portfolio
As at 31 December 2006, the DPI Portfolio (see note 1 1)
comprised 69 properties (31 December 2005: 38) with a
value of £903.7 million (31 December 2005: £529.2 million).
The net initial yield on this portfolio as at 31 December
2006 was 7.0% (31 December 2005: 7.2%). The properties
were 97.9% let on fully repairing and insuring leases to
central and local Government and major corporate tenants
EBITDA was £93.6 million
for the year ended 31
December 2006, compared
to £64.8 million for 2005,
an increase of 44.4%.
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 36 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 37 Financial review
(31 December 2005: 98.0%) with an average unexpired
lease length of 7.8 years (31 December 2005: nine years). 
Over the same period, Property, Plant and Equipment (see
note 10) decreased to £523.3 million from £527.9 million
at 31 December 2005, principally due to the revaluation 
of certain of the Group’s freehold and long leasehold
properties. Property, plant and equipment consists of
the following portfolio:
The HMRC portfolio
The HMRC portfolio comprised 138 freehold or long
leasehold properties (31 December 2005: 144) and
380 rack-rented leasehold properties (31 December 2005:
401). Portfolio occupancy (based on area) was 98.9% at
31 December 2006 (31 December 2005: 98.5%).
As at 31 December 2006, the HMRC portfolio (see note 10)
had a value of £560.1 million (31 December 2005:
£566.6 million). The fall in value results from the sale of
six properties during the year and from a valuation deﬁcit
for the year of £2.8 million. The valuation deﬁcit arose 
as a consequence of the Group’s re-assessment of the 
cost of providing facilities management services to certain
properties as part of the HMRC contract following the
signing of a new facilities management contract. 
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale increased to £3.0 million
(2005: £1.4 million) as a result of the transfer of two assets
from investments properties offset by the sale of prior year
assets. The majority of the £3.0 million increase represents
the transfer of one property held at a value of £2.5 million
at 31 December 2006 based upon the Directors’ valuation,
established by reference to the net disposal proceeds on
completion of sale shortly after the balance sheet date.
Finance and capital structure
The Group’s ﬁnancial strategy is to maintain an optimal
gearing ratio to ensure that shareholders beneﬁt from
maximum leveraged returns. The Group seeks to ﬁnance
its property investments with long-term debt facilities that
reﬂect the long-term nature of its property investments
and on which the interest rates have been ﬁxed by
utilising a mixture of ﬁxed rate debt and ﬂoating rate
debt with matching interest rate swap agreements. 
Mapeley seeks to ﬁnance new outsourcing contracts in 
line with this strategy at up to 80% Loan To Value (LTV).
Purchases of direct investment properties are ﬁnanced 
on a similar basis but initially using a short-term
revolving facility for 100% of purchase costs. This is
subsequently reﬁnanced at up to 80% LTV using long-
term debt with a lower interest rate, with the balance of
the cost of acquisition funded by new equity raised. The
Directors intend to fund future acquisitions in the same
manner. The Group therefore expects continuing growth
in the level of debt over the coming years as it pursues its
strategy of investing in direct investment property. 
The Group strives to eliminate the effect of interest rate
ﬂuctuations on its earnings and in order to achieve this,
hedges its anticipated long-term liabilities using interest
rate swaps or ﬁxed rate debt at the earliest opportunity,
normally on the purchase of a property. Although the
Group has arrangements in place that hedge its interest
rate exposure on substantially all of its borrowings, not 
all of these arrangements are eligible for hedge accounting. 
i) Equity fund raising
On 27 January 2006, Mapeley Limited (the Company)
issued 4,036,697 ordinary shares at a price of £27.25 
per share and raised proceeds of £106.4 million, net of
issue costs. 
On 1 1 October 2006 the Company issued a further
2,876,923 ordinary shares at a price of £32.50 per share
and raised proceeds of £90.4 million, net of issue costs.
In each case the proceeds were used to repay a portion 
of the revolving acquisition facility in place at each time,
resulting in a reduction in interest costs and enabling the
Group to draw new funds under its revolving acquisition
facility to ﬁnance future acquisitions.

ii) Bank loans
At 31 December 2006, £1,278.3 million had been 
drawn under the Group’s loan facilities (31 December
2005: £1,086.6 million). The Group drew down funds 
of £956.3 million in the period and repaid loans of
£764.6 million.
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 37 Conversion of Beta revolving acquisition facility 
to Beta acquisition term loan 
In January 2006, at the time of the ﬁrst 2006 equity 
fund raising, the Group converted the £300.0 million 
Beta revolving acquisition facility into a ten-year,
£208.6 million term facility with a ﬁxed interest rate 
of 4.53% plus a margin of 0.85%. The rate of interest
payable was determined by the weighted average rate
payable under the Group’s matching swap contracts 
which were terminated on the same date. 
Conversion of Gamma revolving acquisition facility 
to Gamma acquisition term loan
Following the successful issue of a further 2,876,923
ordinary shares in October 2006, the Group converted 
the two-year, £300.0 million revolving Gamma acquisition
facility into a ten-year, £179.3 million term facility with 
a ﬁxed interest rate of 4.28% plus a margin of 0.67% 
and a ten-year, £52.0 million stepped ﬁxed interest 
rate facility. The initial rate on this facility is 4.0% with
stepped increments of 0.20% per annum plus a margin 
of 0.67%. The rate of interest payable on both facilities 
was determined by the weighted average rate payable
under the Group’s matching swap contracts which 
were terminated on the same date. 
New Delta revolving acquisition facility 
Having paid down the Gamma revolving acquisition
facility (with the new term facility and equity, as 
described above), the Group also arranged a new ten-year,
£300.0 million revolving facility (the Delta acquisition
facility) to ﬁnance the future acquisition of investment
property. The interest rate payable on the facility is LIBOR
plus a margin of between 1.0% and 1.5%, plus mandatory
costs (if any). The Group has also put in place a ten-year,
£20.0 million swap with an interest rate of 4.37% to ﬁx 
its anticipated long-term exposure to interest rate risk 
on these property acquisitions. 
As at 31 December 2006 the balance drawn down on 
this facility was £36.4 million.
On 20 January 2007, the Group entered into a ten-year,
£9.3 million interest rate swap ﬁxing the interest rate at
5.2% and on the 30 January 2007 it also entered into a
further ten-year, £75.0 million interest rate swap ﬁxing
the interest rate at 5.34% in order to secure the borrowing
cost of planned acquisitions expected to be completed in
the ﬁrst quarter of 2007.
38 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Financial review
The cost to the Group of reﬁnancing its acquisition
facilities during the year was £2.0 million which is
included as part of the exceptional ﬁnance charge 
(see note 4). 
STEPS reﬁnancing
During the year the Group successfully completed the
reﬁnancing of the loan facility entered into by Mapeley
STEPS Limited and Mapeley STEPS Contractor Limited 
in 2001. This involved the repayment of the 20-year,
£174.9 million loan and replacing it with a new 15-year,
£178.0 million term facility, of which £176.0 million has
been utilised. As a result, the Group has incurred an
exceptional charge of £17.8 million comprising of
£4.4 million resulting from a change in the timing of
repayment of the original loan and £13.4 million relating 
to swap termination costs. The beneﬁt of the reﬁnancing 
is a reduction in the rate of interest payable, which fell 
from an average of 6.65% per annum to 5.25% per 
annum (realising an annual cost saving of approximately
£2.4 million per annum).
Gearing
At 31 December 2006, the Group had a gearing ratio 
(see note 31) of 169% (31 December 2005: 220%). The
decrease in gearing was primarily driven by an increase 
in equity following the Group’s issue of shares in January
and October 2006 and the use of the proceeds raised to
partially repay amounts drawn under two £300.0 million
revolving acquisition facilities.
Cash ﬂow
The following table summarises the Group’s cash ﬂows 
for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005:
2006 2005
£ million £ million
Net cash ﬂows from operating activities 35.7 55.9
Net cash ﬂows used in investing activities (359.9) (507.5)
Net cash ﬂows from ﬁnancing activities 319.4 458.0
Net (decrease)/increase in cash and 
short-term deposits (4.8) 6.4
In the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group generated
strong operating cash ﬂows driven by operating proﬁts. 
The decrease in the net cash ﬂows from operating activities,
in 2006 compared to 2005, relates to the receipt of the
facilities management income of £19.3 million in January
2005 relating to December 2004. The largest non-operating
cash outﬂows have been the acquisition of property at
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 38 £366.4 million (2005: £507.2 million), costs paid of
£ 13.4 million (2005: £65.9 million) on breaking interest rate
swaps and related loan termination charges and interest
paid of £65.4 million (2005: £48.8 million). The acquisition
of property has been funded by equity and debt, and
interest paid has been funded from operating cash ﬂows. 
Risks 
Risk management
The Group undertakes comprehensive risk assessments
and identiﬁes the principal risks that affect it and its
activities. The responsibility for management of each 
key risk has been clearly identiﬁed and delegated by the
Board to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other senior
members of the Group’s management. The Group’s senior
management team has close involvement with the day-to-
day operational matters of the Group. In addition to the
Board of Directors, operational teams have responsibility
for the following speciﬁc areas of the Group’s activities:
Property investment and management
Management of property outsourcing activities
Group management and operations
Taxation and regulation
Financing
Property investment and management
Market
Principal risks 
Commercial property markets are cyclical. Rental levels
are determined by the supply of suitable space in a market
and occupiers’ demand. The value of a commercial property
depends upon the characteristics of the lease, the credit
worthiness of the tenant, the prospects of rental growth
and the stage of the property market cycle.
Control of risks
A dedicated in-house team supplemented by external
advisors monitor current and future market trends. 
This includes considering current and future yield
prospects (which form an integral part of business
planning), forecasting and the capital allocation 
decision making process.
Asset management
Principal risks 
Property values may decline and returns not be optimised.
Uneconomic investments may be made or under-performing 
properties retained. Signiﬁcant tenant defaults may reduce
income and property values. 
Control of risks 
The performance of each property is reviewed at least
monthly. Key performance measures such as voids, lease
expiry proﬁles and progress on rent reviews are reported
on a monthly basis and actively managed to mitigate 
risks. Tenants are principally of low credit risk, either
Government departments or large corporations, thereby
maintaining the level of tenant defaults to which the 
Group is exposed at a low level.
Investment performance and returns 
Principal risks
Decisions about the allocation and investment of capital
and other resources may not deliver the anticipated
returns, or may fail to maximise their potential value 
for the Group.
Control of risks 
An Investment Committee has been established to 
monitor and mitigate this risk. The senior management
team monitors actual performance against targets,
recommending corrective actions as appropriate.
Property outsourcing
Outsourcing Contracts 
Principal risks 
Outsourcing Contracts typically require the Group to
provide accommodation and certain associated services 
to an occupier in return for an indexed unitary charge.
Outsourcing clients may transfer signiﬁcant elements 
of the risks in their Property Portfolio to the Group. The
ability of Mapeley to manage these risks creates proﬁt 
for the Group. Mapeley is exposed to a loss if the unitary
charge set at the outset of the contract does not reﬂect 
the operational risks involved, or if the Group does not
deliver the contracted services to the required standard.
Control of risks 
Rigorous ﬁnancial models and systems to measure
performance against contract requirements have been
developed, which together with Mapeley’s ﬁnancial
performance, are reviewed weekly by senior management.
The Group has also placed its facility management
contractor on a back-to-back arrangement with its own
terms under the contract with HMRC. Information and
experience gained from this monitoring process is, in turn,
used to develop the pricing of new contracts.

6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:30  Page 39 Group management and operations
Management 
Principal risks
The Group is reliant on its high-calibre senior 
management team.
Control of risks 
Knowledge of all processes and projects is shared 
by at least two employees and the Group recruits 
and develops high-calibre employees.
Disaster planning
Principal risks 
The Group has developed complex IT and other systems 
to manage its business. Without sufﬁcient recovery
planning, there is an increased risk that the business 
may fail to recover from a ‘disaster’ and potentially 
suffer long-term damage. 
Control of risks
Disaster recovery plans are in place, which include the 
use of off-site facilities. The plans are regularly updated.
IT integrity and performance
Principal risks
The Group’s ability to meet its obligations under
outsourcing contracts is reliant on the continuing
performance of its IT systems. A major failure in these 
IT systems could result in ﬁnancial and reputation loss.
Control of risks 
The IT back up plan is a key element of the Group’s disaster
recovery plans. The Group makes use of an outsourced,
third party, IT service provider which provides a fully
managed desktop and application support service.
Taxation and regulation
Taxation
Principal risks 
The Group is exposed to ﬁnancial risks from increases in
tax rates and changes to the basis of taxation including
corporation tax, V AT and stamp duty land tax. The Group’s
ﬁnancial returns are also dependent on it retaining non-
UK tax residence status for certain of its subsidiaries.
Control of risk
The Group regularly monitors legislative proposals and
consults external advisors to understand, and if possible,
mitigate the impact of any changes. The Group has speciﬁc
procedures in place in connection with the management
and control of its non-UK resident subsidiaries.
Financing
Funding
Principal risks
The Group is exposed to a risk of not having sufﬁcient
funding secured in order to maintain its desired levels 
of growth and acquisition. 
Control of risk
The Group has dedicated resources involved in managing
the Group’s ﬁnancing activities. The Group has established
relationships with major ﬁnancial institutions and has
ﬂexible funding arrangements in place to enable a pipeline
of future acquisitions to be considered. 
Fluctuating market conditions
Principal risks
Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including
governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and
international economic and political conditions and other
factors beyond Mapeley’s control. The Group is exposed to
these prevailing market rates on both current drawn-down
borrowings and on any reﬁnancing of debt in the future.
Any movements in the interest rate could result in the
Group’s interest expense exceeding the income from its
property portfolio. 
Control of risk
The Group aims to reduce its exposure to such ﬂuctuations
on current facilities using a mixture of ﬁxed and ﬂoating
date debt and hedging instruments. The Group aims to
keep 100% of its long-term borrowings at ﬁxed rates
except for debt raised for direct property investment where
property is initially funded on a short-term basis before
being reﬁnanced through long-term borrowing facilities.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps either in advance
of property acquisitions or on the date an asset is
purchased in order to ﬁx the interest rate payments. 
Further details on the Group’s ﬁnancial risk management
objectives and policies are set out in note 24 to the
ﬁnancial statements.

The Directors present their annual report together with the
audited ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the year ended
31 December 2006. 
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group continue to be the
acquisition, ownership and management of a diverse portfolio 
of commercial property throughout the UK. The property 
is primarily let to strong credit quality tenants with large
Property Portfolio management needs such as central and 
local Government and large corporations. The Group reports
these business activities under two main segments, outsourcing
contracts and investment property. Outsourcing Contracts
consists of activities arising from the purchase and leaseback 
of the HMRC and Abbey property portfolios and the result 
from the acquisition, ﬁt-out and delivery of serviced ofﬁce
accommodation for the Identity and Passport Service (IPS).
Direct Property Investments (DPI) involve the purchasing of
individual and small portfolios of ofﬁce property which are 
let to strong credit quality tenants. Further information on 
the Group’s activities is set out in the Business Review.
Review of business
The consolidated income statement for the year is set out on 
page 54. A review of the development and performance of
the business has been set out in the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s
statement, the business review and in the ﬁnancial review. 
This includes an analysis of the key performance indicators 
used to measure the development, performance and position 
of the business. The principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the business are set out in the risk management section

On 7 March 2007, the Board of Directors declared a dividend 
of £0.45 per share for the quarter ended 31 December 2006
(Quarter ended 30 September 2006: £0.43), an increase of 4.7%
per share from the prior quarter, reﬂecting the Company’s policy
of paying stable and growing dividends. The record date for this
dividend is 16 March 2007 and the payment date is 30 March
2007. The Group has declared dividends for the year with an
aggregate coupon of £1.68 per share (2005: £1.30 per share),

acquired the total issued share capital of Mapeley UK Co. Limited
(MUKCO) from Mapeley Holding Company Limited in a share for
share exchange. This restructuring has been accounted for using
the principles of merger accounting and hence the comparative
ﬁgures presented for the consolidated Mapeley Limited Group
(Mapeley or the Group) have been prepared as if the Company
had always been the holding company of the Group.

The Group has a formal health and safety policy in place and
complies with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and
associated legislation to ensure the highest possible standards

is committed to the identiﬁcation of all areas of environmental
impact. Mapeley will strive to minimise or prevent any negative
environmental impacts from its activities. 
Employees
The Group recognises the contribution its employees make to its
continued success. It acknowledges the need to attract and retain
employees of a high calibre and operates an equal opportunities

46 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Directors’ responsibility statement
Directors’ responsibilities for the ﬁnancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable Guernsey law and those
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union. 
Guernsey company law required the Directors to prepare Group
ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and of the proﬁt
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing those Group
ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are required to:
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
Prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company
will continue in business
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
ﬁnancial position of the Group and enable them to ensure that
the Group ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies
(Guernsey) Law, 1994. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 46 Corporate governance
As well as being the Chairman of the Company, Mr Edens, holds
numerous Directorships in a professional capacity. The Board is
satisﬁed that these appointments do not adversely affect his
commitment as the Company’s Chairman.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors bring independent views to the
Board and have diverse experience in chartered surveying,
accountancy, law and ﬁnance to add to the Board’s effectiveness,
particularly in the areas of corporate strategy, governance and
risk. Non-Executive Directors take an active part in debate, not
being afraid to challenge proposals, ensuring the robustness of
Board decisions.
Remuneration for the Non-Executive Directors is determined 
by the Board. They do not participate in the Company’s bonus 
or pension schemes but as part of the terms of their initial
appointment to the Board they have been awarded shares in 
the Company. The Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
for an initial period of three years subject to renewal for 
further periods. 
Board appraisal
The Board and its Committees undertake a formal annual
evaluation of their own performance and that of individual
Directors. The ﬁrst such review took place in 2006 (the ﬁrst full
year of operation since Admission). The performance evaluation
consisted of each Director completing a wide-ranging appraisal
questionnaire based on the process and questions outlined in 
the Higgs Report’s recommendations for good practice. 
The Non-Executive Directors also discuss the performance 
of the Chairman annually, or more frequently as necessary. 
The appraisal process revealed a high level of satisfaction with
the operation and functioning of the Board and Committees.
Board Committees
The Board has established Nomination, Remuneration,
Investment and Audit Committees which deal with speciﬁc
aspects of the Group’s affairs, each of which has written terms 
of reference which are reviewed annually and which deal clearly
with their authorities and duties. Copies of these are available 
on request from the Company Secretary.
The Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee
are chaired by Mr Edens. The Board believes that the interests 
of the Company are better served with Mr Edens as a member 
of these respective Committees, notwithstanding the requirement
of the Combined Code that all members should be independent.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr Parkinson.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is appointed by the Board and
chaired by Mr Edens. Its other members are Mr Carey and 
Mr Parkinson. Their experience is detailed on page 41. Other
Board members, along with other individuals, attend if invited,
for all or part of any meeting, as and when appropriate. The
Committee met once during the year with full attendance. 
The Committee is responsible for: 
Considering the size, structure and composition of the Board 
Considering the retirement of Directors and appointment 
of additional and replacement Directors
Making appropriate recommendations to the Board
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 47 Corporate governance
Statement of compliance with code of best practice
The Financial Services Authority requires all UK incorporated
listed companies to disclose how they have applied the principles
and complied with the provisions of the Combined Code. The
Company, as a Guernsey incorporated company, is not currently
required to comply with the Combined Code. The Directors
believe, however, that it is important for the Company, as a public
company, to maintain a high standard of corporate governance,
and as such, the provisions set out in the Combined Code which
they consider applicable have been adopted during the year 
and are summarised below. Throughout 2006, except as
otherwise explained below, the Company complied with the
recommendations of the Combined Code in relation to the
management of the Company.
Role of the Board
The Board sets strategy and monitors the Group’s operational 
and ﬁnancial performance. A schedule of matters reserved for the
Board was approved on admission of the Company to the Ofﬁcial
List, and is reviewed on an annual basis. It includes those matters
that are most signiﬁcant to the Group, based on the nature and
size of the matter, both in terms of ﬁnancial impact and risk.
As part of its collective responsibility for the management of the
Group, the Board must ensure that adequate resources are in
place to achieve its strategic aims and that its obligations to its
shareholders and other stakeholders are met. 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the management and
control of the Group’s activities and good corporate governance.
The Board met 16 times during the period and intends to meet at
least seven times a year. The Board objectively sets and monitors
Group strategy, reviews performance, ensures adequate funding,
examines major potential acquisitions and disposals, formulates
policy on key issues and reports to shareholders.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties fully, all Directors
receive appropriate and timely information, including brieﬁng
papers distributed in advance of Board meetings. Management
regularly makes presentations on business and operational issues
to the Board and its Committees. All Directors have access to the
advice and services of the Company Secretary and his team, who
are responsible to the Chairman on matters of corporate
governance. 
Board balance and independence
The Board is satisﬁed that no individual or group of Directors
has unfettered powers of discretion and that an appropriate
balance exists between the Executive and Non-Executive
members of the Board.
During the year, the Board comprised of the Chairman, one
Executive Director and four Non-Executive Directors. The roles 
of Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are split. The Chairman 
is responsible for the effectiveness of the Board, and the Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer for the day-to-day management of the Company. 
The Board considers that all four Non-Executive Directors are
independent (notwithstanding their entitlements to free ordinary
shares under their letters of appointment). Mr Carey is the senior
independent Non-Executive Director. Mr Edens, the Chairman
may not be regarded as ‘independent’ since he is the chief
executive ofﬁcer and chairman of the Board of Directors of
Fortress Investment Group LLC, afﬁliates of which manage 
the major shareholders of the Company. However the Board
considers that the experience and independent judgment of
its other Non-Executive Directors provides an appropriate and
effective balance between the Executive and Non-Executive 
and independent and non-independent members. Throughout 
the period and to the date of this report, more than half of the
Board, including the Chairman, comprised independent Non-
Executive Directors.

Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is appointed by the Board and
chaired by Mr Edens. Its other members are Mr Carey, Mr
Fascitelli and Mr Parkinson. The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the
Chief Finance Ofﬁcer and others attend by invitation. The
Committee aims to meet at least once a year and during the
period met once with full attendance. 
The main role and responsibilities of the Remuneration
Committee are set out in written terms of reference, which 
are reviewed annually. During the year, the Remuneration
Committee carried out its responsibilities in accordance with 
the terms of reference and its activities are described in the
Directors’ remuneration report.
In accordance with the Committee’s terms of reference, no
Director participated in discussions relating to his terms and
conditions of service or remuneration. 
Audit Committee
Membership
The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board. It comprises 
of Non-Executive Directors. The Committee is chaired by 
Mr Parkinson. Its other members are Mr Carey and Mr Harris.
The members of the Committee have no links with the
Company’s external auditors and are independent of the
Company’s management. The Board considers that collectively
the Audit Committee has signiﬁcant recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience as detailed on page 41 and the ability to discharge 
its duties properly, gained from managing businesses of a similar
or greater size, and through extensive service on the Boards and
audit Committees of other listed companies. 
The Committee meets at least three times a year, and where
appropriate meetings coincide with key dates in the Company’s
ﬁnancial reporting and audit cycle. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and others attend by invitation.
During the period, the Audit Committee met six times.
Responsibilities
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set 
out in written terms of reference, which have been reviewed
annually as part of the Committee’s evaluation process. Copies 
of these are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The main responsibilities are:
Considering and making recommendations regarding the
appointment and removal of the external auditors
Recommending the audit fee to the Board and pre-approving
fees in respect of non-audit services provided by the external
auditors
Reviewing the nature and scope of the external audit and
monitoring the external auditor’s independence and objectivity
Monitoring the integrity in relation to the interim and 
annual ﬁnancial statements and ﬁnancial announcements 
and signiﬁcant reporting judgments therein before 
submission to the Board
Ensuring effective systems of internal ﬁnancial control,
ﬁnancial reporting and risk management are maintained
Reviewing and challenging, where necessary, the actions 
and judgment of management in relation to the quarterly,
interim and annual ﬁnancial statements before submission 
to the Board
Reviewing the Company’s procedures for handling allegations
from whistleblowers
The Company has procedures whereby staff may, in conﬁdence,
raise concerns about matters of possible impropriety, fraud,
ﬁnancial irregularity or other malpractice. 
Financial reporting
The Audit Committee has reviewed the signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the
preparation of the Group’s ﬁnancial statements including
signiﬁcant accounting policies, any changes to them and any
signiﬁcant estimates and judgments. The Audit Committee has
also reviewed the clarity and completeness of disclosures in 
the ﬁnancial statements and considered whether the disclosures
made were set properly in context. The review of the annual
report included a review of the business and ﬁnancial review 
and corporate governance relating to audit and risk management.
Internal audit
The Audit Committee reviewed the requirement for an internal
audit function during the year on behalf of the Board and
considered there was no necessity for an internal audit function,
as the Group has a small management team operating from one
location and the Board and senior management team exercise
close control over the Group’s activities. This enables the close
involvement of the Executive Director and the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer in the day-to-day operational matters of the Group. 
The Audit Committee expects to review this decision annually.
Auditors
The Committee’s terms of reference require the Audit Committee
to carry out an annual review of the independence of the
Group’s auditors, Ernst & Young LLP. Senior members of the
audit team are rotated on a regular basis. The Company has a
policy on the provision of non-audit services by the auditors. 
The implementation of the policy is continually monitored by 
the Audit Committee. The Committee has considered the
provision of non-audit services performed by the auditors 
and was satisﬁed they were and continue to be objective 
and independent of the Group. 
Investment Committee
The Company has clearly deﬁned guidelines for capital
expenditure. An Investment Committee reporting to the 
Board and chaired by Mr Edens is responsible for reviewing 
and approving all signiﬁcant individual property transactions
proposed by the Group. The Committee includes, in addition 
to the Chairman, Mr Fascitelli, Mr Harris, Mr Hopkins and 
Mr Parkinson. The Committee also monitors: the disposals 
of surplus property; rent reviews; lease renewals; development
opportunities; dilapidations settlements; and freehold 
and leasehold acquisitions.
The Committee evaluates, considers and makes recommendations
to the Board in relation to proposals for new business in terms 
of the type; ﬁt with the Company’s strategic plan; its proﬁtability
and the resources required. In addition, the Committee considers
and makes recommendations to the Board in relation to: customer
requests; invitations to tender/bid; market research; networking
information; risk evaluation and major expenditure on life cycle
and other projects in relation to the Group’s properties.

Internal control
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the signiﬁcant risks faced by the Group. The Executive
Director and senior operational management are responsible for
identifying key risks and assessing their probable impact through
formal processes at both Group and subsidiary levels. 
During 2006, the Board discharged its responsibility for internal
control through the following key procedures:
The maintenance of an organisational structure with clearly
deﬁned levels of authority and divisions of responsibilities
A comprehensive system of budgeting, planning and
reporting, which is approved by the Board and against 
which performance is regularly monitored
The formulation of policies and of approval procedures in a
number of key areas such as treasury operations and capital
expenditure. These are reviewed from time to time by the
Board to conﬁrm their adequacy
The provision of a code of conduct for employees and the
monitoring of the quality of personnel through an annual
performance appraisal process
The Group is committed to the highest standards of business
conduct and seeks to maintain these standards across all of its
operations. The Group has what it believes to be an appropriate
organisational structure for planning, executing, controlling and
monitoring business operations in order to achieve its objectives.
The Group has designed and implemented procedures to ensure
complete and accurate accounting and to limit the potential
exposure to loss of assets or fraud. Control measures undertaken
include physical controls, segregation of duties and reviews 
by management.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the effectiveness 
of the Group’s system of internal control was kept under review
during the year by the Board. This review included ﬁnancial,
operational and compliance issues. A formal evaluation was
carried out in 2006 and the Audit Committee has been 
requested to keep the matter under review.
The Board considers its policies and procedures to be robust,
whilst recognising that such a system is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives, and can provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Relations with shareholders
The Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and designated 
members of senior management are the Company’s principal
spokespersons with investors, fund managers, the press and 
other interested parties. The Board is fully informed on the
information provided to shareholders and their reactions.
As part of the Company’s effort to increase effective
communication with both investors and potential investors,
Mapeley executed a continual programme of meetings and
presentations during 2006. Management met with institutional
shareholders as and when requested and as part of formal road
show meetings in connection with its two equity fundraisings.
The Company works continually to improve the understanding 
of its objectives, strategy and performance and in the year
173 presentations were made by the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and Head of Investor Relations. These
presentations provide an opportunity to explain the Company’s
business and ﬁnancial performance and to answer questions
from investors. All such meetings are conducted within the
guidance provided by the UKLA Listing and Disclosure Rules 
on the dissemination of price sensitive information. The Board 
is regularly updated as to the views of investors, analysts and 
the media and reports are made available to the Board on
feedback received on an unattributable basis from investors. 
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
At the AGM, investors will be given the opportunity to 
question the Board and to meet with them afterwards. They 
are encouraged to participate in the Meeting. At the AGM the
Company complies with the provisions of the Code relating 
to the disclosure of proxy votes, the attendance of Committee
chairmen and the separation of resolutions. The Company
arranges for the annual report and notice of the meeting 
to be posted to shareholders in good time to allow for full
consideration prior to the AGM.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the ﬁnancial statements. 
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 49 Corporate governance
6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 49 Remuneration report
Introduction
This report sets out the Group’s remuneration policy and also gives details of the salaries, incentives, shares and pensions received by
all Directors and members of senior management of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006. The comparative information
for the period ended 31 December 2005 comprises the information for the Company for the period from incorporation on 26 April 2005
to 31 December 2005 and for the former parent company, MUCKO, for the period from 1 January 2005 to the date of its acquisition by
Mapeley Limited. 
Although a Guernsey incorporated company, Mapeley Limited’s Remuneration Report has been prepared to provide voluntary
disclosures in line with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 1985 (as amended) and the UK Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002 (the Regulations), together with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee)
The Committee’s objective is to ensure that the Company continues to be able to attract and motivate individuals with the skills 
and experience required to operate its business competitively. The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration policy for 
the Executive Director and senior management. This includes determining the terms of service agreements, salaries and discretionary
bonus payments. The Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors, Mr Carey and Mr Parkinson and is chaired by Mr Edens.
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and others attend by invitation. Further information is given in the corporate
governance report.
In determining the Directors’ remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted New Bridge Street Consultants LLP. New Bridge
Street Consultants LLP did not provide any other services to the Company or the Group during the year. 
Remuneration policy
The Committee seeks to ensure that the total remuneration received by the Executive Director and members of the Group’s senior
management team under their contracts is competitive within the property industry and set so as to motivate them to perform at 
the highest level.
In order to align the interests of the Executive Director and members of the Group’s senior management team with the interests 
of shareholders, a signiﬁcant proportion of that Director’s or those employees’ remuneration comprises annual bonuses. 
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is reviewed and determined by the Board. 
Components of executive remuneration
Base salary and beneﬁts (non performance related)
The Committee’s policy is to set the basic salaries of the Executive Director and senior managers at levels which reﬂect their role,
experience and practices in the employment market. Base salaries are reviewed annually as at 1 January. Other beneﬁts consist 
of private medical insurance cover, permanent health insurance, critical illness cover, additional salary in lieu of a company car 
and pension contributions.
Performance related remuneration
For 2006 the Committee has awarded cash bonuses to the Executive Director and senior managers based on assessment of their
individual achievements during the year and on the Company’s ﬁnancial performance. The Company’s ﬁnancial performance is
assessed based upon the performance of Mapeley in comparison to the performance of its peers. 
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the apportionment of remuneration between performance related and non performance
related elements was as follows:
Non 
Performance performance
Director related related
Jameson Hopkins 53% 47%
Wesley R Edens nil 100%
Charles Parkinson nil 100%
John Harris nil 100%
Roger Carey nil 100%
Michael Fascitelli nil 100%
Since the last annual report, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP were instructed by the Committee to carry out a review and
benchmarking exercise on the remuneration and incentive arrangements of the Executive Director and senior managers. Having
received the results of this review, the Committee concluded that the structure and level of remuneration was appropriate based 
upon the performance of the Group during the year. 
Share plan
The Group established its Employee Share Plan (the Plan) (including all Executive Directors and senior managers) during the year
ending 31 December 2005. This replaced the Leveraged Co-investment Plan (LCIP) and Performance Option Plan (POP) operated by
MUKCO, the Group’s parent Company prior to the Group reorganisation in 2005. Both the LCIP and POP were wound up during 2004.

6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 50 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 51 Remuneration report
On the Company’s admission to the Ofﬁcial List of the London Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005, ordinary shares were granted and
issued in the names of Plan members, subject to certain vesting conditions. A further grant was made on 14 December 2006 when 
the bid price of Mapeley Limited shares was £38.10. Vesting takes place over a three to ﬁve year period from the date of issue and 
is conditional on employees remaining in employment. There are no performance conditions. During the vesting period, the
participants receive dividends and the shares may be sold, but the proceeds of any sale are subject to the same vesting terms as 
the shares. 
Mr Hopkins has been granted 13,123 shares under the Plan during the year. He held an interest in 100,080 and 86,957 Plan shares 
at 31 December 2006 and 1 January 2006 respectively. These shares vest over periods up to 13 December 201 1. None of these shares
vested during the year (2005: nil).
The four independent Non-Executive Directors were each awarded 5,000 ordinary shares on appointment to the Board. The shares 
are not conditional on a qualifying vesting period. The Company is committed to making further rewards of 5,000 shares to each 
of the independent Non-Executive Directors at each of the ﬁrst two AGMs following their date of appointment providing those
Directors remain in ofﬁce at those dates. A further award of 5,000 shares was therefore given in the year ending 31 December 
2006. Mr Fascitelli received the ﬁrst and second tranches of shares during the year ended 31 December 2006. 
Full details of Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company are set out in the Directors’ report.
Policy on service contracts 
The Executive Director of the Company has a service contract in force. There is no provision for contractual termination payments,
save those payments normally due under employment law.
In accordance with best practice, Non-Executive Directors are not appointed on service contracts, but there are letters of appointment
in place for each Non-Executive Director. All of the Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years following
which they may serve up to a further two three-year terms if re-elected. If they fail to be re-elected their terms of appointment cease.
Details of the service contracts and letters of appointment of those who served as Directors during the year are as follows:
Annual Contract Duration of Notice 
Director fee (£000) date appointment period
Jameson Hopkins – 31.05.05 – 6 months
Wesley R Edens – 01.06.05 3 years 1 month
Charles Parkinson 30 01.06.05 3 years 1 month
John Harris 25 01.06.05 3 years 1 month
Roger Carey 25 01.06.05 3 years 1 month
Michael Fascitelli 25 20.12.05 3 years 1 month
Mr Edens was appointed to the Board of MUKCO prior to 2004. Mr Hopkins was initially appointed as Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of
MUKCO (not as a member of the Board) in 2004. Both Directors have continued their roles as respectively Chairman and Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer of the Mapeley Group following the creation of Mapeley Limited as its new parent company in 2005 with
Mr Hopkins being appointed to the Board of Mapeley Limited on 31 May 2005.
Information regarding senior managers below Board level 
The Group currently employs four senior managers in positions below Board level. None of these senior managers is paid at a rate
higher than the Executive Director and the structure of their remuneration package, including bonuses, is consistent with that of
the Executive Director. 
Directors’ remuneration 
For the year ended 31 December 2006, the remuneration received by the Directors was as set out in the table below:

Directors’ pension entitlements
The Executive Director is entitled to participate in a deﬁned contribution scheme. The Group contributes up to 20% of the Director’s
monthly salary to this scheme and during 2006, contributions paid or payable by the Group were £32,373 (2005: £17,850).
Performance graph
This graph illustrates the performance of the Company measured by total shareholder return (share price growth plus dividends paid)
against ‘broad equity market indices’ over the period since 15 June 2005. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index, the
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index and the FTSE EPRA Index these indices are considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the
purposes of the graph.
This graph illustrates the value, at 31 December 2006 of £100 invested in Mapeley Limited on 15 June 2005 compared with that

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Mapeley
Limited on the annual Group ﬁnancial statements for the 
year ended 31 December 2006
Introduction 
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Mapeley
Limited for the year ended 31 December 2006 which comprise 
the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement 
of changes in equity, the consolidated balance sheet, the
consolidated cash ﬂow statement and the related notes 1 to 32.
These Group ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein. 
This report is made solely to the Company's members, as 
a body, in accordance with Section 64 of The Companies
(Guernsey) Law 1994. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company's members those matters
we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit
work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Group ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with applicable Guernsey Law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted
by the European Union as set out in the statement of Directors’
responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group
ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with The Companies (Guernsey) Law 1994. We also report to 
you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with
the ﬁnancial statements, if the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, or if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit.
We read other information contained in the annual report and
consider whether it is consistent with the audited group ﬁnancial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s
statement, the operating and ﬁnancial review, the statement
concerning corporate governance and the remuneration report.
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware
of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the ﬁnancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test 
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the ﬁnancial statements. It also includes an assessment of
the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the Directors 
in the preparation of the Group ﬁnancial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group ﬁnancial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the Group ﬁnancial statements:
Give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 December 2006 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended
Have been properly prepared in accordance with

Notes to the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2006
1 General information
Mapeley Limited was registered in Guernsey on 26 April 2005 under the provisions of The Companies (Guernsey) Law, 1994. The
Company’s registered ofﬁce is located at Regency Court, Glategny Esplanade, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 1WW. The nature of the
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the ﬁnancial review. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group 
for the year ended 31 December 2006 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries and were authorised by the Board for issue on
7 March 2007. 
Amounts stated in the comparative consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in equity have been adjusted 
to reﬂect the adoption of merger accounting as set out below. 
2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards adopted for use in the European Union (IFRS) and The Companies (Guernsey) Law 1994 on the historical cost basis, 
except for investment property, non-investment property held as part of property, plant and equipment, derivative ﬁnancial
instruments and available for sale ﬁnancial assets that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to one decimal place to the nearest million (£m) except where 
otherwise indicated. The functional currency of the parent is pounds sterling. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of Mapeley Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended
31 December 2006. 
During the prior year the Group underwent a restructuring involving a share for share exchange which introduced a new holding
company, Mapeley Limited, in readiness for listing on the London Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005. At the time of the reorganisation
Mapeley Limited and Mapeley UK Co. Limited (MUKCO), the previous holding company, were under common control. MUKCO
prepared special purpose consolidated IFRS ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 in readiness for listing on the
London Stock Exchange. 
The relative rights of the former shareholders of MUKCO were not altered and this restructuring has been accounted using the merger
method of accounting, in line with guidance from UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) a similar, principles based
GAAP to IFRS. UK FRS 6 Acquisition and Mergers states that the merger method of accounting on Group restructuring is allowable
provided the relative rights of the shareholders were not altered. This basis of consolidation has been adopted as best practice by the
Group as no guidance currently exists on Group restructuring under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Although Mapeley Limited was only formed on 26 April 2005 and acquired MUKCO on 2 June 2005, the accounting information, 
in line with the merger method of accounting, has been prepared as if the Company had always been in existence in its current form.
The prior year comparatives are accordingly presented to reﬂect the Group’s reorganisation and its accounting in accordance with the
merger method of accounting. 
Except as noted above in connection with the formation of the Mapeley Limited Group, subsidiaries are consolidated from the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred from the
Group. The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent
accounting policies. All intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Statement of compliance
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Mapeley Limited have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. This is consistent with IFRS as
adopted for use in the EU as it applies to the ﬁnancial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2006. In preparing the
annual ﬁnancial statements, the accounting principles applied reﬂect the amendments to IFRS and the adoption of those new IFRS
which have become effective since 1 January 2006. 
IFRS issued but not yet effective
The Group has not adopted the following standards in the preparation of ﬁnancial statements as they were either not effective at
31 December 2006 or not applicable to the Group’s business:
Standard Effective date
IAS 1 (para 124A-124C) Presentation of Financial Statements Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007
IFRS 8 Operating Segments Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Periods commencing on or after 1 May 2006
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives Periods commencing on or after 1 June 2006
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment Periods commencing on or after 1 November 2006
IFRIC 1 1 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Shares Periods commencing on or after 1 March 2007
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements Periods commencing on or after 1 January 2008
The Group is still evaluating the impact that these standards will have on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements, if any, but expect that 
there will be no material impact when implemented.
6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 58 2.2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies 
A summary of the signiﬁcant accounting policies is set out below. These have been applied consistently in the current and previous
ﬁnancial years.
Revenue
Revenue recognised in the income statement represents amounts receivable in respect of contractual income, property rental income,
other property and trading activity and interest income earned in the normal course of business, net of V AT and other sales-related
taxes, as follows:
Contractual revenue
The Group’s gross contractual revenue comprises income earned by its property outsourcing businesses, and rentals and service
charges received from tenants.
Contracts entered into under the UK Government’s Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme are unbundled, either at inception or on 
any reassessment of the arrangement. Income from the embedded leases, principally contractual and third party rents, is distinguished
from income from the other contract elements. Amounts receivable under PFI contracts in respect of the provision of property to
customers are treated in accordance with the provisions of IAS 17 Leases (with the minimum lease payments being spread on a
straight line basis over the life of the lease). However, the cost and revenue proﬁles of the portion of the contract concerned with the
provision of property related services are treated as arising from service contracts in accordance with IAS 18 Revenue. Revenues
earned from property outsourcing businesses are subject to variation due to the ﬂexible occupational rights conferred by those
contracts. 
Income from service contracts where payment is received by a ﬁxed unitary charge is recognised and accounted for according to 
the stage reached in the contract by reference to the value of work completed. Income from other service contracts is recognised and
accounted for according to the stage reached in the contract by reference to the costs of work completed. An appropriate estimate of
the proﬁt attributable to the work undertaken is recognised once the outcomes of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty. 
In addition to service charges, as part of certain property outsourcing contracts, the Group is also responsible for procuring certain
additional goods and services supplied to its customers. The direct costs of supplying these goods are invoiced to the Group and
recharged to customers in full. As the Group receives a pre-determined fee for managing such activity on behalf of its customers 
and the risks in relation to the provision of these goods and services are primarily borne by the Group’s customers, revenue for this
activity recorded by the Group comprises the net income earned by the Group from this activity in each ﬁnancial reporting period.
Property trading income
Income earned from property trading consists of proceeds from the sale of trading properties. Sales are recognised on completion 
of sale contracts.
Interest income
Interest income is the interest earned on cash held in bank accounts and is recognised in the accounts on an accruals basis.
Rental income receivable under operating leases
Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except for 
contingent income which is recognised when it arises.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the non-cancellable period of the lease, even if the
payments are not made on such a basis. Premiums received to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement 
when they arise.
Rentals payable under operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the period to the ﬁrst break, 
if shorter. Incentives given by lessors to enter into lease agreements, including asset management receipts, are spread evenly 
over the shorter of the lease term or the period to the ﬁrst break as a reduction of rental expense, even if the payments are 
not made on such a basis. 
Premiums paid to amend or terminate leases are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Investment property
Freehold property held to earn rent or for capital appreciation or both is classiﬁed as investment property in accordance with 
IAS 40 Investment Property. Property held under ﬁnance leases for similar purposes is also classiﬁed as investment property. 
Investment property is measured initially at cost, including transaction costs, and thereafter is stated at fair value, which reﬂects
market conditions at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are 
included in the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Property, plant and equipment
Property
Where the Group provides signiﬁcant levels of ancillary services to the occupiers of its property, this property is not classiﬁed 
as investment property. Such freehold property and property held under ﬁnance leases are revalued to fair value annually and
depreciated in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment. Surpluses or deﬁcits on individual properties are transferred 
to the revaluation reserve, except that deﬁcits including impairment adjustments below historical cost are taken to the income
statement. Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve in equity except to the extent that it reverses a decrease 
in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the income statement, in which case the increase is recognised in 
the income statement. A revaluation deﬁcit is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent of any existing surplus in
respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.

6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 59 Notes to the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2006 (continued)
2.2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
A transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings for the difference between depreciation based on the carrying
amount of the assets and that based on the asset’s original cost. Additionally, accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date 
is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the net amount is restated to the revalued amount of the asset. 
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Plant and equipment
Plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Premiums on operating leases
Premiums on operating leases are stated at cost less amortisation and any additional provision for impairment which may be required.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated
residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life.
Buildings are classiﬁed according to their condition and date of construction, and are depreciated over periods between 20 and 
50 years according to this classiﬁcation. Buildings held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the terms of the leases if shorter
Premiums paid for operating leases are amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining lease terms
Plant and equipment, excluding information systems equipment, are depreciated over four years
Information systems equipment, including computer equipment and telecommunications apparatus is depreciated over two 
to four years
No depreciation charge is applied to land
The useful economic life and residual values of all property, plant and equipment is reassessed annually.
Pre-contract costs
Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until it is virtually certain that a contract will be awarded, from which time further 
pre-contract costs are recognised as an asset and charged as an expense over the life of the contract. Amounts recovered in respect 
of costs that have been written off are deferred and amortised over the life of the contract. 
Acquisitions of corporate interests in property 
Acquisitions of corporate interests in property are accounted for on consolidation as if the Group had acquired the underlying
property directly. Accordingly, no goodwill arises on such acquisitions. Any difference between the fair values of the property 
and the acquisition consideration are allocated to the investment property asset, which is subject to subsequent revaluation to 
its market value under IAS 40 Investment Property.
Non-current assets held for sale
Items of property, plant and equipment are transferred to non-current assets held for sale when it is expected that their carrying
amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than from continuing use in the business in accordance with IFRS 5 Non
current assets held for sale. On re-classiﬁcation any depreciation of the assets ceases (even if the assets are still being used by the
Group), and in the case of investment property each asset is carried at its fair value less cost of realisation and in the case ofother
assets, each asset is carried at the lower of its previous carrying value and fair value less cost of realisation. Any impairment
adjustment below historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Long-term service contract balances
Where costs incurred plus recognised proﬁts less recognised losses exceed progress billings on long-term service contracts other 
than those contracts for which the Group receives a ﬁxed unitary charge, the balance is shown as an asset within trade and other
receivables. Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised proﬁts less recognised losses on long-term service 
contracts, the balance is shown as a liability within trade and other payables. 
Finance leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a ﬁnance lease, is based on the substance of the arrangement and
requires an assessment of whether the fulﬁlment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a speciﬁc asset or assets and 
whether the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and beneﬁts incidental to ownership of the leased item, are
capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to the income statement as they arise. 
Impairment of assets
The Group assesses, at each reporting date, whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If the carrying amount 
of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows of the asset are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount 
rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset. Impairment losses are
recognised in the income statement.
60 Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2006 Notes to the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements
6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 60 2.2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses 
may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognised
impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since 
the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment
loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement unless the asset is carried at
revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase. After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is
adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its
remaining useful life.
Inventories
Trading property
Property acquired and held with the intention of being sold, is included in inventories at the lower of cost and net realisable value,
being the market value less expected costs of sale.
Work in progress
The costs of service contracts not yet taken to the income statement, less any foreseeable losses and payments on account, are shown
within inventories as work in progress.
Asset management receipts
Asset management receipts, which represent premiums given by lessors in return for the Group extending its existing lease terms or
removing break clauses from existing leases, are deferred and released as a credit to operating costs evenly over the shorter ofthe
lease term and the ﬁrst break, even if payments are not made on such a basis.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. 
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able 
to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned. Balances are written off when the 
probability of recovery is assessed as being remote. 
Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, short-term deposits held at call with banks and other 
short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
Derecognition of ﬁnancial liabilities
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing ﬁnancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of
an existing liability are substantially modiﬁed, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a derecognition of the original liability
and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are stated at cost.
Provisions
Provision is made in respect of costs incurred on vacant leasehold properties or for leasehold properties sublet at a level which renders
a property loss-making over the length of the lease, being the net cash outﬂow committed to be incurred over the lives of the leases.
The cash ﬂows for each such lease are discounted back to the balance sheet date, representing the Group’s best estimate of the impact
of the time value of money and the risks inherent in its obligations. Any increase or decrease in the provision is taken to the income
statement each ﬁnancial period. The unwinding of the discount in the provision is charged to the income statement each year within
ﬁnance costs. The basis of the provision, the discount rate applied and amounts provided are reviewed semi-annually. 
Share-based payments
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which shares are
granted. Fair value, in the case of shares issued at the date of the Company’s IPO and the two further equity raises, is the offer 
price. Fair value at all other dates is determined as the bid price quoted on the London Stock Exchange at the date of the grant.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the
service conditions are fulﬁlled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (the vesting
date). The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reﬂects the
extent to which the vesting period has expired. The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in
cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modiﬁed, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
modiﬁed. In addition, an expense is recognised for any modiﬁcation, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment
arrangement, or is otherwise beneﬁcial to the employee as measured at the date of modiﬁcation.
Where an equity-settled award does not meet the vesting conditions, the expense recognised in the income statement is reversed, 
as if it had not vested, on the date of cancellation. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated 
as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modiﬁcation of
the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

2.2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Treasury shares
Treasury shares represent those shares returned to the Company as a result of members withdrawing from the Employee Share Plan.
They are accounted for as a deduction from equity at their cost of acquisition. 
Share premium
Costs related to the issue of ordinary shares are charged against share premium.
Financial instruments
Interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration received less directly attributable transactions costs.
After initial recognition, interest and non-interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium 
on settlement. 
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or otherwise cancellation of liabilities are recognised in ﬁnance income and
ﬁnance expense respectively. 
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments 
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge its risks associated with interest rate
ﬂuctuations. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. Such derivative
ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into and are
subsequently remeasured at fair value. 
Fair value for a swap is market value, as determined by a break cost quote prepared by an experienced, independent broker, which is
estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash ﬂows. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive
and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives with the characteristics of a hedge and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is
documented at its inception and designated as a hedge. This documentation identiﬁes the hedging instrument, the hedged item or
transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. Such hedges are
expected at inception to be highly effective. 
For the purpose of hedge accounting, interest rate swaps are designated as cash ﬂow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability
in cash ﬂows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction. 
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the
income statement for the year. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value
are recognised in equity under net unrealised gains or losses.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for
hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity
until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge
accounting, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the year. 
Current taxation
Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to
the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted by
the balance sheet date.
The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel Islands and is not subject to local taxation. Certain Group
undertakings are subject to foreign taxes in respect of foreign source income, including UK income tax on rental income.
Deferred taxation
Deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for ﬁnancial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the ﬁnancial statements, with the following exceptions:
Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is 
not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the
temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁt will be available against which
deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised

6818 Accounts 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:33  Page 62 2.2 Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset
is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance
sheet date.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme. The amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement beneﬁts is the contributions payable for the year. Differences between contributions payable for the year 
and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
2.3 Signiﬁcant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with IFRS requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect 
the value at which certain assets and liabilities are held at the balance sheet date and also the amounts of revenue and expenditure
recorded in the period. The Directors believe the accounting policies chosen are appropriate to the circumstances and that the
estimates, judgements and assumptions involved in its ﬁnancial reporting are reasonable. Accounting estimates made by Mapeley’s
Directors are based on historical experience and on information available to them at the time each estimate is made. Accordingly,
actual outcomes may differ materially from current expectations under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting policies
that are subject to signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions are set out below.
Property valuations
Investment properties are accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property and are held at fair value. Any surplus or
deﬁcit on revaluation is recognised in the Income Statement. Under the relevant provisions of IFRS, the properties held under the
HMRC portfolio are considered to be property, plant and equipment because of the signiﬁcant levels of facilities management services
provided on them. These properties are revalued at each balance sheet date.
For both the investment properties and property, plant and equipment, the annual valuations are based upon estimates and 
subjective judgements that may vary from the actual values and sales prices that may be realised by the Group upon ultimate 
disposal. The critical assumptions made relating to valuations have been disclosed in notes 10 and 1 1 to the ﬁnancial statements. 
Rental income
Rental income receivable under operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, except where income
is contingent in which case it is recognised as it arises. The Group’s outsourcing contracts with Abbey and HMRC are subject to annual
uplifts in rental income. Receipts from HMRC are considered contingent as they are subject to annual uplifts related to RPI and
uncertainty of income due to the vacation rights that exist within the HMRC contract. On the Abbey contract the considerable
ﬂexibility of occupation conferred by Abbey’s vacation rights also makes contract revenue contingent. 
Operating lease incentives
The Group treats any incentives for tenants to enter into lease agreements as a reduction to revenue and accounts for rental income
from the commencement of any rent free period. The net rental income is spread evenly over the shorter of the period to the ﬁrst break
of the lease and the lease term. Similarly the Group treats any incentives given by landlords on the Group’s leasehold properties as 
an offset to the rental cost and accounts for such rental reductions from the commencement date of any rent free periods over the
shorter of the period to the ﬁrst break of the lease and the lease term. The net rental incentive is spread evenly over the shorter of the
period to the ﬁrst break of the lease or lease expiry. This straight-lining of rent may cause rental income or expense to be recognised
in a manner that does not conform to rental receipts or payments. As at 31 December 2006, accrued rent payable of £2.6 million
(2005: £2.0 million) and accrued rent receivable of £6.5 million (2005: £7.3 million) was included within ‘Trade and other payables’
and ‘Trade and other receivables’ respectively. 
Onerous lease provision
Provision is made in respect of costs incurred on vacant leasehold properties or for leasehold properties sublet to tenants at a level of
rent that would cause the properties to realise losses over the remaining terms of leases as set out in note 19. The annual projections 
of cash ﬂows for onerous leases are based upon estimates and subjective judgements and they may vary from the actual costs incurred
on such onerous leases. These estimates are driven from the Group’s core business management systems and property databases which
reﬂect the Director’s best expectations of the likely outcome of each property at any point in time. The forecast cash ﬂows are
discounted to the annual discount rate at a rate estimated to reﬂect the Group’s time value of money.
Long-term service contracts
The Group receives regular income under its outsourcing contracts, however its life cycle activity does not arise in such a regular
manner. Accordingly, certain costs incurred under the service contract element of outsourcing contracts are deferred and classiﬁed 
as work in progress. The amounts deferred are estimates from the Group’s ﬁnancial forecasting models and expectations of future
occupancy which reﬂect the Directors’ best expectations of the likely outcome under these contracts at any point in time. 
In respect of other service contracts proﬁt is recognised over the course of the contract according to the stage reached in the contract.
An appropriate estimate of the proﬁt attributable to the work undertaken is recognised once the outcomes of the contracts can be
assessed with reasonable certainty. The estimate of proﬁt attributable to the contract is based upon the Director’s best expectations 
of costs to be incurred.

3 Revenue and segmental information
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two segments in line with the Group’s business model – Outsourcing
Contracts and Direct Property Investments. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The segments are described below:
Outsourcing Contracts
This segment consists of activities arising from the purchase and subsequent leaseback of the HMRC and Abbey property portfolios
and the ﬁt-out and delivery of serviced accommodation under the IPS contract. The main characteristics of these arrangements are
listed below:
Long-term contracts (the contracts run over periods from three to 20 years)
Agreements are tailored in accordance with the client’s accommodation requirements (from simple purchase and lease back to fully
serviced accommodation)
The HMRC and Abbey agreements allow them to exercise ﬂexibility to vacate properties within deﬁned parameters 
Under the HMRC and Abbey agreements the revenue earned is subject to annual increases
Direct Property Investments
The segment previously known as ‘Investment property’ has been renamed ‘Direct Property Investments’ .
The Group has embarked on a separate strategy of acquiring individual and portfolios of ofﬁce property. The Group’s activities within
this segment will focus on purchasing property primarily let to strong credit quality tenants, who are likely to stay in the properties 
for a minimum term of ﬁve years. 
The Group has a single geographical segment, being the UK commercial property market.

5 Employee beneﬁts expense (continued)
Employee share beneﬁt expense
During 2005, the Group established its Employee Share Plan (the Plan), which replaced the Group’s Leveraged Co-investment Plan 
and Performance Option Plan, both of which were wound up during 2004. On the Group’s admission to the Ofﬁcial List of the London
Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005, 291,308 ordinary shares were granted and issued in the names of Plan members subject to certain
vesting conditions. A further 13,059 new shares were granted and issued on 17 March 2006. Vesting takes place over periods of up to
5 years from the date of issue and is conditional on employees remaining in employment; there are no performance conditions. During
the vesting period, the participants receive dividends and the shares may be sold, but the proceeds of any sale are subject to the same
vesting terms as the shares. 
Two further awards of 2,173 shares and 45,740 shares were granted on 8 May 2006 and 14 December 2006 respectively and were
issued out of shares that had been returned to the Company as a result of members withdrawing from the Plan. Following these issues,
698 shares remained having been returned to the Company (2005: 1,460 shares).
The total cost to the Group of shares issued under the Plan of £8.8 million (2005: £6.7 million) is to be spread over the relevant vesting
periods; 30% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant and the remaining 40% will vest on the last
business day before the ﬁfth anniversary of the date of grant. 
Non-Executive Director share beneﬁt expense
During 2005 four Non-Executive Directors were each awarded 15,000 ordinary shares. 5,000 shares each vest on the date of grant 
and after each of the ﬁrst two annual general meetings following the date of appointment. The total cost to the Group of shares 
issued or granted to Non-Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2005 of £1,438,000 is to be spread over the relevant
vesting periods.

7 Income tax expense
No income tax is chargeable to the income statement or the statement of changes in equity in the current year in respect of Guernsey,
UK or other overseas taxation, other than the tax credit recognised in the current year as a result of the recognition of deferred tax
assets amounting to £10.9 million.

The weighted average income tax rate for the year of 10.8% (2005: 24.5%) is based on the weighted average tax rate applicable 
across the Group’s operations. This has been calculated by dividing (1) Group companies' proﬁts before tax multiplied by the tax 
rate applicable for each Group company by (2) the Group's proﬁt before tax.

7 Income tax expense (continued)
The Group has additional tax losses and deductions that will be available indeﬁnitely for offset against future taxable proﬁts of the
companies in which the losses and deductions arose. The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets in respect of some of
these losses (as stated above). In addition, the Group has the following unrecognised deferred tax assets. The assets have not been
recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and the timing of utilisation.

9 Earnings per share
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share ﬁgures is based on the following:
Net proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of £53.8 million (year ended 31 December 2005: loss of
£56.5 million)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares (after deducting 698 treasury shares relinquished by members of the Employee 
Share Plan during the year) for basic earnings per share: 26,887,700 (year ended 31 December 2005: 19,510,770 after deducting
1,460 treasury shares relinquished by members of the Employee Share Plan)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares (after deducting 698 treasury shares relinquished by members of the Employee 
Share Plan during the year) for diluted earnings per share: 26,903,833 (year ended 31 December 2005: 19,527,249 after deducting
1,460 treasury shares relinquished by members of the Employee Share Plan)
The difference between the number of shares used for the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation represents the weighted
average number of shares awarded but not yet issued to Non-Executive Directors of 16,133 (2005: 16,479), refer to note 5.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and 
the date of completion of the ﬁnancial statements.

ﬁnance leases at 31 December 2006 of £41.7 million (2005: £37.6 million) were valued at 31 December 2006 by Savills Commercial
Limited (Savills), a valuer external to the Group, as part of the valuation of all the valuable properties held by the Group under the
HMRC contract. These valuations have been incorporated into the annual ﬁnancial statements. Savills have consented to the use of
their name in these ﬁnancial statements. The total of this valuation at 31 December 2006 was £560.1 million (2005: £566.6 million)
and an analysis of where the assets valued are recorded in the ﬁnancial statements is shown in the table below:

Property acquired under ﬁnance leases 41.7 37.6

Properties held within premiums on operating leases 39.2 38.6
Properties held as non-current assets held for sale – 3.1
Total valuation of the Group’s assets valued by Savills 560.1 566.6
Long leasehold properties with a valuation of £39.2 million (2005: £38.6 million) are classiﬁed as premiums on operating leases 
and are recorded at historical cost less amortisation (see note 12). During the year no properties were reclassiﬁed as ‘non current 
assets held for sale’ (2005: £3.1 million). 
The valuations at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors' (RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Standards published in February 2003 (the Red Book) and the CESR Guidance 
on property valuations. 
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is deﬁned as follows:
‘The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
in an arms-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without
compulsion. ’
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were speciﬁc to the Group: 
For the purpose of the valuations, each property has been valued individually and not as part of a portfolio notwithstanding the
overriding terms of the Group's contract with HMRC and the non-assignable nature of this contract. The valuations assume that 
the contract is freely assignable in the open market
No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation nor for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a
property. The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs (if any)
Purchasers' costs have been deducted in arriving at the valuations. These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees (fees include
V AT at 17.5%) and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property
Under the terms of the contract with HMRC, it is entitled to bring a proportion of its leases to an end earlier than the 20-year term
and vacate the premises subject to (i) 12 months' notice; and (ii) agreed limits on the amount and type of space that can be vacated
each year. The valuations assumed a hypothetical weighted average lease term for the leases with HMRC to reﬂect these termination
rights, and taking into account HMRC's stated intentions. These hypothetical weighted average lease terms are as follows:
Properties designated ‘Core’ by the HMRC contract – leased until 31 March 2021
Properties designated ‘Intermediate’ by the HMRC contract – leased until the contractual lease expiry date
Properties designated ‘Flexible’ by the HMRC contract – leased until 30 September 201 1
HMRC pays the Group amounts under the contract which cover the charge both for the accommodation provided and the related
services. The payment is subject to deductions for failures to meet speciﬁed performance standards and unavailability for use.
Services provided to HMRC include maintenance, life cycle replacement, cleaning, help desk, security, catering, childcare, health 
and safety, utilities, equipment management, churn, vending and landscaping. The valuations rely upon the Group for its assessment
of the cost of providing these services, the level of deductions and how they will vary over time
The valuations have been carried out by taking account of the beneﬁt of the contract with HMRC and the various occupational
leases and the subsequent sale of the property at expiry of these arrangements. In assessing the future sales proceeds, Savills have
estimated the current vacant possession value of the properties and assumed that these decline in real terms at rates between 0.5%
and 1.25% per annum. In order to arrive at their valuation, Savills discounted net annual rents receivable at a weighted average 
rate of 6.1% and residual sales values were discounted at a weighted average rate of 10.0%

10 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Certain other properties held under ﬁnance leases and included within property, plant and equipment were valued in accordance with
the Red Book by the Directors at a Market Value of £2.2 million (2005: £2.4 million) having taken advice from a suitably-qualiﬁed
employee (a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors).
The valuations for the ﬁnance leases were determined by: 
Taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property
Using appropriate discount rates that reﬂect the incremental borrowing rate of the Group at the time the leases were taken out, being
9%. (2005: 9%)
If freehold property and property acquired under ﬁnance leases were measured using the historical cost model, the carrying amounts
would be as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
Freehold
Cost 189.8 190.8
Accumulated depreciation (3.5) (3.2)

Accumulated depreciation (2.4) (2.3)
Net book value 21.3 21.4
All leased assets are pledged as security for the related ﬁnance lease obligation.
As set out in note 18, freehold property and property acquired under ﬁnance leases have been secured against external borrowings.

It is the Group’s policy to carry investment property at fair value in accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ . Investment property
was valued at 31 December 2006 by CB Richard Ellis Limited (CBRE) and Savills, valuers external to the Group.
These valuations have been incorporated into the annual ﬁnancial statements. Both Savills and CBRE have consented to the use of
their names in these ﬁnancial statements. 
Investment property comprises the Group’s Abbey portfolio and its direct property investments. CBRE’s valuation of the Abbey
portfolio of properties was £575.7 million (2005: £546.5 million). Certain properties with a valuation of £nil (2005: £1.8 million)
included within this valuation are being marketed for sale and as such are classiﬁed as trading properties within inventories. 
They are carried at the lower of cost and fair value less costs of realisation (see note 13). 
In addition certain properties with a valuation of £3.0 million have been identiﬁed for sale within the next 12 months and have
therefore been transferred to non-current assets held for sale. Of this amount £2.5 million has been valued by the Directors and the
remaining £0.5 million is included within the assets valued by CBRE. These are carried at fair value less costs of realisation in the
ﬁnancial statements (see note 13). 
Savills and CBRE both carried out valuations of the Group’s other properties held within investment property, which were valued 
at £53.1 million (2005: £24.8 million), and £850.6 million (2005: £504.4 million) respectively as at 31 December 2006. 
The remaining properties held under Property acquired under ﬁnance leases were valued by the Directors at a Market Value of
£4.2 million (2005: £3.5 million), having taken advice from a suitably-qualiﬁed employee (a member of The Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors).

The valuations at 31 December 2006 and 2005 have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors'
(RICS) Appraisal and Valuation Standards published in February 2003 (the Red Book) and the CESR Guidance on property valuations. 
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is set out in note 10.
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were speciﬁc to the Group: 
No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation or for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal 
of a property. The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs (if any)
Purchasers' costs have been deducted in arriving at our valuations. These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees (fees include
V AT at 17.5%) and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property
The valuations have been undertaken assuming (except as otherwise disclosed to us) that in the case of the Abbey properties, 
each property is subject to a standard-form lease agreed between the Group and Abbey and that these leases commenced on
1 January 2001 without options to break on the part of either the tenant or the landlord. There are overriding provisions for 
Abbey to terminate occupational leases earlier than the original lease end date. These are set out within a master agreement 
entered into with Abbey. In the case of the DPI properties, the valuation for each of the properties has been undertaken 
determined by the speciﬁc term of the individual leases
Abbey's ability to exercise its right to end leases and vacate property early is constrained by the fact that the aggregate rent 
payable by Abbey in the following years of the master agreement's 20-year term cannot fall below the following percentages 
of the projected aggregate rents for those years:
Years 5 to 6 95%
Years 7 to 1 1 85%
Years 12 to 15 80%
Years 16 to 20 90%
Constraints over the remaining investment properties are determined by the speciﬁc term of the individual leases
In return for the ﬂexibility in the Abbey portfolio, there are compensation mechanisms provided within the master agreement 
which are intended broadly to leave the Group in a neutral position. Whilst invariably the computation on a property by property
basis may result in some properties being under compensated or vice versa, the valuations consider that overall the position is
indeed likely to remain neutral
It should also be noted that the rental increments broadly hold the rental ﬂow at a similar level even on the presupposition 
that Abbey exercises maximum ﬂexibility
The Directors valued certain ﬁnance leases at 31 December 2006, having taken advice from a suitably qualiﬁed employee 
(a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors), on the following basis: 
Taking into account the estimated future income stream from each property

being 7.5%

As at 31 December 2006 the Group had decided to dispose of two investment properties. These properties have been actively marketed
and it is anticipated that these disposals will take place early in 2007. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 5, these properties
have been transferred from investment properties and are held at the lower of carrying value and fair value less estimated costs of
realisation. Properties transferred in 2005 from Property, plant and equipment have been sold during 2006 (see note 4). All non-
current assets held for sale relate to the Group’s ‘Outsourcing Contracts’ segment.
All non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2006 had previously been recorded within investment property and carried at fair
value. All non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2005 had previously been recorded within property, plant and equipment;
their carrying amount under the historical cost model as at that date would have been £1.0 million.

16 Cash and short-term deposits
Cash and short-term deposits earn interest at ﬂoating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for
varying periods of between one day and one month depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest 
at the respective short-term deposit rates. The fair value of cash and short-term deposits at 31 December 2006 was £77.3 million
(2005: £81.2 million).

On 27 January 2006, through an additional public offering, the Company issued 4,036,697 ordinary shares to investors at a price of
£27.25 each. On 1 1 October 2006 a further 2,876,923 ordinary shares were issued at a price of £32.50 per share. The Company also
issued 13,059 new shares to employees under the Employee Share Plan and 25,000 ordinary shares to the Non-Executive Directors
during the period. The ordinary shares issued to the Employee Share Plan and to the Non-Executive Directors were issued for £nil
consideration. 
Ordinary shares have no restrictions attached and entitle all shareholders to one vote for each share held and to the assets of the
Company on any winding up after settlement of all liabilities.
The restructuring of the Group during the prior year involved a share for share exchange, which introduced a new holding company,
Mapeley Limited. The relative rights of the former shareholders of MUKCO were not altered and this restructuring has been accounted
for using the merger method of accounting. Although Mapeley Limited was only formed on 26 April 2005 and acquired MUKCO on
2 June 2005, the accounting information on the Group has been prepared as if the Group had always been in existence in its current
form.
At 31 December 2006, 698 shares (2005: 1,460 shares) had been returned to the Group following withdrawal of members from the
Plan. These shares are held for the beneﬁt of the Group under trust. 47,913 shares were issued to employees under the Employee 
Share Plan during the year out of shares that had been returned by Plan members leaving the Company prior to shares vesting. 
Share premium
Share premium represents the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares over the nominal value of those shares. Costs incurred
in issuing shares of £3.9 million and £2.8 million in respect of the new share issues on 25 January 2006 and 1 1 October 2006
respectively (2005: £8.4 million) have been deducted from share premium during the year from both the Company and the Group.
Net unrealised gains/(losses)
This reserve records movements in the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments held as cash ﬂow hedges net of deferred taxes.
Asset revaluation reserve
The asset revaluation reserve is used to record increases in the fair value of non-investment properties and decreases to the extent 
that such decrease relates to an increase on the same asset previously recognised in equity and is recognised net of deferred taxes.
Any decrease below historical costs is recognised in the income statement.
Other reserves
Other reserves include contributed surplus, capital contribution and share beneﬁts expense.
Contributed surplus and capital contribution
The contributed surplus and capital contribution of MUKCO were reclassiﬁed as other reserves as part of the Group restructuring
which occurred during the prior year. This involved a share for share exchange with shareholders of MUKCO, which introduced a 
new holding company, Mapeley Limited. The contributed surplus represented the excess of proceeds raised on the issue of shares 
over the nominal value of those shares. During the prior year, £29.0 million of contributed surplus was repaid to the shareholders. 
The capital contribution was an irrevocable offer to contribute capital on demand made by the shareholders of MUKCO in 2002. This
contribution was called and received during the prior year. There have been no further movements in the current year. Contributed
surplus is available for distribution to the members of the Company provided that following any distribution the Company continues
to have net assets and is able to meet its liabilities as they fall due. The capital contribution is available to be used for the purpose of
providing additional funds in the event that obligations exceed available resources. It is not available for distribution to the members.

Share beneﬁts expense
Other reserves includes a credit of £1.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2006 (2005: £0.9 million) in respect of shares issued
under the Plan to employees and charged to the income statement. The total estimated cost to the Group of £8.8 million (2005:
£6.7 million) is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods. Other reserves also include a credit of £0.5 million (2005: £0.8 million)
which relates to a share beneﬁts expense for shares issued to the four Non-Executive Directors and charged to the income statement.
These Directors were awarded 15,000 shares each during the prior year and vest on dates ranging between the date of grant and the
conclusion of the second AGM following the date of appointment to the Board. The total estimated cost to the Group is spread over 
the periods from the date of grant to the date at which the beneﬁts vest. Further details are set out in note 5.

All of the Group’s properties, as valued by Savills and CBRE (see note 10, 1 1, 12 and 13), have been secured against the Group’s loan
facilities The loan balances above represent the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2006 on the following facilities:
Term loan under the HMRC portfolio facility
During the period the Group entered into a new 15-year, £176.0 million ﬁxed rate loan secured on properties held under the HMRC
portfolio. The interest rate payable on this facility is a ﬁxed rate of 4.5% plus a margin of 0.65% for the ﬁrst seven years of the loan
increasing to 2.25% for the remainder of the loan, plus mandatory costs (if any).
Term loan under the Abbey portfolio facility
The Abbey portfolio is ﬁnanced by a £455.0 million, seven-year loan which is secured against all investment property held in the
Abbey portfolio and by a charge over the investments of Mapeley Columbus Holdings Limited. The loan is repayable in 2012. Interest
on the loan is paid quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 0.95% plus mandatory costs (if any). The borrowers have entered into separate
interest rate agreements to ﬁx the interest payable.

Acquisition term loan 
Mapeley’s direct investment portfolio is partly ﬁnanced with a ten-year, £170.9 million term loan. At inception the loan had a loan to
value ratio of 70%. There is no amortisation during its term and the loan is repayable in July 2015. The interest payable on this loan 
is ﬁxed at 4.95% plus a 0.75% margin. 
Beta acquisition term loan 
Mapeley’s direct investment portfolio is further ﬁnanced with another ten-year, £208.6 million term loan. At inception the loan had 
a loan to value ratio of 75%. There is no amortisation during its term and the loan is repayable in April 2016. The interest payable 
on this loan is ﬁxed at 4.53% plus a 0.85% margin. 
Gamma acquisition term loan 
Mapeley’s direct investment portfolio is further ﬁnanced with another ten-year, £231.3 million term loan. At inception the loan had 
a loan to value ratio of 75%. There is no amortisation during its term and the loan is repayable in January 2017. The interest payable
on this loan is currently ﬁxed at 4.28% plus a 0.67% margin, however the interest payable increases by 0.20% each year until the 
end of the loan. 
Revolving Delta acquisition facility
The Group has a three-year, £300.0 million Revolving acquisition facility to ﬁnance further property investments. Acquisitions under
this facility are initially fully debt ﬁnanced and will be reﬁnanced using a mix of long-term debt and equity at a later date. The
facility is repayable in April 2008. The interest rate payable on the facility is LIBOR plus a margin of between 1.0% and 1.15 % plus
mandatory costs (if any). The Group has also put in place a ten-year, 4.37% £20.7 million swap to ﬁx part of its anticipated long-term
exposure to interest rate risk on these property acquisitions.
Working capital facility 
The Group has a £25.0 million working capital facility which ends in June 2007 with an option to extend the term for one year until
June 2008. At 31 December 2006, £nil was drawn down. The interest rate payable on the facility is LIBOR plus 2.0% plus mandatory
costs (if any). The loan is guaranteed by Mapeley Limited.
Finance leases
Certain of the Group’s investment properties, properties held within property, plant and equipment and properties held under short-
term leases are accounted for as ﬁnance leases. These leases have no terms of renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses other
than periodic reviews to increase rents payable to market rates as required. 
Future minimum lease payments under ﬁnance leases together with the present value of the net minimum lease payments are as
follows:
2006 2005

Rental payments on ﬁnance leases in excess of these minimum payments (contingent rents) are expensed in the year in which they 
are incurred and amounted to £485,000 in the year ended 31 December 2006 (2005: £40,000).

the properties loss-making over the remaining life of the lease. The provision represents the Directors’ estimate of the net cash ﬂows
on the properties over the shorter of the period over which the property is expected to remain vacant and the remaining lease term,
discounted at a rate of 6.0% (2005: 5.5%), being the yield of a high quality real estate backed bond with similar maturity to the

22 Pension costs
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme. The pension charge for the year amounted to £0.3 million (2005: £0.2 million).
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund. The Group does not
operate any deﬁned beneﬁt schemes.
23 Commitments and contingencies 
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee
The Group leases a number of commercial properties under operating leases. Typically the leases provide for upwards-only rent
reviews during the lease term and last 20 years from inception. Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating
leases as at 31 December analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows:
2006 2005 
£m £m
Less than one year 163.1 162.5
Between one and ﬁve years 567.0 573.9
More than ﬁve years 705.9 776.6
1,436.0 1,513.0
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessor
The Group’s portfolio of receivable operating leases comprises a block of leases purchased in December 2000, together with another
block of leases, embedded within outsourcing contracts purchased in 2001 (which also provide for the supply of other property-related
services) and some subsequent additions. 
These leases are non-cancellable and have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years. The Group’s leases typically include a clause either
to enable upward revision of the rental charge on an annual basis based on prevailing market conditions or a ﬁxed annual uplift of
3% or RPI and provide for the lessee to pay all insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
Future minimum rentals receivable under other non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December, analysed by the period in which
they fall due are as follows:
2006 2005 
£m £m
Less than one year 157.1 135.5
Between one and ﬁve years 537.1 474.2
More than ﬁve years 763.9 828.2

Income from operating leases embedded in the Group’s outsourcing contracts entered into under the UK Government’s PFI scheme 
are not included in the above table. Minimum payments cannot be established with certainty under the terms of the contract as 
the contract provides for ﬂexibility for the Government to relinquish space and consequently demand and revenue are uncertain.
Total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases in respect of properties acquired
under ﬁnance leases at 31 December 2006 were £65.8 million (2005: £46.3 million).

conclusion of the second AGM following their dates of appointment.
24 Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group's principal ﬁnancial instruments comprise bank loans, ﬁnance leases and cash. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial
instruments is to ﬁnance the Group's Property Portfolio. The Group has various other ﬁnancial instruments such as trade receivables
and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group has also entered into interest rate swap agreements in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements with its principal
providers of ﬁnance. The purpose is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Group's sources of ﬁnance.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in ﬁnancial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Board reviews
and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group’s accounting policies in relation to
derivatives are set out in note 2.2. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all ﬁnancial instruments. 
Interest rate risk
The Group's policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of ﬁxed and variable rate debt. The Group's policy is to keep 100% 
of its long-term borrowings at ﬁxed rates of interest except for debt raised for direct property investment, where property acquired 
is initially funded on a short-term basis before being reﬁnanced through long-term borrowing facilities. A target gearing ratio of
up to 80% has been set for these long-term borrowings on direct property investments. Mapeley also seeks to ﬁnance new outsourcing
contracts in line with this strategy at up to 80% Loan To Value (LTV). To manage this mix in a cost-efﬁcient manner, the Group 
enters into interest rate swaps on the date an asset is purchased under which the Group agrees to exchange, at speciﬁed intervals, 
the difference between ﬁxed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount
expected to be equivalent to the related long-term borrowings to be used to ﬁnance the asset on its reﬁnancing. These swaps are
designated to hedge underlying debt obligations. At 31 December 2006, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps,
substantially all of the Group’s non-current borrowings were at a ﬁxed rate of interest.
Credit risk
The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade 
on credit terms are subject to credit veriﬁcation procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with
the result that the Group's exposure to bad debt is not signiﬁcant. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other ﬁnancial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, available-
for-sale ﬁnancial assets and certain derivative instruments, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from any default of the
counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
A signiﬁcant proportion of the Group’s total income is earned from the Group’s three contracts. The contractual parties have either
AAA or A+ credit ratings and no major credit risk is currently considered to exist.
Liquidity risk
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and ﬂexibility through the use of its overdraft facility.
Short term ﬂexibility is achieved by a working capital facility of £25.0 million (2005: £55.0 million) which is available until June 2007
with an option to extend for a further year. 
In addition, at 31 December 2006, the Group had a £300.0 million (2005: £300.0) revolving acquisition facility of which £36.4 million
(2005: £283.4) was drawn down. In addition, the Group has drawn, long-term secured facilities totalling £1,241.7 million (2004:
£803.2 million).

25 Financial instruments 
Certain of the Group’s bank debts are subject to ﬂoating interest rates, the majority of which has been exchanged for ﬁxed interest
rates under interest rate exchange agreements. 
The Group’s criteria for an interest rate swap are that the instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and that it must change
the character of the interest rate by converting a ﬂoating rate to a ﬁxed rate or vice versa.
Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value and shown on the Group balance sheet at the year end. The fair value for a swap is
market value, estimated using a break cost quote from an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current
yields to anticipated future cash ﬂows. The key assumptions used in the swap valuations are listed below:
The valuations represent the Net Present Value of the cash ﬂows from the valuation date until expiry of the instrument at the
contracted rate and at the valuation rate
The valuation rate is compiled from prevailing market futures rates and swap rates on the date of the valuation
Fair values
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the Group's ﬁnancial instruments that are
carried in the ﬁnancial statements. The fair value of ﬁnancial derivatives and borrowings has been calculated by discounting the
future cash ﬂows at prevailing market interest rates.

Interest on ﬁnancial instruments, classiﬁed as ﬂoating rate, is re-priced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on ﬁnancial
instruments classiﬁed as ﬁxed rate is ﬁxed until the maturity of the instrument. The other ﬁnancial instruments of the Group 
not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
Credit risk
In the year ended 31 December 2006, 86% (2005: 86%) of the Groups total turnover was derived from contractual payments 
made to the Group by Government Agencies (i.e. HMRC and the Home Ofﬁce), rated AAA (by Standard & Poor’s) and Abbey, 
rated A+ (by Standard & Poor’s). Except for these contracts, there are no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

Group reorganisation
During the prior year and prior to its acquisition by Mapeley Limited, MUKCO sold the shares of three subsidiaries, Mapeley Milton
Keynes Limited, Willen Lake Limited and Mapeley Services Limited to Mapeley Holding Company Limited, a company outside the
Group owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC and the former parent of MUKCO. The shares were sold at book value. However, 
the amounts have been subsequently written off as they are considered irrecoverable by the Company’s Directors. As a consequence,
£599,000 was charged to the prior year’s income statement to write of amounts owing from Mapeley Milton Keynes Limited. 
This is offset by a credit to the prior year’s income statement for £129,000 written-off owing to Willen Lake Limited. 
Amounts owed by shareholders
The Group has entered into an agreement to provide property management services in respect of 135 property interests owned by
Pinnacle Towers Limited, a company in which Fortress Investment Group LLC held a signiﬁcant interest. In return for the provision 
of these services, the Group receives £100,000 per annum evenly spread across the year and receivable one month in arrears. 
During 2006, £100,000 (2005: £94,000) had been received and at 31 December 2006, £nil (2005: £6,000) was outstanding. 
The Group previously provided property management and consultancy services in respect of 36 property interests owned by BC
Services (UK) Limited and BC Acquisition (UK) Limited, companies wholly-owned by Fortress Acquisition Group LLC. This agreement
was terminated during the year ended 31 December 2005. During 2005, £13,000 had been received with £nil outstanding at 31
December 2005. Amounts were receivable one month in arrears. A balancing settlement of £40,443 was received during 2006 in
respect of this agreement.
During 2006 the Group provided consultancy services to Eurocastle Investment Limited, part of the Fortress Investment Group LLC.
Total services provided amounted to £97,532 of which £68,988 is outstanding as at 31 December 2006. 
In addition in 2006 the Group managed a refurbishment project on behalf of Fortress Investment Group UK. The fees received in
respect of this project amounted to £140,666 of which £nil is outstanding as at 31 December 2006. 
Costs incurred by Fortress UK Acquisition Company in relation to the listing of Mapeley Ltd in 2005 were reimbursed by Mapeley
Limited during the year; these amounted to £5,984 (2005: £nil).

Balances owed to shareholders
As part of the Group restructuring in 2005, accrued interest charges on shareholder loans of £0.2 million were transferred to Mapeley
Holding Company Limited, a company outside the Mapeley Limited Group and a member of Fortress Investment Group LLC’s group 
of companies. 
Shareholder loans from FIT Mapeley Holding Limited and Fortress UK Acquisition Company Limited with a total book value of
£8.1 million, of which £0.7million was received in 2005 and £0.3 million related to accrued interest, were converted into 654,998
ordinary shares on 1 June 2005. Both these entities have signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the Group at 31 December 2005 and at
31 December 2006 and owned a combined 49.78% of the ordinary shares in Mapeley Limited (2005: 70.5%). 
Interest on the shareholder loans was paid quarterly at a rate of LIBOR plus 2% for the ﬁrst year and before being converted to 
non-interest bearing loans for the remaining two years of the term.
Shares to Non-Executive Directors
15,000 shares were awarded to each of the four Non-Executive Directors in the prior year. These awards vest on the date of grant 
and after each of the two ﬁrst annual general meetings following the date of appointment. The market value of the shares on the date
of the grant of the award was £23.00 per share in respect of the shares awarded to Mr Harris, Mr Carey and Mr Parkinson who each
received 5,000 shares in the prior year and a further 5,000 in the current year. 5,000 shares were awarded to Mr Fascitelli in the prior
year when the market value of the shares was £26.85 per share, these shares were issued in the current year and he received a further
5,000 shares in 2006. 
During the year, £539,074 (2005: £805,000) has been charged to the income statement relating to share beneﬁts expense for the 
Non-Executive Directors.
28 Subsequent events
Since 31 December 2006, the Group has exchanged and completed contracts to acquire eight properties for consideration of
£95.1 million. These properties are to be funded by the Group’s cash resources and the acquisition facility.
Dividend declared
At a Board meeting held on 7 March 2007 the Board of the Company declared a dividend of £13.2 million (31 December 2005:
£8.3 million) representing £0.45 per share based on the number of shares in issue on 16 March 2007.
Ten-year interest rate swap
On 20 January 2007, the Group entered into a ten-year, £9.3 million interest rate swap ﬁxing the interest rate at 5.2% and on the
30 January 2007 it also entered into a further ten-year, £75.0 million interest rate swap ﬁxing the interest rate at 5.34% in order 
to secure the borrowing cost of planned acquisitions expected to be completed in the ﬁrst quarter of 2007.
29 Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation 
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or ‘EBITDA’ is deﬁned by the Group as proﬁt before tax, ﬁnance 
costs, depreciation and amortisation, valuation surplus/deﬁcit on investment property, gain on disposal of subsidiaries and
impairment/impairment reversal of non-investment property. EBITDA for the year is computed as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
Proﬁt/(loss) before tax 42.9 (56.5)
Add back: ﬁnance cost net of ﬁnance income 82.8 125.9
Depreciation and amortisation 9.5 13.4
Net valuation surplus on investment properties (40.8) (18.0)
Impairment of non-investment properties – 0.6
Reversal of impairment of non-investment properties (0.8) –
Gain on disposal of subsidiaries – (0.6)
EBITDA 93.6 64.8

30 Funds From Operations
Funds from operations or ‘FFO’ is a management measure used to demonstrate the underlying operating performance of real estate
businesses such as the Company. It provides investors with information regarding the Group’s ability to service debt and make capital
expenditure. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with IFRS, therefore it should not be
considered an alternative to cash ﬂow as a measure of liquidity, and is not necessarily indicative of cash funds available. This
calculation of FFO may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
The Group deﬁnes ‘FFO’ as Group ‘EBITDA’ less ‘net ﬁnance costs’ less the ‘movement in the onerous lease provision’ less the
‘movement in work in progress’ plus the movement in ‘net asset management receipts’ plus the charge in respect of ‘employee shares’
plus realised revaluation gains. This deﬁnition has been reﬁned at 31 December 2006 but this has had no impact on reported FFO 
for 2005 or 2006. More detailed deﬁnitions of these adjustments to EBITDA are given below:
‘Net ﬁnance costs’ comprise ﬁnance costs less ﬁnance income as set out in the Group income statement, adjusted to exclude
amortisation of loan ﬁnance fees, gains or losses on interest rate swaps, loan termination costs and the unwinding of discounts on
provisions. 
The ‘Movement in the onerous lease provision’ – This is the net release (or charge) to the Group income statement as a result ofthe
change in the Group onerous lease provisions, excluding interest charged on the unwinding of the provision. Although these amounts
offset rental costs in the income statement, they do not represent cash movements and are therefore excluded from the computation 
of FFO.
The ‘Movement in work in progress’ or the ‘movement in long-term accrued costs’- This is the year on year change in Group work 
in progress or if negative at the balance sheet date, accrued cost. The amount represents the increase or decrease in life cycle costs
deferred by the Group so as to match costs with revenue.
‘Net asset management receipts’ – These are the total cash receipts in the year less amounts amortised in the ﬁnancial period. 
The accounting treatment of asset management receipts is set out in the accounting policies.
‘Employee shares’ – Under IFRS 2, costs are charged to the Group income statement when share based payments are made. 
This is a non cash expense and is therefore excluded from the measure.
‘Organic FFO’ is deﬁned as the FFO contribution from property assets or services following the ﬁrst anniversary of their acquisition 
or commencement of the contract, net of central overhead costs.
‘Acquisition FFO’ is deﬁned as the FFO contribution from property assets or services in the ﬁrst year of ownership in the case of
property assets and contract commencement in the case of new services.

FFO 32.2 13.5 45.7 21.4 4.1 25.5
FFO per share 170p 130p
The calculation of FFO per share is based on the following:
FFO for the year of £45.7 million (2005: £25.5 million)
Weighted average number of ordinary shares of 26,887,700 (2005: 19,510,770)
FFO per share calculated using a diluted weighted average number of shares of 26,903,833 (2005: 19,527,249) is 170 pence per share
(2005: 130 pence per share).

31 Gearing ratio
Gearing is deﬁned as Group net debt (total debt less cash and short-term deposits) as a proportion of total consolidated equity
attributable to the equity holders of the parent. ‘Total debt’ is deﬁned as actual current and non-current loan balances together 
with any overdrafts owed to lenders and excludes any ﬁnance costs or adjustments to apply the effective interest rate method. 
Equity is as set out in the consolidated balance sheet. Gearing is computed as follows:
2006 2005
£m £m
‘Total debt’ 1,279.2 1,086.6
Less: Cash and short-term deposits (77.3) (81.2)

Equity 712.2 456.9
Gearing ratio 169% 220%
32 Net assets per share
2006 2005
Basic net assets per share £24.21 £20.34
Diluted net assets per share £24.19 £20.34
The calculation of basic and diluted net asset value per share ﬁgures is based on the following:
Consolidated net assets (equity) attributable to the equity holders of the Company as at 31 December 2006 of £712.2 million 
(as at 31 December 2005: net assets of £456.9 million)
Number of ordinary shares for basic net asset value per share 29,416,128 (2005: 22,463,687)
Number of ordinary shares for diluted net asset value per share 29,436,128 (2005: 22,480,166)

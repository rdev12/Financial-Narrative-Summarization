Annual report and accounts 2007 02
Revenue from continuing operations was £299.8 million in 
2007, an increase of 4 per cent on a constant currency basis.
Net debt came down by £84.4 million to £16.2 million in 2007 
and the Group has also agreed a ten year funding plan with 
the UK Pension Trustees which will eliminate the current 
funding deficit over the funding period and provide greater 
certainty to the Group in its future cash flow planning. The 
Group’s combined deficits for retirement benefit obligations 
at the end of 2007 under IAS 19 was £21.5 million versus 
£37.3 million a year earlier.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, before 
exceptional items, improved by 31 per cent to 7.2 pence as 
a result of the higher operating profit. The Group recorded 
exceptional items of £12.5 million (2006: £1.7 million) related 
to the gain on sale of the Pigments business and the recent 
restructuring exercise. Diluted earnings per share from 
continuing and discontinued operations, after exceptional 
items, was 10.8 pence versus 7.0 pence in 2006.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.4 pence 
taking the total return to shareholders for the year to 
2.7 pence, an increase of 12.5 per cent. Subject to approval 
at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 
30 May 2008 to members on the register at the close of 
business on 2 May 2008. The Board intends to continue to 
review the dividend policy as earnings performance permits.
Chairman’s statement
Robert Beeston
“ We have made a strong start to the year, 
building on the solid growth achieved in 2007, 
and expect to maintain progress in 2008 in 
line with our expectations.”
I am pleased to report that the Group has continued to make 
solid progress in 2007, with improvements in both earnings 
and cash flow. In addition the Group made a significant 
strategic step forward on 31 August by completing the sale 
of its Pigments business. This has further strengthened the 
Group’s balance sheet and provides a firm base for future 
profitable growth.
Results
Operating profit from continuing operations, and before 
exceptional items, improved by 21 per cent to £38.1 million 
and all three businesses again contributed to the improvement. 
Good demand in all of our major end markets was a key 
driver in 2007, with the exception of the North American 
architectural coatings and construction sectors which 
were impacted by the slowdown in US housing. Specialty 
Products experienced good demand in industrial coatings 
and oilfield, and made solid progress in sales to Europe 
and Asia, while Chromium benefited from a one time 
energy rebate of £1.4 million and changes in Chinese tax 
regulations prompted improved demand for chrome oxide 
and chromic acid. Surfactants made steady progress 
through further product optimisation and operating 
efficiencies. The Group’s operating margin improved 
to 12.7 per cent (2006: 10.4 per cent) led by Specialty 
Products where operating margins are now over 
20 per cent (2006: 17.3 per cent). Elementis plc

The Board
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company’s 
strategy in addition to monitoring performance. Through 
its own actions and those of the Board committees, the 
Board continues to meet its commitment to high standards 
of corporate governance. The Board seeks to implement 
these standards in such a manner that they provide 
real benefit for shareholders, employees and customers. 
Matthew Peacock stepped down from the Board on 
31 January 2008 and Ken Minton has indicated his 
intention to leave the Board in April 2008. Matthew and 
Ken have been on the Board since 2005 and have made 
significant contributions to the Group’s strategy and success, 
and for that I would like to thank them on behalf of myself 
and the other directors. The remaining Board members 
represent a good balance of industry, geography and 
functional experience, and so I feel it necessary to add only 
one new director in 2008 as replacement for the two who 
are leaving. We are actively engaged in a process to identify 
a suitable individual and expect to make an announcement 
during the first half of 2008.
Health, safety and environment
The Board is actively engaged in monitoring this important 
aspect of our business, and I am happy to report that our 
performance in this area remains in the upper quartile of 
industry standards. We remain committed to achieving the very 
best results and reporting in an open and transparent manner .
People
Our people have been instrumental in implementing a 
significant amount of positive change in the Group over the 
recent period, affecting both them and their families, and so 
I would again like to offer my sincere thanks to all of them 
for their contributions to the Group’s excellent performance.
Outlook
The Group has achieved a great deal over the last 24 months 
and now has a robust platform of good quality earnings and 
a strong balance sheet on which to move forward. We have 
made a strong start to the year, building on the solid growth 
achieved in 2007, and expect to maintain progress in 2008 
in line with our expectations.

Principal activities
For the purposes of this report, the expression ‘Company’ or 
‘Elementis’ means Elementis plc and the expression ‘Group’ 
means the Company and its subsidiaries.
The main activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are 
the manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals. The Group 
is comprised of three businesses: Elementis Specialty Products, 
which manufactures rheological additives, compounded 
products and colourants; Elementis Surfactants, which 
manufactures surface active ingredients used primarily 
in the formulation of detergents; and Elementis Chromium, 
which manufactures chromium chemicals.
The Group’s corporate headquarters are in London, UK and 
its operational headquarters are based in Hightstown, New 
Jersey, USA. Each division of the Group is managed on a global 
basis with operations at over 20 locations in 6 countries. 
Elementis aims to manage its businesses responsibly. Its 
key responsibility to shareholders is to achieve a sustainable 
long-term return on the capital employed in the businesses 
and to be able to invest for future growth. The Group also 
takes seriously its responsibility to employees, customers 
and suppliers and for the impact its operations have on the 
environment and targets best practice in each of these areas.
Business review
Group Chief Executive’s report
David Dutro
“ The Group has continued to make excellent 
progress in both earnings and cash flow 
in 2007. We have improved the base level 
of earnings, stabilised results from the 
Chromium business and improved cash flow. 
In addition, the sale of the Pigments business, 
announced earlier in the year, was successfully 
completed on 31 August at a price of £71 million 
and together with cash flow generated from 
continuing operations has significantly reduced 
the Group’s debt. These accomplishments have 
resulted in a strong balance sheet and put the 
Group in a firm position to drive profitable 
growth, and this is where we are focussing our 
attention. The Specialty Products business 
provides an ideal platform for growth, having 
a strong technology base, a broad geographic 
footprint, diverse markets and a wide range of 
applications. The combination of product 
leadership, technical expertise and customer 
understanding provides true market 
advantage, and we are seeking to make 
prudent investments that will leverage 
these inherent qualities.”

Objectives 
Elementis Specialty Products is the Group’s largest 
and most profitable division. It has attractive growth 
opportunities and the objectives for this division are 
to increase the rate of sales growth, to achieve volume 
growth and to enhance operating margins. This organic 
growth strategy will be supplemented by selective acquisitions 
as appropriate, where a complementary technology, product 
line or target market can be identified.
Elementis Surfactants is the smallest division in the Group 
and achieves a lower return on its capital employed due 
to its market positioning. The objectives for this division 
are to focus its efforts on higher margin products and to 
maintain tight control on its operating costs.
Elementis Chromium successfully reduced its minimum 
operating rate in 2006 by reducing capacity in the UK. 
Its strategy is to increase sales volumes whilst effectively 
managing its supply chain to reduce its sensitivity to 
cyclical fluctuations.
Strategic developments
Background
Each of the three divisions has distinct characteristics and the 
Group has developed separate strategies for each business 
which are focussed on improving financial performance and 
improving the long-term return on the capital employed in 
the businesses. The cornerstone of each strategy is superior 
customer service and alignment with market leaders.
Elementis Specialty Products
Elementis Specialty Products has four manufacturing sites 
in North America, two sites in Europe and a smaller facility 
in China. 
The division’s products are purchased on the basis of 
performance rather than specification and are typically a 
small percentage of the cost of the end product. The business 
provides strong technical support to its customers, and its 
end-use markets are consumables. 
The priorities of this division are:
•  To increase the rate of sales growth without 
compromising margins.
•  To achieve volume growth from new product 
development and a wider geographical focus.
•  To enhance margins through improved productivity, 
procurement, supply chain efficiencies and enhanced 
product mix.
Specialty Products manufactures solvent based rheological 
products and low solvent and compounded products. In the 
low solvent market, it has technological strength and the 
competition is more fragmented. This market lends itself to 
new product development while the solvent based products 
present the opportunity for increased market share in Asia 
and Eastern Europe. Future volume growth in Specialty 
Products will be more focussed on the low solvent and 
compounded market. 
Elementis Surfactants
Elementis Surfactants was acquired in 2004 as part of the 
Sasol Servo business and it operates from a facility shared with 
Elementis Specialty Products at Delden, The Netherlands. It is a 
specialty surfactant manufacturer offering innovative products to 
the market and creating tailor-made solutions for its customers. 
Its products are used primarily in the formulation of detergents. 
Since the acquisition activities have been reorganised by 
reducing or eliminating low margin business and improving 
the productivity of its manufacturing site in the Netherlands. 
Its strategy is to continue to move to higher margin products 
while at the same time lowering its cost base.
Elementis Chromium
Supply and demand has been more balanced in the global 
Chromium market over the last two years, following a period 
of excessive supply through the early part of this decade.
Following a number of years of earnings volatility, it was 
decided, in 2005, to reduce production capacity in the UK 
and reduce fixed costs proportionately. This strategic action 
materially reduced the worldwide minimum operating rate 
for Elementis Chromium and reduced the division’s 
sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations. 
The business relies on the key raw materials of chromite 
ore and soda ash. A continuous supply of these materials, 
whilst effectively managing any price increases, is core to 
its strategy. In addition, the business seeks to optimise its 
global production to meet demand and flex its capacity as 
appropriate to reduce earnings volatility.
“ [T]he Group has developed separate strategies 
for each [of our] business[es] which are 
focussed on improving financial performance 
and improving the long-term return on the 
capital employed...The cornerstone of each 
strategy is superior customer service and 
alignment with market leaders.” Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 06
Business environment
Structure
A large part of the Group’s management team, including 
the Group Chief Executive, is based in Hightstown, New 
Jersey, US, while the Chairman and Finance Director and 
his staff are based in London, UK. The management 
team meets monthly and reports to the Board at each 
of its meetings. 
Sales and marketing
Elementis Specialty Products 
Elementis Specialty Products holds a market leading position 
in solvent based rheological additives and is seeking to grow 
its market share in low solvent and compounded products. 
The division is also aiming to increase its market share in 
Asia and Eastern Europe. The division’s sales and marketing 
strategy is based on thoroughly understanding its customers’ 
needs, providing excellent customer service, technical 
support and product innovation and thereby responding to 
each customer’s specific requirements. 
In 2007, approximately 74 per cent of its products were 
rheological additives (2006: 73 per cent) and the balance 
comprised colourants, additives and surfactants. The 
coatings market represented about 65 per cent of sales 
(2006: 65 per cent) and the next largest market was oil 
drilling at 13 per cent (2006: 13 per cent). Geographically, 
sales to Europe were 46 per cent of the total in 2007 
(2006: 43 per cent), North America represented 
33 per cent (2006: 37 per cent) and the balance was sold 
to the rest of the world. 
Elementis Surfactants
The main market for Elementis Surfactants is currently 
Western Europe. It is seeking to penetrate markets in Asia 
and Latin America. In addition, the business is aiming to 
reduce production of large volume commodity surfactants 
and tolling activities and to increase its market share in 
higher value specialty surfactants for the agrochemical, 
feed, plastic and resin markets.
In 2007, approximately 55 per cent (2006: 50 per cent) of 
its products were surfactants and the balance comprised 
additives for the pulp and paper market and production 
chemicals for the oilfield industry. In terms of sales, the 
three largest segments were leather and textile, domestic 
detergents and industrial cleaning. Geographically, 
89 per cent of sales were to Europe (2006: 95 per cent) 
and the balance was sold to North America and the rest 
of the world.
Elementis Chromium
Elementis Chromium aims to offer its customers competitively 
priced, quality products combined with good customer service 
and strong technical support. It has the largest market 
share in the chromium industry and operates from modern 
manufacturing facilities. Health, safety and a strong record 
of environmental care are important in differentiating this 
business from its competitors.

In 2007, sales of its products comprised: chromic acid, 
chromic oxide, merchant dichromate and chrome sulphate. 
Geographically, 47 per cent of sales were in North America 
(2006: 47 per cent), 29 per cent in Europe (2006: 26 per cent) 
and the balance to the rest of the world. The division made 
73 per cent of its sales in 2007 directly to customers 
(2006: 75 per cent) and the balance was sold through 
distributors and agents. 
Competition
Elementis Specialty Products operates in a market with 
several technologies. It has numerous competitors ranging 
from large multi-national companies to family owned 
private entities. 
Elementis Surfactants is active in numerous applications, 
technologies, chemistries and industries, and therefore it 
has a large number of competitors ranging from large 
multi-national companies to small and family owned 
private producers.
Elementis Chromium competes with one large multi-national 
public company and a number of privately owned producers. 
Supply chain
The key raw materials for Elementis Specialty Products are 
quaternary amines and hectorite clay for which Elementis 
owns and operates a mine. Elementis Surfactants primarily 
uses ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, nonylphenol 
ethoxylate and fatty alcohols to manufacture its products. 
These are primarily sourced from third parties. Elementis 
Chromium’s key raw materials are soda ash and chrome ore. 
All businesses purchase energy in the form of natural gas, 
fuel oil and electricity. Elementis Chromium is the largest 
energy user in the Group. 
Elementis is committed to paying its suppliers according 
to agreed terms. The Group’s policy is to agree terms of 
payment at the start of business with each supplier and 
to adhere to those terms, subject to satisfactory 
performance by the supplier. 
Elementis has identified that there is a risk inherent in 
its supply chain in maintaining a sufficiently broad base of 
suppliers able to deliver high quality products to schedule. 
In certain markets the Group is limited to a small number 
of suppliers and as part of the Group’s risk review, an 
overdependence on any particular supplier is reviewed 
and, where possible, mitigating action is taken. Elementis 
is also exposed to the risk of raw material price increases, 
particularly in markets where there are a small number of 
suppliers or with regards to energy where the price is driven 
by oil price and regional supply and demand issues. In 2007 
Elementis entered into agreements with suppliers to lock in 
the price of approximately 70 per cent of its energy costs for 
the year. Elementis Chromium agreed prices for soda ash 
and chrome ore at the start of the year subject to its volume 
requirements and certain market factors.
Computer systems
High performing information technology (‘IT’) systems are 
important to the successful running of the Group’s businesses. 
The Specialty Products and Chromium divisions have 
implemented an Enterprise Resource Planning (‘ERP’) 
system and are supported by two shared service centres, 
based in Hightstown, New Jersey, US for North American 
operations and Eaglescliffe, UK for European operations. 
Underpinning the success of ERP is a reliable IT infrastructure 
which focusses on delivering a secure, stable and cohesive 
architecture through server replacement, software upgrades 
and network simplification. An IT infrastructure that adapts 
to change and responds to the evolving requirements of the 
business activities is an important component in achieving 
the strategic goals of Elementis.
The Group’s IT strategy strives to protect the integrity and 
security of its data, network and systems through various 
tools such as encryption, authorisation, anti-virus programmes 
and proactive monitoring. A continued investment in IT 
signifies its commitment to utilising technology for 
achieving corporate objectives in an ever-changing, 
global market.
Regulatory issues, health, safety and environment
Elementis is committed to preventing harm to its employees, 
third parties and the environment in a sustainable manner . 
The Health, safety and environment report, which forms part 
of this Business review, is set out on pages 18 to 21.
The raw materials which the Group’s businesses use and 
the products that they produce are subject to demanding 
regulations concerning product safety in all parts of the 
world. These regulations, which also cover product testing 
and risk assessment requirements, are subject to review 
and revision, as is happening in Europe with the REACH 
(Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) 
regulations. The Group is assessing the potential impact 
of these requirements on its businesses and planning to 
ensure compliance when the regulations come fully into force.

Introduction
IFRS requires separate disclosure of items of income 
and expense which are material by virtue of their nature 
or amount. These items are considered to be most 
appropriately disclosed as exceptional.
The Board considers that the information presented in 
the tables in the Business review provide useful financial 
information relating to the performance of the Group. This 
information should not be considered as an alternative, 
but as a supplementary to the full IFRS income statement 
presented on page 38.
Group results
Group revenue from continuing operations was £299.8 million 
in 2007 which, after adjusting for currency movements, 
represents an increase of 4 per cent over the previous year, 
and all three businesses showed an increase on this basis. 
Market trends were generally positive for each of the 
businesses with good demand in most sectors except for the 
North American coatings and construction markets which 
were impacted by the slowdown in US housing. Volumes 
were higher in Specialty Products and Chromium but lower 
in Surfactants, and pricing was improved in all three 
businesses compared to the previous year. Revenue 
including discontinued businesses was £359.5 million 
(2006: £395.9 million) reflecting the fact that the Pigments 
business was sold part way through the year .
Group operating profit from continuing operations before 
exceptional items increased by 21 per cent to £38.1 million 
(2006: £31.5 million), and all three businesses contributed 
to the increase. The Group operating margin on the same 
basis increased to 12.7 per cent (2006: 10.4 per cent), 
and the result benefited from a one time energy rebate 
of £1.4 million at Chromium in the first half of 2007, 
and from £2.9 million (2006: £1.8 million) of currency 
hedging gains.
Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, before 
exceptional items, was 7.2 pence compared to 5.5 pence in the 
previous year . The increase was largely driven by the increase 
in operating profit. After exceptional gains of £12.5 million, 
which are described below, diluted earnings per share was 
10.8 pence versus 7.0 pence in 2006.
Net borrowings decreased by £84.4 million in the year 
to £16.2 million following the disposal of Pigments which 
reduced debt by around £66 million and was complemented 
by £26.4 million of free cash flow from operations. 
Elementis Specialty Products
The dominant theme in Specialty Products during 2007 has 
been one of robust demand in all major sectors, except for 
North American coatings. Overall volumes for the business 
increased by 3 per cent versus the previous year with sales 
to the oilfield and construction sectors showing particularly 
strong gains. Management has also continued to focus

20 per cent versus 17 per cent in 2006. Accelerating new 
product pipeline has also been a priority and a new colourant 
viscosity stabiliser is currently being tested by over 25 customers 
and should begin to contribute to sales in 2008.
Sales in 2007 were £141.6 million compared to £144.8 million 
in 2006 which, on a constant currency basis, is an increase 
of 3 per cent. Volumes increased by 3 per cent and average 
pricing improved by a similar amount, but relatively lower 
sales to the higher margin North American region somewhat 
reduced the positive impact of price and volume. In coatings, 
which accounts for around 65 per cent of total sales, 
volumes increased by 4 per cent compared to the previous 
year with gains in Europe (3 per cent) and Asia (7 per cent), 
more than compensating for the weaker demand in North 
America where volumes were lower by 7 per cent. Sales to 
architectural coatings were mostly affected by the slowdown 
in North America, but sales volumes in industrial coatings 
remained at a similar level to the previous year. Industrial 
sales volumes were strong in Europe (up 13 per cent) which 
more than offset weaker architectural sales (down 7 per cent). 
Both architectural and industrial segments showed good 
volume gains in Asia. Oilfield sales volumes improved by 
6 per cent over the previous year with strong gains in 
North America due to the continued drilling activity, plus 
the application of new technical approaches by drilling 
companies to access areas such as oil bearing shales. 
In construction, volumes were strongly ahead in Europe 
(up 15 per cent) as a result of a buoyant market and some 
new applications for defoamers and hectorite products. 
Consumer sales volumes improved by 1 per cent with good 
gains in Europe, due to growth in antiperspirants and colour 
cosmetics, compensating for lower growth in North America 
where growth in antiperspirants and agricultural applications 
was offset by weaker demand in paintballing.

Operating profit before exceptional items was £28.8 million 
in 2007, which is an increase of 15 per cent (2006: £25.0 million) 
with currency having a negligible effect due to the Group’s 
hedging programme. Improved sales contributed about 
9 per cent with the balance coming from reductions in 
variable costs, where energy costs were almost £1.0 million 
lower than the previous year due to management’s decision 
to take fixed price contracts towards the end of 2006. 
Variable logistics and some raw material costs were also 
marginally lower than the previous year. Fixed costs were 
more or less unchanged versus 2006 as efficiencies in 
selling, general and administration costs offset modest 
inflation in manufacturing costs.
Elementis Surfactants
The Surfactants business has continued a process 
of optimising the product portfolio by reducing sales 
of lower margin commodity products, and focussing on 
more differentiated applications where there is greater 
opportunity to improve pricing in response to raw material 
inflation. Consequently, sales have continued to decline 
in areas such as textiles, leather and pulp and paper but 
increased in agriculture, plastics and feed. In addition, 
there is a strong focus on operational efficiency and cost 
management in the business to help improve margins.
Sales in 2007 were £46.3 million compared to £46.1 million 
in the previous year, with currency having a negligible effect. 
Volumes were 8 per cent lower than the previous year due 
to the product optimisation programme, but also due to 
lower sales into the oilfield sector where the stronger Euro 
made the product offering less competitive in a predominantly 
US dollar market. Average pricing across all products 
improved by almost 9 per cent as pricing initiatives were 
launched in lower margin sectors and in response to rising 
raw material costs. 
Operating profit before exceptional items was £0.9 million 
in 2007 versus £0.6 million in 2006, with no material impact 
from currency movements. Improved pricing more than 
offset the effects of lower volumes and higher raw material 
costs, and fixed costs were maintained at 2006 levels. Elementis plc

Elementis Chromium
In Chromium, 2007 was a year of positive market dynamics 
and the first full year of trading since a number of strategic 
changes were made in the first quarter of 2006. At that time 
50 per cent of production capability at the Eaglescliffe, UK 
site was mothballed and the business increased its hedging 
activities in energy and currency. This was done with a view 
to creating a more stable earnings environment, and also 
included a greater focus on sustainable sales and better 
optimisation of production capacity. Market demand for 
chrome chemicals was favourable in 2007, particularly 
in the second half of the year assisted by changes in tax 
regulations in China. During the second quarter the Chinese 
government eliminated VAT rebates on a broad list of 
materials, including chrome metal, chrome oxide and 
chromic acid, which reduced the competitiveness of Chinese 
exporters and thereby increased demand for those products 
in North America and Europe. Strength in demand has 
allowed selling prices to increase in line with raw materials, 
where chrome ore costs have been rising as a result of 
continued Chinese demand for steel.
Sales in 2007 were £115.9 million (2006: £116.8 million), 
which is an increase of 13 per cent after adjusting for 
currency movements of £7.6 million and the impact of the 
UK plant closure in March 2006 of £7.0 million. A 12 per 
cent increase in sales volume was the main contributor to 
the year on year improvement, driven by sales of chromic 
acid and chrome oxide following the changes in China. 
Average selling prices were 4 per cent higher than the 
previous year due to price increases implemented in the 
second half of the year, but were offset by a slightly less 
favourable product mix.
Geographic sales trends showed strong volume gains 
in North America and in Europe following the changes in 
China, while sales volumes to Asia Pacific were lower than 
the previous year as Chinese exporters refocussed their 
attention back to their home market.
Operating profit before exceptional items in 2007 was 
£14.2 million versus £11.9 million in the previous year. 
The business benefited from a one time energy rebate of 
energy costs in the US as a result of an electricity industry 
reorganisation in the State of Texas, which amounted 
to £1.4 million. Otherwise the improvement in sales 
contributed over £9.0 million to operating profit, more than 
offsetting increases in fixed and variable costs of around 
£8.0 million. In variable costs, chrome ore prices increased 
by almost 40 per cent over the previous year. Energy costs, 
excluding the one time rebate, were slightly lower than the 
previous year due to the timing of hedging activity, where 
fixed price contracts were concluded by the beginning of 
2007. Manufacturing fixed costs were also higher due to 
an extensive maintenance programme in the second half 
of 2007, which was implemented in order to ensure the 
reliability of plant operations during a period of high 
capacity utilisation. 
Currency movements reduced operating profit by 
£0.9 million, with the impact being significantly lower 
due to hedging activities.

Central costs
Central costs are costs that are not identifiable as expenses 
of a particular business, and are comprised of expenditures 
of the Board of Directors and the corporate office. In 2007 
central costs have been reduced by £0.2 million.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items after taxation were £12.5 million in the year 
(2006: £1.7 million). The Group made a gain on disposal of its 
Pigments business of £16.3 million (2006: £nil). The Pigments 
business was sold for gross proceeds of £70.7 million on 
31 August 2007.
Past service credits and curtailment gains following 
changes to the Group’s post retirement medical benefit 
schemes were £2.0 million (2006: £3.7 million) and the 
release of restructuring provisions previously charged 
as exceptional was £1.1 million (2006: £1.0 million). 
Tax charges of £6.9 million (2006: £1.3 million), primarily 
in relation to the business disposal, were included within 
exceptional items.

on net borrowings by £1.6 million. Interest income from 
pension schemes increased by £0.6 million due to a lower 
pension deficit.

profit before taxation. The tax charge on discontinued 
operations was £0.2 million (2006: £0.5 million). The disposal 
of the Group’s global Pigments business utilised losses in the 
US and resulted in the recognition of an exceptional deferred 
tax charge of £5.8 million. A further £1.1 million of taxation 
was charged to exceptional items in relation to past service 
credits on post retirement medical benefits and the release 
of unutilised provisions. 
Earnings per share
Note 9 sets out a number of calculations of earnings per share. 
To better understand the underlying trading performance of the 
Group, earnings per share reported under IFRS is adjusted for 
items classified as exceptional and for discontinued operations. 
Diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued 
operations and before exceptional items increased by 19 per cent 
to 8.0 pence (2006: 6.7 pence).
Diluted earnings per share from continuing and discontinued 
operations reported under IFRS was 54 per cent above 2006 
at 10.8 pence (2006: 7.0 pence).
Discontinued operations
Discontinued operations representing the Pigments 
business which was sold on 31 August 2007, contributed 
£3.6 million to the profit for the year before exceptional 
items (2006: £5.2 million). Pigments’ sales in the eight 
months ended 31 August 2007 were £59.7 million 
(2006: £93.9 million) and its operating profit before 
exceptional items was £4.3 million (2006: £6.1 million). 
Interest and taxation were £0.7 million (2006: £0.9 million). 
The business was sold for gross proceeds of £70.7 million 
with net assets of £46.6 million. After deducting costs 
incurred in the disposal and net debt transferred to the 
purchaser, the gain on disposal was £16.3 million. Elementis plc

Distribution to shareholders
During 2007 the Group paid a final dividend in respect of 
the year ended 31 December 2006 of 1.2 pence per share. 
An interim dividend of 1.3 pence per share was paid on 
5 October 2007 and the Board is proposing a final dividend

During the year, based on the most recent actuarial valuation 
on 30 September 2005, the Group agreed to pay £6.4 million 
per annum to fund the deficit in the UK scheme over a ten year 
period. Arrangements with the UK trustees are subject to review 
in line with the scheme’s triennial valuations.
Critical accounting policies
The analysis of the Group’s results and its financial position 
is based on the consolidated financial statements, which 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU. The preparation of financial statements requires 
the application of estimates and judgements that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and 
costs and related disclosures at the balance sheet date. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under 
different assumptions or conditions. 
Critical accounting policies are those that require significant 
judgements or estimates and potentially result in materially 
different results under different assumptions or conditions. 
It is considered that the Group’s critical accounting policies 
are limited to those described below. The development of 
the estimates and disclosures related to each of these 
matters has been discussed by the Audit Committee. 
Additional information on the accounting policies of the 
Group is set out in note 1 to the financial statements.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a 
result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
The Group had a provision for environmental issues of 
£14.0 million at 31 December 2007 (2006: £15.8 million). 
Approximately one quarter of the provision relates to 
continuing businesses and the remainder relates to 
businesses previously owned by the Group. Provisions for 
environmental issues are judgemental by their nature and 
more difficult to estimate when they relate to sites no longer 
directly controlled by the Group. Elementis has taken a 
consistent approach to estimating environmental provisions.
Pension and other post retirement benefits
The Group accounts for pension and other post retirement 
benefits in accordance with IAS 19. The Group has pension 
scheme assets of £451.8 million (2006: £447.5 million) and 
liabilities of £472.6 million (2006: £484.1 million). The 
actuarial evaluation of these assets and liabilities is based on 
assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, 
discount rates, returns on equities and bonds and mortality 
rates. Due to the size of the pension scheme assets and 
liabilities, relatively small changes in the assumptions can 
have a significant impact on the expense recorded in the 
income statement and on the pension liability recorded 
in the balance sheet. 
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Under IFRS, goodwill is capitalised and tested for 
impairment annually or when changes in circumstances 
indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Other intangible assets are capitalised and amortised 
over their useful economic lives.
Changes to the assumptions used in impairment testing 
could have a material impact on the financial position of 
the Group and on the result for the year.
Financial instruments and derivative instruments
Under IAS 39, financial instruments are recorded initially at 
fair value. Subsequent measurement of those instruments 
reflects the designation of each financial instrument. Gains 
or losses on derivative financial instruments designated as 
cash flow hedges and assessed as effective for the period, 
are taken to equity in accordance with IAS 39. Gains and 
losses taken to equity are reflected in the income statement 
when the hedged cash flow impacts income or its 
occurrence ceases to be probable. 
Due to the requirement to measure the effectiveness of 
hedging instruments, changes in market conditions can 
result in the recognition of unrealised gains or losses on 
hedging instruments in the income statement.
Exceptional items
The Group presents certain items separately as ‘exceptional’. 
These are items which in management’s judgement need to 
be disclosed by virtue of their size and incidence in order for 
the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial 
information. The determination of which items are separately 
disclosed as exceptional items requires a significant degree 
of judgement.
“ Free cash flow... increased by £27.7 million 
to £26.4 million in 2007. This, together with 
net proceeds from businesses disposed 
of £66.8 million... reduced borrowings 
by £84.4 million... to £16.2 milllion...” Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 14
Critical accounting policies continued
Taxation
The Group is required to estimate the income tax in each of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates. This requires an estimation 
of current tax liability together with an assessment of the 
temporary differences which arise as a consequence of 
different accounting and tax treatments. These temporary 
differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which 
are included within the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply when 
the temporary differences reverse.
The Group operates in a number of countries in the world 
and is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules. As a 
consequence the Group is subject to tax audits, which by 
their nature are often complex and can require several years 
to conclude. Management’s judgement is required to 
determine the total provision for income tax. Amounts are 
accrued based on management’s interpretation of country 
specific tax law and likelihood of settlement. However the 
actual tax liabilities could differ from the position and in 
such events an adjustment would be required in the 
subsequent period which could have a material impact.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that 
the tax positions are sustainable. Once considered to be 
probable, management reviews each material tax benefit 
to assess whether a provision should be taken against full 
recognition of the benefit on the basis of potential settlement 
through negotiation. Deferred tax assets are not recognised 
where it is more likely than not that the asset will not be 
realised in the future. This evaluation requires judgements 
to be made including the forecast of future taxable income.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. 
Management regularly considers whether there are any 
indications of impairment to carrying values of property, 
plant and equipment. Impairment reviews are based on 
risk adjusted discounted cash flow projections. Significant 
judgement is applied to the assumptions underlying these 
projections which include estimated discount rates, growth 
rates, future selling prices and direct costs. Changes to 
these assumptions could have a material impact on the 
financial position of the Group and on the result for the year .
Key performance indicators 
The Group’s key performance indicators are a standard 
set of measures against which each business reports on 
a monthly basis. Incentive plans include targets against the 
annual operating plan for operating profit and operating 
cash flow. 
1. Operating profit / operating margin
Operating profit is the profit derived from the normal 
operations of the business. Operating margin is the ratio 
of operating profit or loss to sales before exceptional items. 
The Group achieved an operating profit from continuing 
operations before exceptional items of £38.1 million for 
the year ended 31 December 2007 (2006: £31.5 million). 
This is an increase of 20.9 per cent on the previous year. 
The Group’s operating margin from continuing operations 
was 12.7 per cent compared to 10.4 per cent in 2006.
2. Trade working capital to sales ratio
The trade working capital to sales ratio is defined as 
trade working capital divided by sales expressed as a 
percentage. Trade working capital comprises inventories, 
trade and other receivables and trade and other payables 
but specifically excludes prepayments, capital or interest 
related receivables or payables, business acquisition 
related payables or receivables and items classified as 
other receivables and other payables. The Group’s trade 
working capital to sales ratio at 31 December 2007 was 
21.9 per cent (2006: 22.8 per cent). 
3. Return on operating capital employed
The return on operating capital employed is defined as 
operating profit before exceptional items divided by operating 
capital employed expressed as a percentage. Operating capital 
employed comprises fixed assets (excluding goodwill), working 
capital and operating provisions. Operating provisions include 
self insurance and environmental provisions but exclude 
restructuring provisions and retirement benefit obligations. 
The Group’s return on operating capital employed was 
24.6 per cent for the year ended 31 December 2007 
(2006: 18.8 per cent).

4. Lost time accidents
A lost time accident (‘LTA’) is any work related injury or 
illness sustained by an employee or directly employed 
contractor whilst working at the Group’s premises that 
results in greater than three days lost, excluding the day 
of accident. There were two LTAs in continuing operations 
in 2007 (2006: three) and in discontinued operations, 
there was one LTA (2006: two).
5. Contribution margin
Contribution, which is defined as sales less all variable 
costs, divided by sales and expressed as a percentage is the 
definition of contribution margin. The Group’s contribution 
margin in 2007 was 33.5 per cent (2006: 32.7 per cent). 
6. Operating cash flow
The operating cash flow is defined as the net cash flow 
from operating activities less net capital expenditure but 
excluding income taxes paid or received, interest paid or 
received, pension contributions net of current service cost 
and exceptional items. In 2007 the operating cash flow was 
£47.0 million (2006: £26.4 million). 
Principal risks and uncertainties
The Group has a process that identifies certain risks that 
could affect the business operations and hence the financial 
results of Elementis. These risks are reviewed by the Board 
annually and further information about this process is given 
in the statement on internal control on page 29.
Some risks are relatively well understood and, to a certain 
extent, predictable. Data on other, often emerging, risks 
may be sparse. As a result, some risks may be treated in 
an overly cautious manner, while on others the assessment 
may be over optimistic. Finally, there will be risks that are 
unknown currently or, like epidemics and pandemics, 
beyond the Company’s ability to control.
Commercial risk
The economic climate can create some uncertainties for the 
Group’s businesses but its geographic spread of customers 
and its breadth of product applications reduce the Group’s 
exposure to local economic downturns.
In the chemical industry, significant increases in raw 
material prices and energy costs can be detrimental to 
a company’s financial results. With regard to raw materials, 
the Group aims to continually improve efficiencies of use 
and, where possible, to explore using alternative sources 
of raw materials. Supply chain trends are monitored and 
where appropriate long-term contracts are secured with 
existing suppliers. Alternative sources of supply are also 
identified to minimise the effect of any disruption from 
supplier failure. The Company also maintains a strategic 
stock of raw materials to mitigate against the effect of any 
short term disruption to supply. Fixed price contracts are 
used to provide greater certainty on energy costs.
Operational and hazard risk
The Group is highly dependent on IT systems for managing 
its businesses and has an on-going review programme in 
place to ensure that systems are maintained adequately and 
any repairs or upgrades are made as necessary. Elementis 
is confident that it has a high level of resilience in its IT 
systems and infrastructure, and that IT management has 
adopted good industry practices for protecting against 
malicious attacks. There remains, however, the threat of 
disruption to voice and data infrastructure, which is a risk 
common to many organisations.
Health, safety, environmental (‘HSE’) and property damage 
risks are managed conscientiously to a high standard, as our 
HSE performance statistics show within the HSE report, but it 
is still possible that an accident may occur at a manufacturing 
facility, with risk of harm to people or the environment. 
To reduce this risk the Company has an established incident 
reporting and investigation system including near miss 
reporting. Lessons are learnt from root cause analysis and 
specific corrective actions are backed by annual improvement 
plans on a site and global basis. These are backed up by 
regular equipment and site audits to mitigate against loss 
arising from faulty equipment or processes.
Some of the Group’s manufacturing facilities are located in 
parts of the world where natural hazards such as hurricanes, 
tornados, earthquakes and floods are a predictable risk. Good 
design and management of all facilities is backed by a close 
collaboration with our property insurers. This provides a good 
level of confidence that property is protected from damage 
and consequent business interruption. Nevertheless accidents 
can happen and Elementis has insurance to protect against 
catastrophic loss. 
The Group has taken steps to be prepared to initiate 
effective business continuity to reassure shareholders, 
customers and other stakeholders that, in the unlikely 
event of a major incident or crisis, Elementis would 
remain viable in business.
“ Health, safety, environmental (‘HSE’) 
and property damage risks are managed 
conscientiously to a high standard...  
[T]he Company has an established incident 
reporting and investigation system... corrective 
actions are backed by annual improvement 
plans...[and]... regular equipment and site audits.” Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 16
Principal risks and uncertainties continued
Operational and hazard risk continued
During 2007 Elementis continued with its development 
of a comprehensive business continuity plan (‘BCP’), which 
is being introduced across all sites. The BCP is appropriate 
for the major risks identified and would provide critical 
guidance for risks not yet identified. For example, the 
BCP covers key generic actions such as communications 
to provide accurate and timely information to interested 
parties and hence preserve reputation. The BCP has been 
tested and is subject to continual updating and 
improvement so that it remains viable. 
Financial risk
Implementing a BCP does not render insurance 
unnecessary. Elementis maintains a comprehensive 
insurance programme with limits and deductibles that 
are set to optimise the total cost of risk borne by the Group.
Elementis works closely with underwriters and the Group’s 
insurance brokers to ensure that appropriate cover is in 
place. The management of risk is undertaken through 
focussed risk reduction measures, attention to limits of 
cover, claims management, programme structure and 
insurance premiums. 
As with all businesses there is a risk of failure of financial 
controls. Elementis uses an external controls assurance 
provider to perform an internal audit function and conduct 
a comprehensive programme of internal audits across the 
Group. Significant issues and corrective actions are reported 
to the Audit Committee and reviewed subsequently 
for compliance.
Regulatory and legal risk
Chemical companies are subject to regulations governing the 
chemicals, processes and equipment used. The trend globally 
is for increasingly stringent environmental performance and 
protection of health. Elementis is committed to responding to 
these challenges but there is a risk that tighter requirements 
may involve costs that reduce profitability or may even make 
production of a particular product uneconomic.
For example, the REACH regulations which affect the 
manufacture and import of chemicals products in the EU 
and potentially subject manufacturers to costly registration 
and testing that will have to be borne by the Company or 
passed on to customers. Elementis has active REACH 
management programmes at business level with 
appropriate reporting to the Board.

REviEw of thE yEaR
Other risks faced by the Company include governance 
and compliance risk. Lack of Board oversight and processes 
or ineffective management teams can lead to significant 
financial loss or loss of strategic direction. These risks are 
mitigated by regular Board meetings with comprehensive 
agenda, regular evaluations of Board and management 
team members and regular Board reviews of strategy, 
business plans and compliance programmes. 
Breach of anti-trust or safety laws or failure to obtain 
operating permits can lead to a major financial loss 
or public censure or both thereby damaging the 
creditworthiness and or reputation of the Company, and 
the latter can damage the Company’s long and short-term 
market value. These risks are mitigated by our compliance, 
insurance and risk management programmes, including 
regular HSE compliance audits, supported by external 
advisers and the Internal Audit service. 
In terms of the key legal risks, there remains a risk of toxic 
tort and environmental claims from historical or ongoing 
operations. Despite the insurance in place there is always 
the possibility of an underinsured or uninsured claim and in 
the extreme an insured limit might be exceeded. However, 
Elementis has a robust programme in place to actively 
manage and defend against the threat of legal action or 
claims relating to its products or manufacturing facilities. 
The programme is led by the Group General Counsel who 
is supported by an in-house team and professional advisers. 
Litigation reports are reviewed periodically by the Board. 
Treasury policies and objectives
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures 
approved and monitored by the Board. The Group operates 
a central treasury function which manages and monitors 
external and internal funding requirements and the 
following treasury risks:
•  Credit risk,
•  Liquidity risk,
•  Market risk.
These risks and the Group’s policies to manage these risks 
are set out in note 23.

Leadership
The Chief Executive takes leadership of health, safety and 
environment (‘HSE’) issues at Board level with direct lines of 
reporting from the operational facilities. This includes formal 
monthly reports on HSE performance and rapid notification 
of HSE incidents wherever they occur throughout the world. 
A manufacturing council, comprising senior manufacturing 
and HSE managers, reviews performance monthly, sets 
standards and initiates improvements. 
The Board of Elementis reviews HSE performance at 
its meetings.
Elementis HSE Policy
Elementis conducts business globally with a high level 
of concern for the health and safety of our employees, 
contractors, customers, neighbours and general public 
and for the environment in which we operate.
Elementis seeks to identify and eliminate occupational 
health hazards, is committed to providing a safe work place 
for all employees and strives for zero injuries as part of our 
continual improvement process.
Elementis operates facilities to minimise impact on the 
environment. We view compliance with all applicable legal 
requirements and other codes of practice as our minimum 
standard. Our sustainable development strategy requires 
that we work proactively to reduce emissions, minimise 
waste from our processes, conserve valuable natural 
resources and ensure responsible product stewardship 
throughout the supply chain.
Elementis recognises the importance of communication 
with all interested parties and is committed to open 
dialogue with our neighbours, contractors, customers, 
and the general public about our operations.
The Board and senior management of Elementis are 
committed to this policy and continually monitor 
performance to ensure its implementation.
Commitment
Elementis is committed to preventing harm to people and 
the environment in a sustainable way. Good performance 
in protecting the health and safety of our employees, 
contractors, customers, neighbours and the general public, 
and for the environment in which we operate allows the 
Group to focus on developing, manufacturing and selling 
its products without the cost, in both human and financial 
terms, of accidents and incidents.
Social responsibility
Elementis recognises the international standards for human 
rights and strives to ensure equality of opportunity and fair 
rewards for expertise and knowledge at all its locations 
globally. The Company has a Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics and an Anti-Corruption Policy. The Company also has 
a customer service policy with key account management 
operated to ensure that the views of our customers can 
be taken on board with regard to HSE matters. 
Lost time accidents (‘LTAs’)
Using the UK Health & Safety Executive’s definition of LTA 
(greater than three days lost, not including day of accident), 
the continuing operations of Elementis globally had two 
LTAs in 2007 compared with three in 2006. Over the years 
the rate has reduced to 0.10 LTA per 100,000 hours worked. 
There was one LTA during last year in discontinued 
operations (2006: two). If discontinued operations were 
included in the LTA rate, it would increase marginally 
to 0.11 LTA per 100,000 hours worked.
Recordable incidents
Using ‘Recordable Incidents’ as a standard measure, which is 
used by the American Chemistry Council (‘ACC’), 2007 was our 
safest year ever . Recordable incidents are workplace injuries 
and illnesses that require medical treatment beyond first aid, 
including LTAs.
The Total Recordable Incident Rate for the year was 
0.62 per 200,000 hours (0.65 if including discontinued 
operations), which is the best performance in Elementis’ 
history. Based on the ACC’s average member rate, our 
performance now ranks with companies that are generally 
viewed as ‘best in industry’.
The chart below illustrates our performance and how far 
we have come. This clearly demonstrates that the Elementis 
culture has the right discipline and focus on safety as we 
continue to drive towards an injury-free workplace.

Safety goal: Our goal remains zero recordable incidents, 
with continual improvement in the health and safety of 
our employees leading to year on year improvement in 
safety performance. 
Commitment to the environment
As well as complying with environmental reporting 
requirements, Elementis records and categorises incidents 
according to the seriousness of the impact for monitoring 
purposes, so that continuous improvements can be made. 
Tier 1 incidents have no impact on the environment, 
such as minor spills that can be completely cleaned up. 
Tier 2 incidents have a minor impact and Tier 3 has 
some impact on the environment.
In 2007 the continuing operations of Elementis had one 
Tier 3 incident, compared with zero in 2006. The incident 
involved a tank rupture at a site that required clean up but 
was not subject to any regulatory action. There was also one 
Tier 2 incident, compared with six in 2006. There was also 
one Tier 3 incident in discontinued operations: an operational 
problem that led to a short term emission of sulphur dioxide 
above the permitted quantity.
Environmental goal: Our goal remains zero incidents that 
create harm to the environment, and a continual improvement 
in environmental performance.
The rest of the information contained in this HSE report 
relates to continuing operations only.
Emissions, discharges and waste
Emissions to air, discharges to water and waste disposal 
are regulated by external authorities and controlled carefully 
within Elementis. Emissions are, in part, a function of 
production output. The following charts are normalised to 
production output to take account of the way the Company’s 
production volumes have changed over the years. Note that 
even then changes in product mix can have an affect on the 
emissions, discharges or waste per tonne. As is standard 
practice in the chemical industry, some emission and 
discharge values may be based on samples rather than 
continuous monitoring. Despite good practice and working 
to recognised procedures it is possible that non-representative 
samples may be taken on occasions. 
Emissions to air
Elementis continues to seek to reduce, wherever it can, 
its emissions of carbon dioxide, a ‘greenhouse gas’ which 
facilitates global warming and leads to other consequences 
of climate change. Higher levels of production output in 
the Chromium business last year increased the absolute 
quantities emitted but our rate of emissions remained 
similar to 2006 (see accompanying chart).
Emissions of the oxides of sulphur and nitrogen (‘SOx’) 
and (‘NOx’), which can cause acid rain, increased marginally 
although the business still operates within regulatory limits. 
Volatile organic compounds (‘VOCs’), which can damage soil 
and groundwater or combine with NOx to cause smog, 
remained constant (see accompanying chart).

Discharges to water
Levels rose slightly in 2007 mainly due to increased 
production at sites that have a disproportionate effect 
on the overall total (see accompanying chart).
Solid waste
The Company is committed to minimise the quantity of all 
types of waste. The quantity of hazardous waste resulting 
from operations in Elementis has reduced significantly over 
the last nine years (see accompanying chart). The low level that 
remains is highly controlled and subject to licensed disposal. 
There is also non-hazardous waste arising from operations. 
Amounts initially increased due to substitution of the 
previously emitted hazardous waste, but since then there 
has been a steady decline. Recycling is used where possible 
but it should be noted that most of the waste is the residual 
oxides of iron, magnesium and aluminium in the naturally 
occurring chromite ore after the chromium has been 
extracted for use in chromium chemical manufacturing. 
Water consumption
With the exception of the hectorite mine in the US, 
the Company does not operate in areas of extreme water 
shortage. Nevertheless, water is a valuable resource and 
the Company recognises the global need to conserve it. 
Water consumption is minimised where possible by 
treatment and recycling. The accompanying chart shows 
that water consumption has followed a declining trend 
in recent years.
Energy consumption
Conserving energy is important for sustainable development. 
As an expensive resource, energy efficiency also has a 
significant effect on the cost of production. Since 1999 the 
Group has been recording all energy use. The accompanying 
chart is normalised to gigajoules (‘GJ’) and gigajoules 
per tonne (‘GJ/te’) to provide consistent energy units. This 
shows that over the last nine years the Group’s consumption 
of energy (left hand scale) has reduced by around 57 per cent 
in total, and the consumption per tonne of production 
(right hand scale) has reduced by approximately 50 per cent.

Product stewardship
Elementis recognises its responsibility to ensure that its 
products are safe for the intended use, transport and the 
environment throughout the product life cycle. Safe use 
is guided by long experience of many of our products 
in conjunction with third party studies and regulatory 
requirements. Information is provided via technical 
bulletins, safety data sheets and labelling – all backed 
up by discussion with our customers and suppliers, 
and participation with industry associations. 
In the US, Elementis Specialties is a member of the 
industry initiative Responsible Care
®
 and complies with the 
stringent demands of membership. This means that, for 
example, our procurement policies include criteria that 
take into consideration HSE factors. Other manufacturing 
locations elsewhere in the world adopt similar practices.
The Company is fully engaged in the REACH programme 
for registering substances (our products) manufactured 
in Europe and imported products where applicable. 
HSE hazards and risks
Elementis is committed to identifying hazards and reducing 
risk to people and the environment. Corporate audits are 
conducted to assess compliance. 
New equipment and plant is subject to HSE review including 
where appropriate hazard and operability studies (HAZOP). 
A formal modification control system is employed to ensure 
that changes to plant are approved with due consideration 
of risk as well as financial cost. 
The Company has a set of policies to cover life critical 
activities such as working at heights and in confined spaces. 
Many sites are certified to external standards such 
ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.
A well established mandatory incident reporting system 
records HSE incidents (including near-misses) worldwide 
throughout Elementis. A structured investigation process 
is then adopted to establish root causes and implement 
effective corrective actions. Learning from these incidents 
is then shared across the Company to help prevent similar 
incidents occurring elsewhere and, in the case of repeat 
occurrences, to identify trends for further action. 
Behavioural safety programmes and a mandatory scheme of 
routine plant inspections by management ensures that working 
practices and plant conditions are maintained in good order . 
Major hazards and risks (including those from natural 
perils) are identified and included in the Company’s risk 
management process (referred to in page 15 of the 
Business review section of this Annual Report). 
Continual improvement in HSE 
Each site has an annual plan with HSE objectives that 
should have a positive impact on safety. These plans are 
drawn up in conjunction with the manufacturing council who 
then monitors performance and provide guidance to achieve 
the desired results. Additionally, the Audit Committee 
approved the inclusion of HSE reporting within the scope 
of the internal audit programme for 2008.
Community well-being
Elementis works with local communities to provide information 
on its activities and be a responsible neighbour . The Company 
provides focussed support for children and disadvantaged 
groups, and encourages employees to be active in their 
communities through volunteer work or fundraising. 
For example, a long-term activity has been the Ecology Site 
on land owned by Elementis Chromium at Eaglescliffe in the 
UK. Employee volunteers have been working there for over 
ten years to create a conservation site, protecting a variety 
of vulnerable species, and providing a nature study resource 
for children and other groups. The success of this has led 
to the development of a partnership with two local schools 
to provide Forest School classrooms. These schools have 
dedicated sites to build camps. They use these as bases 
for carrying out a range of activities that provide a calming 
influence on children with emotional and behavioural 
difficulties to help build self-esteem and confidence. Elementis plc

Directors’ report
Employment policies
The Group Chief Executive is the Board member responsible 
for employee matters and he is assisted by a Vice-President 
of Global Human Resources.
The Group is committed to the principle of equal opportunity 
in employment, regardless of a person’s race, creed, colour, 
nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, 
religion or disability, and will not tolerate discrimination 
in any form. Employment policies are fair, equitable and 
consistent with the skills and abilities of the employee and 
the needs of the Group’s businesses.
These policies ensure that everyone is accorded equal 
opportunity for recruitment, training and promotion. Where 
existing employees become disabled, it is the Group’s policy 
wherever practicable to provide continuing employment 
under normal terms and conditions and to provide training, 
career development and promotion to disabled employees 
wherever appropriate.
The Board expects the Group to conduct its operations 
based on sound ethical practices which are open and free 
from discrimination and harassment. It has adopted and 
disseminated throughout the Group a Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics that is supported by appropriate policies 
and procedures, including clear guidelines on matters such 
as competition law, bribery and policies on whistleblowing. 
Web-based, modular training courses are required to be 
completed by all management level staff. 
Employee communications and involvement
It is Group policy to communicate with all employees on 
major matters to encourage them to take a wider interest 
in the affairs of their employing company and the Group 
and to make them aware of the financial and economic 
factors affecting the Company’s performance. This is done 
in a variety of ways including informal consultations, 
bulletins and briefing sessions. There are well established 
procedures, including regular meetings with recognised 
unions, to ensure that the views of employees are taken into 
account in making decisions likely to affect their interests. 
Managers throughout the Group have a responsibility to 
keep their staff informed of developments and matters of 
interest. The Company operates a savings-related share 
option scheme allowing UK and US employees an opportunity 
to become shareholders, details of which are set out in 
Note 26 to the Financial Statements on pages 67 and 68.
Going concern and Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors are satisfied that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to continue to operate 
for the foreseeable future and confirm that the Company 
and the Group are going concerns. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
these financial statements.
The Directors’ responsibilities statement and statement on 
internal control are set out in the Corporate governance report. 
Report and financial statements
The directors submit their report and the audited financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2007.

‘Group’) are the manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals.
The Chairman’s statement and Business review, the latter 
of which forms a part of this report, contain a fair review 
of the development, performance and position of the Group, 
as well as of principal risks and uncertainties, including 
policies on financial risk, and likely future developments. 
The Health, safety and environment report summarises the 
Group’s approach to health and safety, environmental and 
community matters.
The Group undertakes, on a continuing basis, research 
and development activities for new products and to improve 
existing products.

these directors served on the Board throughout the financial 
year. Past directors include Edward Bramson who retired 
as a director at the end of the 2007 Annual General Meeting 
on 26 April 2007 and Matthew Peacock who served throughout 
the financial year and stepped down from the Board on 
31 January 2008. 
The interests of directors in the share capital of the 
Company are set out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting, Brian Taylorson and 
Kevin Matthews will retire in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and offer themselves for re-election 
by shareholders. Kevin Matthews does not have a service 
contract with any Group company. Brian Taylorson has 
a service contract with the Company, which does not have 
a fixed term but provides for a notice period from the 
Company of 12 months. 
Kevin Matthews as a non-executive director has undergone 
a formal performance evaluation and his performance 
continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment 
to his role including commitment of time for Board and 
committee meetings and his other duties. The Board 
recommends the re-elections of Kevin Matthews and 
Brian Taylorson.  Elementis plc

Information required by section 992  
of the Companies Act 2006
The Company’s share capital consists of ordinary shares, 
as set out in Note 39 to the Financial Statements on page 74. 
All of the Company’s issued ordinary shares are fully paid up 
and rank equally in all respects. The rights attached to them, 
in addition to those conferred on their holders by law, are set 
out in the Company’s Articles of Association (‘the Articles’). 
Other than those specific provisions set out in the Articles, 
there are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
or on the exercise of voting rights attached to them. From 
time to time the Elementis Employee Share Ownership Trust 
holds shares in the Company for the purposes of various 
share incentive plans and the rights attaching to them are 
exercised by independent trustees, who may take into account 
any recommendation by the Company. 
Rules about the appointment and replacement of directors 
are set out in the Articles. Changes to the Articles must be 
approved by shareholders passing a special resolution. The 
directors’ powers are conferred on them by UK legislation 
and by the Articles. The Board has the power conferred on 
it by shareholders to purchase its own shares and is seeking 
renewal of that power at the forthcoming AGM within the 
limits set out in the notice of that meeting.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company 
is a party which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of 
change of control of the Company. There are no agreements 
providing for compensation for directors or employees on 
change of control. 
Substantial shareholders
As at 22 February 2008 the Company had been notified of 
the following interests in 3 per cent or more of the voting 
rights in its issued ordinary share capital:

Auditor
A resolution to re-appoint KPMG Audit Plc as auditors 
of the Company will be proposed at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 April 2008.
Each director in office at the date of this Directors’ report 
confirms that, so far as he is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware and that he has taken all the steps that he ought 
to have taken as a director to make himself aware of any 
relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditors are aware of that information. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 26
Corporate governance
Information of an appropriate quality is issued in a timely 
manner to assist the Board in performing its duties. New 
directors receive appropriate induction tailored to their 
needs. This includes visits to manufacturing facilities 
and meetings with senior management to assist them in 
building an understanding of how the Group operates and 
the issues that it faces. New directors are advised of their 
legal and other duties and other obligations as directors 
of a listed company. All members of the Board have access 
to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and 
may take independent professional advice as appropriate 
at the expense of the Company. 
Directors are encouraged to undertake such activities and 
training as is appropriate or may be required or desirable 
in order to carry out their duties. At least one meeting of the 
Board each year is held at an operating division’s offices. Last 
year, the Board had one of its meetings at the Hightstown 
office in New Jersey, USA and a group of non-executive 
directors, including the Chairman, together with the Finance 
Director visited the hectorite mine at Newberry Springs in 
California. Inspecting operating facilities and interacting with 
staff help non-executive directors to better understand the 
risks faced by the business, including environmental, social 
and governance risks. 
Board Performance Evaluation
The Board is supportive of the principles and provisions 
of the Combined Code on Board Performance Evaluation 
and towards the end of last year carried out an evaluation 
of its performance, including the performance of its 
committees and of individual directors, using comprehensive 
assessment questionnaires. The results of the questionnaires 
were reviewed by the Board and the Chairman also met 
with Board members individually. The Board believes that 
the performance of non-executive directors continues to 
be effective and demonstrates commitment to their role 
including commitment of time for Board and committee 
meetings and their other duties.
During the year the Senior Independent Director chaired 
a meeting of the non-executive directors to review the 
performance of the Chairman without him being present, 
and concluded that the Chairman was fully effective in 
his role. 
Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to maintaining high standards 
of corporate governance. 
The Company has throughout the year ended 31 December 2007 
applied fully all the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code 
of Corporate Governance (June 2006) as issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council (the ‘Combined Code’).
The Board
Composition
The Board currently consists of a non-executive Chairman, 
Group Chief Executive, Finance Director and four non-executive 
directors. The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive 
are separate and clearly defined. Non-executive directors are 
appointed for an initial term of three years, and all directors 
are required under the Articles to retire and offer themselves 
for re-election at least every three years.
Matthew Peacock stepped down from the Board at the 
end of January 2008 and Ken Minton, Senior Independent 
Director, will retire at the conclusion of the 2008 Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’). Ian Brindle will be appointed 
Senior Independent Director in his place. The Nomination 
Committee has appointed The Miles Partnership to assist 
with the recruitment of an additional non-executive director 
and the Board considers that the structure and composition 
of the Board will then be appropriate to take the Company 
through to the next stage of its development. 
Board independence
The Board considers all the non-executive directors to be 
independent, notwithstanding the fact that Ian Brindle and 
Ken Minton currently have other directorships in common 
and that when he was a director Matthew Peacock was a 
principal of Hanover Investors which until June 2007 was 
a shareholder of the Company. The Board is satisfied that 
each director exercises independent judgement and believes 
no individual or group dominates decision making. 
Board operation
The Board operates within a framework of controls used 
to minimise risks and has a formal schedule of matters 
specifically reserved to it for decision. These include 
strategic and annual operating plans, the approval of 
financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, major 
non-recurring projects and major capital expenditures. 
The Board regularly reviews management performance 
and sets values and standards to ensure that its obligations 
to its shareholders and others are understood and met. It 
also delegates specific responsibilities with written terms 
of reference to the Board Committees described on page 27.  Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 27
CorporatE govErnanCE
The Committee has two members with ‘recent and relevant 
financial experience’ when one is recommended by the 
Combined Code. Ian Brindle’s qualification is based on his 
career with PricewaterhouseCoopers and his current role at 
the Financial Reporting Review Panel, and Chris Girling was 
most recently Group Finance Director at FTSE 250 listed 
Carillion plc.
A description of the remit and work of the Audit Committee
The Committee has delegated authority from the Board for:
•  monitoring the integrity of the financial statements and 
reviewing significant accounting policies, judgements 
and estimates contained within them;
•  reviewing the effectiveness of internal control and risk 
management systems, including control over financial 
reporting; 
•  reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function, 
including of the risk management programme; 
•  reviewing the Group’s policies and practices concerning 
business conduct, ethics and integrity and on 
whistleblowing; and 
•  overseeing all aspects of the relationship with the 
external auditors, including their appointment, the audit 
process, the supply of non-audit services and monitoring 
their effectiveness and independence. 
The Audit Committee met five times during 2007. Findings 
and recommendations at each of its meetings are given to 
the Board. The Committee met to review the annual and 
interim reports and financial statements and also to receive 
half yearly reports from the internal audit providers, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (‘PwC’), as well as representations 
from management. During the year it reviewed the 
effectiveness of the internal and external audit activities 
through meetings and interviews with management and 
key finance staff, approved the scope of work of and fees 
for both internal and external auditors, and concluded that, 
owing to the complexity and international nature of the 
Group’s businesses, the internal audit function was best 
served by continuing to outsource to PwC, given their global 
expertise and resources. The Committee also reviewed the 
Group’s risk management programme as part of the full 
Board’s review of risk management in November 2007.

Communication with shareholders
The Board has developed a comprehensive programme 
to ensure that effective communication with shareholders, 
analysts and the financial press is maintained throughout 
the year. Through the annual and interim reports, results 
and other announcements, as well as through presentations 
to institutional shareholders and the dissemination of 
information via the Group’s website at www.elementis.com, 
the Board seeks to present its strategy and performance in 
an objective and balanced manner.
Shareholders attending the AGM are invited to ask questions 
during the meeting and also to meet the directors after 
the formal business of the meeting has concluded. The 
Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees are 
also available to answer questions from any shareholder 
at the meeting. Full details of proxy votes cast on each 
resolution are made available to shareholders at the 
meeting and are made available on the Company’s website 
after the meeting.
The Board receives regular reports on any meetings held 
with shareholders or analysts, and the Chairman and 
Senior Independent Director are also available for contact 
by shareholders at any time.
Board Committees
The Board has established Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees, all with defined terms 
of reference, modelled closely on those set out in the 
Combined Code, which are available from the Company 
Secretary or can be found on the Company’s website 
at www.elementis.com.

Corporate governance
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and 
Company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law the directors are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by 
the EU and have elected to prepare the Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
The Group financial statements are required by law and 
IFRS, as adopted by the EU, to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the Group. The Companies 
Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial 
statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. 
The Company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
parent company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
•  for the Group financial statements, state whether they 
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted 
by the EU;
•  for the Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the parent company financial statements; and
•  prepare the financial statements on the going concern 
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
1985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps 
as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors 
are also responsible for preparing a Business review, 
Directors’ report, Directors’ remuneration report and 
Corporate governance statement that comply with that 
law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Audit Committee continued
The Committee keeps under review the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditors and the nature and 
extent of the non-audit services which they provide. The 
Committee has adopted a policy which prohibits certain 
types of non-audit work from being performed by the 
Company’s auditors, particularly where auditor objectivity 
and independence could be at risk. The Company’s policy 
is that any appointment of the external auditors to undertake 
non-audit work is subject to the approval of the Audit 
Committee unless it falls below a threshold in which case 
the Finance Director has delegated authority from the 
Committee to approve such appointments. The threshold 
is where any individual non-audit engagement fee is no 
greater than 15 per cent of the annual Group audit fee 
and the total cost of non-audit engagements in the same 
financial year do not exceed 50 per cent of the annual Group 
audit fee. The external auditors were appointed during the 
year to undertake tax work for the Group. It was thought 
that their knowledge of the Group’s business processes 
and controls makes them best placed to undertake this 
work cost-effectively on the Group’s behalf. The Committee 
believes that notwithstanding the tax advisory services they 
provided during the year, the external auditors’ objectivity 
is not impaired. The Committee also reviewed its policy 
on whistleblowing during the year. 
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee (the 
‘Committee’) and their attendance records are shown 
on page 27. Robert Beeston is the Committee’s Chairman. 
The Committee is responsible for:
•  reviewing the size and composition of the Board, 
together with the skills, knowledge and experience 
of its members and making recommendations for 
change as necessary;
•  carrying-out an annual performance evaluation 
of the Board and its Committees and members; and
•  succession planning for the Board and leadership team.
The Committee met twice in 2007 to discuss changes to 
the Board and review the results of the Board Performance 
Evaluation exercise. It concluded that, for the time being, 
the recruitment of one additional non-executive director 
would be sufficient to give the Board the balance, structure, 
skills and experience it needs. The procedures applied 
by the Committee in the recruitment a new non-executive 
director follow closely those set out in the Combined 
Code provisions.

Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive Group-wide system of financial 
reporting. Figures reported include profit, cash flows, capital 
expenditure, balance sheet and relevant performance 
indicators. Each operating division prepares an annual 
operating plan which is approved by the Board. Thereafter 
a formal re-forecasting exercise is undertaken three times 
a year . Actual monthly results are monitored against budget, 
forecasts and the previous year’s results. Any significant 
variances are investigated and acted upon as appropriate.
Investment appraisal
There are clearly defined investment guidelines for capital 
expenditure. All such expenditure is subject to formal 
authorisation procedures, with major proposals being 
considered by the Board. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee plays a critical role within the Company’s 
system of internal control and risk management and a full 
description of its work is given on pages 27 and 28.
By order of the Board

Internal control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management and for reviewing 
the effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only 
be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives and can therefore only 
provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Board is of the view that an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks 
faced by the Group was in place throughout the financial 
year under review and up to the date that this Annual Report 
was approved. This process is regularly reviewed by the 
Board and accords with the Financial Reporting Council’s 
‘Turnbull’ and ‘Smith’ guidance on internal control. 
The key features of the Group’s internal control system are:
Control environment
A key factor in the Group’s approach to internal control 
is the recognition of the need for risk awareness and the 
ownership of risk management by executives at all levels. 
The Group has policies and procedures that set out the 
responsibilities of Divisional Management, including 
authority levels, reporting disciplines and responsibility 
for risk management and internal control. Certain activities, 
including treasury, taxation, insurance, pension and legal 
matters are controlled centrally with reports reviewed by 
the Board as appropriate. Site-level policies and procedures 
are set by Divisional Management appropriate to the needs 
of each business unit. 
Risk identification and review
Key identified risks, both financial and non financial, are 
reviewed by the Board as well as by Divisional Management 
on an ongoing basis, which is supported by the work of the 
Audit Committee and the Internal Audit service, which is 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (‘PwC’). A formal 
annual review of risks and controls is carried out by both the 
Management Team and the Board, and the meetings last 
year, which included presentations from senior managers, 
were held in September and November respectively. 
The Management Team, which comprises the executive 
directors, divisional managing directors and functional 
business leaders, meets on a regular basis to review each 
division’s performance, strategy and risk management. 
Their work is supported by a central risk management unit 
whose terms of reference include supporting corporate 
governance requirements, recommending business risk 
strategy and developing policies and procedures for risk 
management and internal controls. PwC’s work covers the 
monitoring of the effectiveness of internal controls and the 
design of processes to test the effectiveness of controls. 
At operating level, both divisions are required to have 
processes to identify risks, and so far as possible, take 
action to reduce those risks, and annual compliance 
statements on internal control are certified by each 
operating division. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 30
Salaries, fees and benefits
Salaries for executive directors are determined by the 
Committee and are reviewed annually by it, taking into 
account individual performance over the previous 12 months, 
external benchmark salary data and pay and employment 
conditions elsewhere in the Group. David Dutro was awarded 
a 30 per cent increase to his basic salary, from 1 January 2008, 
to bring his pay into line with the median pay that chief 
executives of similar sized companies get both in the US 
and UK. Brian Taylorson’s basic salary was increased by 
three per cent from 1 January 2008. 
Benefits relate to the provision of a car, life assurance 
and medical cover. Additionally, as is standard in the 
US, David Dutro receives benefits covering dental costs, 
accidental death and disablement, and long-term disability. 
Information about pension benefits and share incentive 
schemes is provided further below.
Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the 
Board, having regard to fees paid to non-executive directors 
in other UK quoted companies, the time commitment and 
responsibilities of the role. No share options are held by 
non-executive directors and individuals cannot vote on 
their own remuneration.
Service contracts
It is the Company’s policy that salaried executive directors 
should have service contracts with the Company that contain 
a termination notice period not exceeding 12 months, as is 
the case with the service agreements of David Dutro and 
Brian Taylorson.
Termination payments in relation to departing executive 
directors are not agreed in advance and are determined 
in accordance with the directors’ contractual rights. It 
is the Committee’s policy to ensure that a director’s duty 
to mitigate his loss is taken into account in the calculation 
of any termination payments.
The total amount that would be payable to David Dutro for 
early termination by the Company of his service agreement 
is between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate of 
(i) his basic annual salary and (ii) any bonus which he may 
be eligible to receive.
The total amount that would be payable to Brian Taylorson 
for early termination by the Company of his service agreement 
is between also 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the aggregate 
of (i) his basic annual salary, (ii) the sums that would have 
become payable to him or on his behalf, had 12 months’ 
notice of termination been given, by way of pension 
contributions and any pension cash salary supplement, 
(iii) the cost of providing private medical insurance for him, 
his spouse and children aged under 21 for the 12 months 
following termination, and (iv) his monthly car allowance 
for a 12 month period.
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee (‘the Committee’), which 
is chaired by Ken Minton, determines the remuneration of 
the Chairman and the executive directors, and recommends 
and monitors the structure and level of remuneration for 
senior executives.
The Committee met four times in 2007 and its members 
and their attendance records are shown on page 27. At the 
conclusion of the 2008 Annual General Meeting, subject to 
his re-election, Kevin Matthews will be appointed Chairman 
of the Committee in place of Ken Minton who will retire from 
the Board. The Committee will then comprise Kevin Matthews 
and Chris Girling, which is the minimum number required for 
smaller companies under the Combined Code.
Members of the Committee have no personal financial 
interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be 
decided and no day-to-day involvement in the running 
of the business of the Group.
Advisers to the Committee
The Vice President, Global Human Resources is the internal 
adviser to the Committee and provides information and advice 
to facilitate discussion and decision making on remuneration 
matters. He also provides the Company and its subsidiaries 
with services which include the setting of employment policies, 
recruitment of senior managers and overall responsibility for 
all major issues involving human resources.
The Committee was assisted by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
in relation to the proposed 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
the annual review of salaries of the executive directors.
Annual General Meeting
A resolution to approve this report will be tabled at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’). The Chairman of the 
Committee is available to answer questions from 
shareholders on the decisions of the Committee. 
Remuneration policy and practice
The policy of the Committee for the current and subsequent 
years is to set basic salaries at a level which is competitive 
with that of comparable businesses enabling the Company 
to attract and retain people with relevant ability, experience 
and skills. To ensure that executive directors align their 
interests to those of shareholders a substantial proportion 
of the overall remuneration package is linked to individual 
and corporate performance through participation in 
short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee does not consider corporate performance 
on environmental, social and corporate governance issues 
when setting the remuneration of executive directors. The 
Committee believes that management should aspire to 
achieving high standards in both safety and environmental 
performance without the need for incentives. It is also not 
appropriate to remunerate executive directors on the basis 
of corporate governance performance as corporate 
governance standards are set by the Board as a whole.

1998 Executive Share Option Schemes
The 1998 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option 
Schemes (the ‘1998 Schemes’) are discretionary option 
schemes under which senior management below Board 
level were granted options to purchase shares in the 
Company. The price at which options may be exercised 
is the average market price over the five working days 
preceding the grant and there is no discount. Options are 
capable of exercise after three years and within ten years 
of the date of grant; those granted since 1995 are subject 
to EPS performance targets. The 1998 Schemes have now 
expired and no further options will be granted. However, 
subject to the rules of the Schemes, certain awards 
continue to remain exercisable.
2003 Executive Share Option Schemes
The 2003 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option 
Schemes (‘the 2003 Schemes’) replaced the 1998 Schemes. 
The main features of the 2003 Schemes are as follows:
•  Options are granted with an exercise price per share 
based on the Company’s share price immediately before 
the date of grant.
•  The value of options at the date of grant will not normally 
exceed 1.5 times basic salary in any financial year.
•  Conditions attached to the exercise of options granted 
between 2003 and 2007 to executive directors and other 
senior managers were based partly on the Company’s 
EPS growth relative to inflation and partly on the 
Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) relative 
to the comparator companies comprising national 
and international chemical companies.
The comparator companies for purposes of grants in 2007  
were the following:
FTSE All Share Chemicals Croda International Plc 
 Imperial Chemical Industries 
 PLC (since de-listed) 
 Porvair plc 
 Yule Catto & Co plc
FTSE Eurotop 300 Chemicals Akzo Nobel NV 
 Ciba Specialty Chemicals  
 DSM NV 
 Degussa AG (since de-listed)

 Rohm & Haas Company
Switzerland: 
Specialty Chemicals Lonza Group AG
S&P 400 Specialty Chemicals Ferro Corp 
 HB Fuller Co 
 Minerals Technologies Inc 
 Arch Chemicals Inc 
 Quaker Chemical Corp
France: Chemicals Rhodia SA
The non-executive directors during the year held 
engagement letters with the Company as follows:
    Date of Date of 
Name    appointment expiry
Robert Beeston    21/9/06 20/9/09
Edward Bramson    6/6/05 5/6/08
Ian Brindle    6/6/05 5/6/08
Chris Girling    29/4/05 28/4/08

Ken Minton    6/6/05 5/6/08
Matthew Peacock    6/6/05 5/6/08
Each letter provides that the director’s appointment can 
be terminated by the Company on six months’ notice on 
any grounds without claim for compensation. Ken Minton 
will retire at the conclusion of the AGM. Kevin Matthews’ 
appointment was recently renewed for a further three 
years from 16 February 2008 and he will retire and offer 
himself for re-election at the AGM. It is the Board’s 
intention to renew the appointments of Ian Brindle and 
Chris Girling for a second three-year term when their 
respective appointments expire.
Short-term incentive arrangements 
The 2007 Annual Bonus Scheme for David Dutro and 
Brian Taylorson was based on the achievement of earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) performance hurdles contained in the 
operating plan, at threshold, target and upper levels. At the 
target level, the bonus provided for a value of 70 per cent of 
basic salary at the time the payment is made, and at upper 
level a further 30 per cent of basic salary can be added. 
There is an additional element in which both executive 
directors can share, together with three other senior 
executives, equally up to a maximum of 25 per cent of the 
equivalent earnings pool for achieved EPS over and above 
upper level, subject to a maximum cap which for the 
executive directors was equivalent to 73 per cent of their 
average basic annual salary. The amount paid to each 
executive director under this element was equivalent to 
less than 15 per cent of their average basic annual salary. 
The 2008 Annual Bonus Scheme follows a similar design 
and structure. 
In December, the Committee decided to award the executive 
directors a special bonus of £25,000 each for the work they did 
in securing the sale of the Pigments division. The Committee 
considers that there were exceptional circumstances which 
justify this special bonus payment. As reported in previous 
Annual Reports, restructuring initiatives implemented in the 
Pigments division by management over recent years resulted 
in steadily improving results in a highly competitive environment, 
and the unsolicited offer for the business confirms this. The 
price obtained (gross proceeds of £70.7 million) represents 
an attractive multiple of 2006 operating profit (earnings before 
interest and tax) of 11.5 times, and demonstrates the value 
delivered to shareholders. Despite regulatory hurdles from 
several competition authorities, the transaction was completed 
earlier than expected as a result of management’s intensified 
efforts to further strengthen the Group’s balance sheet and, 
in line with declared strategic intent, focus more of the Group’s 
resources on growing the more profitable Specialties business. Elementis plc

executives with shareholders. Participants who receive awards 
under the 2008 Plan would not also receive new awards under 
any existing discretionary share incentive plan. Further details 
about the 2008 Plan, including a summary of the rules, are 
provided in the circular and explanatory notes attached to 
the Notice of Meeting enclosed with this Annual Report.
Share ownership guidelines
Shareholding guidelines introduced previously required 
executive directors to build up a stake in the Company over 
a period of time that is equal in value to one times their basic 
annual salaries. Brian Taylorson, who has been Finance 
Director since 2002, has met this requirement. David Dutro, 
who was appointed to the Board as Group Chief Executive in 
January 2007, will also be expected to build up a shareholding 
equal to his basic annual salary. The proposed 2008 Plan 
contains a requirement that a proportion of the awards which 
vest must be retained as shares by the executive directors in 
order to build up the required shareholding under the Share 
ownership guidelines.
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes
Under the 1998 UK savings-related share option scheme 
(‘1998 UK SAYE Scheme’) all eligible UK employees, including 
executive directors, can enter into savings contracts with 
a building society or bank for a period of three or five years 
and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to acquire 
shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. 
The option price at which options may be exercised is the 
average market price over the five working days preceding 
the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent. 
Options granted to executive directors under the 
1998 UK SAYE Scheme are not subject to performance 
conditions, as it is a HM Revenue & Customs approved 
all-employee scheme, which does not allow for the imposition 
of performance conditions on the exercise of options. 
A similar scheme operates for US based employees, 
including executive directors, and the savings period is 
typically 24 months, with an option price discounted by 
a maximum of 15 per cent (‘US SAYE Scheme’).
The 1998 UK SAYE and US SAYE Schemes expire during 
2008 and a replacement UK SAYE scheme is being proposed 
at the AGM. The new 2008 UK SAYE Scheme will also be 
HM Revenue & Customs approved and will therefore contain 
substantially the same provisions as before. A resolution 
will be proposed at the AGM to authorise the directors to 
adopt appendices to the new 2008 UK SAYE Scheme in order 
to allow equivalent arrangements to be made for the benefit 
of non UK employees. More details about these two new 
schemes are provided in the accompanying circular and 
Notice of Meeting.
The Committee recommends the adoption at the AGM of 
both the 2008 Plan and the 2008 UK SAYE Scheme as well 
as the approval of the resolution to authorise the directors 
to establish savings based share option schemes for non 
UK employees. 
2003 Executive Share Option Schemes continued
The following targets applied to options granted to executive 
directors and other senior managers.
Proportion of

The EPS performance condition and TSR condition apply separately to options 
granted under the 2003 Schemes.
•  The performance conditions will initially be tested after 
three years. If they are not satisfied, then they may be 
retested after four years, from the same fixed base point. 
To the extent they are not met after the end of the fourth 
financial year, the options will lapse. Options granted 
in 2006 and subsequently will not be retested. 
•  The Committee believes that this combination of targets 
is the most appropriate way of measuring both the total 
returns to shareholders relative to similar businesses 
and the Company’s underlying financial performance. 
The assessment of the performance targets was carried 
out by Hoare Govett Limited.
Grants of options were made under the 2003 Schemes in 
that year and every year since 2003. 
2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan
Following our review into the remuneration and incentive 
structures and consultation with many of our major 
shareholders, the Committee is recommending the adoption 
of a new long-term incentive plan primarily for executive 
directors and senior executives. Subject to the approval of 
shareholders at the AGM, the Committee intends to introduce 
this new long-term incentive plan during 2008 (the ‘2008 Plan’). 
This new scheme replaces the performance share plan that 
was envisaged last year .
The 2008 Plan would be based around three key features: 
(i) Total Shareholder Return (comprising dividends and 
increase in the share price) over three years must exceed the 
performance baseline (being the cost of equity over the same 
three year period), in order for any awards to vest; (ii) a Plan 
pool is then calculated as a set percentage of the growth in 
value of the Company over the performance baseline; and 
(iii) each participant would have a set entitlement over part 
of the Plan pool established at the outset.
The Committee believes that providing such a share-based 
long-term incentive arrangement for the executive directors 
and senior executives would best align the interests of those  Elementis plc

Total shareholder return performance
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return for the five years ending 31 December 2007, relative to 
the FTSE All Share Index.
This graph looks at the value, to the end of 2007, of £100 invested in Elementis on 31 December 2002 compared with that of 
£100 invested in the FTSE All Share Index.
The Company is a member of the FTSE All Share Index and accordingly this is considered to be the most appropriate broad 
equity market index for the purpose of measuring the Company’s relative performance.

5   Emoluments for Brian Taylorson also exclude salary supplements paid as compensation for the limitation of pension 
rights to the HM Revenue & Customs’ earnings cap. These are shown in the Directors’ retirement benefits table below. 
His basic salary was increased by 3 per cent from 1 January 2008. 
6   The Company has released Brian Taylorson to serve on the Board of Fiberweb plc and fees of £32,000 (2006: £9,000) 
were paid to him during the year.

Retirement benefits
David Dutro, as a US salaried executive director, participated in the Elementis Career Reward Retirement Plan (‘ECRRP’) 
for US employees until the plan was frozen on 1 May 2006. The ECRRP is a cash balance retirement plan, which falls under 
the category of defined benefit pension plans in the US. As the plan is frozen, participants’ account balances are no longer 
credited with contributions, however, interest is credited each year at the US Treasury 30 year bond rate. David Dutro’s 
accrued benefits under this plan is shown in the table below. The normal pensionable retirement age for David Dutro 
under the ECRRP is 65.
David Dutro also participated in the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (‘SERP’), which is a supplemental scheme 
for US executives. This plan was also frozen on 1 May 2006 and he received a one-off settlement of £150,000 in June 2007 
in lieu of any benefits payable from this plan. 
The ECRRP and SERP were replaced by a US 401(k) Plan, which is a money purchase scheme, and a Non-Qualified 
Deferred Compensation Plan. Employer contributions in respect of David Dutro under these plans in 2007 were £13,751 
in total. 
Brian Taylorson, as a UK salaried executive director, participates in the Company’s HM Revenue & Customs approved 
funded occupational pension scheme, and he is subject to the HM Revenue and Customs’ earnings cap on the amount 
of salary which may be treated as pensionable.
The main benefits under this scheme to him as a UK salaried executive director, who contributes a percentage of his 
salary to the scheme each year, are:
•  an accrual rate of 1/30 for each year of pensionable service;
•  life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary; and
•  pensions to spouse and dependent children payable on death.
The normal pensionable retirement age for Brian Taylorson is 60.

Notes:
Transfer values for David Dutro and Brian Taylorson have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the 
UK Institute of Faculty of Actuary’s guidance note GN11. The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits discloses the current 
value of the increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the year, whereas the increase in transfer value less 
directors’ contributions discloses the absolute change in transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits 
resulting from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the start of the year as well as the additional value earned in the year . 
The increase in transfer value less directors’ contributions for David Dutro is attributable to the interest credit described above.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to retirement benefits.

Directors’ share options continued
The gain made by David Dutro from the exercise of options was £185,558 and by Brian Taylorson was £420,094 
(2006: £771,455).
Note 26 to the financial statements contains a detailed schedule of all options granted to directors and employees 
as at 31 December 2007. All of the share options were granted for nil consideration.
The market price of ordinary shares at 31 December 2007 was 76.0 pence and the range during 2007 was 70.3 pence 
to 105.3 pence. 
David Dutro is also a recipient of awards made in 2004 and 2005 under the Deferred Share Bonus Scheme. Under the 
Annual Bonus Scheme in operation at the time, certain senior employees were entitled to receive part of their annual 
bonus payments in the form of deferred shares. David Dutro received an award of 46,495 and 25,078 deferred shares in 2004 
and 2005 respectively. These are not subject to further performance conditions and vest three years after the award date. 
The 46,495 deferred shares which vested this year were sold for 88.3p per share by David Dutro who made a gain of £41,055. 
The deferred shares that are rewarded under this scheme are in respect of eps-based performance conditions for a single 
financial year and therefore does not constitute a long-term incentive scheme and accordingly shareholder approval was 
not required nor sought at the time. Other than the grants made in 2004 and 2005, no further grants have been made and 
there are no plans to do so in the future. 
None of the directors had an interest in any contract of significance in relation to the business of the Company or its 
subsidiaries at any time during the financial year. There has been no change in the directors’ shareholdings (all of which 
are beneficial) and their share options between 31 December 2007 and 22 February 2008.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Elementis plc
We have audited the Group and Company financial statements (‘the financial statements’) of Elementis plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated and Company balance 
sheets, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and the 
related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also 
audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an 
auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the Company 
financial statements and the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards 
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 28.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in 
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and whether, in addition, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements. The 
information given in the Directors’ report includes that information presented in the Chairman’s statement and Business review 
that is cross referred from the Principal activities, business review and future development section of the Directors’ report.
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and 
other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does 
not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form 
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial 
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatement or material 
inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in 
the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited.

Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Accounting policies
Elementis plc is a company incorporated in the UK. The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRS’). 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with the UK GAAP. These are 
presented on pages 71 to 74.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial 
instruments and financial instruments held for trading or available for sale are stated at their fair value. Non-current assets 
held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The accounting policies set out below 
have been consistently applied across group companies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. 
Judgements made by the directors in the application of accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial 
statements and considered to be critical accounting policies, are set out in the Business review.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries for the period. A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company 
has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity to obtain benefits from its 
activities. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during a period are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
In accordance with the transitional rules of IFRS 1, the Company has not restated business combinations that took place 
prior to the date of transition to IFRS of 1 January 2004. As a consequence the Scheme of Arrangement entered into in 
1998 whereby the Company acquired Elementis Holdings Limited and applied the true and fair override to account for 
the transaction as a merger has not been restated under IFRS.
Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, 
are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with 
associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised 
losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the post-acquisition total recognised 
gains and losses and the net assets of associates on an equity accounted basis. Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds 
its investment in an associate, the Group’s carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred a legal or constructive obligation. 
Foreign currency 
(a)  Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date 
are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are 
recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated at exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
(b)  Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on consolidation are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The 
revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rates of exchange ruling for the relevant 
period. As allowed by IAS 21, exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken to the translation reserve. They are recognised in the 
income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation. The Group hedges a portion of the translation exposure of its 
overseas net assets through US dollar and Euro borrowings. From 1 January 2005, the Group has elected to apply net 
investment hedge accounting for these transactions where possible. Where hedging is applied, the effective portion of 
the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment is recognised in equity. Any ineffective portion of the 
hedge is recognised in the income statement. 
(c)  Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading 
purposes. However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. 
  Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is 
recognised immediately in the income statement. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition 
of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. The fair value of forward exchange 
contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price. 
  Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of 
a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the 
derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.  Elementis plc

finanCial statEmEnts
  Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial statement is designated as a hedge of the variability in a fair value 
of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are 
recognised immediately in the income statement. The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in 
fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged (even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost) and any 
gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised immediately in the income statement (even if those gains would 
normally be recognised directly in reserves).
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses. Freehold land is not depreciated. Leasehold property is depreciated over the period of the lease. 
Freehold buildings, plant and machinery, vehicles, fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives on a straight line basis. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are assessed at the reporting 
date. No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until the asset is brought into use. 
Estimates of useful lives of these assets are:
Buildings 10 – 50 years
Plant and machinery 2 – 20 years
Vehicles 2 – 10 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 – 20 years
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it 
is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within it will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. 
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Leased assets Leases which result in the Group receiving substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of an 
asset are treated as finance leases. An asset held under a finance lease is recorded in the balance sheet and depreciated 
over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Future instalments net of finance charges are included 
within borrowings. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge, which is allocated to each 
period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining liability and charged to the income statement and 
reduction of the outstanding liability. Rental costs arising from operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over 
the period of the lease.
Intangible assets
(a)  Goodwill All business combinations since the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 are accounted for by applying the 
purchase method. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since the transition date, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of the consideration given and the fair value of net identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired. In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its 
deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating 
units and tested annually for impairment.
(b)  Research and development Expenditure on research is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Expenditure on development where research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or 
substantially improved products and processes is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially 
feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of 
materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads less accumulated amortisation. Other development 
expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
(c)  Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost or when arising in a business combination, estimated 
fair value, less accumulated amortisation.
(d)  Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each balance 
sheet date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives 
are as follows:
 Patents and trademarks 10 – 20 years
 Other intangible assets  1 – 5 years Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 44
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2007
1 Accounting policies continued
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling 
price, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. Cost, which is based on a weighted average, includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring stock and bringing it to its existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured 
inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads attributable to manufacture, based on 
normal operating capacity.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non interest bearing and are stated at their nominal amount which is the original 
invoiced amount less provision made for bad and doubtful receivables. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on the 
ageing of receivables and historical experience. Individual trade receivables are written off when management deem them 
no longer to be collectable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity 
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash 
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially measured at cost (which is equal to the fair value at inception), and are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Any difference between the proceeds, net of 
transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the terms of the borrowings using 
the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables Trade payables are non interest bearing borrowings and are initially measured at fair value and 
subsequently carried at amortised cost.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as 
a deduction from equity. When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, 
including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as 
treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity. 
Impairment The carrying amount of non-current assets other than deferred tax is compared to the asset’s recoverable 
amount at each balance sheet date for any indication of impairment. For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life 
and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. 
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on 
a pro rata basis. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. 
The recoverable amount is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Revenue Revenue is based on the fair value of consideration received from the sale of goods and services. It excludes sales 
between Group undertakings, VAT and similar sales based taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the 
income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. Revenue 
from services is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion at the balance sheet date.
Investment income and finance costs Investment income comprises interest income on funds invested and changes in the fair 
value of financial assets at fair value taken to the income statement. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective 
interest method. Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions, dividends on 
preference shares classified as liabilities, foreign currency losses and changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value taken 
to the income statement. All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Pension and other post-retirement benefits In respect of the Group’s defined benefit schemes, the Group’s net obligation 
in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, 
and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit 
rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Group’s obligations. Pension and post-retirement 
liabilities are calculated by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The expected increase in the present 
value of scheme liabilities and the long-term expected return on assets based on the fair value of the scheme assets at the 
start of the period, are included in the income statement under finance income. Any difference between the expected return 
on assets and that achieved is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense together with the difference 
from experience or assumption changes. The Group recognises all such actuarial gains and losses in the period in which 
they occur through the statement of recognised income and expense. The Group also operates a small number of defined 
contribution schemes and the contributions payable during the year are recognised as incurred. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 45
finanCial statEmEnts
Share based payments The fair value of equity settled share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense 
with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which 
the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using 
a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount 
recognised as an employee expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where 
forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Own shares held by Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘ESOT’) Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOT are included 
in the consolidated financial statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of shares in the Company are charged directly 
to equity.
Investments Investments comprising loans and receivables are stated at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the 
restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. In accordance with the Group’s environmental policy 
and applicable legal requirements, a provision for site restoration in respect of contaminated land is recognised when the 
land is contaminated.
Government grants Grants against capital expenditure from government and other bodies are shown as creditors in the 
balance sheet. Such grants are released to the profit and loss account over the same period for which the relevant assets 
are depreciated.
Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised 
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted 
or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: 
the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable 
profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they 
will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially 
enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future 
taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that 
it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations A non-current asset or a group of assets containing 
a non-current asset (a disposal group), is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally 
through sale rather than through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and is highly probable within one year. 
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous 
carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains 
and losses on subsequent remeasurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, has been 
abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Termination benefits Termination benefits are recognised as an expense when the Group is demonstrably committed, 
without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to terminate employment before the normal retirement 
date. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised if the Group has made an offer encouraging voluntary 
redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are 
not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2007, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial 
statements, but that become mandatory for the Group’s 2008 financial statements, are as follows:
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions 
in which some or all of the goods or services received cannot be specifically identified. IFRIC 11, requires retrospective 
application and the Group has not yet determined the potential effect of the interpretation. Elementis plc

2 Segmental information
Business segments
For management and internal reporting purposes the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions 
– Specialty Products, Surfactants and Chromium. Principal activities are as follows:
Specialty Products – production of rheological additives, compounded products and colourants.
Surfactants – production of surface active ingredients.
Chromium – production of chromium chemicals.
On 31 August 2007 the Group sold its global Pigments business, which manufactured synthetic iron oxides and complementary 
products. It has been classified as a discontinued operation, with comparatives restated accordingly. Surfactants, which operates 
from the Elementis Specialty Products site in Delden, The Netherlands, has been classified as a reportable segment in 2007 
as its revenue is more than ten per cent of total revenue and for internal purposes, it is reported separately. Comparatives have 
been restated accordingly.

The tax charge on profit before exceptional items from continuing operations represents an effective tax rate on profit 
before exceptional items for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 5.3 per cent (2006: nil). The rate is lower than the 
standard UK corporation tax due to the amortisation of goodwill in the US for tax purposes and the utilisation of UK tax 
losses. Tax on exceptional items comprised taxation of £5.9 million (2006: £nil) in respect of the disposal of Pigments 
business and £1.0 million in respect of curtailment gains on pension schemes and provision releases (2006: £1.3 million). 
As a Group involved in overseas operations, the amount of profitability in each jurisdiction, transfer pricing legislation and

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (‘CGUs’) that are 
expected to benefit from that business combination. The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products 
and Elementis Surfactants.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value 
in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and 
direct costs during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The discount rate used in 2007 was 
7.7 per cent (2006: 8.2 per cent). The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices 
and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for 
the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following seventeen years based on an estimated growth rate 
of 2.5 per cent. The rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Other intangible assets comprise a favourable supply contract which arose on acquisition of Sasol Servo BV on 30 June 2004 
and a patent. The assets are amortised over their estimated finite useful lives, which does not exceed 4 years. Elementis plc

Environmental provisions relate to manufacturing and distribution sites including certain sites no longer owned by the 
Group. These provisions have been derived using a discounted cash flow methodology and reflect the extent to which it is 
probable that expenditure will be incurred over the next 20 years. Restructuring provisions at 31 December 2007 relate to 
redundancy costs which will be paid in the first half of 2008.
Self insurance provisions at 31 December 2007 represent the aggregate of outstanding claims plus a projection of losses 
incurred but not reported. The restructuring provisions are expected to be utilised during 2008 and self insurance 
provisions are expected to be utilised within five years. Elementis plc

At 31 December 2007 the full amount of ACT previously written-off, available for offset against future UK profits, 
was £25.8 million (2006: £26.3 million). 
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable 
profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted. Where this is not the case, 
deferred tax assets have not been recognised. No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas 
subsidiaries. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the 
foreseeable future. There are no significant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries 
and associates.
During the year the taxable gain on disposal of the Pigments business was significantly reduced by available tax losses 
in the US. Following the disposal and the likelihood of taxable profits from which timing differences could be deducted, 
full provision for deferred taxation in the US business is considered appropriate. The Group has therefore recognised a 
£24.5 million liability in respect of the amortisation of goodwill in the US within tax computations. This is partially offset 
by a deferred tax asset of £22.8 million on unrelieved tax losses.

23 Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
•	 Cr edit	risk,
•	 Liquidity	risk,
•	 Mark et	risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management 
framework. The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, 
to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and 
systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities.
The Group’s Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies 
and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
The Group’s Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and 
ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet 
its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. Elementis plc 
Annual report and accounts 2007 57
finanCial statEmEnts
Trade and other receivables
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer . The demographics 
of the Group’s customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of 
an influence on credit risk. No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Group’s revenue and geographically 
there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery 
terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank 
references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without 
requiring approval from the Board. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact 
with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade 
and other receivables. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually 
significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that 
have been incurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment 
statistics for similar assets.
Investments
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have 
a credit rating of at least A1 from Standard & Poor’s and A from Moody’s. Given these high credit ratings, management 
does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its 
liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage 
to the Group’s reputation. The Group’s funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per 
cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period. At the year end the Group had £125.4 million 
(2006: £49.0 million) of undrawn committed facilities, which expire after more than one year but within four years.
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the 
Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to 
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order 
to manage market risks. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency 
other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the Euro and the US Dollar. The Group hedges 
approximately 70 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency. 
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the 
reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations 
of the Group, primarily USD, but also Euro and GBP. This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into. 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net 
exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address 
short-term imbalances. The Group’s investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by USD denominated drawdowns 
under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of subsidiaries’ net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the 
required interest profile. The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Group’s borrowings are at fixed 
rates of interest.
Other market price risk 
Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Group’s defined benefit pension 
obligations. Management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market 
expectations. The primary goal of the Group’s investment strategy is to maximise investment returns in order to meet 
partially the Group’s unfunded benefit obligations; management is assisted by external advisers in this regard.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected usage and sale requirements; 
such contracts are not settled net. Elementis plc

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, 
as well as the return on capital, which the Group defines as total shareholders’ equity, excluding minority interests, and the 
level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold shares in the Company through the Group’s savings-related share 
option schemes. At present employees hold 0.24 per cent of ordinary shares, or just under 3.14 per cent assuming that all 
outstanding share options vest or are exercised.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings 
and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. The Group’s target is to achieve a return on shareholders’ 
equity of between 10 and 15 per cent; in 2007 the return was 26.6 per cent (2006: 17.0 per cent). In comparison the weighted 
average interest expense on interest-bearing borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputed interest) was 6.2 per cent 
(2006: 6.3 per cent).

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial 
instruments reflected in the table above.
Derivatives
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not 
available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current 
forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest (based on government bonds).
Non-derivatives financial liabilities 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market 
rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the 
market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the 
reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows:
          2007 2006

25 Retirement benefit obligations
The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits 
for the majority of employees and executive directors. The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the 
defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employee’s final remuneration 
or the employee’s average remuneration during a period of years before retirement. The assets of these schemes are held 
in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet. In addition the Group 
operates an unfunded post-retirement medical benefit (‘PRMB’) scheme in the US. The entitlement to these benefits is 
usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period. 
Due to curtailment gains and past service credits of £2.0 million (2006: £3.7 million) there was a net credit in respect 
of post-retirement health care and pensions in the year of £2.1 million (2006: £2.1 million), of which £0.8 million 
(2006: £1.7 million) related to overseas schemes.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2005 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2007 for the 
US and Netherlands schemes. The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2007 for inclusion within 
this Annual Report. The trustees of the UK scheme are required to act in the best interest of the funds’ beneficiaries. 
The appointment of trustees to the UK scheme is determined by the trust scheme’s documentation. The Group has a 
policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by the UK scheme. Investigations have been carried out during 
the past three years into the mortality experience of the Group’s major schemes. The investigations concluded that the 
current mortality assumptions include sufficient allowance for improvements in mortality rates. The assumed life 
expectancy on retirement at age 65 are:

The main assumptions for the PRMB scheme are a discount rate of 6.25 per cent (2006: 5.75 per cent) per annum and 
a health care cost trend of 10.00 per cent (2006: 10.00 per cent) and 11.00 per cent (2006: 11.00 per cent) per annum for 
claims pre age 65 and post age 65 respectively reducing to 4.5 per cent per annum by 2012 (2006: 4.5 per cent). Actuarial 
valuations of retirement benefit plans in other jurisdictions have not been updated for IAS 19 purposes because of the 
costs involved and the considerably smaller scheme sizes and numbers of employees involved.

In addition to the current service cost above, £1.0 million (2006: £1.0 million) was charged to the income statement in 
respect of defined contribution schemes. Curtailment gains of £2.0 million (2006: £3.7 million) arose as a result of the 
disposal of the Pigments business and changes to the PRMB scheme, which due to their nature and size have been 
classified as exceptional items in the income statement.

26 Share based payments
The Company has several share option schemes for executive directors and employees of the Group.
The 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which senior management below Board level 
are granted options to purchase shares in the Company. The option price is the average market price over the five working 
days preceding the grant and there is no discount. Options are capable of exercise after three years and within ten years 
of the date of the grant; those granted since 1995 are subject to earnings per share performance targets.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme under which executive directors and senior managers 
below Board level are granted options to purchase shares in the Company. The option price is the market price of a share 
on the dealing day immediately preceding the day on which the option is granted with no discount applied. Options are 
capable of exercise after three years, subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets 
being met, and within ten years of the date of the grant.
The UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 1998 is a scheme under which UK employees can enter into savings 
contracts with a building society or a bank for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings 
accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options. The option price is the average market 
price over the five working days preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20 per cent. Elementis plc

The US Savings-Related Share Option Scheme is a scheme under which US employees can enter into savings contracts 
with a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company 
on the exercise of their options. The option price is the market price on the date of the grant, discounted by 15 per cent.
Options were valued using the binomial option pricing model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used 
in the calculations are as follows:
          2007 2006
Fair value per option         29.0 32.9
Weighted average share price at grant        58.0 54.9
Weighted average exercise price         56.6 53.7
Expected volatility (per cent)         38.0 43.0
Risk free rate (per cent)         5.4 5.1
Expected dividend yield (per cent)        2.7 2.6
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over the previous 
5 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects 
of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The Group recognised total expenses of 
£0.9 million (2006: £0.9 million) related to equity-settled share based payment transactions during the year.

Notes to the financial statements of Elementis plc
for the year ended 31 December 2007
32 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in 
relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under 
the historical cost accounting rules. Under section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to present its profit and loss account. As the Company’s voting rights are controlled within the Group headed 
by Elementis plc, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed 
transactions or balances with entities which form part of the group (or investees of the group qualifying as related parties).
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange 
ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments 
Investments in group undertakings are included in the balance sheet at cost, or if lower, directors’ valuation.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are 
appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these 
criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits
The Company participates in the Elementis Group defined benefit pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held 
separately from those of the Company. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities 
in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and, as required by FRS 17, it has treated the scheme as if it were a 
defined contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions 
payable for the year.
Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain 
items for taxation and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except as 
otherwise required by FRS 19. Advance corporation tax recoverable by deduction from future corporation tax is carried 
forward within deferred taxation or as ACT recoverable within debtors as appropriate.
Share based payments
The fair value of share options granted to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the options. The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold 
for vesting. 
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company
Following the adoption of FRS 25, financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that 
they meet the following two conditions:
a)  they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Company; and
b)  where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that 
includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will 
be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own 
equity instruments.
To the extent that the definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument 
so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for 
called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of interest payable and similar charges. 
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified as part of shareholders’ funds, are dealt 
with as appropriations in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds. Elementis plc

33 Profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.

The investment in unlisted loans is with Elementis Holdings Limited, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary. The provision 
for impairment was made following a directors’ valuation of the subsidiary undertaking using a discounted cash flow 
methodology. The investment in unlisted shares is in Elementis Group BV, a wholly owned subsidiary.

4  Undertakings operating in the United Kingdom are incorporated in England and Wales. In the case of corporate 
undertakings other than in the United Kingdom their country of operation is also their country of incorporation.

38 Retirement benefit obligations
The Company is a member of a multi-employer pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay. 
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable 
basis, as permitted by FRS 17 ‘Retirement benefits’, the scheme has been accounted for as if the scheme was a defined 
contribution scheme. The net deficit in the scheme at 31 December 2007 was £12.8 million (2006: £17.8 million).
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 September 2005 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes 
to 31 December 2007 by a qualified actuary. The contribution for the year was £0.2 million (2006: £0.2 million).

_1_cover.indd   1 26/10/2007   10:36:40 WHAT WE DO
Hot Tuna own the global rights to the Hot Tuna brand, a progenitor of global youth fashion, 
born in Australia with a heritage of authentic surf culture.
The Group has coordinated design, marketing and distribution competence in its core 
markets supported by a team of inspired, experienced and young designers, marketers, 
salespeople and management with apparel expertise.
DESIGN
From its very beginning in the late sixties Hot Tuna 
was always the rebellious brand that dared to be 
different, without taking itself too seriously. While 
maintaining that core spirit and bringing the brand 
to the forefront of surf-fashion today, we have put 
together a second-to-none team of experienced 
designers from Sydney, London and Los Angeles, 
who will all operate from Hot Tuna’s new creative 
platform in our corporate showroom, in downtown 
Los Angeles. They will be working alongside our 
marketing and merchandising staff to ensure global 
brand consistency and make extensive use of our 
sourcing facility in Shanghai to ensure a cost and 
time-effective design process and ultimately better 
delivery rates and profit margins.
MARKETING AND PROMOTION
The Hot Tuna brand is built on a platform of 
quality surf lifestyle products that represents real 
value in terms of experience and creative expression. 
Being blessed with promoting a brand that never 
“sold out” and still remains respected and admired 
in the surf community is not only a great asset for 
our designers, but also makes the job of our 
marketing staff much easier, as they don’t have 
to “invent” credibility by jazzing up the message.
The Hot Tuna marketing and promotional activity 
is mainly at grassroots level. We sponsor athletes 
within the surf community who represent our core 
values, surfers who are “real” and aspirational.
The most invaluable marketing for us is to see 
our surfers and the surf community endorsing our 
product on the beach.
The Hot Tuna marketing and design staff work 
in partnership with our customers making sure that 
the brand visualisation at retail is consistent and 
effective in promoting the brand and maximising sales.
SPONSORSHIP AND EVENTS
Hot Tuna sponsors major surfing events and 
competitions around the world and features 
predominantly at major industry fashion shows, 
event parties and tradeshows.
Hot Tuna also proudly takes some of the core 
values that exist on the water into its association 
with charities and non-profit organisations that are 
trying to make the life on land a bit better for the 
ones who need it the most.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Directors of Hot Tuna (International) PLC have pleasure in presenting 
the Company and Group’s results for the year ended 30 June 2007. 
Over the last twelve months, we have made significant progress in re-establishing 
Hot Tuna as a leading global surf and youth lifestyle brand. Despite challenging 
market conditions and a particularly poor summer in 2007 resulting in sales 
for the period being lower than expectations, we are encouraged nonetheless 
by the fact that retail sales of surf and related products have climbed by over 
15% in the last two years and that this sector still remains one of the fastest growing 
sectors within the apparel industry. Surfing, today, is no longer seen as a ‘rebel’ 
pastime but another healthy fun sport and lifestyle that everyone can enjoy. 
We believe that our strategy to position Hot Tuna as a global surf and youth 
life style brand will benefit from this sector growth.
During the past twelve months, there have been many affirmations of 
the Company’s growing strength and presence in the industry including 
the addition of fashion entrepreneur and brand management leader, 
Elle Macpherson, to the Company’s Board of Directors. Also on 1 June 2007, 
we were privileged to be able to appoint Niels Juul as Chief Executive Officer. 
Niels joins us from the world renowned Von Dutch apparel business where 
he was Managing Director and within three months of joining the Company 
implemented clear leadership and direction that we believe will take Hot Tuna 
to the next level in our quest to rank shoulder-to-shoulder with the biggest names 
in surf fashion and youth lifestyle.
FUNDRAISING
As a result of the successful fundraising in December 2006, the Company 
has been able to expedite the strategic plan to improve the distribution and 
manufacturing process. The capital raising exercise generated £4.2m (before 
expenses) via a placing of 28,024,994 new ordinary shares of nominal value 
htfrontLR.indd   2 26/10/2007   10:41:44 03
Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
£0.01p each, at £0.15p per share. These shares were issued together 
with warrants, in the ratio of one warrant for every two placing shares. 
In March 2007, the Group also agreed a maximum £2.5m equity-based credit 
facility with Cornell Capital Partners LLP. Cornell Capital Partners LLP also 
subscribed to convertible loan notes worth US$450,000. 
RESULTS SUMMARY
The Group operating loss for the year of £3.7m included employee costs of £1.5m 
(2006: £0.7m), production and manufacturing costs of £0.5m (2006: £0.1m) 
and marketing costs of £0.6m (2006: £0.1m). The high cash expenditure 
reflects the Group’s commitment to commissioning the right management 
and personnel to drive the Group into the next phase of its strategy. 
Hot Tuna has incurred approximately £2m of non-cash expenses up to 
30 June 2007, including £0.2m bad debt and inventory write-offs and £1.7m 
of exceptional share-based payment charges incurred in accordance with IFRS 2 
requirements and £0.1m outside equity interests were absorbed in recognition 
of the fact that these amounts would not be re-couped in the future. The 
share-based payments, which have been charged as an “exceptional item”, 
were incurred in order to appoint key personnel to the Hot Tuna team during 
the year. This charge does not affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends 
going forward nor does it affect the net assets of the Group. It is strictly 
a charge to reserves in accordance with current accounting standards. 
As at the 30 June 2007, the Group had cash reserves of £1.9m (2006: £1.5m) 
and a net current asset position of £2.2m (2006: £1.5m).
COLLEAGUES AND PARTNERS
On behalf of the Board I wish to thank my fellow Directors, our employees 
and our partners for their energy and commitment and to extend our sincere 
thanks to all of them for their hard work and dedication. We look forward to 
driving the business forward and taking the business of surf to new heights 
through the merits of Hot Tuna.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW
It gives me great pleasure to give my first Chief Executive’s review since 
joining the Company on 1 June 2007. 
During 2007, the Group has made significant strides and secured the delivery 
of its products into important independent retailers in all of its core markets. 
STRATEGIC REVIEW
Since I have taken on my new role, the Board and I have been focusing 
on driving sales growth as well as creating efficiencies that will ultimately 
generate cost savings and improved margins for the Group. Hot Tuna have 
planned the global launch of their product for Spring/Summer 2008 and 
up until this season the operations have not been cohesive and as a result 
of many inefficiencies the margins generated and the operating result has 
not been favourable.
The first improvement in our process recommended during my global strategic 
review was a reduction in the number of manufacturing partners (from fourteen 
to three). This will enable quicker delivery times and added reliability through 
stronger relationships. Most importantly we will be in a much stronger position 
SHEA LOPEZ
Shea has enjoyed a successful career on the World 
Championship Tour (WCT), and remains one of the most successful 
athletes still competing in the water (and way above it!).
NIELS JUUL, CEO – with 
members of Homeboyz, a US 
charity that reforms hard-core 
gang members into working 
citizens, through special 
training and job-placements. 
Hot Tuna is a proud corporate 
sponsor of Homeboyz and 
recently organised a major 
event in California with its 
team riders, teaching ex-gang 
members how to surf.
Niels Juul is the one with 
the glasses.

Australia and now resides in Ballina on the East

tour, and studied one year of bachelor of ﬁne

to negotiate better prices and therefore secure better margins. Additionally, 
we are in the process of establishing our own sourcing office in Shanghai. 
From here we will co-ordinate our production, quality control and global 
logistics, leading to substantial improvements in delivery rates and making 
sure that Hot Tuna is not only a strong brand but also a credible and efficient 
supplier for our distributors and main retail partners.
Secondly, our team will be moving to a new showroom in the Cooper Building 
in downtown Los Angeles, where Hot Tuna will feature alongside many other 
reputable fashion and sportswear leaders. The new showroom will give us 
instant access to fashion buyers whilst serving as our design, marketing and 
branding headquarters. Furthermore, all aspects of the design process will be 
overseen by myself from this central location whereas previously our designers 
were based across our three regional offices. These changes will reduce the 
overall design time by six to eight weeks, which is significant not only in terms 
of reducing the cost of the process, but it will also allow the Company to 
secure more orders by offering a quicker time to market. 
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
UNITED STATES
The US’s launch plan was to establish an initial account base of ‘A’ grade 
independent surf retailers. The Company succeeded in securing orders from Jacks’ 
Surfboards, (voted Retailer of the Year 2006 by the Surf Industry Manufacturers 
Association (SIMA)). Jacks’ Surfboards are based in four locations in California, 
namely Huntingdon Beach, Newport Beach, Corona del Mar and Dana Point. 
Orders were also received from key accounts and trendsetting retailers in 
New York, Miami, Dallas, San Francisco and other major cities across the 
USA. Additionally, the Company has fulfilled orders from Diane Beachwear, 
a leading swimwear retailer with fourteen stores in southern California and 
the Cocoa Beach Surf Company (based in Florida). Cocoa Beach houses 
the largest surf complex in the world and is the location of Hot Tuna’s first 
concept store launched in Spring 2006. 
UNITED KINGDOM
The appetite for the brand within the UK is strong and this is illustrated by 
orders received from some of the most respected independents, including: 
Fluid, Two Seasons, Cult Clothing, Shore Watersports, Free Spirit, Extreme Pie, 
Shred Head and Surfdome.
Free Spirit is currently the largest and most prominent group on the high street 
for surf lifestyle and stocks all the main surf lifestyle brands. Free Spirit has 
38 stores nationwide. Extreme Pie is the online and mail order retail division 
of the Extreme Group and is now one of Europe’s largest online board action 
sports stores. The Extreme Group possesses a large customer base with 
the Extreme channel broadcasting non-stop through satellite.
In addition to the above, we have secured orders from Otto, the mail order and 
online sales group, who own titles such as Freemans and Grattan. Otto have 
established a new mail-order catalogue and online business called “Oli”, which 
will feature Hot Tuna men’s apparel and women’s swimwear going forward. 
Early sell through results have been very positive, with the Hot Tuna ranking 
in the top 20 selling mens’ brands.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
AUSTRALIA
In Australia, Hot Tuna has re-launched into the key independents including, 
amongst others, Glue, Surf Vision and Beach Street, however, our greatest 
achievement has been to secure orders from both Myer and David Jones, 
on a national level.
Myer is Australia’s largest department store with 60 stores nationwide. Myer 
placed orders for the Hot Tuna boys clothing range (8–16 years) and delivery 
of these products commenced during July 2007 to all Myer stores. Myer are 
also implementing 15 Hot Tuna concept stores into their retail premises which 
will be used to market and sell Hot Tuna accessories (backpacks, caps, wallets 
and sunglasses). The first sell through reports have been very encouraging, 
illustrating sell through of approximately 20% weekly, which is very impressive 
by industry standards.
DISTRIBUTION
Hot Tuna is continuing to pursue strong partnerships with distributors globally 
and will continue to foster new and lucrative relationships as the year goes on. 
Presently, we have distributors in Spain, Portugal and the Canary Islands, and 
most recently in the Middle East. In addition to selling apparel through established 
retail outlets, we have also reached an agreement with Sourcerite, our Middle 
Eastern distribution partner, to open a dedicated Hot Tuna store in Dubai by 
autumn 2008, which will significantly raise the brand’s profile in this region. 
MARKETING AND PROMOTION
On the marketing front we have successfully re-launched our new website 
and established an online sales store in the USA, which is expected to be 
rolled out globally. Hot Tuna has also been receiving a lot of encouraging 
fashion press from the recent trade shows and promotional activities, including 
most recently, the Mercedes Benz fashion show and the Home Boy Industries 
Charity Day in California. 
Hot Tuna has also recently signed a sponsorship agreement with another 
famous Australian brand, Carlton Cold, which is owned by Foster’s Brewing 
Group. Carlton Cold is aimed at adventure lifestyle-seekers, male and female 
18–35 year-olds, as is Hot Tuna’s surf apparel. Carlton Cold will support Hot 
Tuna’s surf team through a number of branding initiatives, and similarly Hot 
Tuna will support promotions run by Carlton Cold with Hot Tuna merchandise. 
The alignment of the two brands will raise awareness of the Hot Tuna brand 
and also facilitate Carlton Cold’s launch of their brand in the UK. This support 
marketing gives Hot Tuna access to new platforms and is intended to further 
drive the Group’s penetration of the trendy young adult market.
Hot Tuna also continues to support the sport of surfing through sponsoring 
athletes, events and grass roots surfing and surf schools. In August 2006, 
Hot Tuna signed former World No. 11 and X-Games Champion surfer Shea 
Lopez to its roster as lead team rider. Under the Hot Tuna banner, Lopez shot 
to the top of the 2007 Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP) ratings and

as of the date of press, he was the No. 2 surfer on the ASP World Qualifying 
Series (WQS) tour. In the United Kingdom, BPSA champion Micah Lester and 
British Professional Surfing Association (BPSA) – ranked No. 7 Toby Atkins were 
retained by Hot Tuna, ensuring a steady stream of national media play at the core 
of their sport, and top-flight representation at the highest levels of European 
and Australian competition. 
In March, the whole Hot Tuna surf team converged on Hot Tuna’s birthplace in 
support of the Company’s crown-jewel event of the year, the ASP 4-star-rated 
Hot Tuna Central Coast Pro Surfing Championship, held at Soldiers Beach, NSW, 
Australia. More recently, Hot Tuna was the sponsor of the prestigious BPSA 
Tour, held at Widemouth Bay, Cornwall. 
From sponsorship of world-class talent and championships, to support of local 
and regional athletes and events, Hot Tuna retains its global stature as a surfer’s 
surfing brand true to the sport and spirit of authentic surf culture. 
MOVING FORWARD
The year ahead looks very exciting and it has begun in a very positive manner. 
Subsequent to our recent brand “makeover” Hot Tuna has gained some high 
profile publicity and fashion trend spotting authorities have recently recognised 
Hot Tuna as one of the top ten swim brands to watch for 2008 (WGSN August 
DNR magazine). We have also strengthened the talent within our team, with 
the likes of Anna Kenney, one of the leading swimwear designers in the USA 
(former Ocean Pacific and Ralph Lauren) who brings tremendous experience 
and creativity to the team.

The Directors submit their report and the financial statements of Hot Tuna (International) PLC and its subsidiary undertakings (“the Group”) for the year ended 
30 June 2007.
Hot Tuna (International) PLC is a public company incorporated in England and Wales, and quoted on the AIM Market.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES
The principal activity of the Group during the year was that of design, production and sale of our branded surf and youth lifestyle apparel to specified regions 
of the world.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Directors consider the following to be key risks involved in running the day to day business of Hot Tuna (International) PLC and its subsidiaries:
u protection of intellectual property across the globe and new registrations in emerging markets;
u loss of key executives and members of the staff would affect product offering and have an adverse impact on operations;
u changes to import and export restrictions across the world;
u obsolescence of inventory, could cause lower than expected margins and large expenditure write offs to the profit and loss;
u general economic climate and consumer sentiment;
u fluctuations in foreign currencies could harm the results of our operations;
u generation of consistent and profitable financial margins; and
u liquidity of the market for trading in our shares.
The Directors address these risks by:
u implementation of internal control policies and global policies and procedures;
u hire of experienced counsel and advisors to provide guidance and advice;
u having an active involvement in day to day operational activities;
u hiring experienced personnel with industry experience;
u offering competitive and rewarding remuneration packages to executives; and
u regular board meetings to address general and industry specific risks and concerns.
BUSINESS REVIEW AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
The Group trading loss for the year, after taxation and minority interests, was £5.3m.

u gross profit margins;
u net profit margins;
u number of sales doors (customers) in each region;

u number of distributors globally;
u brand exposure and recognition; and

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
backLR.indd   3 26/10/2007   10:39:06 The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles underlying the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors is accountable to shareholders for the good corporate governance of the Group. The principles of corporate governance and a code 
of best practice are set out in the Combined Code. The Revised Combined Code applies to reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003. 
Under the rules of AIM market the Group is not required to comply in full with the Code nor to state where it derogates from it. The Board considers that 
the size and nature of the Group does not warrant compliance with all the Code’s requirements. This statement sets out how the principles of the Code 
are applied to Hot Tuna (International) PLC.
BOARD STRUCTURE
The Executive Chairman of the Company is Ranjit Murugason. He is heavily involved in the day to day running of the Group. In total, the Board comprises 
an Executive Chairman, two further Executive Directors and one Non Executive Director. Kiran Morzaria is an independent, Non Executive Director. 
It is considered that this gives the necessary mix of industry specific and broad business experience necessary for the effective governance of the Group. 
There are no matters specifically reserved to the Board for its decision, although board meetings are held on a regular basis and effectively no decision 
of any consequence is made other than by the Directors. All Directors participate in the key areas of decision-making, including the appointment 
of new Directors.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. A statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect of the accounts 
is set out on page 17. The Non Executive Director has a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are fully considered. 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information. 
There is no agreed formal procedure for the Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense. 
All Directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting at regular intervals. There are no specific terms of appointment for the 
Non Executive Director.
The following committees, which have written terms of reference, deal with specific aspects of the Group’s affairs.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee comprises of Kiran Morzaria (Chairman of the committee), Niels Anders Juul and Ranjit Murugason. Meetings are also generally 
attended by the Company Secretary, Angeline Hicks and the external auditors.
The remit of the Committee is to review:
u the appointment and performance of the external auditors;
u the independence of the auditors;
u remuneration for both audit and non-audit work and nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors;
u the interim or final financial report and accounts;
u the external auditors management letter and management’s responses;
u the systems of risk management and internal controls;
u operating, financial and accounting policies and practices; and
u and to make related recommendations to the Board.
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee comprises Kiran Morzaria (Chairman of the committee), Niels Anders Juul and Ranjit Murugason and is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of Executive remuneration and its cost. The Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration 
and other benefits for each of the Executive Directors. The Board itself determines the remuneration of the Non Executive Director. The report on Directors’ 
remuneration is set out on pages 15 and 16.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
There is no separate Nomination Committee at the moment due to the size of the Board. All Directors are subject to re-election at regular intervals.
INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and monitoring the Company’s systems of internal control. Although no system of internal control 
can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Company’s systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance 
that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.
The Group maintains a comprehensive process of financial reporting. The annual budget is reviewed and approved before being formally adopted. Other key 
procedures that have been established and which are designed to provide effective control are as follows:
u management structure – where the Board meets regularly to discuss all issues affecting the Company; and
u investment appraisal – the Company has a clearly defined framework for investment appraisal and approval is required by the Board where appropriate.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and considers the major business risks and the control environment. 
No significant control deficiencies have come to light during the period and no weakness in internal financial control have resulted in any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties which would require disclosure as recommended by the guidance for Directors on reporting on internal financial control.
The Board considers that in light of the control environment described above, there is no current requirement for a separate internal audit function.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Chairman is the Company’s principal spokesperson with investors, fund managers, the press and other interested parties. At the Annual General Meeting, 
private investors are given the opportunity to question the Board.
This year’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 19 November 2007. 
GOING CONCERN
The Directors confirm that they are satisfied that the Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable future. 
This has been determined by the review of the three year forecasts for the Group in light of the current business model and economic environment. 
The Group has access to sufficient debt finance to ensure that all amounts due are paid as and when they fall due.
For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
backLR.indd   5 26/10/2007   10:39:21 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the committee during 2007 were Ranjit Murugason, Kiran Morzaria, James Podaridis and Niels Anders Juul. Details of the remuneration 
of each Director are set out below.
No Director plays any part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of high calibre, who are needed to drive and maintain 
the Group’s position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to the shareholder.
REMUNERATION POLICY
SHARE OPTIONS
The Executive Directors have options granted to them under the terms of the Hot Tuna (International) PLC Share Option Scheme which is open to other

16 OCTOBER 2007
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
backLR.indd   7 26/10/2007   10:39:24 The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
UK Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and have elected to prepare 
the company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU.
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and performance of the Group; 
the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving 
a true and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The Company financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. 
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
c. state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the EU; and
d.  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are also responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Hot Tuna (International) PLC website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements on pages 20 to 46.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS AND AUDITORS
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union are set out in the statement of Directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and whether the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The information 
given in the Directors’ report includes that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement and Chief Executive Officer’s review that is cross referenced 
from the business review section of the Directors’ report. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have 
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other information 
comprises only the, Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive Officer’s review, the corporate governance statement and the Directors’ remuneration report. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes 
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant 
estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s and Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient 
evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

CONSOLIDATED AND COMPANY CASH FLOW STATEMENT 
for the year ended 30 June 2007
backLR.indd   15 26/10/2007   10:39:25 (A) GENERAL INFORMATION
Hot Tuna (International) PLC is a company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985. The address of the registered office 
is given on page 9. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 13 and in the Chairman’s statement on page 2 and 3.
These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates. 
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note (F).
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements 
were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures; and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures
IFRS 8 Operating Segments
IAS 23  Borrowing Costs (Amended)
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives
IFRIC 10 Interim financial Reporting and Impairment
IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Shares Transactions
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements (not yet endorsed by the EU)
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes
IFRIC 14  The limit of a defined benefit asset. Minimum funding requirement and their interaction
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements 
of the Group when the relevant standards and interpretations come into effect.
(B) BASIS OF PREPARATION
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS.
The financial statements are presented on the historical cost basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the 
EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed 
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that 
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period 
or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. 
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
(C) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries controlled by the Company made up to 30 June 2007. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition 
or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other 
members of the Group.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
backLR.indd   16 26/10/2007   10:39:25 26
Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
(C) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION CONTINUED
All intra-group transactions, balances, and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses 
are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, 
at the date of the exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the 
acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that 
meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after re-assessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately 
in the profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities recognised. 
(D) INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND ASSOCIATES
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment in the parent company’s balance sheet. Investments are eliminated on consolidation. 
There are no associates, nor joint ventures in the Group.
Inter-company loans are stated initially at fair value, then subsequently at amortised cost. Inter-company loans are eliminated on consolidation.
(E) LEASING
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
(F) FOREIGN CURRENCIES
The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of its primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in 
Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. 
Transactions in currencies other than Pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet 
date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences on non-monetary 
assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income 
and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for each month in the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity 
and transferred to the Group’s foreign exchange reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the 
operation is disposed of.
(G) TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit/(loss) differs from net profit/(loss) reported in the income statement because 
it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities 
are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be 
available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets or liabilities in a transaction that affects 
neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
backLR.indd   17 26/10/2007   10:39:25 (G) TAXATION CONTINUED
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient 
taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged 
or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
(H) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (see accounting policy (J)).
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Lease payments are 
accounted for as described in accounting policy (E).
Depreciation is provided on all other property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value evenly over 
its expected useful life as follows:
Buildings and improvements 3–5 years straight line
Fixtures and fittings 3–5 years straight line
Office equipment 3–5 years straight line
(I) INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is tested annually for impairment 
(see accounting policy (J)).
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
The value of the Hot Tuna brand and associated licences have not been amortised as they are considered to have an indefinite life. This assumption is based 
on the growing apparel market industry, our financial forecasts and the brand recognition globally.
(J) IMPAIRMENT
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such 
indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated 
at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
(K) INVENTORIES
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Inventory is accounted for on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis. Net realisable value is the 
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
(L) SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 to share option schemes allowing certain employees within the Group to acquire shares of the Company. 
For all grants of share options, the fair value as at the date of grant is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, taking into account the terms 
and conditions upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that 
are likely to vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market-based conditions not achieving the threshold for vesting. The expense is recognised over 
the expected life of the option.
(M) PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits 
that can be reliably estimated.

Hot Tuna (International) PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007
(N) TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment. 
(O) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
(P) REVENUE
Revenue results from amounts received and receivable for goods provided (excluding value added tax) and royalty income receivable on the existing 
licence agreements.
Revenue is recognised when goods are delivered to the customer.
Royalty income is recorded when it becomes receivable in accordance with the individual contractual agreements.
(Q) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash together with various items such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables etc, 
that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide working capital.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group has become a party to the contractual provisions 
of the instrument.
FINANCIAL LIABILITY AND EQUITY
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any 
contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
BANK BORROWINGS
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption, are accounted for on an accrual basis and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled 
in the period in which they arise.
TRADE PAYABLES
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES
Convertible loan notes are interest bearing and are recorded at fair value.
EQUITY INSTRUMENTS
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
(R) CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has to make judgements on how to apply the Group’s accounting policies and make estimates 
about the future. The critical judgements that have been made in arriving at the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements and the key sources 
of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are 
discussed below:
u Acquisitions
When acquiring a business, we have to make judgements and best estimates about the fair value allocation of the purchase price. We seek to appropriate 
competent and professional advice before making any such allocations. We test the valuation of goodwill on an annual basis and whenever events of changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These tests require the use of estimates.
u Impairment reviews
The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policies stated above. The recoverable amounts 
of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates.

9. LOSS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
      Year ended  Period ended 
      30 June 2007 30 June 2006 
Earnings      £ £
Earnings for the purposes of basic earnings per share net loss for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent  (5,333,160) (1,975,718)
Number of shares       
Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share     65,230,931 32,471,760
The denominator for the purpose of calculating the basic earnings per share has been adjusted to reflect all capital raisings. Due to the loss incurred in the period, 
there is no dilution effect resulting from the issue of share options, warrants and shares to be issued.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED
for the year ended 30 June 2007
backLR.indd   23 26/10/2007   10:39:26 10. GOODWILL CONTINUED
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units in each segment are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for this value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks to the 
business segments. The rate used to discount the Group’s forecast cash flows is 11%. 
The Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the management team for the next three years and extrapolates these 
cash flows, using expected business growth rates. The long-term growth rate used is 6%, which does not exceed long-term average growth rates in the industry. 
The growth rates, which are typically high in a start-up operation, reflect the Group’s current position on the product life cycle. Presently entering the growth 
stage we have forecast significant growth in employee marketing and promotional expenses in the first three years of operation, whilst we build our market 
base. Likewise, sales growth is rapid in the first three years until we reach product maturity at which point sales will continue to grow at a steady rate, whilst 
margins become more favourable.

Trade creditors principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.
19. CONVERTIBLE LOAN NOTES
The convertible loan notes were issued on 2 March 2007. The loan notes are to be repaid in full within 540 days of closing and shall bear interest whilst 
outstanding at a rate of 7% per annum (payable monthly).
The Company has agreed to repay the loan notes in cash by instalments of US$30,000 on prescribed dates at thirty-five day intervals throughout the loan 
term. In the event that the Company does not make any such cash repayment in accordance with the terms of the subscription letter for the loan notes then 
it shall be treated as having issued an “Advance Notice” under the facility and repayment of the relevant amount of the loan notes shall take place by setting 
off the subscription monies on the relevant Advance against the Company’s obligation to repay the loan notes.
The issuer has the option at any time during the loan term of converting part or the whole of the outstanding loan notes into ordinary shares. However, the 
Company has the option upon the issuer exercising its conversion rights of paying cash in lieu of such ordinary shares. The conversion price is 130% of the 
average volume weighted price in the 20 days prior to exercise of the option.

The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price defined by the individual option agreement. 
The vesting period varies according to the individual employment contract (between zero and five years). If the options remain unexercised during the 
specified period from the date of grant, the options expire. Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
As of 30 June 2007 a total of 18,010,000 subscription rights had been issued to employees. Of these options, 5,240,000 were exercisable as at 30 June 2007, 
and the weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at the period end is three years.
During the financial year, some of the employee share options were recalibrated to reflect current market conditions, resulting in the cancellation of the old 
options and re-issuance of new options at different strike prices.
Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below. Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Company’s 
share price over period under review. Expected dividends were based on the Company’s payments to shareholders over the two years prior to the grant or 
award date.
Under the schemes, the weighted average estimated fair value per option granted by the Company during 2007 was 0.05p (2006: 0.05p). The fair value 
of the share options granted under the plans during 2007 was £1.7m (2006: £0.1m). The value of the awards is charged in the income statement over the 
vesting period.
The inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows:
Weighted average share price £0.12
Expected volatility 40–56%
Expected life Stated above
Risk free rate 4.25–5.50%
Expected dividends Zero

The following litigation is currently underway within the Group. The financial impact at the conclusion of each of the litigation has been estimated, where known.
HOT TUNA (INTERNATIONAL) PLC AND HOT TUNA INTERNATIONAL INC V CANADA – 1575156 ONTARIO, INC.
Hot Tuna International Inc and its parent corporation Hot Tuna (International) PLC, were served in March 2007 with a complaint made by a numbered 
Ontario company, 1575156 Ontario, Inc. The complaint alleges breach of a trade-mark license agreement. 
A Statement of Defence was filed, in which it denied all allegations and any liability on the ground that it was never a party to the License Agreement and, 
therefore, not a proper party to the proceeding. Hot Tuna (International) PLC has filed its Statement of Defence and Counter Claim in which it defended 
against the plaintiff’s claim and counterclaimed for, inter alia, damages in the amount of approximately $USD2,500,000 for breach of the licence agreement, 
fraudulent misrepresentation and deceit.
It is too early in the proceeding to be able to comment on the likelihood of success or exposure and no provision has been made in the accounts for the 
settlement of this matter.

NOTICE OF MEETING CONTINUED
backLR.indd   39 26/10/2007   10:39:28 WHAT WE DO
Hot Tuna own the global rights to the Hot Tuna brand, a progenitor of global youth fashion, 
born in Australia with a heritage of authentic surf culture.
The Group has coordinated design, marketing and distribution competence in its core 
markets supported by a team of inspired, experienced and young designers, marketers, 
salespeople and management with apparel expertise.
DESIGN
From its very beginning in the late sixties Hot Tuna 
was always the rebellious brand that dared to be 
different, without taking itself too seriously. While 
maintaining that core spirit and bringing the brand 
to the forefront of surf-fashion today, we have put 
together a second-to-none team of experienced 
designers from Sydney, London and Los Angeles, 
who will all operate from Hot Tuna’s new creative 
platform in our corporate showroom, in downtown 
Los Angeles. They will be working alongside our 
marketing and merchandising staff to ensure global 
brand consistency and make extensive use of our 
sourcing facility in Shanghai to ensure a cost and 
time-effective design process and ultimately better 
delivery rates and profit margins.
MARKETING AND PROMOTION
The Hot Tuna brand is built on a platform of 
quality surf lifestyle products that represents real 
value in terms of experience and creative expression. 
Being blessed with promoting a brand that never 
“sold out” and still remains respected and admired 
in the surf community is not only a great asset for 
our designers, but also makes the job of our 
marketing staff much easier, as they don’t have 
to “invent” credibility by jazzing up the message.
The Hot Tuna marketing and promotional activity 
is mainly at grassroots level. We sponsor athletes 
within the surf community who represent our core 
values, surfers who are “real” and aspirational.
The most invaluable marketing for us is to see 
our surfers and the surf community endorsing our 
product on the beach.
The Hot Tuna marketing and design staff work 
in partnership with our customers making sure that 
the brand visualisation at retail is consistent and 
effective in promoting the brand and maximising sales.
SPONSORSHIP AND EVENTS
Hot Tuna sponsors major surfing events and 
competitions around the world and features 
predominantly at major industry fashion shows, 
event parties and tradeshows.
Hot Tuna also proudly takes some of the core 
values that exist on the water into its association 
with charities and non-profit organisations that are 
trying to make the life on land a bit better for the 
ones who need it the most.

WHERE WE DO IT
Hot Tuna maintains its financial and executive headquarters in the United Kingdom; a design, 
production and marketing control centre in the USA; and a cultural hub in Australia.
UNITED KINGDOM
The Company’s administrative and economic base 
is in London, close to the financial market the 
Company serves, and proximal to Hot Tuna’s Board 
of Directors and advisors. Local sales teams 
service the established surfing centres and 
fashion communities of Great Britain and the 
greater European surf-lifestyle market, and 
contribute globally to the aesthetic of the brand.
UNITED STATES 
Global design, production and marketing is directed 
from downtown Los Angeles, in the Cooper Building. 
All of the US accounts are serviced from here and as 
the home base of the Chief Executive Officer, it is 
the source of new inspiration and direction for the 
brand and the Company.
AUSTRALIA
The ‘Land Down Under’ continues as a source of 
inspiration for Hot Tuna. The Company’s operations 
in Australia ensure the values of the brand are 
evidenced worldwide, and that key market points 
throughout the nation and across the South Pacific 
are effectively serviced.

WHO WE ARE
Hot Tuna is one of the world’s most distinct names in surf lifestyle, originally founded 
in Australia in 1969 as a surf apparel company. 
Hot Tuna came into prominence in the global youth fashion market through the 80’s 
and 90’s and still today the brand maintains an internationally recognisable cult status. 
Hot Tuna as a brand went dormant in the 1990’s and only began trading again in 2006. 
Our first product launch coincided with Spring/Summer 2007.
Hot Tuna (International) PLC listed on the AIM in 2005, raising funds with which to 
finance the acquisition of trademark licensing rights worldwide and to fund its future 
growth and development as a global brand manager. 
Hot Tuna own the rights to their intellectual property globally and have established 
operational business units in Sydney, Australia; London, England and Los Angeles, 
California. Penetration of peripheral markets is via the appointment of distributors.

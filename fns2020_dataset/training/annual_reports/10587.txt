2 Morse plc Annual Report 2009 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
This has been a year of significant change for Morse and this has been undertaken against a backdrop of unprecedented 
economic turmoil. At the beginning of the financial year the Board concluded that the structure of the Group needed to 
be simplified, to allow the individual business units to concentrate on their core competencies and to improve the levels of 
profitability and operational management in the business. Morse’s continuing operations are four independent business units 
each reporting to the Chief Executive Officer:
l   Infrastructure Services & Technology – UK;
l   Infrastructure Services & Technology – Spain;
l   Infrastructure Services & Technology – Ireland; and
l   Business Applications Services.
Each business unit prioritises activity in the markets in which it has specialist knowledge and capabilities. Cooperation 
between business units is encouraged where it adds value to the client engagement and to the business unit’s profitability.
The Group’s discontinued operations comprise Investment Management Consulting. During the year the largest part of this 
business unit was sold and since the year end we have announced the disposal of the remaining parts to management.
In July 2008 the Group commenced a significant restructuring process which has helped streamline the business operations 
and align the cost base with the anticipated revenues. The benefit of this restructuring in each of the business units was 
demonstrated in the fourth quarter, traditionally the Group’s strongest financial quarter, resulting in operating profit before 
exceptional items for the full year of £8.3 million (2008: £8.7 million). Once the impact of trading balance releases is removed 
the Adjusted EBIT was £4.2 million (2008: £4.5 million).
A key focus during the year was the improvement of the cash position of the Group. At the end of the year the cash balance 
was £12.7 million (2008: £11.1 million) and after taking account of Customer Specific Financing the net cash balance was 
£12.0 million (2008: £11.1 million). Compared to the low point during the year at 30 September 2008, when the Group had 
debt of £4.9 million and after taking account of Customer Specific Financing net debt of £8.9 million, the year end position is 
a creditable performance.
As highlighted at the Interim Results, the Company is currently not in a position to declare dividends due to a lack of 
distributable reserves. The Board has reviewed the available options to allow dividends to be declared in future and has 
concluded that a Court Approved Capital Reduction scheme should be pursued. This process will first need to be approved 
by shareholders and the appropriate information and resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting 
on 22 October 2009. If approved by shareholders, then it is anticipated that Court approval will be obtained by the end of 
November and will enable the Company to declare dividends out of future profits. The Board will then adopt an appropriate 
dividend policy.
The Group is now in an improved financial position and has achieved a creditable financial performance in difficult market 
conditions. The Board would like to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and commitment.
The Board anticipates that the changes that have been made to Morse’s operating model and focus, together with its 
ongoing strong client relationships, position the Group to deliver improved underlying profitability and cash generation in 
future.

Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
This has been a difficult year for Morse and one of considerable change. The restructuring of the business that has been 
undertaken was necessary in order to align the cost base of the business with the anticipated revenues. The result is that the 
underlying quality of the earnings in the business has improved when compared to the year ended 30 June 2008.
We exited the year with business units refocused to deliver improved cash generative profitability. Each of the business units 
now has a clearly defined set of propositions to offer to existing and future customers and is focused on delivering those 
propositions.
Trading performance for the business units, prior to exceptional items, for the year ended 30 June 2009 is shown below:

The business unit revenues are derived from Resale (of third party hardware & software product and maintenance), 
Maintenance and Support (where the business units have ongoing obligations and includes sale of Morse’s Wisdom software 
application), and Services. Gross Profit margins on revenues from continuing operations in the year ended 30 June 2009 
were 20.8% (2008: 22.1%). Gross Profit margins in the second half of the year were slightly better than the first half of 
the year with the decline from 2008 being driven largely by the impact of the global economic slowdown and change in 
customer mix.
As the management team is focused on delivering cash generative operating profit, a key performance indicator is Adjusted 
EBITDA. In the year ended 30 June 2009 Group Adjusted EBITDA was £7.6 million (2008: £7.8 million).
The Group is committed to improving the operational efficiency of the business and has undertaken a restructuring 
programme during the year intended to reduce the overheads of the Group without impacting upon sales and delivery 
capability. The total cost of restructuring in the current financial year was £9.6 million of which £8.6 million was incurred 
on continuing operations. As a result of this restructuring, and the disposal of the UK and Jersey Investment Management 
Consulting (“IMC”) business, formerly known as CSTIM, the total number of Group employees reduced from 1,420 at 30 
June 2008 to 1,010 at 30 June 2009 of which 973 were employed in the continuing operations (2008: 1,304). 
The Adjusted EBIT of £4.2 million (2008: £4.5 million) reflects the strong performance of the Group in the final quarter of the 
year as, after the first nine months of the year, the Adjusted EBIT was only £0.6 million (2008: £1.9 million). Infrastructure 
Services & Technology represented 81% of reported revenues from continuing operations (2008: 80%) and the delivery of 
these revenues is weighted towards the end of each calendar quarter. This is in line with the revenue profile for the product 
partners for those business units. Traditionally, our second and fourth financial quarters have a stronger financial performance  4 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
than our first and third financial quarters. This was reflected in the current year with Adjusted Losses Before Interest and 
Tax being incurred in the first and third quarters, whilst in the second and fourth quarters continuing operations delivered 
Adjusted EBIT. As we progress in the new financial year a key performance indicator will be the trailing 12 month financial 
performance which will provide an indication of the improvement in operating performance of the business.

Operational and financial review
Infrastructure Services & Technology – UK
This is the largest business unit in the Group and generated revenues of £114.2 million (2008: £131.4 million) and an 
operating profit before exceptional items of £7.2 million (2008: £6.4 million). This improved operating margin percentage of 
6.3% (2008: 4.9%) was achieved despite the impact of the bad debt provision of £0.5 million arising from Lehman Brothers 
filing for Chapter 11 on 15 September 2008 and the £1.0 million of losses recognised on the South Tyneside and Gateshead 
(“STaG”) Building Schools for the Future (“BSF”) project. The second half of the year saw an improved operating margin on 
revenues that were marginally down on the first half of the year.
 Infrastructure Services & Technology UK consists of three main lines of business:
l   Technology – helping our clients with the sourcing, management and support of their IT estates utilising a Technology 
Lifecycle Management approach;
l   Infrastructure Services – supporting our clients with technology transformation, project implementation and operations & 
resourcing services that help them optimise their data centres; and
l    providing the ICT expertise, technology and infrastructure services for STaG BSF. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 5 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
The Technology business had revenues of £78.3 million (2008: £87.8 million) with the second half of the year maintained 
at the same level as the first half. We have maintained our existing customer relationships whilst applying additional focus 
towards new customer acquisition and the development of higher value propositions. We will continue to develop our 
operational processes and level of proposition focus during the current financial year.
The Infrastructure Services business had revenues of £34.2 million (2008: £41.1 million) reflecting the impact of a number 
of major programmes of work that came to completion in the second half of the year ended 30 June 2008, together with 
a tighter market for discretionary services spend and the impact of Lehmans. Revenues in the second half of the year 
ended 30 June 2009 were in line with the first half of that year. The operating structure of the services business is being re-
evaluated to ensure continued flexibility and business agility. We are further enhancing our technology transformation skills 
and higher-end data centre capabilities aimed at helping our clients simplify and optimise their environments.
The STaG BSF project is all that remains from the Morse in Education business. Revenues in the year were £1.7 million 
(2008: £2.5 million). At the end of the first half of the year the Board concluded that the significant time period over which 
the STaG BSF contract will be implemented and the difficulty of winning further projects was not the best use of Morse’s 
resources. Consequently in January 2009 the management and sales team of Morse in Education was made redundant and 
the STaG BSF project is now being managed as a stand alone project. Following a review of the progress on the contract in 
the third quarter of the financial year, operating profit of £0.5 million that had been taken in the year ended 30 June 2008 was 
reversed. This contributed to the loss recognised on the contract during this year of £1.0 million. Good progress has been 
made on the contract since then and contract documentation has been signed for the next schools in the programme.
In Infrastructure Services & Technology we continue to have excellent ongoing partnerships with our key technology vendors 
– HP , IBM and Sun as well as relationships with key software providers such as Symantec and Oracle.
Our focus for the business unit includes:
l    maintaining our Technology business based on the value of our Technology Lifecycle Management approach;
l   continuing to improve our systems and service delivery processes to offer a cost effective but superior level of client 
engagement; and
l   developing and delivering data centre optimisation, operations and resourcing services to provide our clients with the IT 
simplification and project-based return on investment they require.
The market for infrastructure services and technology will remain very focused on business critical IT projects where a high 
degree of flexibility and shorter-term success, demonstrated by Return on Investment payback, are essential. We believe that 
our structural and cost changes over the year enables us to be well positioned to support this requirement for our existing 
customers as well as extending our customer and service reach in the future.
Infrastructure Services & Technology Europe (Spain and Ireland)
For Spain and Ireland, in the year ended 30 June 2009, revenue was £57.4 million (2008: £57.8 million) with an operating 
profit before exceptional items of £0.2 million (2008: £2.9 million). The operating profit before exceptional items for the full 
year reverses the losses that were suffered in the first nine months of the year. This improvement in financial performance is 
predominantly due to improved performance in Spain following the restructuring programme undertaken in January 2009. 
The reported results benefited from the strengthening of the Euro against Sterling and under constant currency, revenues 
declined by 14.5%.
Both our Spanish and Irish businesses have been hit hard by the weakness in their respective economies.
In Spain, following the difficult year ended 30 June 2008 action was taken to reduce costs in July 2008. During the first 
half of the current financial year the business maintained revenues but suffered margin decline due to a change in mix of 
customers. Consequently, a further review of the structure of the business was undertaken in January 2009 and as a result 
the overhead cost base was reduced significantly. As part of this restructuring the business re-engaged with its key vendor 
partner, IBM, and the benefits of this relationship are starting to be seen.
It is expected that the economic environment in Spain will remain challenging in the current calendar year, but with a leaner 
overhead base and a clearer go-to-market approach the business is well positioned to take advantage of any economic 
upturn. 6 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
In Ireland, Morse is a leading IT Infrastructure Services and Technology company and holds the highest level of accreditation 
with all of the major infrastructure and software vendors, together with executive level relationships in many of Ireland’s blue 
chip companies. It continues to build a reputation as the technology partner of choice and is consolidating this position by 
working with its key vendors in providing coordinated propositions to the market.
In the year to 30 June 2009 the business has suffered from the economic difficulties in Ireland and experienced 
significant revenue decline. This made the business loss-making in the first quarter of the year. However, swift action by 
the management team to restructure the business led to the business being marginally profitable for the full year. The 
management team remains committed to delivering the optimal result in difficult times, such as these.
Business Applications Services
Business Applications Services is organised around three separate businesses:
l   Diagonal – SAP implementation and support services;
l   Portals and Collaboration (including Wisdom); and
l   Xayce – Business Change and Transformation Consultancy.
Diagonal operates in three main territories: the UK, Asia Pacific and the USA whilst the other businesses are UK based.
A number of new key proposition areas have been identified and the business will be simplified to focus the business 
development and sales activities on our Microsoft, SAP and business change & transformation capabilities in the UK, USA 
and Asia Pacific.
Stronger governance processes and procedures for both sales and delivery management have been implemented across 
the business, resulting in stronger sales qualification and improved project delivery. A new resourcing framework has been 
implemented allowing better deployment and management of our skills and resources, providing improved utilisation.
In the year ended 30 June 2009 revenue was £40.3 million (2008: £46.1 million). Operating profit before exceptional items 
was £2.4 million (2008: £0.3 million). Revenues in the six months ended 30 June 2009 were lower than the six months to 31 
December 2008 but generated a higher operating margin. This trend is anticipated to continue in the current financial year. 
Diagonal – SAP implementation and support services
Revenue for the year ended 30 June 2009 was £28.4 million (2008: £34.4 million). This line of business has suffered 
historically from problems with a number of fixed price projects, allied to poor planning and execution, which have 
significantly impacted the profit performance of the business. In the year ended June 2008 a provision of £0.7 million was 
made for these problem projects and a bad debt provision of £0.3 million was also made. During the period to December 
2008 one of these problem projects was resolved and the bad debt provision was utilised. In the second half of the year a 
second problem contract was resolved satisfactorily and outstanding amounts due on the third problem contract are fully 
provided.
The issue on fixed price projects has led to a more robust project management process and an increased focus on contract 
profitability reviews.
SAP integration with Sky Mobility and Blackberry enabled solid growth in the USA in the first half of the year, but proved 
more difficult in the second half of the year. In Asia Pacific a new client implementation was followed by an ongoing support 
contract.
Diagonal has developed strong propositions targeting the Construction and Facilities Management Industries, in addition to 
strong experience in the Chemicals and Manufacturing Industries, and the ability to deliver application support using both 
onshore and offshore consultants is also proving to be of significant value to clients.
Portals and Collaboration
The Portals and Collaboration business is focused on a set of core propositions: information portals and information 
collaboration solutions based upon Microsoft and Vignette technology platforms, electronic Document and Records 
Management (eDRM) solutions based upon our own software product, Wisdom, and the associated services and annuity 
based support revenue that is an integral part of such propositions. This business had revenues of £8.8 million in the period 
(2008: £8.8 million).  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 7 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Xayce – Business Change and Transformation Consultancy
Xayce specialises in the Financial Services and Local Government markets and clients include leading banks, insurance 
companies and several large local authorities. Xayce contributed £3.1 million in revenue in the year to 30 June 2009 (2008: 
£2.9 million from date of acquisition in September 2007).
Disposal of Investment Management Consulting 
On 9 February 2009, the Company announced the exchange of contracts on the disposal of the business and assets of the 
UK and Jersey IMC business, formerly known as CSTIM, to Navigant Consulting (Europe) Limited (“Navigant Consulting”).
In the year to 30 June 2008 the CSTIM business generated an operating profit of £1.6 million on revenue of £9.3 million. 
The business has reduced in size considerably since then. In the six months ended 31 December 2008 revenues were £3.2 
million and there was a small operating loss of £44,000. 
The initial consideration was £1.3 million which was paid in cash at completion. The financial performance of the business 
in the year to 30 June 2009 meant that no deferred consideration was payable. The gross assets transferred were £13,000 
and the book value of net liabilities transferred was £0.42 million. Morse retained and was responsible for the collection of 
the outstanding trade receivables all of which were collected. The proceeds of the sale were used for general corporate 
purposes.
CSTIM formed the largest part of Morse’s IMC business unit. Small IMC operations in South Africa and Luxembourg have 
been closed down and a flexible resourcing business in the UK called SkillsHub has been sold to management for a nominal 
sum. The remaining parts of the IMC business held at the year end were operated through majority owned subsidiary 
undertakings in France and Australia. On 4 September Morse announced the sale of its stake in the Australian business 
to management. The sale proceeds were A$ 50,000 and an intercompany loan and interest of A$ 280,000 was repaid to 
Morse. Terms have been agreed with the management of the French subsidiary to sell Morse’s stake to them for E150,000. 
This is a related party transaction which requires shareholder approval and a circular will be sent to shareholders in due 
course. Consequently, the entire IMC business unit is considered to be discontinued for Financial Reporting purposes.
As a result of the sale, disposals and closure there is impairment to goodwill and intangibles on Morse’s consolidated 
balance sheet, relating to the IMC business unit, of £13.7 million.
Risks and Risk Management
Following the changes in Board membership over the past year, risk management processes have been re-assessed to 
ensure a framework of prudent and effective controls is in place to assess effectively and manage risk within the Group. The 
business units in the Group have primary responsibility for managing risk on a day-to-day basis and regular reporting to the 
Board of risk registers and material contracts is now in place. All identified risks are quantified, prioritised and appropriate 
mitigations developed for each. For the UK businesses we have established a separate management board (Morse 
Executive Board) and risk is a standing item on the agenda for its meetings. Risk management of the Spanish and Irish 
businesses is reviewed at the monthly performance reviews for those businesses. The Board regularly reviews the cost and 
benefits of the risk and control activity undertaken and comprehensive business insurances are maintained. The principal 
risks and uncertainties associated with the Group’s activities are discussed below.
Strategic risks
The continuation of the current recession may further reduce demand for the Group’s services and therefore reduce revenue 
and profits. Significant restructuring and cost reductions have been carried out during the year and while this action should 
benefit future profits, further reductions in revenue may offset the cost reductions already achieved.
Certain parts of the Group’s businesses rely on a small number of strategic customers for a significant part of their revenue 
and profits. The businesses seek to increase the number of customers to reduce this reliance, however the loss of a 
strategic customer would impact the profitability of the business in the short term.
Key partner relationships are required in order to undertake the sale of their products and services. The loss of a key partner 
relationship would lead to a loss of revenue and profit. The business units seek to maintain and improve their partner 
relationships in order to mitigate this risk. 8 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
The credit crisis has led to reduced availability of funding as well as tighter credit terms and this may lead to future reductions 
in credit available to run the Group’s operations. The Group is not currently using its committed banking facilities of £7.5 
million and has increased focus on cash management in the last year to reduce the impact of this risk.
Increased competition in an already crowded market place may have a negative impact on the Group’s position, whilst 
efforts to improve the Group’s delivery and range of services will help to mitigate this risk.
Operational risks
The Group’s revenue and profit projections depend heavily upon the delivery of large contracts to customers. In the 
past, issues with delivery have led to significant project overruns and unbudgeted costs which have reduced the Group’s 
profitability. During the year, management and internal processes have been strengthened in this area in order to minimise 
this risk for the future.
The management of the Group’s businesses and the delivery of its contracts rely heavily on staff and loss of key staff is a 
significant risk to the businesses. Remuneration and people management processes are in place to minimise attrition and 
the Group’s rate of attrition is within industry averages.
Seasonality of the Group’s revenue and profits does not change much from year-to-year, but profits tend to be weighted 
towards the end of each six month period and there is a greater weighting towards the second half of the financial year due 
to customer buying patterns.
The Group’s businesses are exposed to the risk to business continuity posed by a pandemic, including the current influenza 
virus, terrorist incident or other external event. During the year our office in Madrid was damaged due to a terrorist bomb, 
although it was not the target. Whilst such events are outside of the Group’s control, measures are taken to mitigate these 
risks wherever possible. The Group has a detailed Business Continuity Plan which was reviewed during the year to cover a 
wide range of risks such as IT systems failure and possible pandemics.
Financial risks
In the current recession, increased credit risk remains a potential issue and during the year Lehman Brothers, a significant 
customer, suffered financial failure. The Group’s increased focus on cash management in the year has helped to improve 
collection times from customers and this focus will continue.
The main external factors affecting financial measures are discussed above and to these can be added changes in 
assumptions underlying the carrying value of certain Group assets. These assumptions are discussed in note 13 and include 
discount rates, long-term growth rates and timing and quantum of future expenditure, the revision of any of which could lead 
to an impairment in the carrying value of certain assets in the Group which would reduce profits and distributable reserves.

of Morse plc as at 30 June 2008 was £16 million. This was part of total Fixed Asset Investments of £125 million held on the 
balance sheet of Morse plc at that date.
At the time of the Interim Results the Board made a write down of £13.8 million in Morse plc’s company balance sheet in 
respect of this investment. As a consequence of this write down Morse plc had negative distributable reserves and was 
unable to declare an interim dividend. In light of this and the current economic environment, the Board has undertaken a 
review of the remaining Fixed Asset Investments and the recoverability of inter company receivables owed to Morse plc. The 
impact of this review is to reduce the net book value of Fixed Assets Investments to £71.7 million and results in negative 
distributable reserves on the Morse plc Company balance sheet of £47.9 million and net assets of £38.0 million.
The Board has reviewed the available options for the Company in order to enable dividends to be declared out of future 
profits. The Board has concluded that, subject to shareholders’ approval, a Court Approved Capital Reduction process 
should be undertaken in order to use part of the share premium account, standing at £70.8 million at 30 June 2009, to 
extinguish the negative distributable reserves. The Board believes that this is in the best interests of shareholders. Details 
of the Capital Reduction process will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting scheduled for 22 October 2009  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 9 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
together with the resolutions to be proposed to shareholders. If shareholders approve the resolution then it is anticipated that 
the Court process will be completed in November 2009 and that the first dividend that could be declared out of future profits 
would be a final dividend for the year ending 30 June 2010. 
Consequently, no final dividend will be paid for the last financial year (2008: 1.30p per share) giving a total dividend for the 
year of nil p per Ordinary share (2008: 2.6p per share).
Cash and Banking Facilities
Morse has historically operated a policy of seeking to maximise the reported cash balance at financial reporting period ends. 
To ensure an appropriate (high) level of focus on cash and a more conservative view on what is used to manage and report 
on the business, the new Executive Management team publishes a chart showing the weekly balances as shown on bank 
statements for the period from 1 July 2006. This chart is published again today and is available at www.morse.com.
Since 30 September 2008 the relationship between cash on the balance sheet and cash per bank statements has reverted 
to a more normal position where the bank position shows a higher cash balance than the balance sheet position. Net cash/
debt position is reduced further by the Customer Specific Funding arrangements entered into by the Group.
The principal banking facilities of the Group are with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc. These facilities consist of a committed 
multi currency Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”) and a multi-currency overdraft facility. The RCF has covenants that relate to:
l   Gearing (Gross Borrowings to shareholder funds);
l   Interest cover (PBIT to Borrowing costs); and
l   Leverage (Gross Borrowings to EBITDA).
We have now extended the period of the committed RCF from 28 March 2010 to 31 March 2011 and based on the 
improved cash position within the Group and internal cash flow projections we have reduced the RCF to £6.5 million and the 
overdraft to £1 million. The Board believes that these facilities are sufficient for the Group requirements for the foreseeable 
future.
Deferred consideration
Xayce was acquired in September 2007 and had an earnout period to 30 June 2008 which was successfully completed. 
As a result, deferred consideration of £2.5 million was payable to be settled by the issue of new ordinary shares at an issue 
price of 95.45 pence. 711,236 shares were issued in July 2008 which settled £678,875 of deferred consideration. Morse 
and the vendors have negotiated settlement of the remaining deferred consideration at a value £1.25 million which will now 
be settled in cash over the period to 31 July 2011.
Trading balance releases
Trading balances are a normal part of our business and have built up significantly over a period of time. These relate to 
unallocated cash payments from customers; credit notes issued and not claimed; supplier credit balances that may not be 
enforced and goods received not yet invoiced. The nature of the uncertainty surrounding them is that while they represent 
present obligations, it is uncertain whether the counterparties will enforce settlement. However, the changing shape of the 
business, particularly the reduced volume and level of infrastructure business (a reduction of approximately £300 million per 
annum since its peak in 2002), means that trading balances are no longer being created at the same level as they are being 
released.
Trading balances are reviewed on a regular basis. If not used in the ordinary course of trade, consistent with established 
operating policies, they are released in line with our accounting policy when a liability is judged to no longer exist.
Given the lower volumes and improved controls and processes implemented over the last three years, the level of short term 
trading balances is reducing.
At 30 June 2008 there were £10.2 million trading balance credits on the balance sheet. During the year £4.1 million 
of trading balances were released to the income statement in line with the policy, £1.7 million of the liability was either 
crystallised or settled with £4.4 million remaining on the balance sheet at 30 June 2009. Reductions in the trading balance 
credits are driven by a number of factors and it is difficult to predict with certainty the levels of releases that will flow through 
the income statement in the years ahead. However, we currently anticipate that trading balance releases will continue at  10 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
the following approximate levels in the years ending 30 June 2010: £0.9 million; 2011: £0.8 million; and 2012: £1.2 million, 
with any increase in these levels being driven by action by the Company. The actual amounts will be disclosed in our future 
financial statements.
Exceptional items
During the year there was a net exceptional charge before tax on continuing operations of £8.16 million (2008: £13.40 
million). This total is analysed in more detail in note 3. The major items considered to be exceptional and included in this 
category are noted below:
Year ended 30 June 2009: Restructuring costs, Dilapidation provision and exceptional credits
Restructuring costs accounted for £8.64 million of the costs with dilapidation provisions adding a further £0.70 million. 
Offsetting these costs were exceptional credits of £1.18 million consisting of £0.62 million relating to the forfeiture of share 
based payments and £0.56 million of reversal of fair value adjustments.
Year ended 30 June 2008: Goodwill and Intangibles impairment
Following the decline in profitability within the Business Applications Services business unit and annual impairment review, 
a goodwill impairment charge of £12.26 million and intangibles impairment charge of £1.14 million were recognised in the 
2008 accounts.
Interest
Net interest expense during the year was £0.5 million (2008: £0.4 million). Details of these costs are provided in note 8 to the 
accounts.
Taxation
For continuing operations there was a tax credit for the year of £1.7 million (2008: tax charge of £1.3 million) consisting of a 
current tax charge of £1.5 million (2008: £2.5 million) offset by adjustments to prior year tax provisions of £2.4 million (2008: 
£0.5 million) and deferred tax of £0.8 million (2008: £0.6 million).
During the year a number of open HMRC enquiries on UK corporation tax years dating back to the year ending 30 June 
2005 were settled and the provisions for tax were adjusted in line with the agreed position. Further details appear in note 9.
Earnings/Loss per share
Basic loss per share including discontinued operations declined from 3.7p last year to a loss of 9.3p in the year ended 30 
June 2009. Details can be found in note 4.
On continuing operations, Adjusted basic earnings per share (before trading balance releases and exceptional items and with 
a normalised tax charge) were 2.0p (2008: 2.2p).
Cash flow
Cash in the Group at the year end amounted to £12.7 million compared to £11.1 million last year. The principal outflows 
during the year were dividend payments of £1.7 million and tax payments of £3.7 million. At the year end Customer Specific 
Financing of £0.7 million (2008: £nil) reduced the net cash number to £12.0 million (2008: £11.1 million). Of the total cash 
balance £0.6 million is held in assets held for resale as part of the discontinued operations.
Cash generated from operations for the year ended 30 June 2009 was £6.8 million (2008: £7.3 million), all of which was 
generated from continuing operations (2008: £3.6 million). This represented 89% of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing 
operations (2008: 47%). Morse plc Annual Report 2009 11 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

Outlook
The Board would like to thank all the Group’s employees for their continued hard work and commitment throughout the 
period under review. It has been a difficult time for the business compounded by the downturn in the economic environment. 
We have and will continue to experience significant change, but we believe that we will emerge a much stronger organisation 
with clear opportunities ahead.
We have completed the execution of the revised business strategy for the Morse business and implemented the changes to 
simplify the structure and focus on the four business units Infrastructure Services & Technology in the UK, Spain and Ireland 
and Business Applications Services. Significant cost reductions have been achieved. In addition, we have started to establish 
a niche focus in each of these businesses.
The improvement in Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis will be the key performance indicator 
of the improved financial performance of the business in the coming year. Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA in the current 
financial year are ahead of the same period last year.
While we expect the market for IT services and technology to remain difficult we believe that the changes to Morse’s 
operating model, together with its ongoing strong client relationships, have delivered improved underlying profitability and 
cash generation in the year to 30 June 2009 and can continue to do so in future.

During the year Morse operated a Save As You Earn sharesave scheme that was open to all UK employees.
Corporate social responsibility
We acknowledge that Morse has an influence on a number of stakeholders including our shareholders, clients, employees, 
suppliers, the community and the environment. Our high ethical standards extend to everything we do; including meeting all 
relevant legislative requirements on environmental issues and minimising the environmental impact of Morse’s operations.
Values
Morse is a client driven organisation. Our values underpin the behaviours required for success and ensure that we conduct 
our business to the highest standards. We:
l work in partnership;
l are refreshing;
l act with integrity;
l are specialists; and
l are passionate about our work.
Charity work
Throughout the year Morse has continued to support a range of charitable activities, including Cancer Research UK, Make a 
Wish Foundation, and The Children’s Liver Disease Foundation. 
During the year the Group made various charitable contributions totalling £4,784 (2008: £9,414). 
Morse made a final contribution to the ‘girl-child’ in Afrika project which we have supported since 2005. Founded by St. 
Cyprian’s School in Cape Town to help to break the cycle of poverty and lack of education that is the plight of many in South 
Africa, it provides financial assistance to girls who would otherwise not be able to afford the quality of education offered by 
the school. 
We also support the charitable activities of our staff, clients and partners; participating in a range of events. 
Give As You Earn (GAYE)
We recognise that many Morse employees wish to donate to charitable causes. In the UK the company operates a GAYE 
scheme, enabling staff to donate to a charity of their choice via regular deductions from their salary. 
Environmental awareness
We acknowledge Morse’s environmental responsibility and are committed to operating the business in an environmentally 
sensitive manner. We have a Morse Group Environmental Policy which was reviewed during the year. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 15 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Recycling

Asset recycling
Morse operates an asset retirement programme internally and offers this as a service to its clients. It donates surplus 
computers to charitable organisations.
Reducing the carbon footprint
We aim to reduce Morse’s carbon footprint wherever possible. We also advise our clients on methods to limit their carbon 
emissions. Recommended techniques include reducing power consumption, improving equipment utilisation, managing 
datacentres efficiently and changing employee behaviours.
The Group has chosen not to set environmental key performance indicators (KPIs) due to its relative size but this is under 
review. Morse’s Environmental Policy is proactive in limiting its impact and includes internal infrastructure which is purchased 
in compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances directive and disposed of in compliance with the Waste 
Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive. 
Supporting students
In order to build strong links between the Group, schools and colleges as well as the local and regional economic 
communities in which we operate, Morse offers work experience and placements to students. Wherever possible Morse 
work placements are positive, challenging and relevant to participants’ current studies and their future job prospects. During 
the year Morse offered internships to students from the ESCP European School of Management, London.
Health and Safety
Morse recognises the importance of health and safety to all stakeholders in the Company. During the year it carried out 
a review of the Morse Health and Safety Policy and Procedure Manual, and the Terms of Reference for the Morse Health 
and Safety Board which was conducted by a specialist external facilitator. Health and safety has positive benefits to the 
organization, therefore, our commitment to a high level of safety makes good business sense.
As part of our health and safety compliance we ensure allocation of appropriate levels of resources to health and safety 
issues and activities within the organisation, and work to encourage a positive culture within this context. Our overall 
approach to health and safety is soundly based on the identification and control of risks.
By reviewing our Health and Safety Policy and Procedure Manual annually we are able to track any changes in legislation 
or in our own operations and act accordingly. We have in place effective procedures for communication and consultation 
between all levels of staff on matters of health, safety and welfare.

Combined Code on Corporate Governance Compliance Statement
The Board is committed to creating and delivering sustainable shareholder value and believes that good corporate 
governance is essential. The following statement sets out how the Company complies with the provisions of The Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance June 2008 (the Code). A copy of the Code is publicly available at www.frc.org. The Board 
confirms that save as set out in this report it has complied with Section 1 of the Code during the year.
The Board of Directors
Board composition
On 30 June 2009 the Board consisted of two Executive Directors, being Kevin Loosemore (Executive Chairman) and Mike 
Phillips (Chief Executive Officer), and two independent Non-Executive Directors, being Richard Atkins and Paul Shelton. At 
all times during the year under review no less than half of the Board, excluding the Chairman, comprised independent Non-
Executive Directors and, in line with the specific guidance for smaller companies (i.e. those below the FTSE 350 throughout 
the year immediately prior to the year under review), the Company had at least two independent Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board. The Company continues to comply with both of these best practice recommendations.
All Non-Executive Directors are considered by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code, even though they 
are permitted to hold directorships with other companies. 
Since 14 February 2008 the Board has been chaired by Kevin Loosemore. For the period 8 July 2008 to 30 June 2009 (the 
‘‘Period’’) Kevin Loosemore was appointed Executive Chairman. This appointment was in response to a strategic review of 
the business which concluded that revisions to the Group structure were necessary and that Kevin Loosemore’s unique skill 
set was best placed to drive through the changes required. Following a successful execution of this strategic change, Kevin 
Loosemore reverted to the role of Non-Executive Chairman on 1 July 2009.
On appointment, Kevin Loosemore was considered to be independent. The Company considers that he remained 
independent until becoming Executive Chairman when the scope of his role expanded to include the executive 
responsibilities of running the Company. However, since his tenure as Executive Chairman was intended to be for a 
short defined period (no more than two years was originally anticipated) and, indeed, was less than a year in practice, 
the Company continues to consider him to be an independent Non-Executive Director for the purposes of Committee 
membership as defined in the Code. Furthermore, the Board’s assessment of his character is that he continues to 
demonstrate independence of thought and judgment. 
The current Board structure, from 1 July 2009, comprises a Non-Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and two 
independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Details of current Directors, including membership of Board Committees, is set out on page 22 and their biographies are set 
out on page 12.
The balance between Executive and Non-Executive Directors continues to be the subject of on-going review by the 
Nominations Committee and the Board. The appointment of new Directors to the Board follows a formal, rigorous and 
transparent appointment procedure including using independent external recruitment consultants.
Richard Atkins and Guy Millward were appointed to the Board on 17 December 2008 and 1 July 2009 respectively. 
Shareholders have the opportunity to meet with all the Directors at the Annual General Meeting.
Board changes during the year
As set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 2, the year under review has seen significant change at Morse. The 
successful implementation of a simplified Group structure that took place during the year has demanded increased 
operational effectiveness and this has been achieved through greater accountability being demanded of our senior team at 
the same time as making a number of changes to its personnel. Concurrently, to ensure that the Board has an appropriate 
balance and skills to deliver effective leadership of our revised Group structure, significant changes have also been made to 
the membership of the Board. In determining the appropriate Board structure for future years and relevant personnel, the 
need to establish a keener framework of effective controls and risk management was also a key factor.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 19 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
The changes made to the Board during the year under review were as follows:
l Kevin Alcock stepped down from the post of Chief Executive Officer on 7 July 2008;
l Kevin Loosemore was appointed Executive Chairman on 8 July 2008;
l Duncan McIntyre retired as Executive Deputy Chairman on 8 August 2008; 
l Eric Dodd resigned from the post of Group Finance Director on 9 September 2008 with Mike Phillips then appointed 
Group Finance Director on the same day;
l on 28 October 2008 Nigel Whitehead retired from the Board; 
l Derrick Nicholson retired from the Board on 17 December 2008 with Richard Atkins then appointed on the same day; 
l on 11 February 2009 Mike Phillips was appointed Chief Executive Officer when he ceased to be Group Finance Director; 
and
l The Hon. Michael Benson retired from the Board on 11 February 2009. 
Since the end of the year under review, on 1 July 2009, Kevin Loosemore was re-appointed to the position of Non-Executive 
Chairman and Guy Millward has been appointed Group Finance Director.
Division of responsibility
As set out above, the appointment of Kevin Loosemore from Non-Executive Chairman to Executive Chairman on 8 July 2008 
took place as a result of a strategic review of the Company’s operations that was undertaken during 2008. 
The Board was aware that the revised Board structure did not meet the Code’s recommendation that the roles of Chief 
Executive Officer and Chairman should be separated. However, given the factors detailed above and following discussions 
with some of the Company’s major shareholders, the Board decided that it was in the best interests of the Company to 
revise its structure until the Board’s revised strategy has been successfully implemented. The Board kept its structure under 
review with the intention being to return to a best practice structure as soon as reasonably practicable. Following successful 
implementation of the simplified business structure as set out in the Chairman’s Statement, and the disposal of the UK 
and Jersey IMC business, the Board promoted Mike Phillips from Group Finance Director to Chief Executive Officer on 11 
February 2009. Both the Board and Nominations Committee considered him to be the best placed candidate to take over 
executive responsibilities for running the Company. Independent external recruitment consultants were retained to consider 
potential candidates for the role. The period from 11 February 2009 to 30 June 2009 then marked a phased transition of full 
executive responsibilities to Mike Phillips with Kevin Loosemore re-appointed to Non-Executive Chairman from 1 July 2009. 
On the same day, Guy Millward was appointed to the Board as Group Finance Director which completed the transition to a 
market consistent Board structure. 
In recognition of the fact that the creation of the role of Executive Chairman, without a Chief Executive Officer reporting 
to it, is uncommon and has potential risks associated with a concentration of power vested in one individual, the Board 
strengthened the role of Senior Independent Director during the Period. The enhanced role of Senior Independent Director 
was put in place to operate until such time as the Board reverted to a Non-Executive Chairman and was intended to ensure 
that a sound control environment remained in place and shareholders’ interests were protected. 
In terms of the specific responsibilities that operated from 8 July 2008, these are summarised below:
Executive Chairman
l Chairmanship and management of the business of the Board; 
l leading the Board in developing and executing the strategy of the business and ensuring this is effectively implemented 
by the management team; 
l taking responsibility for day to day operations and managing the management team*;
l mentoring senior management and implementing the simplified Group structure*;
l developing relationships with key stakeholders*;
l working with the Senior Independent Director to ensure there is effective dialogue with investors in relation to Group 
strategy and plans; and
l working with the Nomination Committee to ensure the revised Board structure and its personnel have relevant 
experience, skills and facilitate a sound framework of effective controls and risk management. 20 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Note: the responsibilities marked with * were transitioned to the Chief Executive Officer following his appointment to the role 
on 11 February 2009. 
Senior Independent Director
l Chairmanship of the Nomination Committee;
l ensuring the Board includes a strong presence of Non-Executive Directors;
l ensuring that the Non-Executive Directors met regularly (at least twice per annum) without the Executive Chairman 
present;
l responsibility for sign-off of the Board agenda following discussions with the Non-Executive Directors (as appropriate) 
with the agenda normally being proposed by the Executive Chairman;
l joint approval of Board minutes in conjunction with the Executive Chairman;
l working with the Executive Chairman in conducting the annual appraisal process and, additionally, retaining responsibility 
for appraising the Executive Chairman’s performance; and
l reporting to shareholders in a newly created Senior Independent Director’s report in the Annual Report.
The additional responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director formed part of a revised formal job description and the 
Senior Independent Director remained available to shareholders to discuss any relevant matters regarding the management 
of the Company at any time. 
During the year under review, the position of Senior Independent Director was held by Derrick Nicholson from 1 July 2008 
until 17 December 2008, The Hon. Michael Benson from 17 December 2008 to 11 February 2009 and Richard Atkins from 
11 February 2009. 
The report of the Senior Independent Director for the year under review is set out on page 25. The Board believes these 
changes, allied to a strong presence of Non-Executive Directors on the Board, resulted in sufficient checks and balances 
operating during the Period whilst the role of Executive Chairman was in place. 
During the Period, the Board was satisfied that Kevin Loosemore’s other commitments did not prevent him from devoting 
sufficient time to the role. 
The Board reviewed and approved a statement on the division of responsibility as between the Non-Executive Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director which came into force on 1 July 2009. The Non-Executive 
Chairman’s main responsibility going forward is to lead and manage the Board ensuring its effectiveness. The Chief Executive 
Officer is responsible for recommending strategy to the Board, making and implementing operational decisions and leading 
the executive management. The Senior Independent Director is available to major shareholders who request a meeting or 
who have concerns which normal channels have failed to resolve. 
Board’s Role and Procedures
The Board provides leadership for the Company and focuses on operational and strategic matters ensuring that there is a 
sound basis for the Company to fulfill its objectives. The Board takes decisions in the best interests of the Company in good 
faith which would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders as a whole, having 
regard to the other stakeholders. 
The Board regularly reviews its responsibilities and accountability. The Board is accountable for the performance and 
affairs of the Company. It is responsible for the adoption of strategic plans, monitoring of operational performance and 
management, and ensuring effective risk management strategies and compliance with legislation. It meets its objectives 
by reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, approving key policies and objectives, understanding key risks and ensuring 
operating processes are in place to mitigate them. 
There is a Schedule of Matters Reserved for the Board which was reviewed by the Board during the year. It is available to 
all staff on the Morse intranet. In reserving certain matters for its review and approval, including an effective overall strategy, 
prudent financial strategy and planning, strategic aims, risk management and human resources, the Board ensures that the 
Company can meet its objectives. During the year the Board approved the Morse Operational Governance Manual which 
sets out the levels of responsibility and accountability throughout the Company, including a delegation structure from the  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 21 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Board to the Chief Executive Officer to the management team. It is available to all staff on the Morse intranet. In fulfilling its 
responsibilities the Board is supported by the executive management who implement the plans and strategies approved by 
the Board. The Board monitors management’s progress on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least six times during a year and holds other meetings as necessary. All Directors have access to the 
Group Company Secretary and General Counsel (Company Secretary). The Chairman is responsible for leading the Board 
and ensuring its effectiveness. The Chairman ensures that business is conducted in an atmosphere of openness with 
the Non-Executive Directors robustly challenging executive management. All Directors receive accurate and appropriate 
information in a timely manner in advance of Board meetings to enable it to discharge its duties. There is a good information 
flow to and within the entire Board and its Committees, and between the Board and the executive management. Business 
unit Managing Directors frequently attend Board meetings and present the performance of their business unit.
The quality and supply of information is reviewed as part of the Board Performance Evaluation exercise and refined as 
appropriate. If there are occasions when Directors are unable to attend Board and Committee meetings questions relating 
to the matters for discussion can be raised in their absence via the Chairman (or, for the Period, the Senior Independent 
Director was available to raise questions if this was felt more appropriate). A copy of the relevant papers and agenda is 
provided in advance of the meeting. The Board is duly updated and made aware of any governance matters. Directors, 
especially Non-Executive Directors, have access to independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where they 
judge it necessary to discharge their duties.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. She is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed, and all governance matters. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is the 
responsibility of the Board. 
The Chairman facilitates the contribution of the Non-Executive Directors and effective relations between them and the 
Executive Directors. During the Period the Senior Independent Director had an enhanced role in this regard. 
The Company has Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance cover in place covering all directors and officers.
All new Non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified terms. Directors are required to retire at least every three 
years. Directors appointed to the Board are required to seek election at the first Annual General Meeting following their 
appointment. Any re-election of a Non-Executive Director, which would take them over a six-year appointment, is subject to 
rigorous review taking into account the need for progression of the Board. 
All new appointed Directors have a formal induction process which includes meetings with senior management.
The Company has a policy of ensuring that any Non-Executive Director who holds office in excess of nine years will be 
subject to annual re-election. 
The Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ notice periods is that they are set at six months or less. However, in relation 
to the recent executive contracts of Kevin Loosemore, Mike Phillips and Guy Millward, these were all structured with an initial 
Company notice period of 12 months, reverting to six months (one month in the case of Kevin Loosemore as Executive 
Chairman) over a period of time. Full details are set out on pages 31-32 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. 
During the year the Board carried out a formal Performance Evaluation of the Board, its Committees and its members. The 
results of the evaluation were reviewed by the Board. An action plan was agreed which will be implemented this year. The 
Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, were responsible for the performance evaluation of the 
Executive Chairman having sought the views of the other Directors.  22 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

The Committees of the Board
The following Committees have been established to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities.
Audit Committee
During the year the Committee met on four occasions to fulfill its duties. A record of individual attendance is listed in the table 
above. The Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Group Finance Director and external auditors were invited to attend 
these meetings. 
This Committee is responsible for overseeing the involvement of the Group’s auditors in the planning and review of the 
Group’s financial statements and any other formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance, for 
recommending the appointment and fees of its auditors, and for discussing with the auditors the findings of the audit and 
issues arising from the audit. The Committee considers the independence and objectivity of the auditors with regard to the 
way in which it conducts its audit duties. It reviews the Group’s compliance with accounting, legal and listing requirements. 
It is also responsible, along with the Board, for reviewing the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office and at 
www.morse.com.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 23 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
In the normal course, the Company will expect its auditors to provide audit and tax services, subject to auditor objectivity, 
independence regarding audit duties, review and re-tendering every four years. The Audit Committee has discretion to 
vary this review period depending on satisfaction with the audit process. A review was conducted this year and the Audit 
Committee’s recommendation is that KPMG Audit Plc be re-appointed as the Company’s auditors. An appropriate resolution 
will be put before the shareholders at this year’s Annual General Meeting. 
All other non-audit/tax advisory (e.g. due diligence) services will always be benchmarked by management to ensure value 
for money, auditor objectivity and independence of advice. Management may exercise its discretion to retain the auditors 
for such services subject to a de minimis of £50,000 per individual transaction or, for a series of smaller transactions, fees 
aggregating 50% of the annual combined audit and tax fee as projected in each year’s initial auditors’ review. Transactions 
involving higher fees, or where the independence of the auditors may be called into question, may be agreed by the Audit 
Committee Chairman who will, at his discretion, refer the matter for approval by the full Audit Committee in material cases. 
The auditors are not appointed to undertake management consultancy work. 
During the year the members of the Audit Committee (all of whom are Non-Executive Directors) were Derrick Nicholson 
(Chairman until 17 December 2008 when he retired) Richard Atkins (joined the Committee and was appointed Chairman on 
17 December 2008), Nigel Whitehead (retired 28 October 2008), the Hon. Michael Benson (retired 11 February 2009) and 
Paul Shelton as set out on the table on page 22. Kevin Loosemore was appointed as member of the Committee on 1 July 
2009. The Board is satisfied that both Derrick Nicholson and Richard Atkins who chaired the Audit Committee during the 
year had recent and relevant financial experience. 
The role of the Audit Committee is to monitor all financial statements of the Company, review internal financial controls, 
consider the need for an internal audit function and report to the Board on its findings if it considers action or improvement is 
required. 
The Board reviews the Company’s requirement for an internal audit function on an annual basis. The Audit Committee 
considers they have adequate structures in place to monitor financial statements and review financial controls without the 
requirement for a permanent internal audit function. This position will be kept under annual review and, should an internal 
audit function become necessary or desirable in the future, measures will be taken to ensure the Company establishes an 
internal audit function without delay. 
The Company has a formal ‘whistle-blowing’ policy made available to all employees of the Company and all subsidiary 
companies. 
Remuneration Committee
The Committee determines on behalf of the Board the overall remuneration package of the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman. In accordance with guidelines set by the Board, it determines the Group’s policy on remuneration of senior 
executives and controls the operation of share incentive schemes and the grant of incentives. 
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is set by a Committee of the Board consisting of at least two Executive Directors. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office and at 
www.morse.com. 
During the year the Committee met on five occasions and the members of the Remuneration Committee (all of whom were 
Non-Executive Directors) were Nigel Whitehead (Chairman until 28 October 2008 when he retired), Derrick Nicholson (until 
retired on 17 December 2008), the Hon. Michael Benson (member 1 July 2008 until retired 11 February 2009 and Chairman 
for the period 28 October 2008 to 17 December 2008), Paul Shelton (Chairman from 17 December 2008), Richard Atkins 
(joined 17 December 2008) and Kevin Loosemore (1 July 2008 to 7 July 2008) as set out on the table on page 22. Kevin 
Loosemore was re-appointed as member of the Committee on 1 July 2009.
Nomination Committee 
The Committee meets as required to initiate the selection process of, and make recommendations to, the Board with 
regard to the appointment of new Directors. Independent external recruitment consultants were retained in relation to the  24 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Corporate Governance Statement (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
appointments during the year for Mike Phillips, Richard Atkins and Guy Millward. The Committee considered the scope of 
roles and skills required having regard to the new operating model and the challenges facing the company.
The Board has established a formal procedure for appointment of new Board Directors based upon merit and objective 
criteria, ensuring the appointee has sufficient time to devote to the role. 
The Board is satisfied with the plans for assessment of Directors, updating of skills and knowledge regarding the Company 
to fulfill their functions, and orderly succession, ensuring that an appropriate core level of skill and experience is maintained 
within the Company and on the Board. Any significant commitments which might conflict with the effectiveness of new 
appointees are disclosed to the Board before appointment. Major shareholders are given the opportunity to meet new Non-
Executive Directors at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Board requires its members to make it aware of any changes in commitments that might give concern regarding the 
effectiveness of that member. 
The Board does not allow any Executive Director to take on more than one Non-Executive Directorship in a FTSE 100 
company or the Chairmanship of such company. 
During the year the Committee met on five occasions and the members of the Nomination Committee were the Kevin 
Loosemore (Chairman 1 July 2008 to 7 July 2008), Derrick Nicholson (Chairman 8 July 2008 until he retired on 17 December 
2008), the Hon. Michael Benson (Chairman from 17 December 2008 until he retired on 11 February 2009) Richard Atkins 
(joined 17 December 2008 and Chairman from 11 February 2009 to 1 July 2009) and Paul Shelton as set out on the table on 
page 22. Kevin Loosemore was re-appointed as Chairman of the Committee on 1 July 2009.
The employment contracts for the Non-Executive Directors are made available for public inspection at the Company’s 
registered office. 
The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office and at  
www.morse.com.
Investor Relations
The Company is committed to maintaining good relationships with its shareholders. There are regular dialogues with 
shareholders to ensure that issues and concerns are raised, including presentations following the Company’s interim and 
preliminary announcements. The Company uses the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity to communicate with its 
shareholders. All Directors are required to attend the Annual General Meeting and the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration 
and Nomination Committees are also available to answer shareholders’ questions. 
Notice of the 2009 Annual General Meeting will be dispatched to shareholders not less than 20 business days before the 
meeting. At the Annual General Meeting, details of all proxy votes will be made available in accordance with the provisions of 
the Code. Separate resolutions on each substantially separate issue, in particular any proposal relating to the Annual Report 
and Accounts, will be made at the Annual General Meeting. 
The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved following 
contact through normal channels – being the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer or Group Finance Director. 
Information is made available to shareholders on the Group’s website, which can be found at www.morse.com.
Management structure
The business is divided into four independent business units and a small central group function. The Morse Executive Board 
UK meets once a month under Terms of Reference approved by the Board to review all Group matters. Each business unit 
has its own executive board which meets once a month. In addition each business unit, together with the Chief Executive 
Officer, Group Finance Director and Company Secretary, holds a Monthly Performance Review.
Health and safety
The Company recognises the importance of health and safety and understands the high standards required to ensure the 
health, safety and welfare of its employees at work, its customers and the general public. The Company has an exemplary  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 25 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
health and safety record. During the year the Board revised and approved Terms of Reference for the Morse Heath and 
Safety Board which is now chaired by the Chief Executive Office, formerly by the Executive Chairman. The Board also 
reviewed the Morse Health and Safety Policy and Procedure Manual. Further information is set out in the Directors’ Report 
on page 15.
Internal control systems
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness on an 
annual basis. However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives, and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Elements of the system of material controls in line with the Turnbull guidance (which includes financial, operational and 
compliance controls) are:
l an annual budget is prepared to facilitate the monitoring of the Group’s business and financial activities and is formally 
adopted by the Board;
l Board meetings are held on a regular basis to consider performance against budget, the management accounts and the 
forecast for the coming months;
l within each business unit, the relevant managing director meets with senior executives of businesses within that business 
unit to discuss issues particular to that business;
l the Audit Committee meets at least three times a year to consider the plans and the results of the audit performed by the 
external auditors. The external auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee and vice versa; and
l business processes and internal control procedures are maintained through the BSI Certified BS EN ISO 9001: 2000 
Business Process documentation. 
Risk management
There are processes to ensure that business risk is considered, assessed and monitored as an integral part of the business. 
During the year the Board enhanced the existing framework by approving the Morse Risk Management Policy. There is an 
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant risks that is regularly reviewed by the Board. 
Senior Independent Director’s Report
I can confirm that in relation to the time that Kevin Loosemore was Executive Chairman, based on my experience at Morse, 
that the enhanced role of the Senior Independent Director (described on pages 19 and 20) operated effectively. Set out 
below is a summary of the additional duties that were undertaken during the year by the Senior Independent Director along 
with details of other practical policies agreed by the Board to ensure sufficient checks and balances existed during Kevin 
Loosemore’s appointment as Executive Chairman: 
l the Senior Independent Director was Chairman of the Nominations Committee;
l the Executive Chairman was not a member of any of the sub-committees of the Board, although he was invited to 
attend; 
l the Non-Executive Directors met twice without the Executive Chairman present;
l the Senior Independent Director signed off the Board Agenda prior to meetings and jointly approved the Board minutes;
l the Senior Independent Director took a full part in the Board appraisal process; and
l the Non-Executive Directors, who already have unfettered access to senior managers in the business, were provided with 
formal channels of communication with business unit managing directors to ensure they could gain relevant information 
in relation to each divisional business unit’s performance.
On 1 July 2009 Kevin Loosemore reverted to his original role as Non-Executive Chairman and the Board adopted the new 
statement of division of responsibility as set out on page 20.

remuneration. This report will be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting of the Company 
to be held on 22 October 2009 and has been produced in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and 
Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 
The information in the following section of the report is not subject to audit.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee reviews and determines on behalf of the Board the overall remuneration package of the Executive Directors 
and the Chairman. The Committee’s terms of reference are available for public inspection at the Company’s registered office 
and at www.morse.com. 
As detailed in the Corporate Governance Statement, a number of changes to the Company’s Board took place during the 
year under review to strengthen the operational and strategic leadership of the Company.
Set out below is a summary of the current and former members of the Committee, relating to the year under review.
Current Members
l Paul Shelton (Chairman from 17 December 2008);
l Richard Atkins (appointed 17 December 2008); and
l Kevin Loosemore (member from 1 July 2008 to 7 July 2008 until appointed Executive Chairman and member from 1 July 
2009 following his reverting to the position of Non-Executive Chairman).
Former members
l Nigel Whitehead (Chairman until 28 October 2008 when he retired); 
l Derrick Nicholson (retired on 17 December 2008); and
l The Hon. Michael Benson (Chairman 28 October 2008 to 17 December 2008, retired on 11 February 2009).
The Company considers the current members of the Committee to be independent Non-Executive Directors (as set out in 
the Corporate Governance Statement).  As set out in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 18 Kevin Loosemore’s 
temporary role as Executive Chairman is not considered to have impacted his independence since it was for a limited period 
of time only. No individual is involved in deciding his own remuneration. 
The Committee has received advice during the year from Hewitt New Bridge Street (“HNBS”), which was appointed by the 
Committee, in relation to current market trends and best practice with regard to Directors’ remuneration and governance. No 
other services are provided by HNBS to the Company save for technical advice relating to the operation of the Company’s 
share incentive arrangements. In addition, the Company Secretary provided services to the Committee.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy is based on the following broad principles:
l to provide Executive Directors with rewards that are competitive;
l to align remuneration with delivery of strategy;
l to take into account pay levels across the Group when setting Executive Directors’ pay; and
l to align the interests of Executive Directors with shareholders. 
Remuneration policy is reviewed regularly and the Committee is satisfied that the current policy does not encourage undue 
risk-taking. 
In light of the challenging economic conditions and recognising pay reviews more generally across the workforce, the 
Committee’s policy was not to award any salary increases to Executive Directors during the year under review. However, in 
light of the promotion of the Group Finance Director to the position of Chief Executive Officer, his salary was increased to 
reflect the broader responsibilities of the role. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 27 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Incentive policy was also reviewed both at the start of the year under review and again following the appointment of a 
new Chief Executive Officer to determine (i) appropriate quantum and (ii) targets in light of the economic environment and 
business performance of the Company.   
The remuneration packages comprise one or more of the following: base salary, benefits, performance-related bonuses, 
defined contribution pensions and long-term incentive awards. Base salaries are set to ensure the Company can recruit and 
retain the most capable talent (with account taken of competitive levels for similar roles in comparably sized companies), 
which the Company believes is vital for creating shareholder value. Strong emphasis is then placed on the variable 
performance-related aspects of the overall package with a significant proportion of pay linked to short and/or long term 
corporate performance targets. 
Subject to Board approval, the Company’s policy is normally to allow Executive Directors to accept outside appointments 
provided these are not considered to interfere with their ability to fulfill their duties to the Company. Whether a Director may 
retain any related fees will be considered on a case-by-case basis after giving due consideration to the time commitments 
associated with the proposed roles. 
The current elements of the remuneration packages are summarised below.
Base salary
Directors’ salaries are usually reviewed in September by the Committee in accordance with the terms above. When 
reviewing base salary levels, the Committee normally takes into account Group results for the previous trading year, individual 
performance, internal relativities, market rates and (in particular) the current circumstances faced by the Company. As stated 
above, however, the Committee’s policy for the year under review was not to award any base salary increases. Furthermore, 
in light of the continued challenging economic environment the Committee does not currently intend to award any salary 
increases for the current financial year. This policy will be reviewed at the start of the 2010/11 financial year in light of 
business performance at that time. 
In terms of the annual salary level of the current Executive Directors these are as follows:
l Mike Phillips (Chief Executive Officer): £275,000 (increased from £200,000 on promotion from Group Finance Director); 
and
l Guy Millward (Group Finance Director): £180,000.
The salary level of Kevin Loosemore as Executive Chairman was £350,000 from 8 July 2008 until his appointment as Non-
Executive Chairman from 1 July 2009 when his fee was set at £120,000.
Benefits
The Company’s policy is to provide Executive Directors’ (save for Kevin Loosemore’s time as an Executive Chairman when 
he was not eligible to receive these benefits) with a car allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance (four times basic 
salary) and personal accident and travel insurance. 
Annual performance-related bonus
Bonus payments have historically been based on actual performance against a sliding scale/range of challenging Group 
performance objectives set at the start of the financial year. The maximum bonus opportunity detailed in last year’s Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year ending 30 June 2009 was 75% of salary for Executive Directors. Bonus payments are 
non-pensionable and are payable after the Group’s statutory accounts have been audited. In respect of the year ended 
30 June 2009, Mike Phillips was the sole Executive Director eligible to participate in the Company’s annual bonus plan. As 
he was appointed part way through the year under review during which the Company was implementing a revised Group 
structure, the Committee measured his performance against a range of Group financial performance metrics, strategic 
milestones and personal objectives. The bonus earned, at £100,000, reflected his performance as both Group Finance 
Director and Chief Executive Officer, and the wider economic environment.  28 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Directors' remuneration report (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Kevin Loosemore was not eligible to receive any annual bonus for the time spent in his temporary role as Executive 
Chairman, with his interests instead aligned with shareholders through the share award and related co-investment which is 
described more fully below. 
For the financial year ending 30 June 2010, the maximum bonus potential will be capped at 75% of salary for all Executive 
Directors. The bonus metrics to apply are currently under review but it is the Committee’s intention to set targets based on 
a challenging sliding scale of Group financial targets in tandem with defined strategic objectives. Full details of the revised 
bonus structure will be set out in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In line with the Association of British Insurers’ Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure 
that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance 
(”ESG”) risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour. More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration 
structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account ESG matters. 
Pensions
The Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ pensions is to provide access to a defined contribution scheme (money 
purchase) which is also available to wider employees. The Company contribution rate is set at a fixed amount for each of the 
Executive Directors (except for Kevin Loosemore’s time as Executive Chairman when he was not eligible to receive a pension 
benefit). For the year under review, Mike Phillips’s Company pension contribution was set at £20,000 from 9 September 
2008 and will remain at this rate for the current financial year.
The annual Company pension contributions of other Executive Directors serving during the year under review were as 
follows:
l Duncan McIntyre’s rate was set at £35,000;
l Kevin Alcock’s rate was set at £42,000; and
l Eric Dodd’s rate was set at £20,000. 
Guy Millward, on joining the Company on 1 July 2009, has a Company pension contribution of £10,000 from 1 July 2009. 
Executive share incentive schemes 
Executive share incentives are considered to be a key part of management retention and motivation. Company policy is to 
incentivise Executive Directors to perform at high levels and to align their interests with those of shareholders. 
The 2004 Morse Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) operates as the Company’s primary long-term incentive arrangement. 
At the time of introducing the LTIP , flexibility was retained to make further awards under the Executive Share Option Schemes 
2000 at the Committee’s discretion albeit with the Committee’s intention being to operate the LTIP as the sole type of long-
term incentive plan in future years. 
During the year under review an award was made to the Chief Executive Officer under the LTIP . A summary of the main 
features of the LTIP is set out below, with details of all historic share awards made to Executive Directors in service during the 
year under review set out in the relevant tables.
Prior to making the award to the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee undertook a review of the targets that had applied in 
prior years to ensure that they remained appropriate in light of the revised strategy of the Company and the wider economic 
environment. As set out on the next page, the Committee felt it appropriate to apply a new target with the Chief Executive 
Officer’s award based solely on delivering significant growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) which is fully aligned with the 
Company’s long-term objectives. 
In addition, as set out in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, as part of individual agreements reached with Kevin 
Loosemore to facilitate his appointment as Executive Chairman and with Mike Phillips to facilitate his appointment as Group 
Finance Director, the Committee considered it necessary to grant special share awards to these individuals under the 
provisions of paragraph 9.4.2 (2) of the Listing Rules. Summary details of these awards are set out in this report. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 29 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
The LTIP
The maximum award that may be made in any financial year (save in exceptional circumstances) is restricted to shares with a 
market value on grant of 150% of annual basic salary.
In determining the award levels to be made in 2008/09, due consideration was given to (i) investors’ best practice 
expectations of scaling awards back where the Company’s share price has fallen in response to the difficult trading 
conditions (ii) the business performance of the Company and (iii) the need to recruit, retain and incentivise our key executive 
talent. Reflecting the above, the award made during the year was set at a fixed number of shares valued at 50% of salary 
which is significantly lower than the maximum award limit up to which awards have been granted in prior years.
Awards normally vest following the third anniversary of grant once the Committee has determined the extent to which the 
applicable performance conditions have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Group. 
Historically, awards have been subject to a mix of EPS growth and relative total shareholder return (TSR). Details of which are 
set out on page 30. 
In relation to the sole award made to an Executive Director under the LTIP during the year under review (the Chief Executive 
Officer), as noted on the previous page, the Committee determined that the performance condition should be solely based 
on a challenging range of EPS growth targets. The range of targets set is the same as that used in prior years but was 
considered to be appropriately challenging in light of prevailing economic conditions and current trading prospects at the 
time of granting the award. The range of targets and associated vesting schedule is set out below: 
 Average Annual Compound Growth
 In Adjusted Basic EPS Percentage vesting
 Below RPI + 4% 0%
 RPI + 4%  25%
 RPI + 13% 100%
 Between RPI + 4% and RPI + 13% 25% – 100% on a straight-line basis
The Committee believes the performance condition for the award is fully aligned with the strategy of the business, namely 
generating significant returns for our shareholders. 
While continued use of relative TSR was considered, recent market volatility, particularly in the FTSE All-Share Software and 
Computer Services Sector, resulted in the Committee concluding that it was not appropriate to subject part of the above 
award to a relative TSR performance condition. This position will be kept under review in future years. 
The extent to which the performance conditions are satisfied will be determined by the Committee, having taken 
independent advice where necessary.
The Committee will regularly review the operation of the Company’s incentive arrangements to ensure they take due account 
of market/best practice and reflect the Company’s particular circumstances and strategic goals.
The base EPS figure used for awards made in the financial year ending 30 June 2009 is based on the Adjusted basic 
earnings per share method detailed on page 10. 
There is no provision for re-testing the condition.
Prior to the Committee making an award under the LTIP , it may require a prospective participant to buy and retain Ordinary 
shares in the Company worth up to one third of the value of the shares over which the proposed award would be made. 
Guy Millward Award
As part of the terms of Guy Millward’s appointment, the Committee agreed to grant Guy Millward an award under the LTIP 
of 700,000 shares at the first available opportunity. Since his appointment on 1 July 2009 it has not been possible to grant 
the award as the Company has been in a close period. The award will be granted as soon as is practicable following the 
Company’s return to trading in an open period. The performance conditions applying to the award will be the EPS condition 
set out above but the base year from which performance is measured will be the year ending 30 June 2009. Guy Millward  30 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Directors' remuneration report (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
will also be eligible to receive a further award during the current year if the Committee considers it appropriate to do so in line 
with the terms of the LTIP .
Recruitment Awards
As reported in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report, two separate recruitment awards granted during the year under 
review were as follows:
Kevin Loosemore
A nil cost option award over 1,050,000 shares was made which was to ordinarily vest on the second anniversary of his 
appointment as Executive Chairman. Vesting was contingent on the purchase and retention of 619,500 shares which was 
the net of tax number of shares comprising the award and this shareholding was achieved in full on 10 July 2008. 
In relation to the change of his role to Non-Executive Chairman on 1 July 2009 and the successful implementation of the 
new operating structure, in accordance with the contractual terms of Kevin Loosemore’s service agreement, the Committee 
determined that the shares should be released and vest in full on 11 February 2009.
Mike Phillips 
To facilitate his recruitment as Group Finance Director, a nil cost option was granted over shares with a market value at grant 
of £300,000. The award will vest dependent upon the satisfaction of two separate challenging targets (EPS growth and 
relative TSR) and continued employment (save in certain good leaver or a change of control situation). The EPS growth target 
that applies to half the award is as set out above for the LTIP award made during the year. The relative TSR performance 
target that applies to the other half of the award (also measured over three years) is set out below:
 Rank of the Company’s TSR against FTSE Percentage of the TSR part of the award
 All-Share Software and Computer that vests
 Services Sector
 Below median 0%
 Median 25%
 Upper quartile 100%
 Between median and upper quartile 25% – 100% on a straight-line basis
If a corporate event (e.g. a takeover) was to take place on or before the second anniversary of the award, the award would 
vest in full provided that a share price of 46.35p was achieved over the week immediately preceding the corporate event. 
Dilution
As a result of the reduction in the Company’s share capital that was effected as a result of the demerger of Monitise, 
shareholder approval was received at the 2007 AGM to operate the LTIP (and Morse’s other share plans) within a 12.5% in 
ten years dilution limit.
It remains the Committee’s intention to return to operating within a 10% in ten years dilution limit as soon as it is considered 
practicable to do so. For information, the current dilution position as at 30 June 2009 was 8.39% of the then current issued 
share capital of the Company and at the date of this report the dilution position was 8.08% of the current issued share 
capital of the Company.
Total Shareholder Return
The following graph shows the value of £100 invested in Morse plc on 30 June 2004 compared with the value of £100 
invested in the FTSE All-Share Software and Computer Services Index, which the Committee believes is the most 
appropriate index to use for this purpose as (i) the Company has been a constituent of this index and (ii) it is the group of 
companies historically used in the LTIP for comparitive TSR purposes.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 31 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

Employee share schemes 
The Company operates a number of all-employee share schemes, including an HMRC approved SAYE scheme, in which 
the Executive Directors are also entitled to participate. Details of the awards, granted and outstanding, under each of the 
schemes are given in note 5 to the financial statements.
Service Agreements
From 8 July 2008 to 30 June 2009, Kevin Loosemore’s role as Executive Chairman was governed by a letter of appointment 
for a two year period. During the first year under this engagement, the Company had a requirement to serve 12 months’ 
notice upon him and he had a requirement to give six months’ notice on the Company. During the second year of this 
engagement, the notice period for the Company had to reduce by one month for each further month of service beyond the 
first anniversary such that after 23 months from the commencement date the minimum period of notice the Company would 
have been obliged to give to terminate his appointment shall be one month. The notice required from Kevin Loosemore 
would have continued at six months until 18 months from the commencement date when it would have reduced by one 
month for each month of service until also at one month. 
On the 1 July 2009 Kevin Loosemore reverted to the role of Non-Executive Chairman on the same terms as his original letter 
of appointment for the remainder of the three years from the 14 February 2008 and a notice period of six months, save for 
his fee which was increased to £120,000 per annum.
Mike Phillips has a notice period on the part of the Company of 12 months during the first year of his appointment, which 
reduces by one month each month post his first anniversary of appointment until 18 months of employment, at which point 
the notice period is and remains at six months. His notice period to the Company is six months at all times.
Guy Millward has a notice period on the part of the Company to give 12 months’ written notice until 1 April 2010 which 
after this period will reduce linearly over a further six month period such that after 1 October 2010 the notice period is and  32 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
Directors' remuneration report (continued)
Morse plc Annual Report 2009
remains at six months. His notice period to the Company is six months at all times. As an additional term agreed to facilitate 
his appointment, the Committee felt it appropriate to agree that if, whist he was serving his notice period at his previous 
employer, there should be a change of control at the Company such that he could not take up the role of Group Finance 
Director on 1 July 2009, he would be entitled to a sum of £180,000 (being one year’s basic salary) less sums due from his 
former employer, subject to an obligation on Guy Millward to mitigate his loss. This provision lapsed on 1 July 2009 when 
Guy Millward joined the Company.
The Service Agreements of Duncan McIntyre (during the post as Executive Deputy Chairman), Kevin Alcock and Eric Dodd 
had notice periods of six months both to and from the Company.
The contracts contain no provisions for termination payments other than those that may arise under notice provisions, which 
the Company believes reflects market and best practice. 
Non-Executive Director appointments contain notice provisions from one month to six months. There are no compensation 
provisions for early termination of Non-Executive Director appointments.

granted in October 2006 prior to him joining the plc Board which was eligible to vest in October 2009). The range of TSR targets were as for Mike 
Phillips’ Recruitment Award made in the year under review as set out on page 30 and the range of EPS targets were as per the targets applying to the

Long-Term Incentive Plan prior to the 1 July 2007 (with the exception of Kevin Alcock’s award granted in October 2006) is determined based on TSR 
with the same range of performance targets as for Mike Phillip’s recruitment award as set out on page 30 and the awards also had a requirement for 
EPS to increase in real terms over the performance period for any vesting to take place (unless the Committee believed it to be inappropriate to apply 
the underpin)
11 Awards granted under the Approved & Unapproved Executive Share Option 2000 were subject to a performance condition that required there to be an 
annual average increase in adjusted EPS of at least 5% over RPI over a three year performance period with no re-testing

increase in adjusted EPS of at least 5% over RPI over a three year performance period with an opportunity to re-test in year 4
The market price of the Company’s shares at the end of the year was £0.1475 (2008: £0.51).
During the year the market price ranged between £0.047 and £0.51.
No other Directors have been granted awards in the shares of the Company or other Group entities.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in respect 
of the Annual Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements, in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting 
Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing 
each of the group and parent company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
l make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l  for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU;
l  for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements; and
l  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility 
for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud 
and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included in the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ 
from the legislation in other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
l   the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
l  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.

1 Group Accounting policies 
General Information
Morse plc is a public limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. 
The address of its registered office is Profile West, 950 Great West Road, Brentford. Middlesex, TW8 9EE.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”) 
and equity account the Group’s interest in associates and jointly controlled entities. The parent company financial statements 
present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”), IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 as 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are 
presented on pages 91 to 99.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented 
in these Group financial statements. These financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling rounded to the nearest 
thousand.
Going Concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position 
are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s Statement. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in note 25 of the financial statements, which also includes the Group’s processes for 
managing its capital, its financial risk and its exposure to credit and liquidity risk.
The Directors are currently of the opinion that the Group’s forecast and projections, taking account of reasonably possible 
changes in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within its renewed borrowing facilities 
and comply with its banking covenants. Forward covenant tests show that none of the covenants are breached for the 
foreseeable future. 
A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in the Group’s debt becoming immediately repayable. Should a 
covenant breach become likely, there are several mitigating actions that the Group could take including: seeking cost 
reductions, remitting surplus funds from international operations, generating cash through disposal of business units and 
entering into negotiations with debt providers which could result in higher financing costs. The Group has not been required 
to seek any commitment from its banks to waive or amend any existing covenants and is not aware of any reason why its 
banking group would refuse to support such a request, subject to acceptable terms, were one to be made. 
The Group is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which arise as a result of the current economic environment. 
In determining that the Group is a going concern, these risks (the most significant of which are listed below) have been 
considered by the Directors, who have determined that currently they do not represent a significant threat to the Group: 
l  whilst the Downside scenarios modelled by the company reflect reasonable changes in market conditions and 
competitive pressures, in the current environment a further significant downturn could impact Group revenues and 
margins to a greater extent than currently envisaged; 
l  liquidity risks are greater because of the difficulties within the banking sector. However, the Group currently 
has adequate facilities with sufficient headroom for the foreseeable future even under a worst case downside which 
assumes almost nil cash generation in the next 12 months; and 
l  credit risk is heightened as a result of difficulties that might be faced by some of the Group’s customers in the current 
climate and also because of credit risks associated with other counterparties, such as banks, with which the Group has 
dealings.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 45 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Going Concern (continued)
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s future cash forecasts and revenue projections, which they believe are based 
on prudent market data and past experience and have formed a judgement that at the time of approving these financial 
statements, based on those forecasts and projections, there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the going concern basis is adopted in preparing these accounts. 
Measurement convention
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are 
stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management 
to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. Details of significant accounting 
estimates and judgments have been disclosed under the relevant note or accounting policy for each area where disclosure is 
required. The judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the financial statements are discussed below.
Share based payments 
The determination of share based payments is reliant on certain assumptions which include expected life of the options and 
expected volatility as detailed in note 5.
Revenue recognition in relation to fixed price contracts
For fixed price contracts revenue is recognised on a percentage completion basis. As delivery is over an extended period, 
judgement is required to estimate the total costs likely to be incurred over the life of the contract. 
Goodwill impairment 
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss, based on the recoverable amount of 
its Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”). The recoverable amounts of the CGUs have been determined based on value in use 
calculations and these calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash flows and suitable discount rates as 
disclosed in note 13. 
Provisions
Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and restructuring. These provisions are estimates and the 
actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the 
actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made. Details of the Group’s provisions 
are set out in note 24.
Income tax liabilities and assets
The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant 
judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual liability arising from these issues differs 
from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period 
when such determination is made. Details of the tax credit/charge and deferred tax asset are set out in notes 9 and 14 
respectively.
Prior year adjustment
The directors have reviewed the tax provisions relating to open tax enquiries from HMRC. Some of these enquiries go back 
as far as the year ended 30 June 2002 and therefore have been the subject of lengthy correspondence with HMRC. The tax 
provisions have stayed relatively constant for the past two years since the level of probability on settling each of these cases 
has not changed. In prior periods, the tax provisions did not include any interest for overdue payments. Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 (continued)
46 Morse plc Annual Report 2009 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Prior year adjustment  (continued)
However, in January 2009, an outline agreement was reached with HMRC in respect of open tax enquiries for periods ending 
after 30 June 2004, which gave rise to interest on overdue tax of £0.8 million, which had not been previously provided for. At 
the half year, based on this review, the directors considered it appropriate to also record the interest on the remaining open 
enquiries within this provision which amounted to a further £1.1 million being provided at 31 December 2008. Updated for 
movements in the second half of the year the interest creditor provision at 30 June 2009 is £2.0 million. 
In light of the materiality of the amounts involved, the directors are of the opinion that it is appropriate to adjust the 
comparatives for the year ended 30 June 2008 retrospectively and therefore the effect has been treated as a prior year 
adjustment. The directors believe this will ensure that the results for the current period are not distorted and that the prior 
periods have the correct amount of interest included. 
Impact on comparatives
The effect on prior year comparatives is as follows:

The effect of this adjustment is to increase the loss after tax by £0.3 million for the year ended 30 June 2008 and reduce net 
assets by £1.2 million as at that date, including a £0.9 million reduction to retained earnings brought forward at 1 July 2007.
The impact on basic and diluted EPS of this adjustment is to increase the loss per share by 0.2p, from 3.5p per share to 
3.7p per share, for the year ended 30 June 2008.
At 1 July 2007 the comparative for Deferred tax asset, previously reported at £420,000 has been adjusted by £395,000 and 
restated at £815,000 to reflect the deferred tax impact of the HMRC interest. 
Basis of consolidation 
Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or 
indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing 
control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements 
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date control commences until the date that 
control ceases. Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenditure arising from intra-
group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, usually between 20% to 50% of the equity voting 
rights, and over which it exercises significant influence. A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term 
interest and over which it exercises joint control. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. The Group’s investment in associated and joint ventures 
includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 47 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Basis of consolidation (continued)
The Group’s share of the post acquisition profits less losses of associates and of joint ventures are included in the 
consolidated income statement, and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance 
sheet. 
Revenue and cost of sales
Revenue represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services provided 
within the Group’s ordinary activities net of Value Added Tax, returns, discounts and excluding intra-group sales. Revenue 
comprises sales of hardware, software, consulting services and maintenance/support services.
Revenue recognition occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, risks and rewards have been transferred, 
the fee is determinable and collectability is probable. 
Hardware and installation
Hardware sales are recognised on dispatch, unless significant installation work is required or customer specific conditions 
must be met, in which case revenues are recognised on installation or acceptance by the customer.
Sales of software
Revenue from the sale of software product licences at the time the software licence is granted is recognised in accordance 
with the contract, typically at the time of supply of the software product to the customer. 
Consulting services
Revenues include sales of services that are delivered over extended periods of time and recognised on a percentage of 
completion basis over the period that the service is delivered. Revenue and profits on fixed price contracts are taken in 
proportion to the cost of work performed on each contract relative to the estimated total cost of completing the contract. 
Revenues derived from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been agreed by the customer. Costs are 
fully accrued for estimated losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen. Revenue on time and material 
contracts typically from delivering consulting services is recognised at the contractual rates with the stage of completion 
measured on the basis of hours delivered as a percentage of total hours to be delivered. 
The gross amount due from customers for contract work is included within trade and other receivables and the gross 
amount due to suppliers is included within trade and other payables.
Maintenance & support
Revenues from maintenance and support services delivered by the group are recognised over the period that the services 
are provided. Payments in advance of services are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred income. 
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment, net of estimated residual value and impairment, is depreciated in equal annual 
instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The residual values of assets or group of like assets and the useful 
economic lives of assets are reviewed annually.
The rates of depreciation are as follows:
Leasehold improvements: shorter of ten years and the unexpired expected term of the lease. 
Fixtures and fittings: four years.
Motor vehicles: four years.
Office equipment:  four years except for computer equipment, which is depreciated by 40% in the year of 
acquisition and thereafter in equal annual instalments over the next two years.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than the 
estimated recoverable amount.  Notes to the financial statements

Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given plus 
directly attributable costs in respect of the acquisition over the fair value to the Group of the net identifiable assets and any 
contingent liabilities acquired (identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights 
regardless of whether those rights are separable). 
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 July 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under UK GAAP , (which was broadly comparable, save that only separable intangibles were recognised 
and goodwill was amortised).
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill has been frozen at its net book value at 1 July 2004, is allocated to CGU and is not 
amortised, but instead is subject to annual impairment reviews. Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated 
impairment losses. Any impairment losses are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets and contingent liabilities acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Expenditure on 
development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, and the Group has 
sufficient resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour 
and an appropriate proportion of overheads. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period to which it relates.
Other intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated at cost, assessed on an estimate of the present value of future 
cash flows projected to arise from the use of the intangible assets less amounts written-off representing impairments in value 
and accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is charged to administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible 
assets unless such lives are indefinite. 
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use or acquired. The estimated useful lives are as 
follows:
Trade names: ten years
Customer relationship backlog: one year
Maintenance contracts: six years
Follow on consulting: eight years
Development: three years
Software: three years
Intellectual property: seven years
Database: three years
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets which are not subject to amortisation, are reviewed at each year end 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated. Impairment tests on the carrying value of assets subject to amortisation are undertaken if events or changes in 
circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date. An impairment loss is recognised whenever 
the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are 
recognised in the income statement. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 49 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Impairment (continued) 
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows and that are largely 
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed on initial 
recognition of these financial assets). Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely 
independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of receivables carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable 
amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after an impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
In respect of other assets an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the 
recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of the previous 
carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell, with any adjustments taken to profit or loss. The same applies to gains 
and losses on subsequent re-measurement. 
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be principally recovered 
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is 
highly probable within one year and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. 
Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 
one year from the date of classification. 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business that represents a separate major line of business or 
geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale, that has been disposed of, 
has been abandoned or that meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. The results of discontinued operations are 
presented separately in the income statement (including the comparative period) and more detail is provided in note 10.
Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise bank borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and financial instruments. The 
Group’s financial assets and liabilities other than derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost. 
The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates. The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes. Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 (continued)
50 Morse plc Annual Report 2009 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates. The Group does not apply hedge accounting and changes in the value of derivative financial instruments are 
recognised in the income statement as they arise. Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The fair value 
of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non 
monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the 
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are 
stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are 
translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are 
translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of 
the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation 
reserve. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
Taxation
The tax charge for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income 
statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amount for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes; initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting 
nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent 
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is 
recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be 
utilised. Deferred tax is recognised on a undiscounted basis.
Leases
Leases in which a significant proportion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained with the lessor are classified 
as operating leases. Operating leases and rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement on 
a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an 
integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Pension costs
Payments made to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they accrue. Assets of the 
schemes are not included within the financial statements of the Group.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 51 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Share-based compensation
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company, these awards are 
granted by the ultimate parent. Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes are equity settled. The expense 
arising on a grant by the parent company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Group are recharged to business units.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled 
to the options. The fair value of market and non-market based options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. Charges to the income statement 
are reviewed each year to take account of service and non-market conditions. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Interest in own shares 
The assets and liabilities of the Group Employee Share Oprtion Schemes (“ESOS”) trusts are recognised in the financial 
statements where there is de facto control of those assets and liabilities. The Company’s own shares held in the ESOS trust 
are deducted from shareholders’ funds until they are transferred to employees.
Cash and cash equivalents
The Group manages its short-term liquidity through holding of cash and highly liquid interest bearing deposits. For the 
purpose of the cash flow statement only deposits, with an original maturity period of three months or less are shown as cash 
and cash equivalents. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are shown as cash and cash equivalents.
Provisions 
A provision is made where the Group has a present legal or contractual obligation as a result of past events and it is 
probable that an outflow of economic benefit will be required to settle the obligation.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been 
communicated to affected parties. A provision is recognised for a contract that is onerous (i.e. one in which the unavoidable 
costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the benefits to be derived). 
A provision for dilapidations is recognised when it is probable that there will be an outflow of economic benefit in respect 
of obligations with the related lease arrangement. During the year management made a change in estimate with their 
dilapidation accounting policy. The policy is now based on receiving estimates from an independent surveyor. Consequently 
an exceptional charge of £0.7 million has been recognised in the profit and loss account in the year ended 30 June 2009. 
The provision is based on the potential costs at 30 June 2009 that the business is likely to incur to bring all properties to the 
same state as at the beginning of the lease. Going forward the provision will continue to be reviewed each year, with use of 
independent surveyors where appropriate, and adjusted as required to reflect the liability existing at that point in time.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less associated transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and 
includes expenditure incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the 
amount that can be realised from the sale of inventories in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of 
realisation.  Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 30 June 2009 (continued)
52 Morse plc Annual Report 2009 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Trade receivables
Trade and other receivables are initially stated at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost. Provisions against bad 
debt are made on a monthly basis, for any doubtful debts where the cost can be reasonably estimated or is known. 
At the beginning of the financial year the policy in place for bad debts was to provide as follows: 100% for any specific 
uncollectable debt, 15% for debt overdue between 90 and 120 days and 100% for debt overdue 120 days or more.
Given the global economic crisis during the year management made a change in estimate with their bad debt policy. The 
policy is now to provide 100% for any specific uncollectable debt, 50% for debt overdue between 90 and 120 days and 
100% for debt overdue 120 days or more.
We believe this is a more appropriate policy at this time to manage the group’s receivables exposure.
Trade payables
Trade and other payables are initially stated at their fair value and thereafter at amortised cost.
Dividends
Dividend income is recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Exceptional items
Items that are exceptional in size or nature, are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement. 
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Group’s underlying business 
performance. Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses arising on the 
restructuring of businesses and asset impairments.
Presentational items 
The Group discloses certain items separately on the face of the income statement in order to assist users of the financial 
statements. These would include items which are material and of a one-off or non-cash nature, such as intangibles 
amortisation, share based payments and trading balance releases. These items are not exceptional items.
Trading balance releases
In the ordinary course of trading, liabilities are recognised in relation to customers and suppliers which ultimately may 
not crystallise. These are referred to as trading balances. Given the lower volumes and improved controls and processes 
implemented over the last three years, the level of build up of short term trading balances is reducing. There is an established 
operating policy for releasing these balances as soon as it is evident that the liability has been extinguished in the ordinary 
course of trading. 
Trading balances have built up significantly over a period of time. These relate to unallocated cash payments from 
customers; credit notes issued and not claimed; supplier credit balances that may not be enforced and goods received not 
yet invoiced. The nature of the uncertainty surrounding them is that while they represent present obligations, it is uncertain 
whether the counterparties will enforce settlement. 
Trading balances are reviewed on a regular basis. If not used in the ordinary course of trade, consistent with established 
operating policies, they are released in line with our accounting policy when a liability is judged to no longer exist. The policy 
in relation to long term (older than one year) trading balances is to credit to the income statement all balances greater 
than six years old if no trading activity has taken place with the counterparty in the previous twelve months or where the 
counterparty confirms that the Group has no further liabilities. The overriding principle is that the time passed and the fact 
that there is no trading relationship with the counterparty provides clear evidence that the liability does not exist. Short-term 
trading balances are reviewed regularly, cleared down and where appropriate credit notes issued. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 53 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
1 Group Accounting policies (continued)
Related party transactions
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under IAS 24 – ‘Related party disclosures’ not to disclose transactions 
between Group companies.
Segmental information
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services (business 
segment), or in providing products or services within a particular economic area (geographical segment), which is subject to 
risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Group’s primary reporting format is business segments and reflects the Group’s management and internal reporting 
structure. Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be 
allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1July 2008 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted. 
a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2008/2009 with no impact on the Group: 
 l IFRIC12 “Service concession arrangements”, effective from 1 January 2008 
 l IFRIC13 “Customer loyalty programmes”, effective from 1 July 2008
 l  IFRIC14 “IAS 19 – The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction”, effective 
from 1 January 2008
b)  New standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by 
the Group. The impact on the Group’s operations is currently being assessed:

IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 ‘Segmental reporting’, and requires a ‘management approach’ under which segmental 
information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes and therefore will have little 
impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements except to split out IS&T Europe into IS&T Spain and IS&T 
Ireland.

Business segments
Morse operates under four key business segments – Infrastructure Services & Technology UK, Infrastructure Services & 
Technology Europe, Business Applications Services and Investment Management Consulting. For reasons of commercial 
sensitivity the results of IS&T Ireland and IS&T Spain are combined as IS&T Europe for external reporting purposes.
The results of the Investment Management Consulting business segment have been reported as discontinued for the year 
ended 30 June 2009 following a decision by the Board on 17 December 2008 to exit this business segment. The results 
of the Investment Management Consulting segment have been reclassified for the prior period to be also shown under 
Discontinued Operations.
The Infrastructure Services & Technology UK segment provides technology and integration solutions for clients and operates 
mainly in the UK. 
The Infrastructure Services & Technology Europe segment provides technology and integration solutions for clients and 
operates in Ireland and Spain. 
The Business Applications Services segment has three key lines of business: SAP Consulting (SAP implementation and 
support services), Portals and Collaborations (Enterprise content management) and Xayce (Business change consultancy). 
The business operates in three main territories: UK, Asia and the USA.
The Investment Management Consulting segment provides specialist investment management consulting to the financial 
services industry. It operates in the following territories: UK, Channel Islands, France, Luxembourg, South Africa, Australia 
and Singapore.
The assets and liabilities of Central and Infrastructure Services & Technology UK are managed collectively (for example, cash 
is managed on this basis) and are therefore not capable of any meaningful separation.
All inter-segment sales are on an arms length basis. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 59 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

2009 items
The dilapidations provision charge reflects a liability at 30 June 2009 for potential costs that the businesses are likely to incur 
to bring all properties to the same state as required by the lease contract. The change in estimate during the year (explained 
in note 1) has led to a charge of £0.7 million being recognised in 2009.
The provision for loss on disposal of businesses relates to the Australian and French business units of the Investment 
Management Consulting division (discontinued operations). The majority stake held in the Australian business was sold to 
management on 3 September 2009. Terms have been agreed for the sale of the majority stake held in the French business, 
subject to shareholder approval, to the management of that business. A circular will be sent to shareholders in due course 
relating to the French business which is classified as a related party transaction. The provision is for the proceeds receivable 
versus the carrying value of the net assets. 
The lapsing of share options relating to a former director of the Group has resulted in a write back of previously incurred 
share options charges. The forfeiture has resulted in a credit of £0.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2009.
The reversal of fair value adjustments of £0.6 million primarily relates to the crystallising of fair value adjustments for mainly 
bad debt provisions and accruals from previous acquisitions.
Restructuring costs in the year ended 30 June 2009 amount to £9.6 million and relate to the cost reduction programme 
announced on 25th July 2008. As part of restructuring a £0.6 million share options charge was reflected representing 
accelerated charges resulting from employees who left the company as part of the restructuring. 
The goodwill and intangibles impairment charge in the year ended 30 June 2009 relates to the impairment of goodwill 
(£13.6 million) and intangible assets (£0.1 million) in the Investment Management Consulting division (discontinued 
operations). The carrying value of goodwill and intangible relating to this division is nil at 30 June 2009.
2008 items
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles in the Diagonal business (part of the 
Business Applications Services division) was reviewed. Consequently, impairment of goodwill (£12.3 million) and intangibles 
(£1.1 million) was recognised in this period.
Tax effect
The tax effect of the exceptional items in the year ended 30 June 2009 is a credit of £2.4 million (2008: nil). Morse plc Annual Report 2009 61 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
4 Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period.
As there was a loss in the period there is no dilution and so the basic and diluted EPS figures are the same.
Reconciliation of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below:

Ordinary shareholders (12,098) 129,829 (9.3) (4,795) 128,742 (3.7)
To provide a comparable measure of performance per share from the normal operations of the business, a supplementary 
EPS has been calculated in addition to the disclosure required by IAS 33 with the following adjustments to the basic and 
diluted EPS. The Directors consider this is helpful in assisting the reader to understand the underlying performance of the 
Group.

The tax charge used for the adjusted EPS calculations has been adjusted to reflect a full tax charge on the adjusted profit 
before tax, thus removing the effect of the significant tax adjustments in any one year that relate to prior periods.
Continuing operations
Basic and diluted earnings per share of 1.0p (2008: loss of 5.1p) for continuing operations is calculated from the net profit 
attributable to equity holders of the parent from continuing operations of £1,351,000 (2008: loss of £6,504,000) divided by 
the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period. Notes to the financial statements

Discontinued operations
Basic loss per share of 10.4p (2008: earnings of 1.3p) for discontinued operations is calculated from the net loss attributable 
to equity holders of the parent from discontinued operations of £13,450,000 (2008: profit of £1,709,000) divided by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period.
To provide a comparable measure of performance per share from the continuing operations of the business, a 
supplementary EPS has been calculated in addition to the disclosure required by IAS 33 with the following adjustments 
to the basic and diluted EPS. The Directors consider this is helpful in assisting the reader to understand the underlying 
performance of the Group.

within this contract. In the year ended 30 June 2009 the potential liability is considered to be immaterial as only 4 employees 
were transferred at year end and transfers are made on a fully funded basis. The company will review this treatment as more 
members are transferred and as the amounts become material will be recognised in the Group financial statements.

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may 
occur in future.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the recent historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also 
not necessarily be the actual outcome.
No other features of the options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The directors consider that the value of Diagonal shares can be calculated on the same basis as the Morse plc shares as the 
nature of Diagonal shares are consistent with those of Morse plc. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 69 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

of property rationalisations through the year. 
7 Trading balance releases
During the year total trading balance releases of £4,139,000 (2008: £4,174,000) were credited to the income statement, 
within ‘administrative expenses’.
At 30 June 2008, there were £10.2 million of trading balance credits on the balance sheet. During the year £4.1 million 
of trading balances were released to the income statement in line with the policy, £1.7 million of the liability was either 
crystallised or settled with £4.4 million remaining in the balance sheet at 30 June 2009.
Of the £4.4 million closing balance, £3.6 million (2008: £8.7 million) is included within trade and other payables and 
£0.8 million (2008: £1.5 million) within deferred income.
As reductions in the trading balance credits are driven by a number of factors it is difficult to predict with certainty the levels 
of releases that will flow through the income statement in the years ahead. However, we anticipate trading balance releases 
will continue at the following approximate levels; FY10: £0.9 million, FY11: £0.8 million, FY12: £1.2 million with any increase 
in these levels being driven by action by the Company.  Notes to the financial statements

The effective tax rate in the year ended 30 June 2009 differs from the UK tax rate of 28% mainly due to the effect of the prior 
year tax credit and the loss making position of the group. The adjustment to the corporation tax provision from prior years 
is higher than in previous years and reflects the finalisation of corporation tax liabilities for 2007 and 2008 and settlement 
of a number of open HMRC enquiries dating back to the year ended 30 June 2005 which has resulted in the reversal of 
previously provided amounts.
For the year ended 30 June 2008 the tax charge was higher than the UK rate of 29.5% because of non-deductible costs, 
primarily the goodwill and intangibles impairment charge.
Deferred tax of £250,000 (2008: £171,000) was credited directly to the Retained Earnings. Morse plc Annual Report 2009 71 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

10 Discontinued operations and Assets of disposal group classified as held for sale
On 20 February 2009, the Company completed the disposal of the business and assets of the UK and Jersey Investment 
Management Consultancy business, formerly known as CSTIM (“CSTIM”), to Navigant Consulting (Europe) Limited. 
(“Navigant Consulting”) and on 2 April the sale of CSTIM’s Jersey business was also completed and on 3 April the sale of 
SkillsHub completed.
CSTIM formed the largest part of Morse’s IMC business unit. The remaining parts of IMC were operated through majority 
owned subsidiary undertakings in France and Australia, small operations in South Africa and Luxembourg and a flexible 
resourcing business in the UK called SkillsHub. The South African and Luxembourg businesses have been closed down, the 
SkillsHub business has been sold and the majority stake held in the Australian business was disposed post year end. Terms 
have been agreed, subject to shareholder approval, for the sale of the majority stake held in the French business. A circular 
seeking shareholder approval will be sent in due course.
Consequently, the results of the IMC business unit have been reported as discontinued for the year ended 30 June 2009. 
As a result of the sale there was an impairment to goodwill and other intangible assets on Morse’s consolidated balance 
sheet, relating to the IMC business units, of £13.7 million arising from the sale and there was also a write down of the 
carrying value of the investment in Morse plc’s company balance sheet.

In the year ended 30 June 2008 adjustments were made to the opening cost of intangibles and goodwill to reclassify 
software assets previously reflected in property, plant and equipment, and to adjust for provisional management valuations of 
intangibles and goodwill made in the year ended 30 June 2007. The provisional valuations were in respect of the acquisitions 
of SkillsHub Limited and CSTIM France in that year. External valuations replaced the provisional estimates made by 
management resulting in an adjustment in the year ended 30 June 2008.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 75 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
13 Goodwill and other intangible fixed assets (continued)
The goodwill and intangibles impairment charge in the year ended 30 June 2009 relates to the impairment of goodwill 
(£13.6 million) and intangible assets (£0.1 million) in the Investment Management Consulting division (discontinued 
operations) which occurred because the goodwill could not be recouped on the sale of the businesses because of the 
depressed state of the consulting market and the likelihood of continuing trading losses. On the basis of fair value less costs 
to sell, the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles relating to this division is nil at 30 June 2009.
Other intangible assets total £3,229,000 (2008: £4,788,000). Other intangible assets acquired in the year ended 30 June 
2009 totalled £119,000 (2008: £183,000) and represent amounts arising on purchase of software. In the year ended 30 
June 2008 the intangible assets acquired represented mainly amounts arising on the acquisition of Xayce plc (customer 
relationship and maintenance contracts).
Impairment testing of goodwill
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to the cash generating units of Infrastructure Services 
& Technology UK, IS&T Spain, IS&T Ireland, Business Applications Services and IMC for impairment testing. These are the 
lowest level of CGU that can be reliably and separately identified and which management use to measure the business. 
During the year ended 30 June 2009, the carrying value of goodwill relating to the Investment Management Consulting 
division has been impaired in full because it has been classified as discontinued operations, and has been partly closed and 
partly sold.
The recoverable amounts of these cash generating units have been determined based on a value in use calculation. 
The Group has based these calculations on estimated cashflows in line with current market expectations over ten years 
(excluding a value in perpetuity) rather than five years plus a value to perpetuity as the current economic environment makes 
visibility of cash flows very problematic into perpetuity. The growth rates are based on management estimates of the industry 
growth rates for the activities being undertaken by each company represented by the investment, averaging 2.25% per 
annum for the IS&T businesses and 4% for Business Application Services. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections 
is based on management assessment of the weighted average cost of capital post-tax of 9.36% (13% pre-tax, 2008: 
13% pre-tax) and uses data from external sources. Management estimates the discount rate reflects the current market 
assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the business.
Based on the above, all the CGU’s generate value in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to them, giving them 
significant headroom. Accordingly, there is no impairment in any of the CGU’s within the continuing operations in the year 
ended 30 June 2009. 
The base case impairment tests are then subjected to a sensitivity analysis varying the growth rates, the WACC and 
cashflows including reducing growth rates to zero, increasing WACC to 14% (post tax) and reducing cashflows by up to 
25%.
The Business Applications Services goodwill would have been impaired by £2.0 million if the cash flows were reduced by 
15% and no growth was assumed for the entire 10 year period.
For continuing operations, future performance would have to deteriorate markedly for the value in use to fall below the 
carrying value.

Impairment testing of goodwill (continued)
The change in the carrying amounts of goodwill from 2008 to 2009 for the Business Applications Services business unit is 
due to the movement in deferred consideration during the year relating to the acquisition of Xayce plc.
The change in the carrying amounts of goodwill from 2008 to 2009 for the Investment Management Consulting business 
unit is due to the impairment during the year and the movement in deferred consideration during the year relating to the

14 Deferred tax (continued)
Deferred tax that relates to the same jurisdictions can be offset and has been presented on the balance sheet as a 
deferred tax liability of £nil (2008: £347,000). Other deferred tax balances are reflected on the balance sheet as an asset of 
£1,119,000 (2008: £1,005,000). The net deferred tax asset is £1,119,000 (2008: £658,000).
The Group anticipates sufficient profits to be made in the relevant geographic locations in order to utilise the deferred tax 
assets.
The total Group deferred tax profit and loss credit for the year is £735,000 and is split £833,000 credit for continuing 
businesses and £103,000 charge for discontinued operations.

17 Trade and other receivables (continued)
Provisions for bad debt are made on a monthly basis, for any doubtful debts where the cost can be reasonably estimated or 
is known. The management reviews on a monthly basis the level of old debts and receivables which are in dispute. Based on 
those reviews actions are taken to ensure collection of debt in a timely manner and appropriate provision is set up.
During the period, management made a change in estimate with their bad debt policy across all divisions, which provides 
100% for any specific uncollectable debt, 50% for debt overdue between 90 and 120 days and 100% for debt overdue 120 
days or more (see note 1).
Customer risk procedures include such activities as credit checks, payment history analysis and credit approval limits. Based 
on these procedures management assess the credit quality of those customers before engaging in transactions.
An analysis of the trade receivables provisions for bad debts for the periods is as follows:

During the year ended 30 June 2009, the Spanish business entered into a debt factoring arrangement to fund extended 
credit terms offered to a customer. Under the terms of the arrangement funds were advanced to the company by the factor 
and are repayable in line with the customer contract payment terms. At 30 June 2009 the group had liabilities of £748,000 
under this debtor factoring arrangement of which £455,000 is payable within one year, and £293,000 is payable in more than 
one year.

The property provision brought forward relates to properties previously vacated in the UK in prior periods. During the year 
ended 30 June 2009 further properties in the UK and Spain were vacated as part of the restructuring programme (see 
above). The provision is being utilised over the length of the leases. The property provision includes a dilapidations provision 
which has been increased in the year ended 30 June 2009 (see note 1), and is expected to be utilised as and when the 
various property leases expire.
The release of property provisions in the year reflects the remaining amounts no longer required for two properties:
(i) one property where the business has moved back into the property in July 2009 (previously an onerous lease provision 
was set up some years ago when the property was vacated); and 
(ii) a second property which was vacated in the first half of the year and an onerous lease provision set up, however, in July 
2009 has been re-occupied.
The restructuring provision relates to the Group initiative announced on 25 July 2008 which is mostly complete at 30 June 
2009. The provision relates mainly to redundancy costs payable at 30 June 2009. The provision is expected to be utilised 
within one year.
Contract losses relate to current loss-making contracts. The provision is expected to be utilised within one year.
Other relates to a provision against loss on disposal of the Group’s stakes in its businesses in Australia and France. The 
provision has been transferred to liabilities held for sale in the balance sheet.
Provisions have been discounted at a pre tax rate of 13% (2008: 13%). Morse plc Annual Report 2009 81 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

Ageing of the Group’s trade and other receivables is shown in note 17.
The majority of cash has been invested during the year in a number of Open Ended Investment Companies’ funds, operated 
by our bankers, which usually offer rates of return in excess of those that can be earned on the money market but which are 
considered by the Group to have a sound credit rating and therefore constitute a low risk. The remaining cash earns interest 
at market interest rates. Rates of interest earned during the year have been in the range 0.48% to 5.42%.
On 1 July 2009, to get better rates of return the Group invested £4,576,458 (2008: £473,925) of their surplus funds in Open 
Ended Investment Companies. The Group has same day access to these funds. 82 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

The figures in this table are based on undiscounted contractual obligations.
Loan notes of £122,000 that were outstanding at 30 June 2008 were all repaid during the year. Loan notes are disclosed 
within borrowings above.
Borrowings reflect debt factoring in the IS&T Spain business unit to finance extended credit terms offered to a customer. The 
Group’s banking facilities are discussed below. 
Financial instruments and risk management
The principal risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are capital risk, liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk, interest 
rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The management of these risks is discussed below.
Capital risk management
The Group’s approach to capital management is to ensure that it has a strong capital base to support the development 
of the business whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value. As part of this approach the Group endeavours to maintain 
a gross debt to EBITDA ratio well within its banking covenants and monitors net cash/debt and borrowings closely. The 
Group’s capital base is primarily utilised to finance its fixed assets and working capital requirements. Each business manages 
working capital in line with Group policies and the Group sets targets for the number of days targeted for trade receivables 
collection to ensure efficient capital usage.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group finances 
its operations through a mixture of retained profits, new equity, cash and the availability of a borrowing facility. The Group 
centrally manages its liquidity risk by focusing on the cash within the business and maintaining access to banking facilities. 
The objective is to provide efficient cash and tax management and cost effective core funding to operating businesses. Our 
cash balance is managed through the daily reporting of all group cash balances to senior finance personnel and through 
short-term cash flow forecasts focussing on the next 3 months receipts and payments. The Group does not trade in financial 
instruments.
The Group has a committed multi-currency revolving credit facility (‘‘RCF’’) with Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) which was 
used during the year but was not in use at 30 June 2009 and 30 June 2008. A non-utilisation fee of 1.00% of the available 
facility is payable for any facility not used and interest is charged at LIBOR plus 2.50%. The revolving credit facility has 
covenants that relate to it as follows:
l Gearing (Gross Borrowings to Shareholder funds);
l Interest cover (PBIT to Borrowing costs); and
l Leverage (Gross Borrowings to EBITDA).
In December 2008, the company renegotiated the covenant calculations to take account of a maximum of £6 million of cash 
restructuring costs during the year ended 30 June 2009 and a reduction in shareholders funds.  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 83 Morse plc Annual Report 2009
25 Financial instruments (continued)
Liquidity risk (continued)
The Group also has a multi-currency overdraft within a group pooling arrangement with RBS. Interest is charged at base rate 
plus 2.00%. 
During the year the Group had a EURO overdraft within a group pooling arrangement with Barclays which has been 
terminated post year end. The maximum overdraft limit for the pooling is A2,500,000 (2008: A2,500,000). Interest is charged 
at EURIBOR plus 0.75%. The Group has replaced this with a net nil EURO facility within a group pooling arrangement with 
RBS. No interest is receivable or payable on this facility. 
The RBS multi-currency RCF and multi-currency overdraft facility come up for renewal in March 2010. The company has 
concluded discussions with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc for the extension of the facilities based on financial projections. 
These projections show that due to the improved cash position within the Group and the continued focus on cash collection 
the Group only has need for smaller facilities in the coming twelve months. Consequently, the Board has extended the RCF 
to 31 March 2011 and this is a committed £6.5 million (previously £10 million) multi currency RCF, and a £1 million multi 
currency overdraft facility (previously £2.5 million) repayable upon demand. 
The IS&T Spain business has an overdraft facility of A500,000 (2008: nil). Interest is charged at EURIBOR + 2.00% with 
a minimum rate of 4.25%. The Spanish business also has access to customer specific funding through debt factoring 
arrangements with a number of financing institutions. IS&T Spain receives funds from the financing institutions which are then 
repaid as cash is received from the customer. Under these arrangements the limits on borrowing are A1.6m (with recourse 
agreement) and A3.5m (without recourse agreement). At 30 June 2009 the outstanding borrowings balance through the 
with recourse debt factoring agreement was £748,000 (2008: Nil). There was no borrowing on the without recourse debt 
factoring agreement.
Counterparty credit risk
This is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due. Credit risks are associated with deposits 
with banks and receivables from customers. The credit risk on trade receivables is heightened by the fact that the Group has 
a number of large customers from whom it receives significant proportions of its revenue. Although this represents a high 
level of customer concentration these customers are large blue chip companies who have developed a good relationship 
with Morse over the years and generally pay in line with agreed payment terms. The standing of these customers, as with 
all customers, is reviewed through credit checks, analysis of payment history and credit approval levels. One such large 
customer, Lehmans, did suffer financial failure during the year. See note 17 for further credit risk disclosures.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet 
date.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is mitigated as the Group places its cash with banks with high credit ratings 
assigned by international credit rating agencies. 
The table below shows the rating and the cash balances held by our major counterparties at 30 June 2009:

Interest rate risk
The Group’s cash and deposits are at floating interest rates. Borrowings and loan notes incur interest on a floating rate basis. 
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into. Management will continue to monitor this position to ensure 
that the interest rate risk profile is appropriate for the Group. At 30 June 2009 there were £748,000 (2008: nil) of outstanding 
borrowings at fixed rates of interest and are associated with the customer specific funding in Infrastructure Services and 
Technology in Spain. The interest incurred on the debt factoring arrangement of 7.67% is charged to the customer.

Currency and exchange rate risk management
The Group’s principal exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises on the translation of overseas net assets and results 
into sterling for accounting purposes. The overseas investments are not hedged by foreign currency borrowing, although 
the exposure created is regularly monitored but is very difficult to hedge because of the lack of cross-border cash flows. A 
proportion of the Group’s revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than Sterling (principally in Euros and US 
Dollars). In order to reduce the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the Group will try to purchase both 
goods and services in foreign currency to match the projected revenues in that trading currency. The Group also enters into 
forward contracts up to four months forward to reduce the exposure that arises on sales and purchases denominated in 
foreign currency. There are no forward contracts as at 30 June 2009.
The table below shows the Group’s principal currency exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses 
recognised in the profit and loss account. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the 
Group that are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating company involved.

Sensitivity analysis
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short term fluctuations on the Group’s 
earnings. Over the long term however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on 
the consolidated results.
A decrease/increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the results for the period. Similarly, a 
decrease/increase of 10% in the currencies that the Group has exposure to would not have a significant impact on the 
results for the period. The main currency impact arises from the translation of the results of the Infrastructure Services and 
Technology businesses in Ireland and Spain that are denominated in Euro’s. Based on a 10% decrease/increase in the Euro 
exchange rate versus £ sterling the reported profit before tax of £1.4 million (2008: loss of £6.5 million) would have changed 
by £130,000 (2008: £241,000).  Morse plc Annual Report 2009 85 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

27 Statement of changes in equity (continued)
The share capital issued at nominal value in the year relates to payment of contingent consideration totalling £0.1 million 
(891,711 shares) relating to previous acquisitions of Xayce plc, SkillsHub Limited and D&C Financial Consultants Ltd.
Share capital to be issued
In the year ended 30 June 2009, share capital to be issued decreased by £3.0 million, which is made up as follows:
l   £2.5 million arising from the acquisition of Xayce in September 2007. £0.35 million of shares issued in settlement of 
consideration due, £1.25 million now to be payable in cash and £0.9 million as a reduction in the value of contingent 
consideration;
l   £0.4 million revaluation of the remaining deferred consideration payable for the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited and D&C 
Financial Consultants Ltd; and
l   £0.1 million in relation to payment of deferred consideration relating to previous acquisitions SkillsHub Limited and D&C 
Financial Consultants Ltd.
The premium arising on the exercise of share options was £nil (2008: £23,000). On the exercise of share options, £nil (2008: 
£10,000) was received from employees.
Other reserves
The capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the Company’s capital following the purchase and cancellation of its own 
shares.
The other reserve related to share options and was set up in 1997, prior to the listing of the company. This reserve is no 
longer required and has been transferred to Retained Earnings.
The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial 
statements of foreign subsidiaries.
The merger reserve has arisen on the various acquisitions made by the Company over several years. During the year the 
disposal of the Investment Management Consulting business and the impairment of the parent company’s investment in 
its subsidiaries (see note iv) has triggered the transfer to the profit and loss reserve of a realised profit per section 9.44 of 
Tech 1/08. Following the transfer, the merger reserve has been fully utilised and the balance at 30 June 2009 is nil.
During the year, shares held by the various Employee Benefit Trusts as shown in note 5, have been consolidated into the 
results of the company. These are classified as Own shares in the statement of equity. Own shares were previously held 
within retained earnings, but have been classified separately in the current year resulting in the movement between reserves. 88 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

31 Acquisitions
There were no acquisitions in the year ended 30 June 2009.
During the year 711,236 shares were issued which settled £678,875 of the deferred consideration, in respect of the 
acquisition of Xayce plc, a company acquired in September 2007. Morse and the vendors of Xayce plc have negotiated 
settlement of the remaining deferred consideration at a value £1.25 million which will now be settled in cash over the period 
to 31 July 2011 (see note 21).
In the year ended 30 June 2008:
In September 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Xayce plc, a business change and 
transformation company. The transaction was to be satisfied by a net consideration of £6,400,000 over a period of three 
years, part of which was deferred consideration of £2.5 million settled by the issue of new ordinary shares.

The value of the assets and liabilities has been taken from the management accounts of Xayce plc as at 31 August 2007. 
Intangibles and the associated deferred tax liability represent fair value adjustments on acquisition. There are no further fair 
value adjustments made to the value of net assets acquired. The cash balance acquired was £617,000.
Xayce plc contributed net profit of £608,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year. If the acquisition had occurred on  
1 July 2007, Group revenue and net profit would not have changed materially.
The Group also acquired D&C Financial Consultants Ltd in April 2008, an investment management consulting company, for a 
total consideration of £237,000. 90 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

(i) Accounting policies
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK Accounting 
Standards. The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP . The 
accounting policies below cover items which are considered material in relation to the Company’s financial statements.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as 
part of these financial statements. The loss after taxation attributable to Morse plc for the year and dealt with in the financial 
statements of the Company was £88,110,000 (2008: profit of £3,940,000).
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Trade investments 
are held at cost less provision for any impairment in value. Impairment charges are recorded if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and are charged to the income statement.
Impairment
The Group has carried out an impairment review of the value of investments held in the Company. 
The recoverable amount of investments is the greater of their net realisable value and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash generating units. 
Associates and joint ventures 
An associate is an undertaking in which the Company has a long-term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting 
rights, and over which it exercises significant influence. A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Company has a long 
term interest and over which it exercises joint control.

The cash flows of the Company are included within the consolidated Group cash flow statement of Morse plc. 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Interests in own shares
Interests in own shares are accounted for in accordance with UITF abstract 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP trusts’ which requires 
the assets and liabilities of the Group’s ESOS trust to be recognised in the financial statements where there is de-facto 
control of those assets and liabilities. The Company’s own shares held in the ESOS trust are deducted from shareholders’ 
funds until they are transferred to employees. 
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future 
have occurred at the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as 
recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing 
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.

(i) Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D(b) of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and 
has not disclosed information required by that standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the 
Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Share based compensation
The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards are 
granted by the ultimate parent. Options granted under the Group’s share option schemes are equity settled. The expense 
arising on a grant by the parent company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings 
in the Group is treated as an expense of the company. 
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair 
value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled 
to the options. The fair value of market and non-market based options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, 
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. Charges to the income statement 
are reviewed each year to take account of service and non-market conditions. The amount recognised as an expense is 
adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest.
Dividends
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Group’s right to receive payment is established. Dividends payable to the 
Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders’ equity in the period in which the 
shareholders’ right to receive payment is established.
Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to sterling at the actual exchange rate at the time of the 
transaction or, where forward foreign currency contracts have been taken out, at contracted rates. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date. 
Cash
Cash comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.

The additions in the year ended 30 June 2009, represent the investment in Morse Overseas Holdings Ltd of £49,308,000 
and the investment in D&C Financial Consultants Ltd of £2,000. The investment in Morse Overseas Holdings Ltd. resulted 
from the conversion of the intercompany balance at 30 June 2009 into investments. The intercompany balance converted 
was made up of a gross amount of £49,308,000 and a provision of £4,783,000. Accordingly, when the investment was 
recognised in the accounts of the company a provision of £4,783,000 was also booked. 
Share based payments reflect the costs of share based payments which have been charged to the business units. The cost 
is allocated on the basis of the business unit which gets the benefit of the services of the employee for which share costs are 
incurred by the company.
The reductions to investment cost reflect the repayment of capital of £2,000,000 from ASMMC Limited (formerly CSTIM 
Limited) which has been treated as a deduction in the cost of the investment , £888,000 due to changes in deferred 
consideration on the acquisition of Xayce Limited (formerly Xayce plc) and £172,000 due to changes in the deferred 
consideration in D&C Financial Consulting Limited.
A detailed impairment review was carried out at the end of the year to assess the carrying value of the investments held 
by the company. In the year ended 30 June 2009 the provision for impairment increased by £100,194,000 and represents 
the write down of the investment in the Infrastructure Services & Technology UK business unit, Infrastructure Services & 
Technology Europe business units, Business Applications Services business unit, Investment Management Consulting 
business unit and the capital contributions made during the year.

(iv) Fixed asset investments (continued)
In the year ended 30 June 2008 the additions in investments represent the investment in Xayce plc of £6,400,000 and the 
investment in D&C Financial Consultants Ltd of £237,000.
In the year ended 30 June 2008 the impairment charge of £28,629,000 represented the write down of the investment in the 
Business Applications Services and Infrastructure Services & Technology UK business units.
Impairment testing of investment carrying values
In the light of the global economic situation, the decision to cease the operations of the Investment Management Consulting 
division and the initiation of a capital reduction process, the Group has carried out an impairment review on the value of 
investments held in the Company at 30 June 2009. The recoverable amounts of these investments have been determined 
by using a value in use valuation. The value in use calculations are done on a similar basis to that used in the impairment of 
goodwill calculation and are therefore subject to the same estimates by management.
The Group has based these calculations on estimated cashflows over 10 years rather than 5 years plus a value to perpetuity 
as the current economic environment makes visibility of cash flows very problematic into perpetuity. The growth rates 
are based on management estimates of the industry growth rates for the activities being undertaken by each company 
represented by the investment, averaging 2.25% per annum for the IS&T businesses and 4% for Business Application 
Services. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is based on management assessment of the weighted average 
cost of capital post-tax of 9.36% (13% pre-tax) and uses data from external sources. Management estimates the discount 
rate reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the business.
Based on the above assumptions, an impairment of £83.1 million in addition to the impairment of the IMC business is 
generated. 
The carrying value of the investment in the Investment Management Consulting business, which is classified under 
discontinued, is derived from the net asset balance which at the balance sheet date will remain within Morse and will not be 
included in the assets disposed. The impairment charge in the year in respect of the Investment Management Consulting 
business unit is £12.3 million. 
After the impairment the carrying value of investments in the Company’s balance sheet is £71.7 million. The carrying value 
of goodwill in the Group balance sheet is £28.6 million. Note 13 provides a summary of the carrying amount of goodwill 
by cash generating unit. The majority of this goodwill arose on the acquisitions of Diagonal plc (now part of the Business 
Applications Services business unit) and CSTIM Ltd (part of the Investment Management Consulting business unit). 
The Infrastructure Services and Technology (IS&T) businesses did not have a large goodwill value relative to investment value 
as a large part of the original business was not acquired (a part of IS&T UK was the original business Morse started up), had 
amortised goodwill prior to the introduction of IFRS in 2006 (part of IS&T UK, IS&T Spain and IS&T Ireland) or has had inter-
company loans capitalised (IS&T Spain and IS&T Ireland) into investment values on the Company’s balance sheet that do not 
impact goodwill. 96 Morse plc Annual Report 2009

(x) Statement of changes in equity (continued)
In the year ended 30 June 2009, share capital to be issued decreased by £3.0 million, which is made up as follows:
l   £2.5 million arising from the acquisition of Xayce in September 2007. £0.35 million of shares issued in settlement of

l   £0.4 million revaluation of the remaining deferred consideration payable for the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited and D&C 
Financial Consultants Ltd; and
l   £0.1 million in relation to payment of deferred consideration relating to previous acquisitions of SkillsHub Limited and 
D&C Financial Consultants Ltd.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, the share capital issued at nominal value in the year relates to the exercise of share options 
(35,535 shares, £3,000) and to the acquisition of Xayce plc (1,309,586 shares, £130,000). Share capital to be issued 
increased by £2,674,000 due to the deferred consideration on the acquisition of Xayce plc of £2,500,000 and D&C Financial 
Consultants Ltd of £174,000. Share capital to be issued of £348,000 (362,760 shares) as at 1 July 2007 related to the 
deferred consideration on the acquisition of SkillsHub Limited.
The premium arising on the exercise of share options was £nil (2008: £23,000). On the exercise of share options, £nil (2008: 
£10,000) was received from employees.
The capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the Company’s capital following the purchase and cancellation of its own 
shares.
The Other reserve related to share options and was set up in 1997, prior to the listing of the company. This reserve is no 
longer required and has been transferred to Retained Earnings.
During the year the carrying value of investments held in the Company’s balance sheet was substantially impaired (see note 
iv). Part of the impairment was transferred from the profit and loss account to the merger reserve, a reserve which has arisen 
on the acquisitions made by the company over the years. Following the allocation, the merger reserve has been fully utilised 
and the balance at 30 June 2009 is nil.
The increase in the merger reserve in the year ended 30 June 2008 of £1,119,000 was the share premium arising on the 
1,309,586 shares issued as consideration on acquisition of Xayce plc, which has been recognised in accordance with s131 
of Companies Act 1985. 
During the year, shares held by the various Employee Benefit Trusts as shown in note 5, have been consolidated into the 
results of the company. These are classified as Own shares in the statement of equity. Own shares were previously held 
within retained earnings, but have been classified separately in the current year resulting in the movement between reserves.

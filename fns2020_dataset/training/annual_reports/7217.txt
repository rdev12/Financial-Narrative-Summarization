Last year saw significant growth 
for HCL both through the
acquisition of RS Locums, and
strong organic growth across all
other divisions. The management
has successfully completed 
two further acquisitions in the 
first quarter of 2006, which will
enhance HCL’s ability to provide
medical and social care staff. 
The acquisitions will also extend
HCL’s ability to provide locum
General Practitioners, an area 
that the Company expects to
grow significantly over the next
twelve months. All acquisitions
have been fully integrated into
the HCL group, which continues
to operate from two call centre
sites, supported by four small
regional satellite offices.
HCL operates in an increasingly
regulated NHS market, and 
has recognised that this market 
has proved difficult for many
smaller companies lacking the
infrastructure to meet the needs 
of NHS contracts. HCL has
capitalised on this opportunity 
and in so doing has gained
market share. The Company has
also been working closely with 
the private sector, especially those
involved with the Government’s
Independent Sector Treatment
Centre Programme (ISTCs). HCL
is now involved in a number of
campaigns in support of private
sector providers to recruit both
permanent and locum staff 
to service the government’s 
ISTC contracts.
The Company has seen a shift
towards more permanent
placement requirements in both
the NHS and private sector, and
this has had a positive effect 
on the gross margins achieved
across the group. We anticipate
that this trend will continue into
2007 and for the foreseeable
future. HCL’s strategy is to remain
in the high margin niche specialist
healthcare and social care
markets operating mainly from 
its two call centre sites. This
approach will minimise costs and
maintain high net margins.
We expect that the market 
will continue to favour larger
operators. Healthcare Locums
whilst only in its third year of
trading, is already the third largest
specialist provider of healthcare
staff in the UK. It is also 
the fastest growing specialist
healthcare staffing company in 
the UK and it remains well
positioned in this market 
to meet the ever changing
needs of the NHS and private 
healthcare markets.

Chairman’s statement
I am delighted to announce the inaugural preliminary results for
Healthcare Locums PLC (HCL) for 2005 which are in line with our
expectations. HCL was successfully admitted to AIM in November
last year, and raised £15m of new money for the Company which
was used to reduce the Company’s financial gearing and put 
HCL in a strong position going forward into 2006. Healthcare Locums  5
Exceptional items – 
costs of listing and 
reorganisation costs
£0.4m has been charged as 
an exceptional item to the 
profit and loss account under 
the requirements of FRS 25
“Financial Instruments: 
Disclosure and presentation”.
FRS 25, which became effective
in 2005, requires costs incurred 
in listing a company to be
apportioned into two categories.
Those costs relating to listing
existing shares are to be
expensed to the profit and 
loss account whilst those costs 
relating to listing new shares 
and raising new funds are to 
be charged against the share
premium account. Prior to FRS 
25 all costs would have been
charged to the share premium
account. The new financial
reporting standard has no effect
on total shareholder funds and
has no impact on the future
profitability of the group.
Substantial reorganisation 
has taken place following the
acquisition of RS Locums. The
business operation has moved
into the Loughton call centre,
health and social care fields. 
It has established a strong place 
in the markets in which it operates,
and is the fastest growing
specialist health and social care
agency in the UK. Its focus now 
is to continue to grow organically
across all specialties, and to
continue to gain market share.
The private sector is a new and
emerging market for HCL, and 
we have established strong links
with many of the ISTCs, which we
hope to develop over the coming
months and years. Maintaining 
a diverse high margin, low cost
business model, which is reactive
to market changes, is key to
success in the current increasingly
regulated environment. HCL is
well positioned to capitalize on all
the opportunities presented in this
dynamic and changing market.
Ian Rosenblatt
Chairman
branches in London, Australia,
South Africa and Canada have
now been closed. The back 
office operation of RS has 
been incorporated into the HCL
infrastructure, and a significant
amount of costs have been
removed from the business. 
This has led to an exceptional
administrative expense of
approximately £1m in 2005. 
No further reorganisation costs 
are expected in 2006 from the 
RS business.
Cash flow and borrowings
Net borrowings at the end of 
the year were £10.9m, a gearing
ratio of 41%. The net funds
raised of £12.9m from listing 
on AIM in November 2005 were
substantially used to reduce the
levels of debt that had arisen 
to fund the acquisitions. 
Acquisitions
RS Locums was acquired in June
2005 for an initial consideration of
£4.5m with a potential maximum
earn out of £3.0m. This acquisition,
whilst complementing the Allied
Health and Medical divisions 
of Thames Medics and Eurosite
Medical, took the group into a
new market providing qualified
social workers. It is anticipated
that this will be a growth area for
the HCL business over the next
few years, and it is intended 
that the RS Social Care division 
will expand its offering outside 
of the London area, whilst
continuing to operate from the
Loughton site.
Earnings per share/dividend
Earnings per share prior to
goodwill amortisation, share
scheme charges and exceptional
items is 4p. The loss per share
after goodwill amortisation, share
scheme charges and exceptional
items is 5p. The Board is not
recommending a final dividend,
but does intend to implement a
dividend policy at the appropriate
stage in the Company’s
development. This will be
reviewed at the interim results.
Board
HCL has brought together a
strong team of non-executive
directors with a broad range of
experience in the city, commercial
and healthcare sectors.

Overview
The last year has seen significant
growth, development and change
for HCL, including the acquisition
of RS Locums and its integration
into the group, and the listing 
of HCL on AIM. The main
challenge for the group in 2005
was to achieve integration 
of systems and management
whilst maintaining strong organic 
growth in a dynamic and 
changing marketplace. 
HCL has now broadened its
product offering by acquiring in
early 2006, Medical and Social
Work Professionals, and BBL
Medical. The BBL Medical
acquisition gives the group a 
small but strategically important
place in the locum GP market.
All of our newly acquired
businesses have been successfully
integrated in line with our plans.
A significant achievement in 2005
was to gain accreditation for
Investors in People. As a people
business our investment in staff 
it is a key strength. We aim to
make HCL the Company of choice
for those working in the healthcare
recruitment sector. Our employee
rewards programme (VIP), share
option scheme, and quarterly
and annual awards are innovative,
market leading and encourage
loyalty and commitment from our
staff who are highly incentivised 
to achieve strong organic growth
for the group. We now have over
240 employees, most of whom
are based in our two call centres
in Wembley and Loughton.
Financial performance
HCL maintains a strategic 
mix between temporary and
permanent placements. The
temporary locum business
accounted for £42.9m of the
turnover at 21.5% gross margin.
In addition, £1m of permanent
placement sales improved 
the group’s gross margin to
23%. Whilst in 2005 permanent
placements accounted for 
just over 2% of total sales, we
envisage that this will grow to
nearer 4% of sales in 2006,
resulting in further gross margin
improvements.
The business split by turnover 
is as shown on the opposite page.
Allied Health Professionals
and Pharmacists
Allied Health Professionals* 
(AHPs) and Pharmacists
accounted for 63% of the HCL
business in 2005. The value 
of this market in the NHS in
the UK is worth approximately 
£350m and HCL has around 8% 
market share. HCL has recently
been awarded the latest NHS
Framework Agreement for Allied
Health Professionals and 
Health Science Service Staff,
which will run to 2009 and it 
is anticipated that HCL will
become a key supplier to this
contract. According to a recent
survey carried out by the NHS,
AHP vacancies are currently 
the most hard to fill vacancies 
in the NHS.
Increasing demand from the
private sector for both diagnostic
and surgical support staff has
meant that HCL now has a
significant number of contracts
with ISTCs and diagnostic
providers to source and supply
staff from outside the UK. This 
is a key driver in the anticipated
increase in permanent 
placements within the group. 
*Allied Health Professionals (AHPs) 
refers to a distinct grouping of 
highly trained, specialist staff who 
work within the healthcare sector.
This group includes therapists such 
as Physiotherapists, Occupational
Therapists, Speech and Language
Therapists, Dietitians, Podiatrists 
and Radiographers.

Doctors
Doctors accounted for 32% 
of the HCL business in 2005. 
With £14m turnover in this
specialty, HCL has approximately
3.5% of an NHS market that is
worth around £400m per annum. 
The addition of BBL medical 
will increase this market share 
to around 8%, but there remains
significant opportunity for growth
in this area.
Late 2005 saw the introduction of
the new NHS national framework
agreement for doctors. New
contracts have been negotiated
with the Trusts that have signed
up to this framework. HCL 
has been successful in gaining 
a substantial amount of new
business for Thames Medics.
However, the handover from the
old to the new contract saw a
slow down in the medical locum
market in the last quarter of 
2005. This trend has now started
to reverse in the first quarter of
2006 as the new contracts start
to impact positively on trading.
We anticipate synergistic benefits
as a result of the acquisition 
of BBL, who are a first 
tier supplier in a number of 
contracts where Thames Medics 
is the second tier supplier, and
vice versa. This will ensure 
that we are able to maximize 
the fill rates without recourse to
subcontracting outside of the
group. The fill rates, and 
therefore customer satisfaction 
will increase accordingly. 
ISTCs are increasingly a source 
of revenue for our doctors 
division both for permanent and
temporary placements. 
Social Workers
Social Work is a relatively new
business line for HCL, as it
was acquired with the acquisition 
of RS Locums, and accounted 
for only 5% of the HCL turnover
in 2005. RS Locums has
approximately 2.6% of a market
that is worth about £170m per
annum. RS Locums has historically
concentrated its efforts on
supplying staff in and around 
the South East of England, and
we have identified that there is 
a large market outside of this
geographical area, which for HCL
has largely remained untapped.
HCL has now developed 
a new specialist Business
Development Team for 
this sector, and we anticipate 
that this will lead to significant
expansion of this division 
over the next twelve months.
General Practitioners
The acquisition of BBL gives 
HCL approximately a 5% market
share in the locum GP market
which is worth circa £90m 
per annum. Due to the ageing
population, the shortages of 
GPs, the number of GPs who 
are due to retire over the next 
few years, and the increased
spending and focus by the NHS
on Primary Care, it is anticipated
that this specialty will present 
a substantial growth opportunity 
for HCL over the next few years.
BBL provides HCL with an
established position in the 
locum GP marketplace, on 
which it can build over the 
next twelve months. 
HCL currently provides 
GPs to out of hour services 
(run either by the NHS 
or the independent sector), 
NHS GP surgeries, and to the
increasing number of private 
GP providers in the UK.
International recruitment
Due to the rising demand for
specialist staff in the UK, and 
the shortages that exist, we 
have an increasing need to 
source staff from international
sources. We have therefore
developed an international
recruitment division, which now
employs seven staff dedicated to
recruiting, vetting, credentialing
and placing staff from abroad.
International staff currently
account for approximately 40% 
of the locum staff that we place.
As a result of the ‘additionality’
requirements, (i.e., staff working
on ISTC contracts cannot 
have worked within the NHS
for the last six months), we 
have a growing dependence on
attracting well qualified specialist
staff to the UK. 
Strong team. Incentivised sales.
Extensive resource pool. Higher margins.
1 Healthcare Locums  9
In order to achieve this HCL 
has developed a network 
of international recruitment agents
across the world: these agents 
are key to our success in bringing
staff into the UK from abroad.
As a result of our development 
of the international team, 
we have identified shortages 
of specialist staff in other parts 
of the world which we are being
asked to fill. This represents 
a new business opportunity for
HCL which we intend to pursue
during 2006.
Integration
At the heart of our success 
has been the smooth integration 
of newly acquired businesses 
into the HCL group. The
management’s strategy for
quickly introducing centralised
systems, procedures and financial
structures has supported 
both the businesses growth 
profile and reassured staff as
to future direction. 
All of the newly acquired
businesses are now utilising
the group’s dedicated IT systems 
and taking advantage of enhanced
central support functions such 
as HR, Business Development
and Marketing. This additional
support provides access to
immediate advantages and
opportunities, providing greater
scope for development and
earnings enhancement.
Delivering the strategy
HCL has within three years
developed into an established
provider of specialist staff 
to the health and social care 
sectors. It has put together
a senior, middle management, 
and recruitment team which 
we believe is unrivalled in 
the sector. It has achieved 
rapid and full integration of all
acquisitions made. We are now
well positioned to gain market
share from our competitors 
in each of the markets in which 
we operate. Whilst consolidation
opportunities remain, HCL has
focused in 2005 and early 2006
on the integration of acquisitions 
made, and placing the individual
businesses on a sound footing 
to maximise their potential for
strong organic growth.
The healthcare market is always
challenging, and changing. To
succeed in this sector requires
vision, the ability to be responsive,
a diverse offering with high
margins, and a low cost base.
HCL has these attributes at 
the core of its business model 
and we are confident of 
achieving further success 
in 2006.

Investment in staff through

as the employer of choice within
the industry. Recent awards of
Investors in People accreditation
and a national award for our 
staff incentive programme,
has further reinforced this, and 
the management are confident 
that this position will be further
enhanced in the coming year.
This has all been achieved within 
three years from a standing start.
Further organic growth, strategic
acquisitions and investment in
its people will enable HCL to
increase its market penetration
within the medical and social 
care sectors. The recent
acquisition of BBL Medical has
launched HCL into the locum
General Practitioner market, 
an area which is expected 
to see significant growth over 
the next few years.
HCL’s cross-sector strategy,
focusing on specialist niche
markets in health and social
care, continues to drive 
the business forward.

The Directors have recognised the opportunities that exist 
within the large but fragmented market that HCL operates in. 
They believe that the group has the potential to achieve further
significant growth in a market that is now worth over £1bn 
per annum in the public sector alone.
In 2005, the group invested
significant resources in developing
its international reach. The group
has established relationships 
with 23 international partners
across Europe, the Middle East,
Australia, New Zealand, the 
USA and Canada, providing
access to a pool of international
healthcare professionals with
highly prized transferable skills.
The Company believes that
demand for overseas professionals
will continue to grow due to
sustained shortages of suitably
qualified staff available within
the UK, and the need for 
private sector clients to comply
with additionality requirements. 
HCL’s experience within this 
field will deliver even greater
opportunities for the group. 
The market is consolidating 
as smaller operators find the
increasing regulations in this
market onerous. HCL has
outsourced its credentialing 
and verification of locum staff 
in order to increase efficiency 
and to reduce costs.
“The Nationwide Accreditation
Bureau provides an efficient,
independent and cost effective
method of vetting locum staff 
on behalf of HCL. This has
enabled HCL to concentrate 
staff on sales improvement, 
whilst significantly reducing 
their administrative burden.”
Kate Bleasdale CEO
Historically the group’s largest
customer has been the NHS.
However, with over £3.5bn
of contracts being tendered to 
the private sector over the next 
five years, we are increasingly
developing both permanent and
locum opportunities with private
providers of healthcare and
diagnostic services. Often these
contracts require staff to comply
with ‘additionality’ requirements,
which effectively require new staff
to be sourced from overseas.
HCL has developed strong links
with the Independent Sector
Treatment Centres (ISTCs) and
diagnostic providers. The group
believes that these contracts,
along with increased permanent
placement business, will result 
in gross margin improvement
across the business over the 
next few years.
Over £3.5 billion of contracts
are being tendered by the
government to the private
sector over the next 
five years. Our areas of

The HCL group’s business 
can be subdivided into four main
specialities, each of which 
are provided under one or more 
of the operating subsidiaries 
of the group.
Doctors
Doctors ranging from junior
grades to consultants are provided
from a number of subsidiaries
within the HCL group of companies.
Thames Medics, one of HCL’s
subsidiaries, sole focus is the
provision of hospital doctors 
and GPs. 
Thames has been appointed

Supply Agency’s (PaSA) National
Framework Agreement for the
Supply of Medical Locums and
also to private sector clients. Both
Eurosite Medical and RS Locums
also supply Doctors within their
operational mix, outside of this
National Framework Agreement.
The business currently focuses on
the provision of hospital doctors
with only a very small proportion
of this business resulting from 
the provision of GPs.
Social workers
The HCL group entered this
market during 2005, through the
strategic acquisition of RS Locums.
Strong progress has been made
with several major contract wins
predominantly in the South East.
The business mix is currently
weighted towards Qualified Social
Workers, with a growing cross
sector focus into the general
social care sector.

Allied Health 
Professionals
Allied Health Professionals 
(AHPs) include physiotherapists,
occupational therapists,
radiographers, medical scientists,
dieticians, and speech and language
therapists. These specialists 
are provided by Eurosite Medical 
and RS Locums operating 
within the NHS Procurement 
and Supply Agency National
Framework Agreement for
Allied Health Professionals and
also from Medical Technical
operating outside of this National
Framework Agreement.
Pharmacists
Healthcare Locums’ pharmacy
businesses supply Hospital
Pharmacists and Pharmacy
Technicians to NHS and private
clients across the UK. Operating
through Eurosite Medical and 
RS Locums on a predominantly
Locum basis this sector has
shown consistent growth over 
the last 12 months.
Analysis of business
between locum and
permanent placements
Historically the group has focused
on the provision of locum staff.
During 2005 significant
opportunities were identified
within the permanent placements
market, providing staff to the 
NHS and to the private sector.
The Department of Health’s
strategy of developing long term
partnerships with private 
sector providers, such as the
Independent Sector Treatment
Centres and outsourcing of
diagnostic services will create
further opportunities in this field,
particularly for the recruitment 
of overseas trained professionals.
These opportunities are anticipated
to continue to grow over the 
next few years.
Exceptional items
The total charge for the year of
£1.4m comprises reorganisation
and listing costs.
The exceptional items include 
a charge of £0.4m relating to
costs incurred during the listing 
of the Company on AIM during
November 2005 as required by
FRS 25 “Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and presentation”. 
FRS 25, which became effective 
in 2005, requires costs incurred
in listing a company to be
apportioned into two categories.
Those costs relating to listing
existing shares are to be
expensed to the profit and
loss account whilst those costs
relating to listing new shares 
and raising new funds are to 
be charged against the share
premium account. 
Prior to FRS 25 all costs would
have been charged to the share
premium account. The new
financial reporting standard has 
no effect on total shareholder
funds and has no impact on the
future profitability of the group.
The exceptional charge for the
year includes a charge of £1.0m
of reorganisation and restructuring
costs following the acquisition 
of RS Locums on 6 June 2005.
This acquisition is now fully
integrated into the group with 
no future reorganisation charges
anticipated from this acquisition.

The exceptional charge for the
previous period resulted from
restructuring following the
acquisition of Eurosite Medical 
in December 2003 and Thames
Medics in September 2003.
Goodwill
The goodwill charge of £1.2m 
for the year relates to the annual
amortisation of the goodwill
arising on the acquisitions of
Thames Medics in September
2003, Eurosite Medical in
December 2003, Medical
Technical in September 2004 
and RS Locums in June 2005.
Interest
The net interest payable for the
year of £1.5m compares to £0.5m
for the 5 months to 31 December
2004. Net interest was covered
2.1 times by operating profit
before exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation, compared
to 2.8 for the comparative period.
Dividends
No dividends have been proposed
or paid to the holders of ordinary
shares in either period.
Cash flows and net debt 
at the period end
During the year the net debt of 
the group has decreased from
£12.7m to £10.9m. The principal
factors affecting this were 
the increase in debt to fund 
the acquisition of Recruitment
Specialist Group Ltd in June 2005
and the listing on the Company
on AIM in November 2005 which
resulted in a net cash inflow of
£12.9m of new funds (after costs
of listing).
Banking facilities
Net debt at the year end
amounted to £10.9m resulting 
in a balance sheet gearing ratio 
of 41%.
Bank facilities totalling £13.7m
were arranged in November 
2005 following the listing of HCL
PLC on the Alternate Investment
Market of the London Stock
Exchange (AIM). 
The new facilities comprise 
a term loan of £7.5m repayable 
over 5 years plus an invoicing
discounting facility of up to 
£6.2m. These replaced a range 
of facilities that included bank
term loans, bank mezzanine
finance, an invoice discounting
facility and loan notes. 
Following the acquisition of
Medical Professionals and Social
Work Professionals in January
2006 and the acquisition of BBL
Medical in March 2006 additional
bank facilities have been arranged.
The total facility now available 
to the group comprises a term
loan of £15.5m and an invoice
discounting facility of up to £9.5m.
Financial instruments
The group’s financial instruments,
other than derivatives, comprise
borrowings, some cash and liquid
resources, and various items,
such as trade debtors, trade
creditors etc, that arise directly
from its operations. 
The main purpose of these
financial instruments is 
to raise finance for the group’s
operations. The group also
enters into derivatives transactions
(principally interest rate swaps).
The purpose of such transactions 
is to manage the interest rate 
risks arising from the group’s
operations and its sources 
of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the
period under review, the group’s
policy that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from 
the group’s financial instruments 
are interest rate risk. The Board 
reviews and agrees policies for
managing each of these risks
and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained
unchanged since the beginning 
of 2005.
The group finances its operations
through a mixture of retained
profits and bank borrowings.  Healthcare Locums  19
The group borrows in sterling 
at floating rates of interest and 
then uses interest rate swaps 
to generate the desired interest
profile and to manage the 
group’s exposure to interest 
rate fluctuations. 
Share capital
The ordinary share capital of the
Company at 31 December 2004
was £2.3m comprising 233.1m
shares of £0.01. In October 
2005 the share capital was
consolidated into 2.3m shares
of £0.10. In November 2005 
0.6m of ordinary shares of £0.10
were issued under terms of warrant
agreements. A further 27.3m
shares of £0.10 were issued in
November 2005 in respect of the
placing agreement for the listing of
the ordinary share capital on AIM. 
Thus by 31 December 2005 
the ordinary share capital of the
Company was £5.7m comprised
of 56.8m shares of £0.10.
As at 31 December 2004 there
were also 1.8m preference shares
of £1 each with a value of £1.8m.
These were all redeemed in
November 2005 on the listing 
of the ordinary share capital 
of the Company on AIM.
Shareholders’ funds
Shareholders’ funds increased
over the year by £10.8m to
£15.3m, compared to £4.5m 
at 31 December 2004.
Post balance sheet events
Since the year end the Company
has made two further acquisitions.
On the 31 January 2006 the
Company acquired the trading
businesses Medical Professionals
and Social Work Professionals 
for a consideration of £1.15m,
satisfied by £0.75m cash and
£0.4m shares in Healthcare
Locums PLC.
On the 10 March 2006 the
Company acquired the trading
business BBL Medical for a total
consideration of £10.5m. This 
was satisfied by an initial payment
of £5.0m in cash and £3.0m 
in shares in Healthcare Locums
PLC. Two further instalments, of
cash or shares at the Company’s
discretion, will be paid 12 and 
24 months following completion.
The first of these instalments 
will be for £1.0m and the 
second for £1.5m.

Corporate governance
Under the AIM listing rules 
the Company is not obliged
to implement the provisions of 
the Combined Code. However, 
the Company is committed to
applying the principles of good
governance contained in the
Combined Code as appropriate 
to a company of this size and
nature. The Board will continue 
to review compliance with the
Code at regular intervals.
The Company took a number 
of steps in November 2005 to
comply with the code, principally
by appointing Non-Executive
Directors to the Board and by
the establishment of three Board
committees. The Company has
appointed three Non-Executive
Directors including the Chairman
to bring an independent view 
to the Board and to provide a
balance to the Executive Directors.
Audit committee
This committee, consisting of 
Alan Walker and Ian Rosenblatt,
was established on 4 November
2005. The committee is chaired
by Alan Walker. It will meet 
at least twice a year and 
will be responsible for ensuring 
that the appropriate financial
reporting procedures are properly
maintained and reported on 
and for meeting the auditors 
and reviewing their reports 
relating to the group’s accounts
and internal control systems.
Remuneration committee
This committee, consisting of
Alasdair Liddell and Alan Walker,
was established on 4 November
2005. The committee is chaired
by Alasdair Liddell. It will meet 
at least twice a year and will
be responsible for reviewing the
performance of the Executive
Directors and other senior
executives and for determining
appropriate levels of remuneration.
Nomination committee
This committee, consisting 
of Ian Rosenblatt and Alasdair
Liddell, was established 
on 4 November 2005. The 
committee is chaired by Ian
Rosenblatt. The committee will
make recommendations on 
all new Board appointments. 26 Healthcare Locums
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the
Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial 
year which give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs 
of the group and Company 
and of the profit or loss of 
the group for that period. 
In preparing those financial
statements, the Directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting
policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgements and
estimates that are reasonable
and prudent; 
• state whether applicable
accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements
on a going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to
presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible 
for keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the
Company and to enable them 
to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the
group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Financial statements are
published on the group’s website 
in accordance with legislation 
in the United Kingdom governing
the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other
jurisdictions. The maintenance
and integrity of the group’s
website is the responsibility of 
the Directors. The Directors’
responsibility also extends to the
ongoing integrity of the financial
statements contained therein. Healthcare Locums  27
Report of the independent auditors
To the shareholders of Healthcare Locums PLC
We also report to you if, in 
our opinion, the Report of the
Directors is not consistent 
with the financial statements, 
if the Company has not kept
proper accounting records,
if we have not received all the
information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or 
if information specified by law
regarding Directors’ remuneration 
and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We read other information
contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is
consistent with the audited
financial statements. The other
information comprises only 
the Chairman’s statement, the 
Chief Executive’s Review, Case
studies, the Operating and
Financial Review, the Report 
of the Directors, the Report on
Remuneration and the report 
on Corporate Governance. We
consider the implications for 
our report if we become aware 
of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies 
with the financial statements. 
Our responsibilities do not 
extend to any other information.
Our report has been prepared
pursuant to the requirements
of the Companies Act 1985 and 
for no other purpose. No person 
is entitled to rely on this report
unless such a person is a 
person entitled to rely upon
this report by virtue of and for 
the purpose of the Companies 
Act 1985 or has been expressly 
authorised to do so by our 
prior written consent. 
Save as above, we do not 
accept responsibility for this
report to any other person 
or for any other purpose and 
we hereby expressly disclaim
any and all such liability.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit 
includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. 
It also includes an assessment 
of the significant estimates 
and judgements made by the
Directors in the preparation of 
the financial statements, and 
of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the 
group’s and the Company’s
circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed 
our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations
which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the
financial statements are free 
from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud 
or other irregularity or error. 
In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy 
of the presentation of information 
in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial
statements: 
• give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with United
Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of 
the state of the group’s and 
the parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2005 
and of the group’s loss for 
the year then ended; and 
• have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

Note 01  Accounting Policies
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost
convention and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 
The policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the preparation 
of the audited accounts for the 5 months ended 31 December 2004,
except that the group has adopted FRS 20 “share-based payments”,
FRS 21 “Events after the balance sheet date” and FRS 25 “Financial
instruments: disclosure and presentation” for the first time. The effect 
of adopting FRS 20 has been to reduce operating profit by £11,000. 
The adoption of FRS 21 and FRS 25 have had no effect on 
operating profit. 
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and all group undertakings made up 
to 31 December 2005.
The consolidated financial statements are accounted for under the
acquisition method of accounting.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of are included 
in the profit and loss account after or up to the date that control
passes respectively.
Turnover
Turnover represents sales to external customers at invoiced amounts
less value added tax or local taxes on sales.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual
values, of all tangible fixed assets, evenly over their expected useful
lives. It is calculated at the following rates:
Improvements to leasehold buildings – term of lease
Motor vehicles – 4 years
Office and computer equipment – 3 to 5 years
Valuation of investments
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the
consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the
separable net assets acquired) arising on consolidation in respect of 
acquisitions is capitalised. Goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual
instalments over its estimated useful life, normally 20 years.
The Directors carry out regular impairment reviews in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 11. Provisions for impairment are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
Knowledge database and brand development 
The cost of purchasing knowledge databases are capitalised at cost
and amortised over the estimated useful life, normally two years.
Brand development costs were previously capitalised and amortised
over the estimated useful life, normally three years. The Directors have
reviewed the nature of the costs previously capitalised as brand identity
costs, in the light of the requirements of FRS 10 “Goodwill and intangible
assets”. While the costs incurred are anticipated to bring future benefits
to the group, the Directors have concluded that they do not give rise to
an asset that qualifies to be capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
In consequence, the amount previously capitalised has been eliminated
from intangible assets. The adjustment has been reflected wholly in the
current year’s financial statements, as the impact of the elimination of
the intangible asset on the prior period’s results and financial position
was not fundamental in the context of the requirements of FRS 3
‘Reporting financial performance’.
The Directors carry out regular impairment reviews in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standard 11. Provisions for impairment are taken 
to the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences
that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except
that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that 
the Company anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future 
to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Leased assets
Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights
approximating to ownership (‘finance leases’), the assets are treated
as if they had been purchased outright. The amount capitalised is the
present value of the minimum lease payments payable during the lease
term. The corresponding leasing commitments are shown as amounts
payable to the lessor. Depreciation on the relevant assets is charged 
to the profit and loss account.
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest components
so that the interest element of the payment is charged to the profit and
loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding. The 
capital part reduces the amounts payable to the lessor.
All other leases are treated as operating leases. Their annual rentals 
are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease.
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2005 34 Healthcare Locums
Note 01  Accounting Policies continued
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the rates
ruling when they occurred. Foreign currency monetary assets and
liabilities are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet dates.
Any differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Share based employee remuneration
The group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan.
When share options are awarded to employees a charge is made to
the profit and loss account recognising the fair value of the employee
services received in exchange for the share options granted. There 
are no non-market vesting conditions, other than that the options lapse
should the employee leave the group. The total amount to be expensed
over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of 
the options granted as required by FRS 20 “share-based payments”.
In previous years the amount to be charged was based on the
difference between the market value of the Company’s shares at the
date of the grant and the option exercise price in accordance with
UITF 17 (revised 2003) “Employee share schemes”.
Under both standards the credit entry for this charge is taken to the
profit and loss reserve and reported in the reconciliation of movements 
in shareholders’ funds.
Pension costs
Contributions to the Company’s defined contribution pension scheme 
are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they
become payable. 
Financial instruments
In relation to the disclosures made in note 19:
• Short term debtors and creditors are not treated as financial 
assets or financial liabilities;
• The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments 
for trading purposes; and
• The group does not conduct any transactions in foreign currencies 
and therefore does not need to use foreign exchange related 
financial instruments.
Note 02  Turnover
Turnover is wholly attributable to the principal activity of the Company
and arises solely within the United Kingdom.

£410,000 has been charged as an exceptional item to the profit and
loss account under the requirements of FRS25 “Financial Instruments:

The loss after tax for the period dealt with in the accounts of the
Company amounts to £182,000 (2004: profit £466,000). As allowed 
by the provisions of Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the
Company has not published its own profit and loss account.
Note 11  Earnings/(Loss) per Share
Basic loss per share has been calculated on the loss for the period to 
31 December 2005: £1,497,000 (31 December 2004: £196,000) using
weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares in issue at December 
2005: 27,442,392 (December 2004: 23,312,883).
Diluted loss per share has been calculated using the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue diluted for the effect of share options.
The diluted weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares for the 
period ended 31 December 2005 is 28,699,263 (December 2004:
23,779,141).

The Directors have reviewed the nature of the costs previously
capitalised as brand identity costs, in the light of the requirements of
FRS 10 “Goodwill and intangible assets”. While the costs incurred are
anticipated to bring future benefits to the group, the Directors have
concluded that they do not give rise to an asset that qualifies to be
capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
In consequence, the amount previously capitalised has been eliminated
from intangible assets.
The adjustment has been reflected wholly in the current year’s financial
statements, as the impact of the elimination of the intangible asset on
the prior period’s results and financial position was not fundamental in
the context of the requirements of FRS 3 “Reporting financial
performance”.
This adjustment is reflected in the financial statements for the
consolidated group and for the Company.

The maximum potential deferred consideration that could have been
paid on the acquisition of Recruitment Specialist Group Limited was
£3,011,000 potential earn out payments. The amount payable under 
the earn out was dependent on the gross profit earned by Recruitment
Specialist Group Limited over the two year period to 6 June 2007. The
deferred consideration included within these financial statements has
been based upon the audited financial statements of Recruitment
Specialist Group Limited for the period to 31 December 2005 and
forecasts for the future to enable an estimate to be made of the earn 
out that will be payable. 40 Healthcare Locums

The bank loans are with the group’s bankers, Barclays Bank Plc, 
and are repayable by instalments over the period to November 2009.
The bank loan is secured by a floating charge over the assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries.
The hire purchase contracts and finance leases are secured on the
assets to which they relate.
The deferred consideration arose on the acquisition of Eurosite 
Medical Limited and Recruitment Specialist Group Limited and is
payable in 2006 and 2007.
Note 19  Financial Instruments
The group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank term 
loans, bank overdraft facilities, invoice discounting facilities and cash.  
All of the group activities are conducted in sterling and as such no
currency risk exists.
Under the terms of the loan facilities of the group taken out in 2003 
and renegotiated in June 2005 and November 2005, the group is
exposed to interest rate risks from any movements in the LIBOR 
rate. Interest rate risk is managed through interest rate derivatives
which cap the group’s exposure to interest rate increases. The group
purchased an interest rate swap financial instrument in December 
2003 that protected £10m of borrowings against upward movements 
in the LIBOR rate above 6% but exposed the group to charges 
should the LIBOR rate fall below the floor specified in the agreement 
of 3.9%. This agreement was cancelled in July 2005 and replaced 
by a similar agreement that protects £7.8m of borrowings (amortising
across the lifetime of the loans) with an upper cap effective on a 
LIBOR rate of above 5.5% and a lower collar effective on a LIBOR 
rate of below 4.46%.

Note 20  Share Capital continued
‘A’ and ‘B’ preference shares did not carry any voting rights.
‘A’ preference shares had a right to a dividend of 5p per ‘A’ share for 
the year ended 30 November 2004, 7.5p per ‘A’ share for year ended
30 November 2005, 10p per ‘A’ share for the year ended 30 November
2006, 12.5p per ‘A’ share for the year ended 30 November 2007, 15p
per ‘A’ share for each year thereafter. ‘B’ preference shares had a right
to a dividend of 2% per annum above base rate for the years ended 
30 November 2007 and November 2008, then 5% per annum above
base rate for each year thereafter.
The Company had the right to redeem the ‘A’ and ‘B’ preference shares
at any time after issue of written notice and had to redeem all ‘A’ and 
‘B’ preference shares still in issue on 30 November 2008 or on an Exit 
if earlier. On redemption the Company had to pay the shareholder £1 
for each ‘A’ preference share or ‘B’ preference share held.
On a return of assets on liquidation, reduction of capital or otherwise,
the preference shareholders would have received first any accrued and
unpaid dividends and second an amount equal to the paid up value of
the preference shares prior to any distribution to ordinary shareholders.
All preference shares were redeemed on 17 November 2005 when 
the ordinary shares of the Company were listed on AIM.
On 1 January 2005 both ‘A’ and ‘B’ preference shares were reclassified 
as creditors in accordance with FRS 25 “Financial Instruments:
Disclosure and presentation”.
Note 21  Adoption of FRS 25 Financial
Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation
In accordance with the requirements of FRS 25, redeemable preference
shares previously included within share capital have been reclassified 
as liabilities. As a result of this reclassification, amounts paid which 
were previously included within dividend payments are now disclosed
as interest expense.
Both the group and the Company have taken advantage of the
exemption in FRS 25 from the requirement to restate comparative
information and have instead restated the amounts included in these
financial statements as at 1 January 2005.
The impact of the adoption of FRS 25 on the current year profit and 
loss account is to increase interest expense by £48,000 for both the
group and the Company.
The main effect of the primary financial statements in the comparative
period had the requirements of FRS 25 been applied retrospectively 
to that year would have been similar to the adjustments that have been
made in the current year, with the increase to the interest expense for
both the group and Company amounting to £28,000.

The final dividend paid in 2004 was of £0.04 per ‘A’ preference shares. 
A final dividend was paid in 2005 on the ‘A’ preference shares but 
in accordance with FRS 25 “Financial Instruments: Disclosure and
presentation” this charge has been classified within interest paid
in note 8. 
No dividends are proposed for ordinary shares in 2005.
Note 24  Contingent Liabilities
In November 2005, group bank facilities totalling £13.7m were 
arranged with the Company’s bankers Barclays Bank Plc. These
replace a range of facilities which had existed within the businesses. 
The bank loan facility is shown on the balance sheet of the Company 
and is secured against the assets of the entire group. The Company 
has guaranteed bank borrowings of its subsidiaries.

year. The fair value of options granted during the year determined using
the Black Scholes valuation model was £328,000. The significant inputs
into the model were a share price of 40p, exercise price as in the table
above, standard deviation of expected share price of 56%, option life
disclosed in the table above, dividend yield of nil, and annual risk-free
interest rate of 4.5%. The volatility measured at the annualised standard
deviation of daily changes in share price is based on statistical analysis
of daily share prices of comparable companies between September
2001 and June 2005. 48 Healthcare Locums

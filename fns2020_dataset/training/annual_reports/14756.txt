2009 has been another year
of good progress. W e are absolutely
focused on delivering products that
delight our customers and meet the
changing needs of all ages around
the world. 
At SSL we have the people,
vision and strategy to achieve 
that. Mindful of today’s business
challenges, but confident in our
growth opportunities, we are
building for sustained success.
The Chief Executive’s review and certain other sections of the Annual
Report contain forward looking statements that are subject to factors
associated with, amongst other matters, the economic and business
circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries and sectors 
in which the Group operates. It is believed that the expectations
reflected in these statements are reasonable but they may be affected
by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results to differ
materially from those anticipated at the date of the Annual Report. 31/03/09 31/03/08

Highlights Durex has been making condoms of the highest
quality for 80 years and continues to strengthen 
its position as global market leader . In recent years,
the brand has been expanded to provide products
such as lubricants and vibrators that are designed to
enhance consumers’ sex lives and sexual wellbeing.
Durex condoms
With about 35 per cent value share of the global branded
condom market, making it the number one condom brand
in the world, Durex condom sales continue to perform
strongly in all markets with global sales growth for the year
2008/09 at 5.5 per cent (in 2008 Durex sales grew at twice
the rate of its major competitors). 
Durex Play lubricants
A key part of the Durex brand, our range of lubricants 
has been extended this year to include Durex Play O, 
a stimulating gel for women. Durex Play 2in1 Massage
Mousse and Durex Play 2in1 Massage Melts have been
successfully rolled out across global markets.
Durex Play vibrators
Our range of personal vibrators is designed to help
people have happier, healthier and more fulfilling sex 
lives. Our most recent addition is the Durex Pure Fantasy,
which is designed as a sleek, gimmick-free product.
Through in-depth consumer insight with an
innovative approach to foot health and wellbeing,
grounded in science and knowledge of the
mechanics of the foot, the Scholl footcare range
addresses five key types of foot conditions to help
people improve their overall comfort and wellbeing.
Foot skin conditions
For conditions such as dry, hard and cracked skin, corn,
callus and blister, the product range includes Scholl Cracked
Heel Repair Cream (with a new formulation which contains
Active Repair K+ for stimulating skin cell regrowth), Scholl
Deep Moisturising Cream and Scholl Clear Gel Blister and
Corn Plasters.
Musculoskeletal conditions
Caused by inherent malfunctions in the feet and body 
– for example, arch problems and heel pain. Products 
include Scholl Party Feet and the recently launched 
Scholl Biomechanics range.
Foot environment conditions
Caused by body functions or activities – odour, hot and
cold feet, as well as tired and aching feet. The product
range includes the newly launched Scholl Deo-Activ Fresh,
part of our odour control range, and Scholl Flight Socks.
Virus and fungus conditions
For conditions such as warts, verrucas and athletes’ 
foot, the product range includes Scholl Freeze Verruca 
& Wart Remover and Scholl Athletes Foot Cream.
Nail conditions
Discoloured toenails is a problem addressed by Scholl Nail
Brightening System/Perfect Nail T reatment, a revolutionary
product with a three step approach to reducing
discolouration, smoothing and conditioning toenails.

GERALD CORBETT growing sales,
increasing earnings,   
generating cash
“
Our strategy of investing in our core brands of Durex 
and Scholl and expanding internationally, whilst tightly
controlling costs, continues to move the Company
forwards. This has been another year of outperformance
against our stated targets, despite the challenging
consumer environment. We see further opportunities 
for growth, both organically, through Durex and Scholl and
from our acquisitions, particularly in Russia and the CIS.
We have benefited from the weakness of Sterling
which has enhanced our foreign earnings, but have still
achieved good organic growth. Underlying sales growth was
6.4 per cent (2008: 6.9 per cent) with growth in each of the
three major categories, Durex, Scholl Footcare and Scholl
Footwear. Operating profit growth again beat our double
digit growth target, increasing by 31.4 per cent before one-
off charges in the prior year (2008: 25.4 per cent). Earnings
per share grew by 35.9 per cent to 28.0 pence.
Dividends
The Directors recommend an increase in the final 
dividend of  20.8 per cent to 6.4 pence per ordinary 
share, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) on 23 July 2009, will 
be paid on 3 September 2009 to shareholders on the

”
register on 7 August 2009. This will make a total dividend 
of 9.0 pence per ordinary share (2008: 7 .6 pence), 
an increase of 18.4 per cent. This dividend is covered 
three times by earnings and is underpinned by another
good year of cash flow. 
Board of Directors
Peter Johnson joined the Board as a Non-Executive
Director on 1 October 2008. He has huge experience of
running international businesses and has immediately
made a positive contribution to the Board’s deliberations.
Anna Catalano stepped down as a Non-Executive Director 
on 11 November 2008. I would like to thank Anna for her 
efforts and contribution during her time on the Board.
Outlook 
Whilst the outlook remains challenging, the new financial
year has begun in line with our expectations. By growing
sales of our brands through innovation, exploiting the
opportunities created by our acquisitions and continuing
to control our costs, we are aiming at a target of growing
earnings per share by at least 50% over the next three 
years–to March 2012. We have a strong balance sheet and
an experienced management team to take advantage of
opportunities around the world.
The achievements of the last year have been
possible only through the continuing considerable hard
work and commitment of our employees. On behalf of 
the Board, I would like to thank them.

operating
profit
growth
Before one-off charges in 2007/08 SSL has achieved its financial targets 
for the past three years – you must be pleased.
I am delighted with the progress we have made. Our target
was to achieve double digit operating profit growth in each
of the three years until 2008/09, and we have achieved
that comfortably in difficult trading conditions. A testament
to the strength of our brands, our continued investment 
in innovation to bring new products to market, our ongoing
ability to control costs, and astute investment in future
growth opportunities.
Y ou have set new targets. How 
confident are you of meeting them in the current
economic downturn?
We believe we are well positioned to build on our strong
operating and financial platforms. Our core brands, Durex
and Scholl, continue to meet consumer needs regularly
bringing new products to the market. The restructuring 
of our supply chain over the past few years has improved
efficiency and is increasing capacity; and our increased
presence in emerging consumer markets provides real
opportunities for long-term growth. Of course, we
acknowledge and understand that we are operating in 
one of the toughest recessions in living memory – but 
we remain optimistic. Many sectors within the personal
care market are comparatively resilient to the current
economic climate, we have limited exposure to the
American consumer market, and our ongoing investment
in training and staff development is producing some
outstanding individual and team performances.
Y our new condom factory in China opens in
July 2009. How will this and other developments to
your operating platform contribute to sales growth?
Our new factory in Qingdao, China will enable us to scale 
up condom production for supply to the Chinese domestic
consumer market and our planned expansion into Russia
and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
In addition, we have invested in our condom factory 
in Thailand, to increase global productivity and flexibility.
New, state-of-the-art facilities at our Peterlee factory 
in the United Kingdom will support growth of our
pharmaceutical products.
SSL recently gave notice to exercise its 
option to increase its stake in the company that
owns Contex, which is sold in Russia and the CIS.
What role does this and other acquisitions have 
for the business?
We have said for some time now that organic growth 
of the business will be supplemented by key acquisitions 
– either of products to develop our brand portfolios, or 
of businesses to gain exposure to new consumers and
markets. In April this year, we gave notice to exercise our
option to increase our stake, from 15.5 per cent to 50 per
cent plus one share, in BLBV, the company that distributes
the Contex condom brand in Russia, as well as exercising
the option to acquire the company that distributes Contex
in Ukraine. We have a final option to buy the remaining
shares of BLBV to take us to 100 per cent ownership, 
which is likely to be exercised in February 2010.
W e have been delighted with our initial investment
in BLBV, and the underlying performance of the business 
has been in line with our expectations. We believe that the
Contex brand, backed by excellent distribution across the
region to a growing number of consumers, has the potential
to take SSL to a new level of success.
This year has also seen us acquire the Swiss
condom brand Crest, the number two brand in that
country with a market share of 32 per cent.
It has been another good year for Scholl
Footcare. What is driving the brand’s strong
performance?
There are a number of factors. The innovation team,
working in partnership with foot experts, healthcare

margin
>>
sales 
growth professionals and research institutes, have an in-depth
understanding of consumer needs and how to meet them.
New product development is quick to the market, and
backed by marketing and advertising campaigns that not
only position products effectively but also educate users
on their key benefits. This year, Scholl Deo-Activ Fresh, a
deodorising footspray that kills 99 per cent of the bacteria
known to cause foot odour, has been launched successfully,
while Scholl Perfect Nail T reatment/Nail Brightening System
continues to sell well across key markets. Our acquisition 
of Orthaheel in late 2007 has now been integrated into the
footcare portfolio, and is performing well for us. 
What are your plans for Durex?
T o continue delivering consistent sales growth across 
the brand’s product categories and commercial regions,
and look for opportunities to bring new products to our
consumers. This year has seen the successful launch of
Durex Play O, a gel that helps women orgasm more easily , the
extension of our Durex Play 2in1 Massage range, and steady
growth in condom sales. The market for Durex products
remains buoyant despite the credit crunch, and we expect
this year to be another year of success for the brand.
Y ou appear to be a business on the move 
– how do you ensure that staff are aligned with the
group’s wider strategic objectives?
This is a subject we take very seriously. SSL continues to
invest in its employees’ training and development, and strives
to create a positive and supportive working environment
that fosters strong performance and entrepreneurial flair.
We also want our staff to understand what the business as
a whole is trying to achieve and, crucially, their part in helping
it to meet its objectives. Our internal communications,
employee development initiatives and working culture 
are all structured with this in mind.

Strategy and priorities
14 / 15 //////////  Business review / Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
Our strategy
We aim to exploit the economic potential of both 
our brand portfolio and our global operating assets 
by focusing on:
// 
Consumer insight-led innovation 
innovation is central to SSL ’s growth strategy.
// 
Cutting edge advertising
supporting the launch of new products by investing 
in effective and targeted marketing and advertising 
is a key part of the success of our brands, raising
consumer awareness and driving retail distribution.
// 
Efficient business practices
improving business processes throughout all areas 
of the business will help ensure that we meet the 
needs of our customers whilst controlling costs.
// 
Training and development of our people
SSL ’s employees are one of our greatest assets and
through continued development programmes we 
aim to strengthen the expertise across our business.
Our priorities
// 
Innovation in the brands
A key growth driver is innovation. The speed at which 
we can develop innovative, quality products, is crucial 
to the future growth and success of the business. 
// 
Integration of Russian and Ukrainian businesses
Another key factor in meeting our new financial target 
is the successful integration of these businesses into
the Group.
We have already begun this process and have been
successfully supplying Contex condoms for more 
than 12 months. However, there are still considerable
challenges to ensure that these new businesses feel 
a part of SSL and contribute effectively to the growth 
of the Group.
Our values
We are committed to our vision that SSL should 
become and remain:
// 
Successful
//
Socially responsible
// 
Lively
This will be achieved through the application of our ABC
operating principles (Attitude-Behaviour-Culture). Our
ABC operating principles outline ways of working, adopted
throughout our whole organisation, which will help us
achieve our business objectives and our vision for SSL.
Our financial target
For the three years to March 2012 to grow earnings per
share by at least 50 per cent.

* Brand contribution is defined as sales less cost of sales, market

SSL ’s products reach far and wide across the
personal care and footwear sectors, enriching
consumers lives every day. Our core brands, Durex
and Scholl, help people enjoy more satisfying sex
lives, keep their nails and feet healthy, and offer
comfortable and stylish shoes that help posture. 
Our local brand portfolio includes an analgesic 
range in the UK (Cuprofen, Syndol and Paramol), 
Full Marks (the leading headlice product), the Mister
Baby range in Southern Europe (for when a baby 
is born) and the Sauber hosiery and toiletry range.
Our sales growth is underpinned by consumer
insight, innovation in new products and effective
advertising, generating funds for investment and
driving operating profit. The Group’s commitment
to its consumers means that the business has
performed well this year despite the ongoing
economic downturn – so let us look in detail at 
our key areas of achievement:
Durex
Durex has a simple brand strategy, to help consumers enjoy
more satisfying sex lives, and this year has consolidated its
position as the number one sexual wellbeing brand. Our
three categories – condoms, lubricants and devices – have
delivered steady growth across our commercial markets,
with a number of notable highlights. The launch of Durex
Play O, a stimulating gel for women, has enjoyed strong
initial sales, supported by a highly memorable advertising

Durex Play O
Launched at the beginning of

Scholl Deo-Activ Fresh
The recently launched Scholl Deo-
Activ Fresh is a perfect example 
of how the Scholl brand matches
innovation with consumer needs. 
A deodorising footspray that instantly
kills bacteria known to cause foot
odour, it will further enhance the
brand’s footcare offering.
relationships with third parties, such as Salford University’s
Centre for Rehabilitation and Human Performance
Research, one of the world’s leading bodies in podiatry. 
This long-term alliance matches the University’s expertise
and knowledge of feet with Scholl’s in-depth understanding 
of consumer needs and how to meet them. It allows us to
grow the brand, invest in innovation and make foot science
more accessible and relevant to consumers.
A key recent addition to our footcare portfolio 
is the Orthaheel brand and technology – state of the art
orthotic insoles that correct foot alignment and relieve 
heel and knee pain. Drawing on this expertise a new Scholl
Biomechanics range has been successfully rolled out this
year across our global markets and will be key to unifying
our Scholl footcare and footwear brands in the minds of
consumers. Scholl Biomechanics with Orthaheel technology ,
like many Scholl footcare products, is targeting a market
that has real growth potential, and by advertising and
educating consumers to its benefits should generate and
sustain strong, long-term sales.
Scholl footwear
The past year has seen the Scholl footwear business
maintain its position as the market leader in European
pharmacies, while using its technological expertise and
appreciation of style and fashion to begin to increase
distribution in the mainstream foot trade channel.
Our consumer research shows that people have
five basic needs for comfort in footwear – shock absorption,
anatomy and ergonomics, exercise effect, massage
benefits and lightness – and are the basis for innovative
new designs that are starting to reach consumers. The
Scholl Bioprint sandal, for instance, concentrates on
anatomy and ergonomics to make walking easier and 
help the foot support itself naturally. 
Consumer demand for footwear that brings
exceptional massage benefits is being answered with the
launch this year of the LiquiMassage range. Pronounced wavy
ridges on the footbed are covered with ultra-thin membrane
campaign. A full roll out across our remaining European and
Asia Pacific markets has been scheduled for this fiscal year.
We have also extended our Durex Play 2in1
Massage range to include Durex Play 2in1 Massage Mousse
and Durex Play 2in1 Massage Melts. Consumer insight from
the Durex Sexual Wellbeing Global Survey demonstrated
that both men and women enjoy the benefits of massage
and frequently incorporate it into their sex lives. These
products have been launched with that in mind, and are
further evidence of Durex’s commitment to excitement
and variety in bedrooms across the world. 
Durex condoms are the world leader; we continue
to deliver steady growth both from existing and new markets
– a trend we believe can continue even in the current
economic climate, as we leverage both our category
knowledge and expanding geographical reach. This year we
have launched our thinnest ever latex condom in the USA
and across a number of our Asia Pacific markets, including
T aiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. The condom provides
enhanced sensitivity and is already very successful in 
Hong Kong and Australia.
Scholl footcare
Scholl too is a world-leading brand in footcare. Our success
over the past year comes from three key areas: strong 
sales growth from core products; a healthy new product
development pipeline; and the acquisition of an innovative
technology that is opening up a new consumer market. 
Scholl Nail Brightening System/Perfect Nail
T reatment is becoming a great success in markets across
Europe, while Scholl Party F eet also continues to perform
strongly in European markets. This year has also seen the
launch of a new Scholl Cracked Heel Repair Cream K+
which contains the regenerative agent, Keratin, to stimulate
skin cell regrowth – and the Scholl Cracked Heel ProFile. 
Our latest innovation uses a novel technology . 
The recently launched Deo-Activ Fresh, developed by the
Scholl Innovation team, kills bacteria known to cause foot
odour . Our research efforts also encompass important
*
new 
product pads of lubricating fluid that allow the foot to be massaged
to stimulate blood circulation and relieve tiredness.
Advances in footwear technology act as core
design benefits that can be incorporated across the whole
footwear range. Thus comfort and foot wellbeing marry
perfectly with style and fashion in products such as the latest
range of Scholl Pescura exercise sandal and the Scholl by
Dolcini range. Such products are destined for department
stores and retail outlets where the opportunities for brand
growth are huge. This is an area of major focus as we build
our distribution capability in many countries across Europe.
Locally owned brands
Locally owned brands such as Full Marks, Syndol, Paramol
and Mister Baby are sold in specific countries – chiefly
the UK, Italy and Spain. They play an important role in
achieving operating profit objectives, and there have been
exciting developments over the past 12 months. Full Marks
was launched in Spain this year, where the market for
pesticide-free products is growing. Italian brand Mister Baby
has welcomed new products to its portfolio – most notably
a new breastfeeding range called Mamma Nature. Also in
Italy, Sauber, a well established brand for deodorants and
compression hosiery, is selling the Sonno-Benefit pillow,
which helps people achieve a better quality night’s sleep.

SSL International is a brand-led company managed
from the Group’s main UK operational centre in
Manchester . We manage our commercial operations
on a geographic basis: in the UK and Europe; Asia
Pacific; and the Americas. These regions account 
for 76 per cent, 19 per cent and 5 per cent of our sales
respectively. Durex and Scholl products are sold in
all European markets, while locally owned brands
complement our core offering mainly in the UK, 
Italy and Spain. T otal sales in this region was 
£488.2 million. Some 1,325 employees are engaged 
in commercial functions across this region, and
recent investment to expand geographically is set 
to grow the European commercial division further 
as we begin to expand both Durex and Scholl into
new territories across Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Our Asia Pacific division, with 830 employees, is
engaged in commercial functions over a vast geographical
area – from Japan and China in the north, to Australia 
and New Zealand in the south. Sales for 2008/09 was
£120.5 million. The major markets are Australia, China,
Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand. Durex and Scholl are sold
across the region, with sales of these supported by some
locally owned brands – such as Woodwards Gripe Water,
which is popular among consumers in Hong Kong and
Thailand. The expanding Chinese consumer market, whilst 
affected by current economic conditions, is a significant
opportunity for SSL. The buy-out of our joint venture
partner two years ago and the development of our own
local commercial team, working with a local distributor
network, leaves the business well placed to take advantage
of current and future opportunities for growth.
Sales in the Americas, where SSL owns the 
Durex brand, for 2008/09 was £33.7 million, or 5 per cent 
of overall turnover. Fifty employees, based in Atlanta, 
USA and Canada, are engaged in commercial functions.

communicate externally by brand.

Durex
Much has been made in the national and business 
media about Durex’s apparent trading resilience during
the current recession. With steady growth in the core
condom category and successful uptake of new product
launches in our Play category, we believe that consumers
will continue to spend money on products that enhance
their sex lives. And with Durex Play O, our new gel that
helps women orgasm more easily, which is due to be
launched across our European and Asia Pacific markets

The explosive 
growth of the Chinese 
consumer market, 
albeit slowing in current
economic conditions, 
remains a significant
opportunity for SSL
”
in the coming months, we expect consistent sales across
our main commercial regions. We also believe that the
brand’s business in emerging markets – principally China,
Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States –
will be a significant contributor to future growth. These
are relatively young consumer markets and SSL is well
positioned to take advantage of the potential for growth
that they offer.
//
Scholl footcare
The global footcare market continues to perform
consistently despite the economic downturn. This, in part,
can be attributed to its relative ‘immaturity’ compared
with other categories in the personal care sector, and we
are looking to exploit the resulting growth opportunities.
In Europe, where 80 per cent of Scholl’s footcare business
is concentrated, the market as a whole has grown by 5 per
cent; however , the brand has managed double digit growth
over the past 12 months. A similarly strong market position
is held in the Asia Pacific region, which accounts for the
remaining 20 per cent of our footcare sales. SSL also
believes the brand has a strong future in the Russian and
Chinese markets, while key European markets, including
Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom,
provide consistent opportunities for growth. In particular,
the foot skin and toenail categories – covered by Scholl
with products such as Cracked Heel Repair Cream, 
1bnthi
condoms produced
annually within 
3 years by our
China factory  Corn and Callus Removal devices and Nail Brightening
System/Perfect Nail T reatment – are expected to
perform strongly over the next year. The newly created
biomechanical orthotics category is also an exciting
prospect for the future.
//
Scholl footwear
Over the past 12 months the footwear market as a whole
has been affected by the wider economic downturn and
poor weather conditions throughout the Spring/Summer
2008 season. The middle segment of the market, where
products struggle to deliver on innovation and compete
on price, was hardest hit. In these conditions especially,
consumers are looking for brands that deliver a real
benefit – witness the success of ultra lightweight clogs –
or make specific promises such as being eco-friendly. 
In spite of the tough economic climate, Scholl Footwear
has performed well, with overall sales up 5 per cent on
last year. South Europe and South East Asia are markets
that are performing particularly well.
We believe that the footwear market will continue to
respond favourably to genuinely innovative products that
are marketed well to consumers. Scholl is well positioned
to exploit the trend and will capitalise on its superior foot
knowledge, links with footcare and marketing experience.
Our expansion into the shoe trade sector in Europe, in
addition to our traditional business in pharmacies, will
broaden our consumer base.
Developing our operating platform and
supply chain
Last year we set out our plans to improve our manufacturing
capability and supply chain for Durex condoms. This
included the construction of a new, state-of-the-art factory
in Qingdao, China, due to go live in July 2009. The new
factory will supply condoms for the global marketplace
within the year, produce one billion condoms within three
years, and support brand growth for the next ten years.
Crucially, it will allow us to meet increasing demand from the
Chinese consumer market, as well as from new consumers
in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS). In addition, we completed the closure of our plant in
Spain and transferred production to India; we are also in the
process of increasing production capacity at our condom
factory in Thailand. 
The past year has also seen other improvements
to our supply chain. We are installing new state-of-the-art
facilities at our Peterlee factory in the United Kingdom to
support growth of our pharmaceutical products. We have
set up an International Procurement Office in Shanghai. 
All global freight movements are being consolidated under
a single provider, which will improve transparency and
control of stock movements within the business to reduce
lead times. Our hosiery factory in Redruth, in the United
Kingdom, is now benefiting from weekly stock replenishments,
allowing us to improve supply responsiveness and reduce
stock levels in markets.
SAP update
This year SAP has been 
implemented in France, the 
existing China manufacturing 
facility and our new Chinese 
factory, bringing the total number 
of implementations across the 
group to 21.
20 / 21 //////////  Business review / Annual Report and Accounts 2009  Processes and systems
SAP update
Our SAP roll out continues across the business. When
complete (in 2011) a single, stable platform across all
commercial, manufacturing and warehousing units 
will give greater efficiency; shorten delivery lead times;
increase responsiveness; and generate more accurate
information. This year SAP has been introduced in France,
and in both the existing and new Chinese factories. The
total number of implementations across the Group is 
now 21 (15 commercial sites and six manufacturing). The
introduction of SAP at the new China factory was a major
element of that facility’s construction, and will play an
important role in meeting consumer demand in the region
more efficiently . W e have also gone live in eight markets 
with SAP demand planning, which is a key element in the
optimisation of our supply chain. Our aim is to have SAP
implemented in the rest of the Asia Pacific and Americas
regions by 2011. 
Web strategy

them opportunities to communicate and share ideas and
content with other like minded people. With that in mind,
our web strategy has focused on two complementary
strands: e-commerce and brand engagement. We have
recently launched our new e-commerce platform, which
delivers a step-change in the consumer experience and
integrates e-commerce within our existing business
platforms. This global initiative has been piloted by Scholl 
in the UK and will be rolled out across other markets during
the coming year.
Over the past 12 months we have also 
improved our web content, enhanced links to related
products and invested in online marketing. The new Durex
website (www.durex.com) has been rolled out across the
business’s global markets. Looking ahead, we see online
presence as an opportunity to create genuine engagement
with our consumers, with the online channel becoming an
increasingly important component in achieving the Durex
and Scholl brands’ business objectives.
Acquisitions
Acquisitions are an important aspect of our growth
strategy. We look for opportunities that complement our
existing brand portfolio and infrastructure, provide access
to new geographical regions to bolster our consumer base,
and bring new products and technologies into our business.
We have made two acquisitions over the past year that will
drive shareholder value over the short, medium and long term.
Contex condom brand
In April 2009 SSL exercised its option to increase its stake
in Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV (BLBV), a distributor
of condoms and medical products in Russia and other CIS
states, from 15.5 per cent to 50 per cent plus one share. 
We also exercised our option to acquire 100 per cent of
Gainbridge Investments (Cyprus) Limited, a distributor 
of condoms and medical products in Ukraine. Through
these acquisitions, SSL will acquire Contex, the number
one condom brand in Russia and Ukraine.
140mthi
consumers 
in Russia The price for the 35 per cent BLBV option, 
based on its Earnings Before Interest, T ax, Depreciation and
Amortisation (EBITDA) to 31 December 2007 , is €70 million;
the price for the Gainbridge option is €20.6 million. Both
acquisitions will be paid for from funds that were raised
from shareholders in a successful share placing at the end
of January 2009. There is also a final option for SSL to buy
the remaining shares of BLBV to take us to 100 per cent
ownership, exercisable in February 2010.
We believe this to be an excellent opportunity 
for our business. There are 140 million consumers in Russia
and 46 million in Ukraine. Both countries have rapidly
expanding consumer cultures and, despite the current
economic climate, we remain optimistic of the potential
they bring for SSL’s products and growth within the CIS 
and Eastern Europe.
Crest
In December 2008 SSL acquired the Crest condom brand
and associated customer relationships in Switzerland 
for £4.6 million. Crest is the number two condom brand 
in the country, with a market share of 32 per cent which
allows us to assume market leadership in another
European market.
Internal development
It is vital for the success of our business that 
we have the right people, with the right skills and
competencies, doing the right jobs. At SSL, we 
make it a matter of priority to recruit and retain
highly skilled and motivated staff, and to provide
development opportunities through training and
work experience programmes. We aim to ensure
that our employees throughout the Group
understand and feel valued by our company ethos 
– based on ‘Attitude’, ‘Behaviour’ and ‘Culture’ –
providing a common basis from which to drive
growth and improve performance. 
As a brand-led company we seek marketing
professionals with skills second to none, and invest in their
training and development. During the year we launched our
Marketing Essentials course, as part of a programme for 
the business’s marketeers worldwide. The first part of the
course took place in May 2008, and brought together 45
marketing professionals from 11 countries in the Asia Pacific
region. Backed by extensive research and preparation, 
it provides tailor-made training to help employees fulfil 
SSL’s strategy. The second part of the course took place 
in May 2009 and will build on these learnings and equip the
same staff with enhanced leadership, management and
presentation skills. Planning for phase three, scheduled for
2009/10, is already underway. 
Corporate knowledge is something that should
be fostered and nurtured – it should also be shared for the
wider benefit of the business. Last year we undertook our
most comprehensive succession planning review to date.
In total, we reviewed 650 managerial roles across the 
globe. This is an ongoing process, and succession planning
reviews for this population will take place on an annual basis
going forward. 
T aking responsibility for one’s own development
is another important aspect of working at SSL. In the UK, 
for example, the Shaping Your Future modular programme
has had another successful year enabling employees to
choose from a suite of education modules ranging from
business awareness to technical skills training and lifestyle
programmes. 
//
Investing in our staff
Our employees are our greatest asset, and we take their
training and development seriously. At SSL we believe in
creating the kind of culture that motivates and inspires
our staff to operate to the best of their ability. As part of

SSL continues to 
be a member of the
FTSE4Good index understand the ethical, environmental and social
considerations within the supply chain, we use sub-
contractors to give greater control across the whole supply
chain cycle. We have made good progress in is reducing
transport requirements, through a process known as
‘depalletisation’. By loading stock onto pallets at the
destination, rather than at the factory, we can maximise 
the amount of product being transported by each
container in transit.
Counterfeiting, while not unique to SSL, is an
issue we take very seriously, and we work hard to protect
our consumers and retailers from counterfeit products. 
We maintain a vigilant watch on any suspect activity through
our contacts with relevant authorities and Ministries of Health
across our commercial markets – particularly in countries
identified as either a source or a target for the counterfeits
– and use external investigators where needed.
In the workplace
It is essential that staff work in a positive, safe and
supportive environment that allows them to flourish in their
jobs and contribute to the success of the business. At SSL,
we also believe in helping employees appreciate their roles
within the Company’s wider strategic objectives, as well as
promoting effective communication across our various
functions and regions. 
Employee Opinion Survey
Employee opinion surveys provide staff with a formal
opportunity to communicate their views about SSL and the
way the business is run. It tells us how staff view the Group’s
leadership, whether people are aligned to our wider strategy
and values, what their views on training and reward are, and
their views on corporate social responsibility. Our most
recent employee opinion survey took place in October 2008.
It was considered so successful that we have decided to
run employee surveys annually, rather than biennially, thus
enabling us to have access to ongoing feedback rather than
a snapshot of views.
We appreciate the importance of connecting our business
decisions to environmental, ethical and social concerns.
Last year we developed a new framework to maximise and
enhance our commitment to corporate responsibility. This
framework has four key elements:
//
In the marketplace: covering the whole supply chain 
from selection of raw materials, third-party supplier
assessments, in-house manufacture, packaging, 
delivery to customers, and responsible and effective
communication with consumers.
//
In the workplace: reflecting the core areas of our 
global human resources strategy – resourcing, reward,
communication and development – and health and
safety for all employees.
//
In the community: supporting work carried out by SSL 
in global, national and local communities. It includes 
the Durex Network, relationships with national health
authorities, local social responsibility programmes, as
well as SSL’s responsibilities to shareholders.
//
In the environment: committing SSL to continual
improvement in its practices in environmental care,
environmental performance and sustainability.
In the marketplace
We aim to look after our consumers with products that are
safe and effective – and sourced from a supply chain that 
is ethical and delivered through sound business practices.
During the past year we have enhanced our standard
supplier assessment process, auditing third-party facilities
with a focus on health and safety, employee welfare 
and quality. We have a dedicated Supply Chain Manager
focusing on new product development. T o help us better

Investors and business finance appreciation
In line with our policy of involving staff within the broader
aims of the Group, we embarked this year on a training
programme that helps employees understand how investors
view SSL and how they impact on our day-to-day work. The
idea behind the initiative was to train ‘ambassadors’ who can
explain to colleagues how investors assess the business and
what they look for in their investment opportunities. The
programme reinforces the reasons behind the importance
of good working capital management, and how employees
can impact on this within the Group. A workshop on
understanding corporate finance and working capital was
followed by two days of training in presentation skills with 
an external training consultant. Feedback was positive from
the roll out in Europe and America and there are plans to roll
out the programme across the Asia Pacific region this year.
Competency framework training
We understand that to succeed in the workplace, staff
require a range of professional, personal and collaborative
skills. T o help our employees develop these, work
commenced this year on defining a worldwide, managerial
competency framework. These competencies are designed
to complement the strategy of SSL as well as reflect the ABC
operating principles and SSL values. They will serve in part as
the backbone for future HR initiatives. The framework will be
launched in October 2009.
Health and safety
Providing a safe working environment for our employees 
is an absolute priority for SSL, and we have a five year
strategy, endorsed and actively monitored by our Board 
of Directors, that is working to ensure a positive safety
culture throughout all SSL sites. The initial focus is on
manufacturing and warehouses, with roll out in subsequent
years to commercial offices.

Our collaboration with SPW, in which SSL employees 
spend time in developing countries using their skills to
develop SPW’s marketing and IT capabilities, has had
another successful year. SPW is a charity that encourages
young people to volunteer to act as peer educators in 
rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia 
to lead health, environmental and education programmes.
Secondees from SSL play a vital role in helping the charity
implement accounting and reporting processes, develop
communication strategies and set up IT systems. Since 
the collaboration was formed two years ago, 26 SSL
employees have participated in the scheme. This year we
have interviewed and selected ten more. They are due to
fly out to their destinations in June this year.
In the environment
We are pleased to report that over the past 12 months we
have continued to make good progress against both our
environmental performance and management objectives,
expanding the reach of our environmental programme 
and integrating environmental sustainability into everyday
decision-making. In particular we have exceeded our
energy target a year earlier than planned, delivering a
reduction of approximately 14 per cent production unit
against 2006/07 levels. 
For more detail related to this and other
environmental activities please see this year’s edition 
of our Environment Report, which can be accessed at
www.ssl-international.com
World Environment Day 
SSL sites across the world took part in World Environment
Day, the theme of which was working towards a low carbon
economy. Activities across a range of markets, including
Thailand, China, India and the United Kingdom, featured
clean-up campaigns, car-sharing, poster designs, tree
planting, and competitions for ideas to reduce waste 
and resources. 
//
We are significantly ahead of our targets on
accident reduction and severity as recorded by our accident
Key Performance Indicators: Lost Time Injury Frequency
Rate and Accident Severity Rate, and we have recently
introduced a new indicator, Recordable Injury Frequency
Rate. We rolled out certification to OHSAS 18001 to all of
our Indian sites in April 2009.
In the community
The Durex Network
SSL supports local, national and global communities
through the Durex Network. The network was founded 
in 2005 to formalise the work Durex has been doing for
many years to promote the safer sex message and raise
awareness of HIV/AIDS and condom use.
Over the past year, the Durex Network has
consolidated its position as a key contributor to the sexual
health debate, primarily through its Face of Global Sex
(FOGS) research series. Its third FOGS paper, published in
2008 and called The Path to Sexual Confidence, received
widespread global coverage and continues to be referenced
in scientific literature. A previous Durex Network paper,
First Sex: An Opportunity of a Lifetime, was presented at
the European Society of Contraception Conference, while
its paper Age At First Sex: When Does It Really Happen? 
was presented at the Global Health Council Conference.
Such reports play an important role in raising
awareness in international media and scientific forums
about the importance of developing evidence-based
interventions to sexually transmitted infections, particularly
HIV/AIDS. The Network also works in partnership with
NGOs, charities, policy-makers and politicians to promote
safer sex and effective condom use. For example, it is a key
partner in Dance4Life, a global charity that informs young
people about HIV/AIDS through the power of dance, 
music and movement. Every year we donate one million 
specially designed condom packs to educational projects
in participating countries.
A process known as ‘depalletisation’
has helped us to reduce freight across
our supply chain. By loading stock onto
pallets at the destination, rather than 
at the factory, we can maximise the
amount of product being transported
and thus reduce the number of
containers in transit.
SSL works with the international 
charity Students Partnership Worldwide
to organise staff work placements 
in developing countries. These
placements are tremendously popular
with our employees, enabling them to
use their everyday professional skills 
to contribute to causes that will impact
and improve lives. 28 / 29 //////////  Business review / Annual Report and Accounts 2009

Sales of Durex condoms increased by 5.5 per
cent to £223.6 million with healthy performance across 
the product range. We continue to benefit from strong
growth in our core condom range in territories such as the
UK and Eastern Europe coupled with robust sales growth as
we extend our distribution network, with excellent results 
from our businesses in China and Russia in the period.
Sales of the Durex Play range, which includes
personal lubricants and vibrators, grew 17 .7 per cent, to

£43.3 million with particularly good growth in the UK,
France, Germany and the United States. New product
offerings within the Play range, such as Play O, a clitoral
stimulating gel that helps women achieve orgasm, and
Massage Melts, a freezable intimate lube and massage gel,
have contributed handsomely to this growth. Our lubricant
products are an important component of the Durex product
portfolio with enhanced product offerings growing
consumer demand. 
Our brand development continues to focus 
on enhancing people’s sexual wellbeing. The consumer
appetite for Play O demonstrates their desire for product
innovations, which enhance sexual pleasure.
Scholl footcare
Sales of Scholl footcare were £143.0 million, an increase 
of 11.4 per cent, with strong sales in the UK, Italy, Benelux,
France and Australia. This excellent performance has been
driven principally by the success of new products such as
Scholl Perfect Nail Brightening System and also by Scholl
Biomechanics, as we began to launch our orthotic insole
range across our network.
The focus on consumer-insight led new 
product development, coupled with additional marketing
investment specifically targeted at the key Spring/Summer
period, continues to connect the Scholl brand name with a
new generation of consumers.
Scholl footwear
Scholl footwear sales were £92.9 million, an increase of
£4.5 million, or 5.1 per cent.
Whilst Europe continues to generate the majority
of footwear sales and we experienced strong growth in 
Italy, France and Spain, we also witnessed particularly good
growth in Asia Pacific during the period, with our South-East
Asian and Australian businesses showing strong growth. 
Locally owned brands
Sales of locally owned brands were broadly flat, down 
£0.9 million, or 1.2 per cent to £75.3 million. This product
portfolio has performed to our expectations and continues
to hold up well despite the relatively low level of investment
we allocate to the brands.

Other sales
Other sales, which include sales from distribution of third-
party products, unbranded condoms, retail stores and
contract manufacture sales, have increased by 3.9 per cent
to £64.3 million. 
Russia
Post year-end we announced that we have exercised our
option to acquire an additional 35 per cent of the shares 
in BLBV
(2)
. This increased shareholding will result in the
consolidation of the results of BLBV from the point of
completion. This is currently expected to be 1st June 2009.
Had BLBV been consolidated for the year to March 2009,
the estimated impact on the Group’s accounts would be 
to increase sales by over £110 million. Approximately 50 per
cent of these sales are of branded condoms and lubricants
with a further 30 per cent being medical gloves. Other
medical and consumer goods make up the remainder 
of the sales. Operating profits would be increased by an
estimated £16 million.
Gross margin, brand contribution, fixed
costs and operating profit
Gross profit increased to £389.1 million (2008: £362.5
million), representing a gross margin of 60.6 per cent
compared with 60.1 per cent in the prior year after adjusting
for currency movements. This improvement in gross
margin demonstrates the benefits being derived from 
the restructuring of our Group Supply Chain, and has been
achieved after offsetting higher input costs relating to the
oil price during the early part of the year.
Brand contribution increased by £14.8 million 
to £249.0 million, an increase of 6.3 per cent in line with
sales growth. Brand contribution represents 38.8 per cent
of sales, the same as in the prior year. This demonstrates 
both an increase in the absolute amount of expenditure 
on advertising during the year of £8.7 million, an increase 
of 9.6 per cent over the prior year but also an increase as 
a percentage of sales when compared with the prior year. 
In the current trading environment we will continue to
invest in our brands to ensure that they are well positioned
to benefit from any improvement in consumer confidence
and expenditure.
Operating costs increased by £6.4 million, or 
4.2 per cent, to £159.5 million. As the rate of increase was
below the rate of sales growth the proportion of sales
accounted for by these costs fell from 25.4 per cent to 
24.8 per cent. The absolute growth is principally due to
further incremental investment in our sales and marketing
infrastructure and our innovation teams of £5.7 million in
the period, with the increase in administration costs held 
at £0.7 million.
Operating profit increased by £8.4 million, or 
10. 4 per cent, to £89.5 million, representing a 13.9 per cent
operating margin (2008: 13.4 per cent).
Interest and taxation
Net financing costs for the period were £13.0 million (2008:
£10.7 million before one-off charges). The underlying
interest cost for the period was £7 .9 million (2008: £8.8
million) reflecting higher average borrowings in the early
part of the year more than offset by lower interest rates 
in the second half .
The IAS 19 net pension finance charge for the
period was £3.3 million (2008: £1.9 million). The remaining
charge of £1.8 million primarily relates to changes in the fair
value of financial instruments under IAS 39. 
The tax charge for the period was £21.0 million
(2008: £16.1 million before one-off tax credits of £4.3
million). The effective tax rate is 27 .5 per cent (2008: 28 
per cent before one-off items).
Earnings per share
Earnings per share increased by 35.9 per cent to 28.0 pence
(2008: 20.6 pence before one off charges). 
Litigation
This is detailed in note 26 on page 94. 
Cashflow and balance sheet
Cash generated from the operations in the period was
£101.6 million (2008: £52.9 million) with improvements 
in working capital generating £19.2 million. The Group
continues to focus on improving the underlying cashflow
from operations and this is a key metric for our operational
management throughout the Group. 
One-off restructuring cash costs, relating
principally to the ongoing restructuring of our European
Supply Chain, amounted to £12.3 million in the period. 
The substantial majority of these costs have now been
incurred with future cash spend limited to ongoing
maintenance of surplus properties.
The cash outflow on acquisitions of property,
plant and equipment amounting to £22.3 million relates to
the continued investment in our new manufacturing facility
in China and the expansion of our manufacturing capability
in the UK, Thailand and India. Again expenditure here has
substantially been completed in the period.

(2) BLBV is a holding company for operating companies primarily engaged in 
the packaging and distribution of condoms and medical products across the
Commonwealth of Independent States (‘CIS’), with the exception of the Ukraine. The acquisition of intangible assets relates 
to the continued roll out of the SAP IT platform and the
acquisition of the Crest condom brand in Switzerland
during the period.
Cash outflow on acquisition of investments
relates to our investment in BLBV, the owner of the Contex
condom brand and the distributor of consumer and
medical products in Russia and the CIS, excluding Ukraine.
This amounted to £29.4 million in the period. Post year end
we announced that we exercised our option to acquire 
an additional 35 per cent of the shares in BLBV for an
acquisition cost of €70 million. We have also obtained
regulatory clearance for this transaction and completion 
is expected to occur on 1 June 2009.
Interest, tax and dividends amounted to £40.8
million in the period. 
Cash payments to the Group’s pension schemes
amounted to £9.8 million in the period, in line with our deficit
recovery schedule.
The major movements in the Group’s balance
sheet are shown in the summarised balance sheet table 
on page 29.
Net borrowings and bank facilities
Closing net debt was £17 .7 million compared with £99.0
million at 31 March 2008.
On 28 January 2009 the Group placed 19.19
million new ordinary shares with institutional shareholders
at a price of 455 pence per share. The net proceeds, after
placing costs, were £85.0 million.
The Group’s main banking facility is a £220 million
committed five-year revolving credit facility. This facility was
arranged in January 2007 and is committed until January
2012. The banking syndicate comprises 7 members and 
is administered by Barclays Bank plc. Further information 
in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities is given in 
notes 15 and 21.
The Group’s financial forecasts, taking account
of reasonably possible fluctuations in trading performance
and known significant committed expenditures, show that
the Group should be able to operate within its current
facility for the foreseeable future.
Capital structure and treasury policy
IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 
IAS 32, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 require that certain disclosures
relating to financial instruments are given in the financial
statements, in order to provide information on the impact
of such instruments on the Group’s risk profile, how this
may affect the Group’s performance and financial position,
and how those risks are managed. The impact of those
financial instruments is considered in notes 22 and 23.
Foreign exchange risk objective
The nature of the Group’s trading activities generates
transactional foreign exchange rate risks. These arise from
the sourcing of raw materials from different countries, 
the location of Group production facilities throughout 
the world and the sale and distribution of finished goods 
in many locations. The objective of the Group’s foreign
exchange policy is to minimise the trade exposure to
foreign exchange rate fluctuations for the overseas entities
and manage the risk from the centre. This requires that 
all trading-related exposures should be centralised in
accordance with prescribed procedures and timetables
under the direction of the Group T reasury Function, which
hedges the major exposures using forward contracts and
options, usually up to a period of 12 months.
Interest rate exposure objective
The interest rate risk management policy aims to reduce
the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Group’s 
net interest expense to acceptable levels. This is achieved
through balancing the ratio of fixed or hedged debt to
those financial liabilities with floating interest rates. Board
approved instruments available to hedge this exposure
include interest rate swaps, interest rate options and
forward rate agreements. Details of the interest rate
analysis are given in note 15.
Liquidity risk
The primary objective of the Group T reasury Policy is 
to ensure that the Group is able at all times to meet its
financial commitments as they fall due. T o facilitate this,
the Group T reasury department is responsible for the
management of cash and liquid resources for the whole
Group, and ensures that the Group has sufficient liquidity
to meet any reasonable change in funding requirements.
The Group’s liquidity being defined as the aggregate of
the Group’s cash, liquid resources and central undrawn
committed facilities as at 31 March 2009, amounted 
to £230.5 million (2008: £141.6 million).
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors
likely to affect its future development, performance and
position, the financial position of the Group, its cash flows,
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Chief Executive’s review on pages 6 to 9 and in the
Business review on pages 14 to 33. In addition, notes 22 
and 23 to the financial statements include the Group’s
objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital;
its financial risk management objectives; details of its
financial instruments and hedging activities; and its
exposure to credit risk and liquidity.
The Group has delivered strong growth in the
year to March 2009 and, notwithstanding the current
difficult trading environment, the Group’s growth prospects
remain strong. As a consequence the Directors believe 
that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks
successfully despite the uncertain economic outlook.
The Directors confirm that, after making
enquiries, they have a reasonable expectation that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

There are risks and uncertainties connected to the Group’s
businesses. The factors listed below are among those that
the Group thinks could cause the actual results to differ
materially from expected and historical results.
Risk management is an important element of 
the system of internal control. This system is designed to
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve
business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and
not absolute assurance against material loss. 
The risk management process involves 
making all managers within the Group responsible for risk
management and for ensuring that a full assessment of
risks, both financial and non-financial has been completed.
This is achieved by a bottom-up and top-down review 
of risks throughout the Group, from which, a Group Risk 
Matrix (the ‘Matrix’) has been developed. This process 
has embedded risk management within the operational
and executive management throughout the Group. 
The Matrix is reviewed twice a year. Overall
responsibility for the risk management process lies with 
the Executive Committee, which consists of the Executive
Directors and certain other senior Executives who report
to the Chief Executive. Details of the Executive Directors
and the other members of the Executive Committee are
given on pages 34 to 36. An overview of the process is
presented below.
The latest review of risks was undertaken in the
light of the current economic outlook. The Matrix includes
an assessment of the impact of the economy on risks
identified by the Group.

Corporate governance
Chairman and the Chief Executive. In addition to the Chairman and 
Chief Executive, there are three Non-Executive Directors (one of 
whom, Peter Read, is the Senior Independent Director (‘SID’)) and 
two Executive Directors.
Details of the Chairman’s professional commitments are
included in his biography. The Board is satisfied that the other
commitments of the Chairman do not interfere with the performance of
his duties as Chairman. The Board considers that all of the Non-Executive
Directors are independent in character and judgement and by reference
to section A.3.1 of the Combined Code and that controls are in place to
ensure that no single Director has unfettered powers of decision.
The management of operational matters within the Group is
delegated to the Executive Committee, which comprises the Executive
Directors and certain other senior executives. Biographical information
on the members of the Executive Committee is shown on pages 34 to 36.
The Executive Committee meets monthly.
Board evaluation
During the year, the Board reviewed the process for the evaluation of the
performance of the Board, its committees and the individual Directors.
Previous evaluations have been conducted internally and led by the
Chairman, whilst the SID conducted the evaluation of the Chairman. 
The Board concluded that this process remained appropriate. 
All Directors were required to complete a detailed questionnaire,
which each Director then discussed with the Chairman and with the SID,
in relation to responses about the Chairman. The results of the evaluation
were presented to the Board.
The Board considers the annual evaluation to be a valuable
process, which has contributed to fostering an environment within the
Board that is challenging but supportive, encourages focus on the main
issues facing the Group and further enhances the Board’s procedures
and working practices.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme
involving existing and potential investors within the UK and overseas. 
The Chief Executive, Finance Director and certain senior executives meet
with institutional investors on a regular basis. The Chairman and SID make
themselves available to meet with institutional investors. The SID attends
the preliminary and interim results presentations with investors and
analysts. An investor relations report is presented and considered at 
each Board meeting.
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting, which all Directors
attend, to communicate with investors and encourage their participation.
The Directors are available to speak informally with shareholders after 
the meeting.
Board Committees
The Board has established three committees. Each committee 
operates in accordance with formal terms of reference, which are
reviewed annually and can be viewed on the Company’s website,
www.ssl-international.com. The committee chairmen report at the 
next meeting on the proceedings of the committee which they chair.
Audit Committee Policy on auditors’ independence
Safeguarding the independence of the external auditors is paramount
and controls are in place to ensure their continued independence.
However, there are occasions when services can be more efficiently
undertaken by the external auditor and at no risk of impairment of their
independence. The Audit Committee has put in place a detailed policy 
on the provision of services by the external auditors, which sets out the
services that the external auditors are allowed to carry out on behalf of
the Group and those which are prohibited to them. Under this policy, the
external auditors cannot be engaged to provide any of the following services:
//
Design or implementation of IT systems;
//
Valuation;
//
Internal audit; and
//
Litigation support, legal or corporate finance advice, tax advice 
(if on a wholly or partly contingent fee basis), recruitment, executive
compensation advice, accounting and actuarial valuation. 
Secondment of senior audit staff to the Company is also prohibited.
The Board is responsible for delivering value to shareholders 
and other stakeholders, by developing strategy and by leading
the Group, ensuring that the appropriate resources, processes
and controls are in place to execute that strategy. Developing and
maintaining high standards of corporate governance is integral
to the delivery of value. This report explains SSL ’s corporate
governance arrangements and how the Group has applied the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’).
The Board
There is a written schedule of matters reserved to the Board. This
schedule includes:
//
Approval / development of the Group’s long-term objectives and
commercial strategy;
//
Approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and 
any material changes to them;
//
Review of performance in the light of the Group’s strategy, objectives,
business plans and budgets and ensuring that any necessary corrective
action is taken;
//
Approval of major capital projects, including acquisitions;
//
Approval of contracts which are material strategically, or by reason 
of size; and
//
Monitoring the system of internal control and corporate governance.
T o ensure proper consideration at the appropriate time, the Board 
has a schedule of matters for each meeting. These matters include:
//
Reports from the Chief Executive and Finance Director;
//
Health and safety;
//
Presentations from the heads of the business units;
//
Investor relations; and
//
Regulatory reviews.
The Board also receives regular updates on relevant legal, environmental
and business development matters.
The schedule below sets out the number of scheduled Board
and Committee meetings held during the year and the attendance by
Directors at those meetings.

During the year under review, the Board continued to be led by the
Chairman, Gerald Corbett. Garry Watts, the Chief Executive, is primarily
responsible for the effective running of the Group’s business. There is 
a clear, written schedule on the division of responsibilities between the Under this policy, it has been agreed that due to their understanding of
the Group’s business and therefore ensuring cost efficiency, the external
auditors may be engaged for the following non-audit services, for which
there is a pre-agreed limit for fees (not including VA T) which do not
require prior approval from the Audit Committee:
//
Audit-related regulatory reporting including interim review, covenant
reporting and other audit certificates (£100,000);
//
Further assurance including advice on accounting matters, non-
regulatory reporting on internal controls or corporate governance, 
due diligence work and environmental audits (£100,000); and
//
T ax compliance and tax advisory services (£300,000).
The Chairman of the Audit Committee may approve urgent engagements
not covered by these categories, subsequently notifying the Audit
Committee at its next meeting. A breakdown of fees paid to the external
auditors during the year is set out on page 61.
Nomination Committee
During the year, the Nomination Committee, considered the appointment
of a new Non-Executive Director, following the resignations of Susan
Murray and Anna Catalano. A recruitment consultant was appointed by
the Committee and a detailed specification was prepared. A shortlist 
of candidates was identified. Following interviews with members of the
Committee, the Committee recommended and the Board approved 
the appointment of Peter Johnson as a Non-Executive Director.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control 
and for reviewing its effectiveness, and this is monitored by the Audit
Committee. Key elements of this system include:
//
Regular Board meetings with a formal schedule of matters reserved 
for Board discussion;
//
Clearly defined segregation of duties, organisational structures 
and appropriate delegation of authority (adherence to which is 
kept under review);
//
Centralised treasury operations operating within defined limits;
//
Review of the Group’s accounting manuals and procedures; 
//
Receipt of annual compliance statements from all statutory units within
the Group, stating compliance with Group accounting manuals; and

An effective Internal Audit function, which reports regularly to the 
Audit Committee and provides independent scrutiny of internal 
control systems and risk management procedures.
The Board has established ongoing procedures for identifying, evaluating
and managing significant risks. Risk management is embedded within 
the day-to-day activities of all executives. Management of this area is the
responsibility of the Executive Committee. A significant element of this
process is the maintenance of a Group Risk Matrix (the ‘Matrix’) detailed
on page 32. The Matrix contains both financial and non-financial risks,
identified through regular top-down and bottom-up reviews.
The Board believes that the Company operates an effective
embedded system of internal control and is confident that it complies
with Internal Control Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
(the ‘T urnbull Report’).
Further information about the risk management processes is
given on page 32.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
Following the changes made to the Company’s Articles of Association 
at the 2008 Annual General Meeting and the subsequent introduction 
of section 175 of the Companies Act 2006 on 1 October 2008, which 
gave boards the statutory power to authorise conflicts of interest, formal
conflict management procedures have been prepared and approved 
by the Board. The Nominations Committee is responsible for reviewing
annually any conflict authorisations granted by the Board and will make
recommendations as to their continuation and any changes to any terms
or conditions or other limitations which may have been applied. Conflicts
were authorised by the Board in compliance with the formal conflict
management procedures. Directors are required to inform the Chairman
and the Company Secretary of any new potential, or actual conflict 
of interest. The procedures for ensuring that the Board’s powers of
authorisation of conflicts operate effectively will be reported annually.
Combined Code compliance
During the year the Company complied with the Code except in the
following respect:
A4.1 Until the appointment of Peter Johnson to the Nomination
Committee on 25 February 2009, the Nomination Committee comprised
the Group Chairman, the Chief Executive, the SID and a Non-Executive
Director. Whilst the Board considers the Group Chairman to be
independent, membership of this Committee did not consist of a majority
of independent Non-Executive Directors, as defined by the Code.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors believe that the Group and the
Company have adequate resources to operate for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements. Further details are included in 
the Financial review on pages 28 to 31. The Directors present their report and financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2009.
Principal activities and Business Review
The principal activities of SSL International plc and its subsidiaries
(collectively ‘the Group’) are the manufacture and distribution of
healthcare products sold into consumer markets worldwide.
A review of the business, covering a comprehensive analysis 
of the activities of the business, the principal risks and uncertainties, 
the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development,
performance and position of the business and key performance indicators
is included in the Chairman’s statement, the Chief Executive’s review, the
Strategy and priorities section and the Financial review and all form part 
of this report.
Information about environmental matters and the Group’s
employees and social and community issues can be found in the
Corporate Responsibility section on pages 24 to 27 .
Results and dividend
The Group profit before tax was £76.5 million. An interim dividend of 
2.6 pence per ordinary share was paid on 4 March 2009. The Directors
recommend a final dividend of 6.4 pence per ordinary share, which,
subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) 
on 23 July 2009, will be paid on 3 September 2009 to shareholders on 
the register on 7 August 2009. This will make a total dividend of 9.0 pence
per share (2008: 7 .6 pence). Shareholders are able to take the dividend 
as cash or in shares, through the Dividend Re-investment Plan (‘DRIP’).
Shareholders who wish to elect for the DRIP for the forthcoming final
dividend, but have not already done so should contact the Registrar,
Capita Registrars by 7 August 2009.
Board of Directors
The Group Board section on pages 34 and 35 gives the biographical details
of the current Directors and the Company Secretary. All of the current
Directors served throughout the year, with the exception of Peter Johnson
who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 October 2008.
Susan Murray and Anna Catalano resigned as Non-Executive Directors 
on 24 July 2008 and 11 November 2008 respectively.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Ian Adamson,
Gerald Corbett and Mark Moran will retire by rotation at the AGM. Peter
Johnson will stand for election at the AGM. Following a recommendation
by the Nomination Committee and in line with the results of the Board
Evaluation, the process for which is described in the Corporate
Governance report, the Board recommends to shareholders that these
Directors be reappointed at the AGM. 
The Company has the authority under its Memorandum and
Articles of Association to agree individual contracts of indemnity with 
its Directors and others (also know as qualifying third party indemnity
provisions ‘QTPIP’). During the year ended 31 March 2009, the Company
entered into such contracts with each of the Directors.
The Company maintains liability insurance for its Directors 
and officers.
Directors’ interests in shares

Maria Buxton-Smith
Company Secretary
18 May 2009 Dear Shareholder
I submit the Directors’ Remuneration report for the year ended
31 March 2009.
The Remuneration Committee’s (the ‘Committee’) aim 
is to maintain a remuneration framework which incentivises the
senior team to outperform against challenging targets, which are
set to drive sustainable business performance. The link between
the achievement of the Group’s goals and the reward of our
talented senior executive team, has been a key factor in the
recent outstanding performance of the Group. Their performance
this year has been particularly impressive in light of the current
economic climate. 
The implications of the controversy relating to executive
remuneration issues over the last year have been carefully
considered by the Committee in its annual review of the Group’s
remuneration policy. Accordingly this year , it has used the various
guidelines published by investor bodies to challenge and risk
assess its own policy. Following this close scrutiny, the Committee
remains confident that the remuneration policy stands up well in
the current circumstances. It sets a robust and well structured
approach to remuneration for both its Executives and the 
wider management team that drives the right, complementary
behaviours for both the short and long-term term within an
appropriate risk framework. 
Peter Read
Chairman, Remuneration Committee
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 (as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report
Regulations 2002).
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’)
Composition of the Committee:
Peter Read
Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director
Gerald Corbett
Group Chairman *
Richard Adam
Non-Executive Director
Peter Johnson
Non-Executive Director
* Gerald Corbett was considered independent by reference to the
Combined Code on Corporate Governance upon his appointment 
as Group Chairman.
All members served throughout the year, except Peter Johnson 
who joined the Committee upon his appointment as a Non-Executive
Director on 1 October 2008. Susan Murray and Anna Catalano were 
both members of the Committee until they resigned as Non-Executive
Directors on 24 July 2008 and 11 November 2008 respectively. The
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
Advisers to the Committee
The Chief Executive, Company Secretary and Group Human Resources
Director, who are generally invited to attend Committee meetings,
provide advice and/or services to the Committee. No Executive
participates in any discussion concerning his or her own remuneration.
The Committee receives advice from independent consultants.
During the year, the Committee received advice from the following
consultants:
Consultant Advice provided to the Committee
Hewitt New Bridge Street On the Group’s medium- and 
long-term incentive arrangements
Ernst & Y oung LLP On the operation of the 
Group’s share schemes and the
calculation of the Group’s total
shareholder return
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP On the Group’s Performance 
Share Plan
Ernst & Young LLP also provides advice to the Company on taxation
matters relating to expatriate employees. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
provided some taxation advice in relation to the closure of the Group’s
manufacturing operations in Spain and some general advice in relation 
to Group VA T matters. The Committee is satisfied that the provision of
advice to the Committee does not result in a conflict of interests. 
Activities of the Committee
The Committee, which meets at least four times a year, has a schedule 
of the principal items to be discussed at each meeting. The purpose of
the schedule is to ensure that all material matters are considered at the
appropriate time. Such matters include:
//
An annual review of remuneration policy and framework;
//
Consideration of Executives’ remuneration packages; and
//
Determination of performance measures for the Group’s 
incentive schemes.
The Committee Chairman reports to the Board on the principal matters
discussed at the Committee. Copies of Committee minutes are available
to all Directors (subject to there not being a conflict of interest).
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are reviewed
annually, can be viewed at the Company’s website, 
www.ssl-international.com.
//
Remuneration report
42 / 43 //////////  Governance / Annual Report and Accounts 2009  Remuneration policy
The main objective of the policy is to attract, retain and motivate those
people of the highest calibre who have the skills needed to lead the Group
to achieve its objectives year on year.
As previously stated, the Committee is satisfied that the
remuneration framework and policy are aligned to Group strategy and 
do not encourage the Executives to take undue risks. The remuneration
policy and framework have been reviewed in the light of the current
economic climate and by reference to remuneration guidelines published
by investor bodies.
The principles of the policy are:
//
Providing a truly motivational incentive scheme which drives individuals
to work to outperform against challenging short and long-term targets;
//
Establishing that variable pay provides the material element to
Executive’s total reward;
//
Ensuring that there is an appropriate and increasing balance between
short-term and long-term targets, with a significant proportion of the
remuneration subject to carefully considered long-term performance
conditions;
//
Aligning the interests of Executives with those of shareholders;
//
Effectively using the Company’s equity for the purposes of reward 
and retention; and
//
Encouraging Executives to build and maintain a meaningful
shareholding in the Company.
The charts below show the proportionate breakdown of the package at
target and maximum remuneration (showing the target levels of the annual
bonus and Performance Share Plan) as a proportion of the maximum:
This reflects the policy of driving both short and sustained long-term
performance. A significant proportion of the package comprises short
and long-term performance linked elements, with the proportion
increasing at the higher level of performance.
Base salary: salaries are reviewed annually and are determined
by individual performance and by reference to market salary levels
obtained from independent sources. This is the only element of
remuneration which is pensionable. Base salary increases during the year
ended 31 March 2009 for Executive Directors were between 2.7 per cent
and 7 .4 per cent. In determining base salary levels for the Executive
Directors, pay and conditions in the workforce are taken into account. 
For the year commencing 1 April 2009, the base salaries of the Executive
Directors and the Executive Committee have been frozen at 2008/09
salary levels. Salary increases across the Group have generally been in line
with local inflation or (if greater), local salary inflation in the countries in
which the Group operates.
Annual bonus: This is a cash plan, with performance targets 
that are designed to drive complementary behaviours within the wider
executive population, aligned to the achievement of Group objectives.
The maximum potential bonus payable is 125 per cent of base
salary for the Chief Executive and 115 per cent for the Executive Directors.
The targets require that any bonus paid above market levels is for
outstanding performance. No specific targets are set for the Executive
Directors relating to environmental, social and governance (‘ESG’)
performance. The Company’s performance in relation to ESG matters 
is robustly monitored and the Committee would consider any failure in
these areas when determining any payment of bonus.

The performance measures for 2009/10 are unchanged from
the previous year. One-third of the annual bonus is based upon Economic
Value Added (‘EVA’) targets, and two-thirds is based on earnings per share
(‘EPS’) targets.
EVA (which is calculated as normalised operating profit after tax
less the cost of all capital employed to produce those earnings) captures
the three basic generic strategies for creating value:
//
T o increase economic return for capital employed;
//
T o grow by investing in new products whose return more than
compensates for the risk taken; and 
//
T o curtail investment in and divert capital from uneconomic activities.
The potential payment for both the EVA and EPS parts of the annual
bonus for 2009/10 will be as shown in the following table:
Performance vs target 97 .5% 100 102.5%
% of salary for Chief Executive 12.5% 57.5% 125%
% of salary for Executive Directors 11.5% 52.9% 115%
The threshold of 97 .5 per cent of target represents an increase over
the 2008/09 EPS and an improvement in EVA over the prior year. No
bonus would be payable on results below the threshold. Maximum 
bonus would be paid upon the achievement of 102.5 per cent of target
(2008/09: 105 per cent).
The Committee has changed the scale of performance versus
target and maximum to reflect the considerable challenge in meeting
even a threshold level of performance. The degree of stretch is
considered by the Remuneration Committee to be suitably challenging
and the level of bonus payable at target performance is below half of the
maximum, providing greater stretch at above target.
The annual bonus is designed to drive complementary
behaviours across the senior executive population as well as aligning with
the Group’s goals and with shareholders’ interests. The table illustrates
the cascade of targets for the year ended 31 March 2009 for the ‘Business
Driver Group’ (currently approximately 35 employees). T ypically
individuals will be bonused on two or three of these targets:

Overall, the Committee is satisfied that the annual bonus has created an

Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
All Executive Directors and certain other Executives are entitled to
participate in the PSP, which is the Group’s only long-term incentive plan.
Under the PSP, conditional awards of shares are granted each year.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, the value of awards 
as at the date of grant does not normally exceed 100 per cent of an
Executive’s base salary. Subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions, determined annually by the Committee, awards vest on 
the third anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding awards are shown on page 48.
The Committee has considered carefully, the performance
conditions and targets attached to the 2009/10 awards. The vesting 
of these awards continues to be subject to the achievement of a
combination of EPS (one-third) and EVA (two-thirds) targets. The
Committee considers that the continued policy of basing the
performance conditions on the Company’s financial performance 
has created a very effective incentive. The Committee monitors
performance targets to ensure that such targets remain sufficiently
stretching and aligned to the interests of shareholders.
Due to the nature of the performance conditions it is not
possible to calculate an expected value using an option valuation model.
The vesting schedule for the proposed award is as follows:
EPS (1/3rd) EV A (2/3rds) 
Compound annual growth rate Aggregate generated over 
(CAGR) over the three financial the three financial years
years ending March 2012 ending March 2012 
Percentage of Performance Percentage of Performance
salary vesting scale salary vesting scale
Below Threshold Nil <13.5% Nil <£160m
Threshold 5% 13.5% 10% £160m
Maximum 33.3% >/=16.3% 66.7% >/=£170m
A sliding scale of payment will operate between the points in the 
target range.
In the case of the EPS condition, the percentage growth range 
is lower than that applying to the awards granted last year. However, 
the base measurement point for this year’s awards represents an EPS
figure which is significantly ahead of last year, meaning that the EPS
performance required to be achieved represents a clear improvement 
on last year’s targets.
The EVA range of £160m to £170m represents a clear
progression on the target range set last year (£130m – £150m).
Despite EPS and EVA also being used for the annual bonus plan,
the Committee is satisfied that there is, in reality, limited overlap between
the two plans. Under the PSP, performance is measured over three years,
compared to a single financial year for the annual bonus, 
thus requiring sustained high performance for targets to be achieved.
EPS and EV A will be calculated by the Company and the calculation
will be independently verified before the awards vest. The Committee is
satisfied that the target range for both measures is sufficiently stretching
and that their achievement would result in significant shareholder value
creation. In particular, it is recognised that a relatively low (by market
standards) proportion of the award vests at the initial vesting threshold.
Awards will not confer shareholder rights until the awards have
vested and participants have received their shares. Participants will be
entitled to receive a payment (in cash and/or shares) on, or shortly
following, the vesting of their awards, of an amount equivalent to the total
dividends that would have been paid on those shares between the time
when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
Shares to satisfy awards may be purchased in the market 
(via the Company’s Employee Benefit T rust) or using newly issued 
shares. Dilution for all schemes is held within the Association of British
Insurers (ABI) limits. The dilution levels compared to ABI limits as at 
31 March 2009 were: 
ABI limit SSL dilution
10% over 10 years for all share schemes 3.63%
5% over 10 years for discretionary schemes 2.92%
Shareholding guidelines
All Executive Directors will be expected to retain at least 50 per cent of
shares (net of tax) which vest to them under the PSP until a shareholding
equivalent to 100 per cent of base salary is achieved. Other participants
will be expected to build shareholdings ranging from 25 per cent to 50 per
cent of base salary.
Pensions
The Company operates a number of retirement benefit programmes
throughout the world. Such benefits reflect local competitive conditions
and legal requirements.
In the UK the company operates three defined benefit schemes
and a contracted-in defined contribution scheme, the SSL UK Pension
Scheme (the ‘SSL Scheme’) for UK employees. All UK defined benefit
schemes are closed to new entrants and future pension accrual.
Executive Directors who participate in the SSL Scheme
contribute 5 per cent of their base salary. Executive Directors receive 
25 per cent of base salary in respect of retirement provision. Any
contributions that are not made in respect of retirement provision 
are paid as a salary supplement.
Ian Adamson, an Executive Director, is also a member of one of
the defined benefit schemes.
Garry Watts, Chief Executive, is not a member of the SSL
Scheme but operates a personal pension plan. Garry Watts receives 
25 per cent of base salary in respect of retirement provision. Any
contributions that are not made in respect of retirement provision 
are paid as a salary supplement.
Other benefits
The Company provides other benefits to all Executive Directors and
certain other Executives, in line with the benefits generally provided in
their country of employment, namely a company car or car allowance, 
life assurance, income protection and private medical insurance.
Service contracts
It is Company policy that the notice period in Executive Directors’
contracts should not exceed one year. However, the Committee retains
the discretion to offer a notice period to an Executive Director in excess
of one year, in exceptional circumstances, where this is considered
necessary.
The Executive Directors’ contracts have no fixed term but
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate the
employment by giving one year’s notice.
Director Date of contract
Garry Watts – Chief Executive 5 February 2001
Ian Adamson – Executive Director 17 June 1996
Mark Moran – Executive Director 28 May 2004 Non-Executive Directors
Save as disclosed below, none of the Non-Executive Directors has 
a service contract.
Gerald Corbett was appointed Non-Executive Chairman 
of the Company on 1 August 2005 for an initial term of three years. 
The appointment has been renewed for a further three years and is
terminable upon 12 months notice by either party. Mr Corbett receives 
an annual fee of £180,000 and a company car.
The basic annual fee for Non-Executive Directors is £40,000.
Committee Chairmen receive an additional fee of £10,000. The Senior
Independent Director receives a further £5,000 p.a.
Details of the appointments of the other Non-Executive 
Directors are as follows:
There are no express provisions for compensation payable in the event 
of termination except that Garry Watts’ contract provides that, if the
Company terminates Mr Watts’ appointment with immediate effect, in
addition to his contractual notice period, Mr Watts shall be entitled to a
payment equivalent to the average of any bonus paid within the three
year period prior to the date of termination. The Committee is satisfied
that the inclusion of an award in respect of annual bonus is appropriate,
as this incorporates a performance-related element to any
compensation payment.
If the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, the
Committee’s policy is to apply mitigation to compensation payments at 
a level determined by reference to the individual circumstances of the
Executive Director. Appropriate external human resource advice would
be obtained in each case.

3. Benefits include all taxable benefits arising from employment with 
the Company.

Notes continued
This represented another year of outstanding profitability by 
the company. The target EPS of 23.81p represents an increase 
of 25 per cent over the target set in the previous year (19.1p). 
The Committee has examined various indicators of company
financial and non-financial performance and is comfortable that 
this excellent profitability has been delivered on a sustainable 
basis and within an appropriate risk framework.
Therefore, the cash bonus payments will be:
G. Watts — £718,500; I. Adamson — £362,250; and 
M. Moran – £333,500.
These cash bonuses will be paid in June 2009.

Notes:
1. Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid
annually on retirement based on service to the date the scheme
closed to future accrual (31 August 1995) and based on current
pensionable salary as at the end of the year.
2. The transfer values at the beginning of the year have been calculated
in accordance with version 9.2 of guidance note GN11 issued by the
actuarial profession, however from 1 October 2008 GN11 ceased to
apply. The year end transfer values have been calculated using the
transfer value basis set by the T rustees.
3. The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the
Director of his service during the year. As the scheme closed to future
accrual of benefits in 1995 this increase is zero.
4. The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in
the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company
and Directors, such as stock market movements.
5. Voluntary contributions paid by Directors and resulting benefits are
not shown. Option schemes

Notes:
1. Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share during
the performance period exceeding the retail price index (RPI). The
targets for each grant are as follows:
1.1 Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for 
not less than three years commencing on 1 April 2001 exceeding the
growth in RPI by at least an average 2 per cent p.a. This condition has
been met.
1.2 Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for
three years commencing on 1 April 2002 exceeding the growth in 
RPI by no less than 2 per cent p.a. This condition has been met.
1.3 Exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share for
three years commencing on 1 April 2004 exceeding the growth in 
RPI by no less than 3 per cent p.a. This condition has been met.
1. 4 Exercise is subject to performance conditions that must be satisfied
over initially a three-year period although this may be extended up to five
years. The exercise is subject to growth in normalised earnings per share
exceeding the growth in RPI by at least an average of 3 per cent p.a. and
TSR of the Company when compared to TSR of companies of the FTSE
250 reaching sixth decile for 50 per cent of the option to become
exercisable, between sixth and eighth for a pro-rata between 50 per cent
and 100 per cent of the option to become exercisable and eighth decile
and above for 100 per cent of the option to become exercisable. Both
the earnings per share and TSR condition have been met.
2. Following the disposal of the Group’s medical business (and the
resultant reduction in earnings), the Committee reviewed the
performance conditions attaching to options granted under the 
SSL 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme. It was agreed that the
performance criteria should be rebased to fairly compare historical
earnings with those in the ongoing business, but the rebased figures
should be no less stretching than the previous targets. Given the share
price at the times of grants (which was in excess of 480 pence), the
Committee determined that only earnings since the financial year
ended 31 March 2002 would be reviewed. Consequently the earnings
per share figures for the financial years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004
were rebased. In light of the rise in the share price during the year to 
31 March 2008, the Committee agreed that the earnings per share
figures for the financial year 2001 be rebased. The calculations to
determine all figures were independently checked by Ernst & Young
LLP , although Ernst & Y oung LLP expressed no opinion on the accuracy
of the base data and the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions.

Source: Thompson Financial The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the
Group and parent company financial statements, in accordance with
applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and
parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and 
have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in
accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law (UK
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
The Group financial statements are required by law and 
IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial position and
performance of the Group; the Companies Act 1985 provides in relation
to such financial statements that references in the relevant part of that
Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to
their achieving a fair presentation. 
The parent company financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial
statements, the Directors are required to: 
//
Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
//
Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
//
For the Group financial statements, state whether they have been
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; 
//
For the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable
UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial
statements; and 
//
Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets
of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration
Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law
and those regulations. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the corporate and financial information included on the company’s
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of
the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
//
The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
//
The Directors’ report, Chairman’s statement, Strategy and priorities
section, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review include a fair
review of the development and performance of the business and the
position of the company and the undertakings included in the
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditors’ 
report to the members 
of SSL International plc 
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of SSL International plc for the year ended 
31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, 
the Consolidated and Parent Company balance sheets, the Consolidated
statement of cash flows, the Consolidated statement of recognised
income and expense and the related notes. These financial statements
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We
have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration report
that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, 
we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, 
for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
EU, and for preparing the parent company financial statements and the
Directors’ Remuneration Report in accordance with applicable law and
UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice)
are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 50. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited in accordance
with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and,
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion, the information given in 
the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. The
information given in the Directors’ report includes that information
presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review, the
Strategy and priorities section, the Financial review and the Corporate
responsibility section that is cross referenced from the Business review
section of the Directors’ report. 
In addition, we report to you if , in our opinion, the company 
has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate governance statement
reflects the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
2006 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority , and we report if it does not. W e are not required
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the Annual 
Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with
the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited. 
Opinion 
In our opinion: 
//
The Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance
with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at
31 March 2009 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
//
The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation; 
//
The parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in
accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the
state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2009;
//
The parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration report to be audited, have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
//
The information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Consolidated statement of cash flows
for the year ended 31 March 2009 1. Group accounting policies
In the financial statements and related notes, the term ‘Company’
refers to SSL International plc, a company incorporated in the UK; the
Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’ or ‘SSL’) and equity
account the Group’s interest in associates.
(a) Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going
concern basis, in pounds Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred
thousand and are prepared on an historical cost basis, modified to
include revaluation to fair value of certain financial instruments as
described below. After making enquiries, the Directors have a
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future as detailed in the financial review on page 31.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the Annual Report and financial statements. The Group
financial statements have been prepared and approved by the
Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’). The Company has elected to
prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with
UK GAAP, these are presented on pages 96 to 103. The accounting
policies set out below have been applied consistently in dealing with
items which are considered material in relation to the financial
statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards
have been adopted for the first time.
Amendments to IAS 23: Borrowing Costs. The amendments 
to IAS 23 eliminate the option available under the previous version 
of the standard to recognise all borrowing costs immediately as an
expense. T o the extent that borrowing costs relate to the acquisition,
construction or production of a qualifying asset, the revised standard
requires that they be capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. 
The revised standard applies to borrowing costs relating to qualifying
assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or
after 1 January 2009, although earlier adoption is permitted.
The revised standard has been adopted with effect from 
1 April 2008, and borrowing costs of £0.6 million have been capitalised
during the year ended 31 March 2009 with regard to three ‘qualifying
assets’, those that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get
ready for intended use. No adjustment has been made to the
comparatives as the effective date is 1 April 2008.
SSL’s management considers the following to be the most
important accounting policies in the context of the Group’s operations.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements 
of the Company, entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries)
and the Group’s share of interests in associates.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when
the Group has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain economic
benefits from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries 
are included in the consolidated financial information from the date
control commences until the date that control ceases.
Where the reporting date of the subsidiary undertaking differs
from that of the Group, the Group’s share of results included in the
consolidated income statement is based on rolled forward information
which coincides with the Group’s reporting date.
Associates
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term
interest, usually from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the equity voting
rights, over which it has the power to exert significant influence, but not
control over the financial and operating policy decisions. The Group’s
share of results of its associates is included in the consolidated income
statement on the equity accounting basis from the date that significant
influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
The holding value of associates in the Group’s balance sheet is
calculated by reference to the Group’s cost of investment plus post
acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets of the entity
less any impairment in value. The carrying value of investments in
associates includes any acquired goodwill.
Where the reporting date of the associated undertaking
differs from that of the Group, the Group’s share of results included 
in the consolidated income statement is based on rolled forward
information which coincides with the Group’s reporting date.
T ransactions eliminated on consolidation
Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income
and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains
arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent
of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated 
in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there 
is no evidence of impairment.
(c) Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the
application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Estimates and underlying
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised
and in any future periods affected.
The Directors believe that the most critical accounting
policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise 
from accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19
‘Employee Benefits’, for goodwill and intangible assets under IAS 36
‘Intangible Assets’ and provisions under IAS 37 ‘Provisions, Contingent
Liabilities and Contingent Assets’. Judgement is also required in the
classification of borrowings between current and non-current.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in
accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, but
significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for
future salary and pension increases, inflation, the discount rate applied
to the liabilities, investment returns and member mortality that
underpin their valuations. Information on the assumptions used and
the sensitivity of the liability to a change on the assumptions can be
found in note 17 .
The measurement of intangible assets both on business
combinations and other asset acquisitions requires assessment of 
the existence of such assets and whether they can be separately and
reliably measured. Assumptions and estimates are made about future
cash flows to value identified intangible assets. Annual impairment
reviews are also performed in accordance with IAS 36. For details of
goodwill and intangibles and the impairment reviews performed refer
to note 8.
When accounting for provisions, the Group has taken internal
and external advice in assessing the level of provision required. Details 
of the provisions made and the key assumptions can be found in note 16.
The basis of the classification of the Group’s committed
borrowing facility is provided in note 15.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements (d) Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, being
the value of goods provided during the year net of trade discounts,
cash discounts, retrospective and other rebates, value added and
sales taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon
transfer to the customer of significant risks and rewards of ownership.
Generally this will be when goods are dispatched to the customer.
Credit note reserves are provided at each period-end to account for
management estimates of customer returns and are deducted from
revenue. Any returns in excess of the amount provided would also be
deducted from revenue. Discounts and rebates are accounted for in
the period they are earned.
(e) Business combinations and goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and
businesses, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration
given over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised and is subject to impairment
review annually, and when there is any indication that the carrying value
may not be recoverable.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business
acquired since 1 March 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or
termination is calculated after charging the carrying value of any
related goodwill.
Prior to transition to IFRS, goodwill was amortised in line 
with UK GAAP. On transition to IFRS, the goodwill balance was frozen.
The Group’s policy up to and including the year ended 
28 February 1998 was to write off goodwill arising upon acquisition
against reserves. Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3 such goodwill will remain
eliminated against reserves and will not form part of any subsequent
profit/loss on disposal.
(f) Other intangible assets
Intangible assets that are acquired, which can be separately identified
and the cost of which can be measured reliably, are capitalised and
amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic
lives subject to any recognised impairment in value, usually between
3—20 years. The fair value of brands acquired in a business combination
or with other assets is based on the discounted estimated royalty
payments that have been avoided as a result of the brand being owned.
The fair value of customer relationships acquired is determined by
discounting estimated future net cash flows from the customer. In
determining the useful economic life each asset is reviewed separately
and consideration given to the period over which the Group expects to
derive economic benefit from the asset. The useful economic life for
significant assets is reviewed annually.
Software developments and licences capitalised are stated 
at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
//
Software development: 5—10 years; and
//
Software licences: over the length of the licence.
Where an asset is deemed to have an indefinite useful economic life 
it is not amortised but is, instead, subject to annual impairment review
to ensure the carrying value of the asset is supportable.
(g) Impairment
Financial assets
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired. A financial
asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that
one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future
cash flows of that asset. All impairment losses are recognised in profit
or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying value of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than
inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount 
is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite
lives, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of 
an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable asset group that
generates cash flows that largely are independent from other assets
and groups. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are
allocated first to reduce the carrying value of any goodwill allocated to
the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets 
in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit
is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In
assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. 
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior
periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that 
the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is
reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation,
if no impairment loss had been recognised.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment assets are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment in value. 
As noted above, the amendments to IAS 23: Borrowing Costs have
been adopted with effect from 1 April 2008, and to the extent that
borrowing costs relate to the acquisition, construction or production 
of a qualifying asset, borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the 
cost of that asset. Depreciation is provided to write property, plant 
and equipment down to a residual value over their estimated useful
economic lives on a straight line basis at the following annual rates:
//
Freehold land: No depreciation is charged on freehold land;
//
Freehold and leasehold buildings: 2 per cent of cost or over the life 
of the lease if less than 50 years; 
//
Motor vehicles: 25 per cent of cost;
//
Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings: 7 per cent to 25 per cent 
of cost; and 
//
Assets under the course of construction: No depreciation is charged
on assets under the course of construction.
The residual value and estimated useful economic life for significant
property, plant and equipment is reassessed annually.
(i) Leases
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. All other
leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included
within property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value and the
present value of minimum lease payments. Each asset is depreciated
over the shorter of the lease term or the asset’s useful life. 1. Group accounting policies continued
The obligations related to finance leases, net of finance lease charges
in respect of future periods, are included within financial liabilities. 
The interest element of the rental agreement is charged to the income
statement over the term of the lease to reflect a constant rate of
interest on the outstanding capital amount payable.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the income
statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Lease
incentives are spread over the term of the lease on a straight line basis.
( j) Foreign currency transactions
T ransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective
functional currencies of Group entities using the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the foreign exchange
arising is taken to the income statement. 
Financial statements of foreign operations
Income statements of foreign operations are translated into Sterling 
at the average rate applicable to the respective accounting period as
an approximation of the rate at the date the transactions took place.
Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, of foreign operations
are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet
date. Gains or losses on translations of foreign operations are included
as a movement on the cumulative foreign exchange reserve. On
a subsequent disposal such gains or losses will form part of the
profit/loss on disposal within the income statement. Gains and 
losses prior to adoption of IFRS are deemed to be nil.
Net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net
investment in a foreign operation, that is determined to be an effective
hedge, is included as a movement in the cumulative foreign exchange
reserve. On a subsequent disposal such gains or losses will form 
part of the profit/loss on disposal within the income statement. 
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
(k) Post-retirement benefits
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for defined contribution plans are recognised as an
expense in the income statement when they are due.
Defined benefit plans
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension 
plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount
of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their
service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to
determine its present value, and any unrecognised past service costs
and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted. The discount rate 
is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The
calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit
credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group,
the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised
past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic
benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the
plan or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the
increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised 
in the income statement on a straight line basis over the average period
until the benefits become vested. T o the extent that the benefits vest
immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income
statement. The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising
from defined benefit plans directly in equity immediately.
(l) Employee benefits
Share-based payment transactions
The Group operates a number of employee share schemes. The fair
value of employee share options granted is recognised as an employee
expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is
measured at grant date, using an appropriate valuation model, taking
into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options
were granted. These will include both performance and service
conditions. The resulting cost is charged to the income statement 
over the vesting period of the options. At each balance sheet date the
cumulative charge in respect of each option plan is adjusted to reflect
expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect
of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as
an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement
date. Any changes in the fair value are recognised within the income
statement as a personnel expense.
For options granted before 7 November 2002 the recognition
and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied in
accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1. Any cost in relation
to these options is expensed to the income statement as incurred.
Overseas termination benefits
The Group’s net obligation in respect of termination benefits other
than pension plans is the amount of future benefit that employees
have earned in return for their service in current and prior periods, 
that benefit is discounted to determine the present value, and the fair
value of any related asset is deducted. The discount rate is the yield at
the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates
approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation 
is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit
method. Any actuarial gains or losses are recognised directly in equity
immediately.
(m) Research and development
Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is
incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised only if it gives rise to
an identifiable intangible asset and where the development costs can
be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially
feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group
intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development 
and to sell the asset. Other development expenditure is recognised 
in profit or loss as incurred. No development costs are capitalised 
at 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2008.
(n) Cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are current asset investments, which are disposable
without curtailing or disrupting the business, and are either readily
convertible into known amounts of cash, at, or close to their carrying
values or traded in an active market. Cash equivalents comprise short-
term bank deposits which have a maturity of three months or less at
the date of acquisition (other than cash).
(o) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for
resale, the FIFO method is used, and includes expenditure incurred 
in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location
and condition. For work in progress and finished goods, cost is taken 
as production cost which includes an appropriate proportion of
overheads based upon normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price
less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in
marketing, selling and distribution.

//
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued (p) Grant income
Revenue grants are recognised in the income statement as a reduction
in the related expense.
Capital grants are shown in deferred income within the
balance sheet and released to match the depreciation charge on 
the associated asset.
(q) Income tax
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised
in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income
for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the
balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of
previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred 
tax provided is based upon the expected manner of realisation or
settlement of the carrying values of the assets or liabilities, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary
differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction
that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting
nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments and
subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised 
for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition 
of goodwill.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which
the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the 
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will 
be available to allow all or part of the asset to be realised.
(r) Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a
present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, which
can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material,
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash
flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
(s) Financial instruments
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to hedge
its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from
operational, financing and investment activities. The Group does not
hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at 
fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial
instruments are stated at fair value. The fair value of derivative financial
instruments is determined by reference to discounted cash flows or
option valuation models. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge
accounting, any gains or losses on remeasurement are immediately
recognised in the Income Statement. Where derivatives qualify for
hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends 
on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged. 
The effectiveness of hedges is tested at each period end to ensure 
that the hedge remains effective.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially stated at fair value 
less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any
difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in 
the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an
effective interest basis.
Fair value hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value 
of a recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from remeasuring 
the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income
Statement within financing costs. Any change in the fair value of the
hedged item, attributable to the hedged risk, is adjusted against the
carrying value of the hedged item and recognised immediately in the
Income Statement within financing costs.
Cash flow hedging
Derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges
when they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised
asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging
instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly 
in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. T o the extent the
hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Discontinuance of hedge accounting
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge
accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity remains there until the forecast
transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the
amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of
the asset when it is recognised. In other cases the amount recognised
in equity is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the
hedged item affects profit or loss.
(t) Treasury shares
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount 
of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is
recognised as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified 
as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.
(u) Investments 
Investments in equity securities held by the Group are classified as
available for sale financial assets and are stated at fair value. Where
there is no active market for unlisted shares held, the investment is
held at cost and subject to annual impairment testing.
(v) Borrowings
The drawndown committed Group facility at the balance sheet date 
is split between current and non-current based upon the Directors’
expectations of the level of drawdown required for the next 12 months.
Accounting standards issued but not adopted
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International
Financial Reporting Committee (IFRIC) have also issued the following
standards and interpretations which have been endorsed by the EU at
31 March 2009 with an effective date of implementation after the date
of these financial statements.
International Accounting Standards Board:
IFRS 8: ‘Operating segments’ is effective for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. The standard specifies how 
an entity should report information about its operating segments in
annual financial statements, and sets out requirements for related
disclosures about products and services, geographical areas and
major customers. Adoption of this standard will have no impact upon
the results or net assets of the Group. 1. Group accounting policies continued
Amendments to:
//
IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements: A revised presentation.
The revised standard requires the aggregation of information in the
financial statements on the basis of shared characteristics, with the
option of presenting income and expense and components of other
comprehensive income either in a single statement or in two
separate statements (a separate income statement followed by a
statement of comprehensive income).
//
IFRS 2: Share based payments: vesting conditions and cancellations.
The amendment to IFRS 2 clarifies the term ‘vesting conditions’ and
provides the accounting treatment for non-vesting conditions and
cancellations. Non-vesting conditions must be taken into account 
in the estimation of the fair value of the instrument at the grant date,
and failure to meet a non-vesting condition during the vesting period
must be treated as a cancellation. The amount of the compensation
cost that otherwise would be recognised over the remainder of the
vesting period is recognised immediately on cancellation, normally 
in profit and loss. If the share-based payment includes a liability
component, then the liability is remeasured to fair value at the date
of cancellation prior to its settlement.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards
and interpretations will have a material effect on the Group’s financial
statements in the period of initial application.
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee:
Interpretations 
IFRIC 14: IAS 19 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum
Funding Requirements and their Interaction. Paragraph 58 of IAS 19
‘Employee Benefits’ limits the measurement of a defined benefit asset
to the ‘present value of economic benefits available in the form of
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the 
plan.’ IFRIC 14 addresses the interaction between a minimum funding
requirement and the limit placed by paragraph 58 of IAS 19 on the
measurement of the defined benefit asset or liability. Under IFRIC 14,
entities are required to measure any economic benefits available to
them in the form of refunds or reductions in future contributions at the
maximum amount that is consistent with the terms and conditions of
the plan and any statutory requirements in the jurisdiction of the plan.
The impact of IFRIC 14 on the Group’s defined benefit obligations at 
31 March 2009 has been assessed as detailed in note 17; IFRIC 14 will be
adopted by the Group for the financial year commencing 1 April 2009.
No significant impact is expected from other standards and
interpretations that are endorsed but not yet effective.

One-off charges during 2008 — European Supply Chain restructuring
During the prior financial year, the Group announced several phases of restructuring projects with regard to the European Supply Chain, and 
the early repayment of loan notes and early settlement of related derivative balances. The key aspects of the restructuring programme were:
//
Closure of the Spanish manufacturing plant in Rubi, with transfer of production to India and Thailand;
//
Closure of the T echnical Services Centre in Cambridge, with its activities transferred to the technical centres at Peterlee, Thailand and India;
//
Restructuring of the Footwear Development Group; and
//
Closure of the Guernsey manufacturing facility, with production to be transferred to the Peterlee facility or to third-party suppliers.
The one-off charges to operating profit during 2008 were £41.3 million with regards to the closures of the manufacturing and technical services
facilities and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group, and £5.2 million one-off financial expenses relating to the early repayment 
of loan notes and early settlement of related derivatives. 3. Financial income and expense

The effective tax rate for the period is 27 .5 per cent on profit before tax and one-off charges (2008: 28 per cent). The total charge of £21.0 million 
(2008: £11.8 million) includes a credit of £nil relating to the one-off charges (2008: £4.3 million). Included within the overseas taxation is 
a benefit of £2.5 million arising from previously unrecognised deferred tax assets (2008: £1.2 million).
Deferred tax charged to the income statement in the year arises principally in respect of the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
The phased abolition of Industrial Building Allowances in the UK was enacted in the 2008 Finance Act. The effect of this was an increase in the
current year tax charge of £1.4 million (2008: £nil).

Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unused income tax losses of £221.0 million (2008: £176.6 million), and unused 
capital losses of £146.1 million (2008: £142.0 million). The increase in income tax losses in the year of £44.4 million is explained by a foreign
currency retranslation difference of £54.5 million on losses carried forward at 2008, net of a decrease in losses carried forward of £10.1 million.
It is probable that future taxable profit will not be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits therefrom. Included in the losses 
are US income tax losses of USD 102 million (2008: USD 120 million) which are unlikely to be available for use due to the change of ownership
restrictions.
£50.0 million (2008: £44.9 million) of income tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining losses held in overseas entities may
expire over periods of up to 20 years.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of the £69.1 million (2008: £43.1 million) of unremitted earnings of non-UK subsidiaries
because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary timing difference and it is not probable that such
differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.

Earnings/(loss) per share (‘EPS’) has been calculated by dividing the profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders is as follows:

Profit/(loss) for the year 54.5 (2.9)

Add back net impact of one-off charges — 42.2
Profit before one-off charges for adjusted EPS 54.5 39.3
The calculation of diluted earnings per share uses basic earnings as defined above, and the basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 
in issue during the period, adjusted as follows:
2009 2008
Weighted average number of shares (millions) 
Number of ordinary shares at start of year 190.6 190.2
Effect of shares issued in the year and share options exercised 4.0 0.4 
For basic earnings per share 194.6 190.6 
Dilutive effect of share options 4.0 1.8 
For diluted earnings per share 198.6 192.4 
The dilutive effect of share options is only considered when a loss is made to the extent that the dilutive effect increases the loss per share. 
The diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2008 is therefore equal to the basic loss per share.

Included within plant, equipment and motor vehicles are assets held under finance leases with a net book value of £0.1 million (2008: £0.2 million). 
As detailed in note 3, additions during the year ended 31 March 2009 includes £0.6 million of capitalised borrowing costs (2008: £nil). 
The carrying value of temporarily idle plant at the year end is £nil (2008: £nil). 
Group assets held under course of construction total £22.8 million (2008: £1.6 million) of which £22.8 million (2008: £1.6 million) is included

expansion of the manufacturing facilities in Thailand.
As assets are transferred onto SAP, fully written down assets are removed from the system. This is the main driver of the high level of disposals

Amortisation and impairment charges are recognised within administrative expenses within the income statement. For the purposes of
impairment testing of goodwill, the Group is regarded as several cash-generating units, one for each component of goodwill recognised at 
the balance sheet date, and one for all other consumer products. The cash-generating units’ recoverable amounts are based on value in use
calculations using projections of the Group’s performance over 10–15 years, periods reflecting the Directors’ best estimates of the cash flows.
Key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in revenues and direct costs during
the period. Risk adjusted pre-tax discount factors of 11.4–12.0 per cent (2008: 9–10.4 per cent) have been applied to the projections. The pre-tax
discount rate has been based on management’s calculation of the pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) using the capital asset
pricing model to calculate the cost of equity. A range of alphas were used to reflect the risk of the cash-generating units. The Directors do not
believe that a reasonably possible change of assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts to fall below book value for any of the following
material assets. Further details are provided below for material assets.
Material assets
Scholl brand 
The Scholl brand, with a carrying value of £61.4 million at 31 March 2009 (2008: £60.8 million), is not amortised. The brand has been tested 
for impairment using the method described below. No charge for impairment was required in the year.
For the purposes of impairment testing of the Scholl brand, the Group is regarded as two cash-generating units, that part relating to Scholl-
branded products and that relating to all other consumer products. The Scholl brand’s recoverable amount was determined by discounting
future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the brand using the following key assumptions: 
//
Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results;
//
Revenue growth was anticipated at 2 per cent (2008: 2 per cent) per annum and operating results held at a constant percentage of revenue 
for a further period of nine years. This is considered a conservative medium-term assumption based on prior performance;
//
Operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the Directors’ assertion that the brand has an indefinite 
useful economic life based upon its proven value over long periods and its position in the market which is considered sustainable for the
foreseeable future; and
//
A risk adjusted discount factor of 11.4 per cent (2008: 9.0 per cent) was applied to the projections.
For the Scholl brand to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase to 
22 per cent before the brand’s value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows
would decrease the valuation by £12.9 million, however the brand would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage
by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £12.6 million, however the brand would still show no impairment.  Goodwill arising on acquisition of Qingdao London Durex Company Limited ‘China Goodwill’
Goodwill denominated in Chinese Renminbi arose on the acquisition of the remaining 50 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Qingdao
London Durex Company Limited in January 2007 . The carrying value of the goodwill at 31 March 2009 is £26.4 million (2008: £17 .2 million).
For the purposes of impairment testing of the China goodwill, the Chinese commercial business and manufacturing entities of Qingdao London
Durex Company Limited and SSL Healthcare Shanghai Limited were identified as a single cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount was
determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill using the following key assumptions:
//
Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results;
//
Revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent (2008: 3 per cent) per annum, based on medium to long-term forecasts, with operating results
held at a constant percentage of revenue for a further period of nine years. This is in line with historic experience;
//
Operating results were then held at the year ten figures into perpetuity reflecting the expected maintenance of the position in the market; and
//
A risk adjusted discount factor of 12.0 per cent (2008: 10.4 per cent) was applied to the projections.
For the China goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase 
to 61 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing the revenue growth from the expected cash flows would
decrease the valuation by £22.2 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage 
by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £2.7 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. 
Vasyli goodwill and intangible assets
The Vasyli business was acquired in November 2007 , with goodwill of £12.8 million initially recognised on acquisition. During the current financial
year, the Directors have reviewed the contingent consideration payable in June 2010, as detailed in note 16, and consequently the goodwill
relating to the Vasyli business has increased to £20.7 million at 31 March 2009. The carrying value of the other intangible assets acquired as part 
of the Vasyli acquisition at 31 March 2009 is £3.1 million (2008: £3.5 million).
An impairment review has been performed at 31 March 2009 in relation to the revised goodwill of £20.7 million. The Vasyli business,
encompassing sales of the Orthaheel, Orthastyle, Vasyli and VAS brands across the Group, was identified as a single cash-generating unit. 
The recoverable amount was determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated from continuing use of the goodwill 
using the following key assumptions:
//
Cash flows for year one were based upon budgeted operating results;
//
Cash flows for years two and three were based upon the business plan forecast operating results;
//
Revenue growth was anticipated at 3 per cent (2008: 3 per cent) per annum from year four to year ten, nil thereafter, and operating results 
held at a constant percentage of revenue;
//
Operating results were then held at the year ten figures for a further ten years reflecting the current expected useful life of the goodwill 
and related brands and the longer-term strategic benefit of the integration of the Vasyli business with that of Scholl footcare; and
//
A risk adjusted discount factor of 11.8 per cent (2008: 10.4 per cent) was applied to the projections.
For the Vasyli goodwill to be be impaired, with all other assumptions held constant, the risk adjusted discount factor would need to increase 
to 29 per cent before the value in use calculation showed any impairment. Removing all revenue growth from the expected cash flows would
decrease the valuation by £23.2 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. A decrease in the operating margin percentage 
by one percentage point would reduce the valuation by £1.4 million, however the goodwill would still show no impairment. 
The remaining goodwill is made up of a number of balances, all individually less than £3.9 million, with a total net book value of £11.1 million.
Impairment reviews have been performed in respect of all balances held.
Other intangible assets includes £6.9 million (2008: £6.3 million) relating to software development and licences, and a number of other balances
all under £3.0 million individually.
Additions
On 31 December 2008, the Group completed the acquisition of the Crest condom brand (comprising Crest and Hot Rubber condom, lubricant
and devices brands) and associated customer relationships. The cash consideration was 7 million Swiss Francs (£4.6 million).

The Group holds a strategic non-controlling interest of 11 per cent in Sirius Global Solutions Limited, acquired during the year ended 31 March
2008, which is classified as a financial asset available for sale. Sirius Global Solutions Limited is an unquoted entity, therefore fair value of the
shareholding cannot be readily ascertained; the investment is therefore held at initial cost and subject to annual impairment review.
On 19 May 2008 the Group completed the first stage of its investment in Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV, ‘BLBV’, acquiring a 15.5 per cent
stake for £30.7 million including acquisition costs, with the ability to purchase the remainder exercisable at future dates over the next two years.
The investment is classed as a financial asset available for sale and is held at fair value. The Directors consider that fair value approximates to cost
at 31 March 2009. The Directors concluded that it was not appropriate to account for the investment in BLBV as an associate because the Group
holds less than 20 per cent of the voting power, had no representation on the Board of BLBV, and the options to purchase the remainder of BLBV
were not exercisable at the balance sheet date; it was concluded that the Group does not exercise significant influence over the financial and
operating policy decisions of BLBV.

The disclosures overleaf detail the cash flow hedge relationships between the Group’s variable rate loans and interest rate swaps. 15. Borrowings and derivative financial liabilities continued
The principal features of the Group’s borrowings are as follows:
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand. Overdrafts and facilities of £13.5 million (2008: £10.9 million) are unsecured. Various overdraft
facilities exist across the Group, including a UK facility of £7 .5 million (2008: £7 .5 million) (net). The average effective interest rate on bank
overdraft approximates 1.25 per cent (2008: 4.7 per cent) per annum.
The Group has the following bank facilities:
//
A syndicated Group facility of £220 million available until January 2012, of which £137 .4 million (2008: £123.0 million) had been drawn down 
at 31 March 2009. Drawdowns can be made for periods of one, two, three or six months, or any other mutually-agreed term in any currency;
interest rates are set at the corresponding LIBOR plus 50 basis points at the time of the drawdown;
//
The individual drawdowns under the Group facility at 31 March 2009 all had repayment dates in April 2009; however, at the balance sheet 
date, the Group had the ability to roll over these drawdowns, and expects that they all would be rolled over for at least 12 months. As a result, 
the borrowings under the facility were classed as non-current. At 31 March 2008, the individual drawdowns all had repayment dates within
12 months of the balance sheet date; however, there was uncertainty as to the funding requirements of the Group for the year ahead,
specifically with regards to the acquisition of Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV (note 9), and whether equity finance might be raised during
the forthcoming year. In light of the uncertainty as to whether any of the drawdowns would be rolled over for more than 12 months after the
balance sheet date, all drawdowns at 31 March 2008 were disclosed within current liabilities; and
//
SSL Healthcare Italia SpA has fixed rate unsecured loans of £10.2 million (2008: £8.8 million) which are rolled forward every three months; 
as there is no committed facility, these loans are disclosed within current liabilities.
Undrawn borrowing facilities
At 31 March 2009, the Group had available £82.6 million (2008: £97 .0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all
conditions precedent had been met.

Interest rate basis swaps: three month LIBOR to one month LIBOR 0.2 (0.1)

Within the total facility drawndown of £137 .4 million, £60.0 million has been hedged from a floating to fixed interest rate. The £60.0 million
drawdowns on the Group facility designated as part of the cash flow hedge relationship are for periods of one month, repayable in April 2009, and
therefore are held at notional value which is deemed equivalent to fair value. The interest rate swaps are held at fair value. Changes in fair value
totalling £3.2 million (2008: £0.7 million) have been charged directly to equity in relation to fair value movements in the interest rate swaps during
the year ended 31 March 2009. Changes in fair value of £0.1 million (2008: £nil) previously credited directly to equity have been recycled through
profit and loss in the current year. The cash flow hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
Bank loans held as a net investment hedge
The Japanese Yen drawdown on the Group Facility of £6.5 million, 913 million Yen (2008: £4.6 million, 913 million Yen) is designated as a net
investment hedge of the Group’s investment in subsidiaries denominated in Japanese Yen. As explained in note 19, the net investment hedge 
was 100 per cent effective in the current and prior year.
Obligations under finance leases 
Finance lease liabilities are secured on the assets to which they relate. The average lease term outstanding is one year. For the year ended
31 March 2009, the average effective borrowing rate was 6.7 per cent (2008: 7 .1 per cent). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. 
The lease obligations are denominated in Thai Baht, and the fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates their carrying value.

Overseas termination benefits 
Included with overseas termination benefits is an amount of £3.8 million (2008: £3.0 million) for termination benefits payable to employees 
in a number of overseas subsidiaries. Benefits accrue with service and are payable to employees upon departure from the Group regardless of
the reason for such departure. Benefits may be calculated with reference to an average salary over the service life of the employee or the final
salary of the employee. Differences arising due to changes in assumptions in calculating the liability for employees are taken through equity in
accordance with IAS 19 and are included above within exchange and other movements. The main assumptions underlying the calculation (on 
a weighted average basis across the various schemes) are salary increases of 3.0 per cent, an inflation rate of 2.0 per cent and a discount rate of
6.9 per cent. The calculation of the provision is determined by contractual obligation. No terminations are expected in the forthcoming year.
Provision is also made for termination payments which may be required for sales agents. At the year end an amount of £1.0 million was provided
(2008: £1.0 million). The amount provided is based upon payments which would be required under collective agreements to sales agents 
upon termination of their contracts by the Group. Increases and decreases in the provision, aside from utilisation, are reflected within the 
income statement.
Disposals 
Following the Group’s disposal of the medical business, in 2004 and 2005, a number of disposal provisions were created for the ongoing
commitments of the Group in respect of the disposals. The Group had utilised the majority of these provisions during previous years, with 
the residual balance transferred into environmental provisions included within the ‘other’ category during the prior financial year.
Manufacturing restructuring 
During 2005 the Group announced its decision to close the Derby manufacturing plant and transfer production to India. This process was
completed during the year ended 31 March 2008.
Group and commercial restructuring 
The Group completed its previous rationalisation and restructuring of commercial operations during the prior financial year.
European Supply Chain restructuring 
During the prior financial year, as part of the European Supply Chain restructuring detailed in note 2, provisions of £41.3 million were made in
relation to the closure of the manufacturing facilities at Rubi (Spain) and Guernsey, the closure of the T echnical Services Centre in Cambridge,
and the restructuring of the Footwear Development Group. Following the announcement of phase 1 of this restructuring programme in 
September 2007 , a provision of £5.2 million was recorded in relation to the early repayment of loan notes and settlement of related 
derivatives, giving a total provision created in the prior year of £46.5 million. Surplus property provisions in relation to the closure of these 
sites of £2.6 million was transferred to the surplus property provision within the ‘other’ provision. 
Operations in Spain and Cambridge had ceased by 31 March 2008; operations in Guernsey ceased, and substantially all of the remaining
European Supply Chain restructuring activities were completed during the current financial year, with £19.5 million of the provision utilised. 
The remaining elements of the restructuring programme to be completed are the final integration and validation of plant transferred 
from Guernsey to Peterlee, and the disposal of the surplus owned and leased properties in Guernsey and Rubi, Spain. The key remaining 
uncertainties at the balance sheet date were in relation to the disposal of these properties, for example whether the properties will be 
sold or sub-let, the potential proceeds receivable under either alternative, and the time period in which the disposals will be completed. 
It is anticipated that all of the remaining European Supply Chain restructuring provision will be utilised within the forthcoming year, subject 
to property transactions being completed.
76 / 77 //////////  Financial statements / Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
//
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued Other 
Other provisions relate to a number of pre-merger environmental provisions of £1.5 million and surplus property provisions of £6.2 million.
Environmental provisions are provided for to the extent that a present obligation exists, it is probable such costs will be incurred and they 
can be estimated reliably by external experts. No provision is made for possible additional costs that are not currently probable. 
The surplus property provision relates to Group commitments under non-cancellable leases which, following historical restructuring exercises,
are no longer used by the Group. The obligation, net of expected rental income, has been provided for.
Surplus property and environmental costs of £6.0 million have been included as non-current. It is expected that all other provisions will be 
utilised during the next financial year. 
Contingent consideration 
Contingent consideration of £9.4 million relates to the acquisition of the Vasyli business during the previous financial year, and is payable in June
2010. The consideration is contingent upon the level of Orthaheel-branded sales achieved across the Group in the year ended 31 March 2010,
and is capped at AUD $42.0 million. 
The amount recognised within provisions during the year ended 31 March 2009 reflects the increase in the amount which is considered probable
to be paid, based on actual sales for 2008/09 and detailed budgets and growth forecasts for 2009/10. There are inherent uncertainties in
deriving sales forecasts, as the Group has introduced Orthaheel products into several new markets during 2008/09, and will launch these
products into further new territories in 2009/10. The level of contingent consideration will be reassessed at each reporting date to reflect
revisions to forecasts or differences between budget and actual sales performance.
17 . Post-retirement benefits
The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans in the UK and overseas. All UK defined benefit
schemes are closed to new entrants and no further benefits are accruing.
UK Pensions
(a) Defined contribution schemes
Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees. It also operates defined
contribution executive pension plans for senior executives. Employer contributions are charged to the income statement in the period in 
which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was £1.5 million (2008: £1.3 million).
(b) Defined benefit schemes
The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to
form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999. All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants and no
further benefits are accruing. Benefits for members who are still employed by the Group remain linked to their final earnings. The finances of all
schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. The
schemes provide benefits for employees as outlined below:
( i ) Seton
Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees. Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased
in August 1995, but existing benefits at that date are being maintained. The latest valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2006. The Group expects
to make contributions of £0.5 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 5 April 2009 actuarial valuation
for funding purposes.
( ii ) Scholl
Accrual of further service related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in August 2000, but benefits accrued to 31 August 2000
continue to be provided from the scheme. The most recent valuation by independent actuaries was at 5 April 2006. The Group expects to make
contributions of £0.6 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 5 April 2009 actuarial valuation for
funding purposes.
( iii ) LIG
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001
continue to be provided from the scheme. The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2006. The Group expects to make
contributions of £8.2 million into the scheme during the next financial year, subject to the results of the 31 March 2009 actuarial valuation for
funding purposes. 17 . Post-retirement benefits continued
Overseas pensions and similar obligations
The Group has a number of pension schemes in different countries, both defined benefit and defined contribution. Defined benefit schemes 
are set up under separate trust funds and liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries. 
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of overseas defined contribution schemes was £2.4 million (2008: £2.2 million).
Details of the material overseas defined benefit schemes are included below. The most recent actuarial valuations for each scheme were
updated for IAS 19 purposes to 31 March 2009 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries in determining the present value of the liabilities were:

For the UK schemes, the mortality assumption was updated at 31 March 2009 to include a minimum underpin for future improvements in
mortality of 1.0 per cent per annum for males and 0.5 per cent per annum for females. The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old male retiring
in the current period is 20.7 years (2008: 20.1 years) and for a male retiring in 20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 22.6 years (2008: 21.2 years).
The assumed life expectancy for a 65 year old female retiring in the current period is 23.2 years (2008: 23.0 years) and for a female retiring in 
20 years at age 65, life expectancy is 24.4 years (2008: 24.0 years). 
The expected rate of return on pension scheme assets is determined as management’s best estimate of the long-term returns of the major
asset classes in which the schemes invest — equities, corporate bonds, and government bonds for the UK schemes, and insurance contracts 
for the overseas schemes — weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date. Based on the
assumptions made and the distribution of assets, the weighted average expected return on assets as at 31 March 2009 is 6.4 per cent 
(31 March 2008: 6.3 per cent). These rates are net of an allowance for investment management expenses. An allowance for administrative
expenses is included in the present value of scheme liabilities.

Severance costs of £1.0 million (2008: £17 .3 million) are not included in the above.
Full details of Directors’ remuneration, shares and options are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 49.
The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Group’s employee incentive schemes provide competitive market-related
packages to motivate employees. They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term
share ownership of the Company. 
Group annual bonus scheme
This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees within the UK and overseas. Annual bonuses are paid in cash
and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures. Maximum bonuses are paid upon achievement of 105 per cent of the target 
for Executive Directors and senior employees. This reduces on a straight line basis to 40 per cent of the maximum for the achievement of the
target. The bonus further reduces in a straight line to 10 per cent of the maximum for reaching 97 .5 per cent of the target. No bonus is payable 
for achieving less than 97 .5 per cent of the target.
Local bonus schemes
Individual countries run local bonus schemes for senior employees who fall outside the Group annual bonus scheme. Performance targets 
are set locally and payment of bonuses is at the discretion of local management.
Executive share option plans
The Group has a number of executive share option schemes:
London International Group 1991 scheme
This scheme was open to senior executives of London International Group prior to the merger with Seton Scholl Healthcare plc in 1999. No
further grants may be made under this scheme. All outstanding options have performance targets attached to them which have been met. 
The outstanding options expired on 3 December 2007 .
SSL 1990 share option scheme
This was a senior executive scheme approved in June 1990 for a period of 10 years. As the scheme has now expired, no further grants may be
made. All outstanding options in the scheme will expire in June 2010. Exercise of any grants made since June 1999 is subject to performance
targets being met. 
SSL 1996 share option scheme
This is a senior executive scheme approved in July 1996 for a period of 10 years. No further grants may be made after July 2006. Prior to March
2005, annual grants were made under this scheme following announcement of final results. Since the development of the new Performance
Share Plan, as detailed overleaf , no grants have been made during the current or prior year. Exercise of all grants is subject to performance 
targets being met. 18. Employee costs and share option plans for employees continued
Long T erm Incentive Plan
This is a scheme approved in July 1999 for senior executives. No further awards may be made under the plan after 31 July 2010. Awards may be
made of deferred shares, funded by the sacrifice of up to 50 per cent of the executive’s annual bonus. These deferred shares are matched by
performance shares, the transfer of which is conditional upon certain performance targets being met. Dividends are payable to the executives 
on the deferred shares. Awards were made under this scheme in July 2000, 2001 and 2002. No subsequent awards have been made. The
performance targets were not met for the 2000 and 2001 awards, but were met for the 2002 award.
SSL International Stock Purchase Plan
This is a scheme operating within the US business which was approved by the Board in August 2001 and launched in September 2001. No further
offering may be made after August 2011. Employees may choose to save each month during a one year offering period. At the end of the offering
period, employees may purchase shares at a discount of 15 per cent on the lower of the first day or last day market price. No offers have been
made since January 2005.
SSL Sharesave Scheme
This is an HM Revenue & Customs approved savings-related scheme approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM in July 1996. No further
grants may be made under the scheme after July 2006. The last grants made under the scheme were in January 2005. 
Options were only granted to employees who entered into HM Revenue & Customs-approved savings contracts, with the savings body
nominated by the Company. Savings of a fixed amount (not less than £5 nor more than £250) are made over a period of three or five years. 
The number of ordinary shares over which an option is granted will be such that the total amount payable on its exercise will be the proceeds 
on maturity of the related savings contract. No payment was required for the grant of an option. Options are not transferable. Employees 
may choose to withdraw from the scheme at which point they will receive their cash savings plus interest. 
Acquisition price
The price per Ordinary share payable upon the exercise of an option was 80 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for an
ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on the dealing date prior to the date on which invitations to apply for options were issued.
Exercise of options
An option will normally be exercisable for six months commencing on the third or fifth anniversary of the start of the related savings contract.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new shares or through the Seton Healthcare Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership T rust either
by newly issued shares or market purchases by the T rust. Options will normally lapse upon cessation of employment.
SSL International plc Global Share Savings Plan
This scheme was approved at the Company’s AGM in July 2001 and launched in September 2001. No grants may be made under the plan after
July 2011. No grants were made during the current or previous financial year.
Eligibility
The scheme has been launched to date in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia,
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, T aiwan, Thailand 
and T urkey.
Grant of options
The scheme operates in a similar way to the SSL UK sharesave scheme, however savings are made with local banks in local currencies.
Acquisition price
The price per Ordinary share payable upon the exercise of an option will be 80 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for 
an ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange on the dealing date prior to the date on which invitations to apply for options are issued.
Exercise of options
An option will normally be exercisable for six months commencing on the third or fifth anniversary of the start of the related savings contract.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan
This plan was in operation for the 2005/06 financial year only, and was intended to provide a focused incentive upon achievement of short-term
financial objectives. Under the scheme, executives were awarded a bonus upon achievement of EPS targets, capped at 100 per cent of salary for
the Chief Executive and 75 per cent of salary for Executive Directors. The bonus earned was converted into an equivalent notional number of
shares at a price of 321.75 pence and deferred until 30 March 2007 . Payment was subject to the employee remaining in service at that point in
time. The amount paid, in cash, in April 2007 was the value of the notional number of shares awarded multiplied by the average share price during
March 2007 .

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued Performance Share Plan
This plan, approved at the Company’s AGM in July 2005, is the Company’s only active long-term incentive plan. Eligibility is restricted to the Chief
Executive and senior executives (approximately the top 35 employees). Annual grants do not normally exceed 100 per cent of base salary. Shares
are awarded and will vest after three years subject to performance conditions being met. 
The 2008 Remuneration Report detailed a proposed exceptional award of 200 per cent of base salary to the Executive Directors and certain
other key senior executives (at lower multiples of base salary). This exceptional or ‘Super’ PSP scheme was approved, and awards were made 
in July 2008; the performance period is three years to March 2011, with 50 per cent of the award vesting in March 2012 and 50 per cent vesting 
in March 2013.
Executive share option plans and share savings plans
The executive share option plans include executive options that have a TSR performance condition attached. These options have been valued
using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. All other options have been valued using the Black Scholes formula. There have been no share options
granted in the current or preceding financial year. The fair value of the services received for share options granted in earlier years was calculated
at the date of grant and disclosure of the assumptions applied in valuing those options was provided in the annual report in the applicable year.

The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations as well as from the
translation of liabilities that hedge the Group’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries. During the year, foreign exchange losses of £1.8 million
(2008: losses of £0.5 million) on foreign currency borrowings were offset by gains of £1.8 million (2008: gains of £0.5 million) arising from
retranslation of foreign assets, designated as the hedging instrument. The net investment hedge was 100 per cent effective in the current 
and prior year.

Share placing
19,190,000 new Ordinary shares of 10 pence were placed with institutions at a price of £4.55 per share on 28 January 2009, generating gross
proceeds of £87 .3 million (£84.3 million net of financing costs, some of which had been accrued but not paid at 31 March 2009). The share
placing was enacted via the use of a new subsidiary company, SSL Capital Limited, registered in Jersey; the institutions subscribed for less than 
10 per cent of the Ordinary shares and 100 per cent of Preference shares in the subsidiary, which were subsequently exchanged for an allotment
of the newly issued Ordinary shares in SSL International Plc. 
The increase in the merger reserve of £82.4 million arose from accounting for the share-for-share exchange in which SSL International Plc 
issued new Ordinary shares in exchange for the remaining Ordinary and Preference shares in SSL Capital Limited. The merger reserve is 
non-distributable.
Shares issued under employee share options generated proceeds of £1.1 million (2008: £0.9 million).
The holders of Ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings
of the Company. Details of the share option schemes in place are included in note 18.

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns whilst maximising the return to
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the
borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital,
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed above. The Group manages its capital structure through maintaining close relationships with its
bankers who provide the majority of funds used for operational requirements. The key indicator of capital management performance used by
internal management is the level of net debt, which is defined as borrowings and derivative financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. 
Net debt is monitored on a monthly basis to ensure that actual results are in line with net debt forecasts.
The Group’s main banking facility is a £220 million committed five-year revolving credit facility. This facility was arranged in January 2007 and 
is committed until January 2012. The banking syndicate comprises seven members and is administered by Barclays Bank plc. Further information
in relation to the Group’s financial liabilities is given in notes 15 and 21. A reconciliation of movements in net debt is provided in note 21. Net debt at
31 March 2009 is £17 .7 million compared with £99.0 million at 31 March 2008. In addition, on 28 January 2009 the Group placed an additional 19.1
million Ordinary shares with institutions at a price of 455 pence per share. The net proceeds, after placing costs, were £85.0 million. The purpose
of the share placing was to raise funds to finance the Group’s acquisition activity, such as the investment in Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the CIS.
The Group is required to maintain covenant ratios in respect of net debt to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), net
interest costs to earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) and the ratio of revenue generated from certain Group brands
to total Group revenue. The Group has met its covenant ratios for the year ended 31 March 2009. The Group has prepared forecasts of the cash
flows for the next financial year which indicate that the Group, after considering all known commitments and appropriate sensitivities, will meet
its covenant requirements for this period.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are
subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group may purchase its own shares on the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group’s share option and performance 
share plans. During the year no shares were physically purchased from the market. During the year £1.7 million (2008: £nil) was paid by the 
Group to satisfy the UK tax and National Insurance elements of the gross shares vesting under the performance share plan, which is disclosed 
as repurchase of shares in the cash flow statement. Vested shares awarded to the individuals were net of tax and National Insurance payments.
This was equivalent to the Group purchasing its own shares on the market and awarding these to the recipients. No risk was taken by the Group 
in respect of share price fluctuations, and the impact on the Group was the same as if it had acted as an agent in the sale of the shares by the
individual and the individuals themselves have not received incremental benefits through this arrangement. The Group held no treasury shares 
at 31 March 2009 (2008: none). Decisions to purchase shares are made on a specific transaction basis by the Board; there is no defined share
buy-back plan. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue 
new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. During the year, the Group issued shares to raise funds as detailed above.

Net debt is defined by the Group as borrowings and derivative financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents.
22. Financial risk management
The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit; liquidity; interest rate; and currency. Further
information on the Group’s exposure to these risks is presented below, with an explanation of the Group’s policies and processes for measuring
and managing these risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and review of the Group’s risk management policies and procedures;
these guidelines are designed to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, including setting and monitoring compliance with appropriate
limits and controls. The policies are reviewed regularly and amended where appropriate to reflect changes in the Group’s operations, risk
exposure and market conditions. The Board is assisted by the Group’s Business Assurance function, which undertakes regular and ad-hoc
reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
The Group’s T reasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and
monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations,
and arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables and investment securities.
T rade and other receivables 
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer; the default risk of the industry and country 
in which customers operate has less of an influence on credit risk. Geographically, approximately 75-80 per cent of the Group’s debtors are 
in Europe.
Group exposure to credit risk is controlled by setting a policy, which is reviewed annually, for limiting credit exposure to counterparties, reviewing
credit ratings, and limiting individual aggregate credit exposures accordingly. The Group considers the possibility of material loss in the event of
non-performance by a financial counterparty to be unlikely. Customer credit risk is monitored at a subsidiary level by divisional management, 
and is reviewed at Group level by country.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim. The Group does
not require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables 
and investments. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, 
and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified. 
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payments statistics for similar financial assets.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued Investment securities
Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments. Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded derivatives.
The Group deposits central funds, when available, with highly rated banks, in line with Group policy. The central funds on deposit at the balance
sheet date were £104.5 million (2008: £15 million).
Guarantees
The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to wholly-owned subsidiaries. At 31 March 2009, no guarantees were outstanding
(2008: none).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity
is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group manages liquidity risks by ensuring that any anticipated funding requirements, based on detailed cash flow forecasts at subsidiary 
and Group level, will be met by access to different sources of funding. T ypically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet
expected operational expenses for a period of 30—60 days, including the servicing of financial obligations. In addition, the Group maintains the
credit facilities detailed in note 15.
Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at the balance sheet date were 
as follows:
2009 2008
£m £m 
Expiring in one year or less — —
Expiring in more than one year and less than two years — —
Expiring in more than two years 82.6 97 .0
Total 82.6 97 .0
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices, would affect the Group’s
income, the value of its holdings of financial instruments, or its obligations in respect of retirement benefits.
Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
of the Group’s entities. Where practicable, the Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge major transactional exposures on
working capital balances. At the start of each financial year, the Group enters into forward contracts to hedge approximately 50 to 70 per cent 
of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast sales and purchases over the forthcoming financial year. These transactions 
are not treated as hedges for accounting purposes.
Interest on borrowings is primarily denominated in Sterling, such that no related foreign currency derivatives are required. 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an
acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group’s investment in its Japanese subsidiary is hedged by a Japanese Yen-denominated secured bank loan which mitigates the currency
risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets.
Interest rate risk
The Group’s variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates over the longer term; 
the Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps over £60.0 million of the drawndown facility. The remaining
drawndown facility of £77 .4 million was at LIBOR plus 50 basis points at 31 March 2009 with all contracts ending in April 2009. Interest rates 
will be reset for each tranche on the amounts redrawn in April 2009.
Other market price risk
The Group does not speculate in equity securities, nor does the Group enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Group’s expected
usage requirements. The Group holds a strategic investment of £1 million in the equity securities of an unlisted company as detailed in note 9, 
this is not deemed to expose the Group to market price risk, although the investment is subject to annual impairment reviews. During the year 
the Group acquired an investment in BLBV, an unlisted company at a cost of £30.7 million (note 9). The cost is considered equal to fair value. 
As detailed in note 25, the percentage investment in BLBV will increase from 1 June 2009 and BLBV will be consolidated from that date. 22. Financial risk management continued
Exposure to credit risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:

Net credit exposure 183.9 154.9 
There are no customers representing more than 3.3 per cent (2008: 2.0 per cent) of the total balance of trade receivables. In determining the
recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially
granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, the
Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairment. Movement on the allowance for
impairment in respect of trade receivables is disclosed in note 11. The allowance for impairment has been determined based on historical trends,
and relevant market and customer information. The Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables
not past due. All other receivables are within the respective payment/contractual terms.

At 31 March 2009, the carrying amount for secured bank loans of £137 .4 million relates to drawdowns under the syndicated Group facility. As
explained in note 15, the contractual repayment dates of each drawdown, along with accumulated interest, were in April 2009; however, at the
balance sheet date, it was expected that all of these drawdowns would be rolled over for at least 12 months, and therefore classification as non-
current liabilities at 31 March 2009 was concluded to be appropriate. Within the table above, £0.2 million contractual cash flows relating to the
interest to be paid on maturity in April 2009 have been included within the category ‘six months or less’. The contractual cash flows relating to 
the underlying drawdowns of £137 .4 million have been included in the category ‘two to five years’, the period in which the Group facility expires.
The interest rate swaps used for hedging at 31 March 2009 are designated in a cash flow hedge relationship against £60 million of the secured
bank loans, and therefore the related cash flows will not impact upon profit or loss until the hedge relationship ceases.
Currency risk
Exposure to currency risk
The Group’s main exposure to foreign currency risk was in respect of the Euro, based on notional amounts:

Net exposure to currency risk with regards to other foreign currencies was not significant at 31 March 2009 or 31 March 2008.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year:

Sensitivity analysis
A 10 per cent strengthening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have increased/decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts
shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and that forward contracts are not revalued.
2009 2008
Equity Profit or loss Equity Profit or loss
Euro 1.0 (4.1) 1.6 (1.1)
A 10 per cent weakening of Sterling against the Euro at 31 March would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on
the basis that all other variables remain constant, and that forward contracts are not revalued.
Interest rate risk
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
Due to the short maturity dates of the drawdowns on the Group facility at 31 March 2009 (average maturity 18 days) and 31 March 2008 (average
maturity 51 days), a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at either reporting date would have negligible impact on the carrying value of
variable rate financial instruments, and similarly upon profit or loss. The interest rate swap at 31 March 2009 and also at 31 March 2008 is included
as part of a cash flow hedge relationship, therefore any change in interest rates at the reporting date would have no impact upon profit or loss for
the year, only upon the amount recognised in equity within the cash flow hedge reserve and the carrying value of derivative financial liabilities on
the balance sheet.

Basis for determining fair values
The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the
table above.
Available for sale financial assets
The available for sale financial assets at 31 March 2009 are unquoted entities, therefore fair value of the shareholding cannot be readily
ascertained. Both investments are therefore held at initial cost, which is deemed to be comparable to fair value, although the investments 
are subject to annual impairment review.
90 / 91 //////////  Financial statements / Annual Report and Accounts 2009 
//
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued Derivatives
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available. If a listed market price is not available, then fair value
is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the
contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on broker quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash
flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the
reporting date. In respect of finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. The carrying
values of all borrowings are equal to the fair values due to the relatively short contractual maturity dates and variable interest rates.
Trade and other receivables
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at 
the reporting date.
23. Financial instruments
(a) Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities 
Financial assets 
Cash and cash equivalents, as detailed in note 12, comprise cash at bank and short-term deposits. These are placed on terms not exceeding
three months. £62.9 million is held at variable rates and £85.0 million at fixed rates at 31 March 2009 (2008: £42.5 million at variable rates and 
£2.1 million at fixed rates respectively).
Financial liabilities 
The Group’s fixed rate financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair value due to changes in interest
rates. The Group’s variable rate financial derivatives and variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cashflows due to changes in
interest rates.
Hedging 
At 31 March 2009, the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of £122.4 million (2008: £133.0 million). Interest rate swaps (including
those in effective fair value hedging relationships) are measured at fair value under IAS 39. 
The fair value of interest and currency swaps recognised as hedges at 31 March 2009 is a net liability of £4.0 million comprising liabilities of 
£4.0 million (2008: net liability of £0.7 million comprising assets of £0.1 million and liabilities of £0.8 million).
Up to the repayment of the loan notes and settlement of related swaps in November 2007 , interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges
were fair valued through the income statement as part of net finance costs. Underlying loans that form part of fair value hedge relationships were
adjusted for fair value attributable to hedged risk through the income statement to offset any mark-to-market arising on the interest rate swaps.
Hedge documentation was prepared for all fair value hedges at inception and effectiveness testing was carried out semi-annually. All designated
hedges remained effective throughout the prior financial year to the point of settlement.
The maturity dates of all financial liabilities, together with details of their nominal interest rates, fair values and carrying values are disclosed 
in note 15.

Subsequent events 
Proposed dividends are disclosed in note 20.
On 7 April 2009, the Group announced that it has given notice to exercise its option to increase its stake in Beleggingsmaatschappij Lemore BV 
(‘BLBV’) from 15.5 per cent to 50 per cent plus one share by acquiring additional shares from BLBV’s majority shareholder Abraca.The Group
acquired its initial 15.5 per cent stake in BLBV in May 2008 as explained in note 9. In addition, SSL has also given notice to exercise its option to
acquire 100 per cent of Gainbridge Investments (Cyprus) Limited (‘Gainbridge’) from CCD Estate. 
BLBV is a holding company for operating companies primarily engaged in the packaging and distributing of condoms and medical products
across the Commonwealth of Independent States (‘CIS’) with the exception of the Ukraine. BLBV is the market leader in this steadily growing
condom market and its key condom brand is Contex. Gainbridge is a holding company for operating companies primarily engaged in the
packaging and distributing of condoms and medical products in the Ukraine.
Regulatory approval has since been obtained, and completion of the transaction is anticipated to occur on 1 June 2009, with BLBV consolidated
into the Group’s results from that date. The consideration for the increased stake will be €70 million. Further disclosures required under IFRS 3
‘Business Combinations’ have not been provided as there has been insufficient time to obtain and review the relevant financial information from
BLBV, and to finalise the accounting treatment and disclosures for the business combination.

Company accounting policies
As used in the financial statements and related notes, the term
‘Company’ refers to SSL International plc. The separate financial
statements of the Company are presented as required by the
Companies Act 1985 and have been prepared in accordance with 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices.
A list of principal subsidiary undertakings is presented on 
page 95.
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 1985. As permitted by the Act, the
separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (‘UK GAAP’). The
accounting policies under UK GAAP are presented below.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical
cost basis, with the exception of financial instruments as described
below. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
In accordance with Section 230(4) of the Companies Act 1985 the
Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account.
The profit for the financial year dealt with in the financial statements 
of the parent company, SSL International plc, is disclosed in note (x).
The Company has taken the exemption from the requirement to
prepare a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 (revised 
1996) ‘Cash flow statements’.
The following paragraphs describe the main accounting
policies. These policies have been consistently applied to all the 
years presented.
(a) Tangible fixed assets
T angible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write tangible fixed assets down to a
residual value over their estimated useful economic lives at the
following annual rates:
Plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis
over a period of between 4—15 years.
(b) Intangible assets
Software developments and licences capitalised are stated at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight line
basis over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
//
Software development: 5—10 years; and
//
Software licences: over the length of the licence.
(c) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for 
any impairment.
(d) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the loss/profit for the year 
and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation 
and accounting purposes.
Credit is taken for advance corporation tax written off in
previous years when it is recovered against corporation tax liabilities.
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided where a
taxation liability will arise as a result of transactions or events which
have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is regarded that they will be recovered.
Provision is made at rates expected to be applicable when the liabilities
or assets are likely to crystallise.
(e) Foreign currencies
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the
rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Gains or losses on
transactions are included in the profit and loss account.
(f) Derivative financial instruments
In accordance with exemptions under FRS 29: ‘Financial Instruments:
Disclosures’, the Company has not presented the financial
instruments disclosures required by the standard, as disclosures 
which comply with the standard are included in the consolidated
financial statements.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce
exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements. The
Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
speculative purposes.
With the exception of derivative financial instruments, and
those hedged items forming part of a fair value hedge, financial
instruments are held at amortised cost.
Hedge accounting
The accounting for the Company’s various hedging activities is 
detailed overleaf: (i) T ransaction exposure hedging
Forward currency contracts hedging transaction exposures are fair
valued through the profit and loss account.
(ii) Fair value hedges
Derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges
when they hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fair value
of a recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from remeasuring the
hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss
account. Any change in the fair value of the hedged item, attributable
to the hedged risk, is adjusted against the carrying value of the hedged
item and recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
(iii) Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instruments
designated as a cashflow hedge are recognised directly in equity to 
the extent that the hedge is effective. T o the extent that the hedge is
ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments qualifying for fair value hedge
accounting are principally foreign currency and interest rate swaps.
Discontinuance of hedge accounting
Hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
(g) Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of employee share schemes. The
cost to the Company of making awards in the form of shares or rights to
shares under these schemes is charged to the profit and loss account
as an employee expense over the period to which the employee’s
performance relates. The Company issues equity settled share-based
payments to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiary
undertakings. Equity settled share-based payments are measured at
fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model, taking
into account the terms and conditions precedent at the time of grant.
The impact of any non-market vesting conditions is excluded.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is
determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments
granted and the number of equity instruments which eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimate of the
number of instruments that are expected to vest. It recognises the
impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss
account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining
period. When awards are made to employees of subsidiary
undertakings and the fair value of the award is not recharged to the
subsidiary, the award is treated as a capital contribution to the
subsidiary, with a corresponding increase in the cost of investment.
(h) Dividend income
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised within
other income at the point the dividend has been declared. Dividends
declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised in the profit
and loss account.
(i) Related party transactions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available in FRS 8:
‘Related Party Disclosures’ and has not disclosed transactions or
balances with entities which form part of the Group.

Of the reserves of the Company, £ 89.0 million (2008: £12.3 million) is regarded as distributable.
Of the £84.1 million increase in the non-distributable reserve during the year, £82.4 million relates to the increase in the merger reserve arising
from accounting for a share-for-share exchange in which SSL International plc issued new Ordinary shares in exchange for the remaining Ordinary
and Preference Shares in SSL Capital Limited. A further £1.7 million relates to the share-based payments awarded to employees of the subsidiary
undertaking LRC Products Limited, which has been treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary undertaking.
By virtue of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company is exempt from presenting a profit and loss account.
For details on dividends paid and payable during the year, see note 20 to the Group accounts.
(xi) Commitments and contingent liabilities
The Company has no contracts for future expenditure that have not been provided for (2008: none).
Guarantee contracts
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the
guarantee. At the balance sheet date, there were no contingent liabilities arising as a result of these guarantees (2008: none).
(xii) Directors’ remuneration and share-based payments
The Company has no employees other than the Directors; information covering Directors’ remuneration, interests in shares, share options 
and pension benefits is included in the Remuneration report on pages 42 to 49.
The information as disclosed in the Group accounts under IFRS 2: ‘Share-based payment’ is comparable with the UK GAAP information under 
FRS 20: ‘Share-based payment’.

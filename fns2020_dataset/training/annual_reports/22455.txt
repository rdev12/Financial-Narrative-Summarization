CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
 
2 
 
I am delighted to present the Group’s financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2010. The Group performance, 
particularly from the IVA division, has been especially pleasing and has been marked by a step change in the 
number of new IVAs being passed each month and of course by the acquisition of the back books from Relax Group 
plc (“Relax”) for £2.7m in December 2009. 
 
The Group’s financial performance was very strong. Whilst the Group made a pre-tax profit in the year of £465,709 
(2009: £460,923) this has to be considered in light of the Relax acquisition costs amounting to £527,819 (including 
finance costs of £28,346), amortisation relating to the back books of £944,234 and partially offset by a profit on the 
bargain purchase of the back books of £252,914. The financial and operating performance of the Group can be better 
judged by the massive gains in revenue, gross profit and profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
when compared to the previous year. 
 
I am pleased to say that the Group has successfully rationalised and integrated the Relax acquisition with some 
6,500 new clients being added more than doubling the client base of the Group. These clients are spread across a 
whole spectrum of IVAs, DMPs and for the first time PTDs - giving us the capacity to take in house cases based in 
Scotland for PTDs which were previously outsourced. 
 
The Group’s Statement of Financial Position shows net assets of £5,016,621 (2009: £4,535,318) including cash of 
£541,504 (2009: £584,593) and has been strengthened by the raising of new monies in April 2010 via the issue of 
convertible loan notes raising £2.3m to finance the £2.7m acquisition and associated costs.  
 
The Group finances are on a sound footing and we look to continue to achieve strong growth in the client base 
through the acquisition of further back books as well as through organic growth with cost efficient marketing 
activity and referral relationships. We have made a very good start to the first quarter as regards new IVA business 
and I look forward to another profitable year.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT

The Group has enjoyed another excellent year which has been further improved by the acquisition of the Relax back 
books for £2.7m together with further substantial growth in the numbers of new IVA cases approved during the past 
year.  
 
In December 2009 we acquired some 6,500 new clients through the back book purchase of IVAs, PTDs and DMPs 
from the Administrator of Relax together with certain staff and offices in Chesterfield where Relax were based. This 
acquisition more than doubled the number of clients within the Group and provided us with additional experienced 
staff in the IVA and DMP areas as well as in PTDs,  allowing us to take in house the processing of new PTDs going 
forward which were previously referred externally.  
  
I am pleased to say that the operations in Chesterfield have been successfully restructured and integrated into the 
Group with the vast majority of clients now transferred onto our back office systems and the staff relocated locally 
to Staveley, Chesterfield in new offices much more appropriate to the size of operation. 
 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the new and existing staff in the Group for their dedication and hard 
work over the last nine months in bringing this process to a successful completion.  
 
The timing of cash flow from the Relax acquisition in particular has been well above our forecasts and overall we 
expect the ultimate realisations to be ahead of our initial estimates that were anticipated last December. We continue 
to make rapid progress in closing these cases with over 500 closed since December which is as expected given the 
profile of cases which were mainly recruited in 2007/8 and prior years. As Relax workload falls the existing 
Staveley staff can be utilised to look after new cases recruited to the Group which will avoid the need for further 
recruitment in the short term. We continue to look for further purchases of IVA and/or DMP back books to leverage 
our efficient systems.  
 
Abacus has not been able to grow its DMP plans as aggressively as hoped but we believe many of our competitors in 
this marketplace are also experiencing a slowdown in the growth of DMPs.  The main reason for this is that a much 
higher percentage of new clients this year have converted to IVAs rather than DMPs. We are, however, very pleased 
with the client retention rates both at Abacus and Debtcare (the former Relax DMP operation) which continue to 
generate excellent cash flow, forming a strong income stream and financial foundation for the wider group.  Our 
overall conversion of leads across the Group continues to be good. 
 
Our policy is always to give our clients the most appropriate advice for their circumstances, through using our 
proprietary algorithms and we are perhaps seeing further acceptance from our clients that the IVA is a better long 
term solution to their difficulties than the DMP. ClearDebt has always felt that DMP’s are only applicable for clients 
who will see a rapid recovery in their finances. 
 
We continue to expand our internet and other marketing activities across the Group and are constantly exploring 
new opportunities for lead sources. In addition we are closely monitoring consolidation opportunities within our 
industry and the Group is well financed to capitalise on opportunities that may arise. We have a successful history in 
profitably integrating acquired businesses - both operationally and financially. We are therefore confident that we 
can manage any acquisition risks. This confidence is derived from the strength of our management, but also our 
systems which remain highly scaleable. 
 
THE CONSUMER DEBT MARKET 
 
ClearDebt Group operates within the debt resolution sector, an established sub-category of financial services. 
Personal insolvencies saw a step change in 2006 with a 58% increase in individual insolvencies to over 100,000 per 
annum which has been steadily maintained each year until 2009. In 2009 personal insolvencies increased by 26% 
with IVAs showing growth of 22%. The first half of 2010 continues to show overall growth of 11% in personal 
insolvencies with IVAs growing at nearly 15% when compared to the same period last year.  
 
The contraction in available credit to all but those with unblemished credit records and the slowdown in the housing 
market means traditional refinancing options remain closed to the majority. Our society and those of Western 
economies are now largely driven by consumer consumption financed too often through debt and we see the debt 
resolution sector remaining robust in the foreseeable future. The high levels of consumer debt and unemployment  ClearDebt Group plc 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 
 
4 
 
and forthcoming tax rises and public sector cuts should continue to  increase the total level of personal debt levels; 
thereby increasing the market for ClearDebt’s portfolio of integrated personal debt resolution products.  
 
We see a continued shift towards the IVA or bankruptcy solution and away from DMPs as consumers realise that the 
perceived short term fix of a DMP is actually more expensive in the longer term where a quick return to 
employment or an improvement in circumstances is unlikely to happen quickly. Many DMPs take longer than five 
years to clear debts even with interest and charges frozen (which is not always the case) and so the typical five year 
IVA after which debts are written off in full is increasingly more appropriate. 
 
Against this background the government is actively looking to increase regulation and has already started to enforce 
much stricter compliance monitoring of companies in the sector and it is now much more difficult to renew existing 
consumer credit licences or obtain new ones. We see this as an opportunity for ourselves and those larger 
organisations with cash who maintain the highest standards to purchase back books and consolidate the sector as the 
many smaller players are unwilling or unable to comply with the increased regulation.  
 
THE CLEARDEBT MODEL – IVAs and PTDs 
  
Unlike most of its major competitors in the consumer IVA market, ClearDebt has developed a low overhead, high 
quality model, based on Kaizen manufacturing principles and an intelligent internet interface - www.cleardebt.co.uk. 
This model allows the company’s cost base to be kept to a minimum level whilst still providing high levels of 
service.  It also facilitates efficient growth as there is minimal need to hire new staff until customer number 
thresholds have been breached.  
 
Due to this distinctive operating model, ClearDebt is able to offer a more effective debt resolution solution than 
many of its rivals. The model allows ClearDebt to offer IVAs (if that is the appropriate solution) at lower cost not 
only to the debtor, but also the creditor, by enhancing dividends - thereby increasing the chance that an IVA will be 
approved by the creditor and completed by the debtor, benefiting all parties involved in the proposal. 
 
THE ABACUS MODEL – Debt Management Plans 
 
Abacus provides services to indebted individuals by negotiating and putting in place a debt management plan with 
their creditors. The debtor makes a monthly payment to Abacus who then distributes the payment to the creditors as 
agreed in the plan less an administration fee at an agreed percentage of the debtor’s monthly payment. An initial set 
up fee is also charged.   
 
Such plans are suitable for individuals whose debts are more manageable and rely on the goodwill of creditors as 
they are not a formal insolvency procedure and interest usually continues to accrue on outstanding debts although 
some creditors are prepared to waive the interest for short periods.  
 
Many clients are cross referred between ClearDebt and Abacus allowing the Group to offer an appropriate advice 
solution to all individuals.  
 
As a leading member of the trade body, The Debt Resolution Forum, ClearDebt has been in regular negotiation with 
the creditor community and aims to be at the forefront of any proposals to introduce a Regulated Debt Management 
Plan following the completion of the consultation process that was undertaken by the Ministry of Justice at the end 
of 2009.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW 
 
ClearDebt – IVA Division 
 
Since 1 July 2009 (2009: 1 July 2008), the following numbers of new IVAs have been arranged through ClearDebt:- 
 
 Year ended Year ended 
 30 June 2010 30 June 2009 
First quarter 176 84 
Second quarter 173 117 
Third quarter 184 118 
Fourth quarter 266 164 
 ____ ____ 
 799 483 
 ____ ____ 
 
The growth of new IVAs continues to be strong and ClearDebt enjoyed an excellent year with a 65% increase in the 
number of IVAs passed in the year with 799 new cases (2009: 483) and a large rise in profitability.  I am pleased to 
say this rate of growth has recently accelerated further as new lead sources come on stream. Following the 
acquisition of some 3,700 IVAs and PTDs from Relax last December, ClearDebt now has as at 30 June 2010 a total 
of 4,894 IVA and PTD’s generating income (2009: 858).  
 
ClearDebt has made steady progress in the first three quarters of the year before seeing a rapid acceleration in the 
number of new plans in the fourth quarter following the introduction of further lead sources.  
 
Case numbers in the first quarter of our current financial year are expected to be well ahead of the fourth quarter 
with 216 cases already passed by the end of August and a solid pipeline in hand. This first quarter is one of the 
quieter periods of the year for the industry due to the summer holiday period and so bodes well for the rest of the 
year.  
 
The Board monitors several key performance indicators  (“KPIs”) for the business on a monthly basis including the 
number of cases passed, various conversion ratios from lead to cases passed, the cost per case acquired and the staff 
to  caseload numbers. Your Board is pleased to advise that these KPIs are delivering positive messages about the 
business. 
 
Abacus– Debt Management Division  
 
The division made a small profit in the period having achieved profitability for the first time last year although we 
have seen a slowdown in the recruitment of new clients and an increase in the number of plans that cease as the age 
of the relatively young DMP book at Abacus matures.  There have also been a number of clients who have ceased a 
DMP and commenced an IVA with us.  
 
In the year 2009/10, Abacus has arranged 2,366 new plans (2008/09: 2,856). In December 2009 we acquired some 
2,800 DMP plans from Relax and as at 30 June 2010 the total number of debt management plans generating income 
was 6,316 (2009: 3,430). Our attrition rates on DMPs are well within our normal expectations and we are actively 
looking for further back books to acquire as a means of boosting income over the short and medium term. 
 
The Board has KPIs to monitor the number of active income generating plans as well as the value of monthly 
payments made by debtors.  Revenue is only recognised by Abacus upon receipt of fees which are drawn from 
debtor payments as received.  
 
The costs of acquisition of cases and plans are also monitored closely. We continue to resist the temptation to grow 
the book through lead sources providing leads at what are, in our view uneconomic prices.

FINANCIAL REVIEW 
 
Group turnover more than doubled to £6.63m (2009: £3.39m) following the Relax acquisition and increased growth 
in the insolvency business. Gross profit more than doubled to £3,300,688 (2009: £1,436,365), largely as a result of 
the Relax acquisition and continued growth in the insolvency division. Administration and finance costs also 
included one-off acquisition related items totalling £449,473 and £78,346 respectively. 
 
In April 2010 we successfully issued to investors £2.3m of 3 yr 10% secured convertible loan notes which are listed 
on the Channel Islands Stock Exchange (CISX) via our wholly owned subsidiary CDG (Guernsey) Limited. This 
comprised £1.8m of investment from new investors and the conversion into the loan notes of £0.5m of the £1.2m 
loan due to D E M  Mond.  
 
Cash resources at the year end amounted to £541,504 and cash flow remains strong leaving the Group on an 
excellent financial footing to finance further back book acquisitions as opportunities present themselves. 
 
GOING CONCERN 
  
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting 
Council entitled “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK Companies 2009.  The Board has prepared 
detailed financial forecasts and cash flows for the three years to 30 June 2013 and in drawing up these forecasts the 
Board has made assumptions based upon its view of the current and future economic conditions in the UK that will 
prevail over the forecast period - given that the business is likely to be solely focused on the UK market for the 
foreseeable future. The timing of the cash flows and covenants to the debt holders in respect of loans provided have 
been taken into consideration and in addition to the forecasts we have also produced sensitivities to these forecasts 
to test our ability to trade as a going concern for at least the following 12 months based upon a 20% rise or fall in 
projected turnover without any reduction in overhead costs. In practice the Board believes that it can quickly realign 
overheads, in particular marketing spend, to allow for any reduced levels of activity within the business that may 
occur going forward. 
 
The Board believes that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate because there are no material 
uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company to 
continue as a going concern.  
 
FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 
The IVA market has continued to grow strongly and ClearDebt has substantially increased the numbers of IVAs it 
has dealt with and continues to outperform the growth rate in the wider market as we continue to increase market 
share. 
 
Whilst we have seen a slowing in the rate of acquisition of DMP plans, our overall conversion of leads as a Group 
across all solutions remains excellent and we are merely experiencing a shift to a higher proportion of clients for 
whom an IVA is the more appropriate solution. The last quarter of the financial year produced a record number of 
IVAs for the Group and this figure has almost been achieved after only two months of the first quarter of the new 
financial year.  
 
Given the current economic outlook in the UK with unemployment showing no signs of falling together with further 
tax rises and public sector cuts to come in the short to medium term, I believe the Group is well placed for another 
highly profitable and successful year – without any further acquisitions. We remain delighted with our organic 
growth, but also are entirely open to the possibilities of acquisition, due to our unique Kaizen based scaleable 
business model. 
 
Once again I would like to pay tribute to all our employees who continue to offer the highest standards of service 
and commitment to all our clients at all levels and without whom the company would not be where we are today.

Going Concern 
As part of its going concern review the Board has followed the guidelines published by the Financial Reporting 
Council entitled “Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for UK Companies 2009”.  The Board has prepared 
detailed financial forecasts and cash flows for the three years to 30 June 2013 and in drawing up these forecasts the 
Board has made assumptions based upon its view of the current and future economic conditions in the UK that will 
prevail over the forecast period - given that the business is likely to be solely focused on the UK market for the

The Board believes that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate because there are no material 
uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company to 
continue as a going concern.  
 
Principal Risks and Uncertainties 
All businesses face a range of risks and uncertainties, being subject to risk factors from internal and external 
sources. The Board considers the likelihood and significance of risk factors when putting in place risk management 
procedures to ensure risk mitigation. 
 
The following are considered to be the key risks facing the Group:- 
 
1. Competition - the market for debt resolution solutions remains highly competitive. The Group seeks to 
manage the risk of losing referrers through providing innovative solutions supported by high quality 
delivery. The Group’s main marketing channel still continues to be the internet and the Group monitors 
closely the strategies of competitors and the prices paid in the market place and reacts appropriately 
where necessary.  
 
2. Credit risk – the Group’s credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and is managed by daily 
monitoring of client’s payments into their programmes versus agreed contracted terms. 
 
3. Funding arrangements – the Group monitors cash flow as part of its normal activities. Cash flow 
positions are discussed with the Board on a monthly basis to ensure that all possible treasury benefits are 
being taken and facilities are available if necessary. Advertising and marketing spend is monitored 
closely as it is a key component of funding requirements. 
 
4. Economic environment – the current economic climate is extremely favourable and the market for 
indebted consumers is likely to grow in the next few years. 
 
5. Creditor Pressure – Creditors can restrict the market for personal debt resolutions by refusing to agree to 
proposals which they do not deem acceptable. This can have the effect of restricting approvals and 
therefore the timing of fees. The Group is actively involved in talking to creditors constantly to ensure 
that all Group products are in line with creditor approval criteria as much as possible.   
 
Risks associated with financial instruments entered into by the Group are detailed in note 20.  ClearDebt Group plc

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 
11 
 
Principles of Corporate Governance 
 
The Group’s Board appreciates the value of good corporate governance not only in the areas of accountability and 
risk management but also as a positive contribution to business prosperity. It believes that corporate governance 
involves more than a simple “box ticking” approach to establish whether a company has met the principles 
(including those set out in the corporate governance guidelines for AIM companies published by the Quoted 
Companies Alliance in February 2007) of a number of specific rules and regulations. Rather the issue is one of 
applying corporate governance in a sensible and pragmatic fashion having regard to the individual circumstances of 
a particular company’s business. The key objective is to enhance and protect shareholder value.  
 
Board Structure 
 
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group. A statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 13.   
 
The Non-Executive Directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive 
Directors are fully considered.   
 
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and 
there is a procedure for all Directors, in furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional advice, if 
necessary, at the expense of the Group. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved to it and meets 
monthly. It is responsible for overall group strategy, approval of major capital expenditure projects and 
consideration of significant financing matters.   
 
The following Committees have been set up, which have written terms of reference and deal with specific aspects of 
the Group’s affairs.   
 
1. The Remuneration Committee, includes D E M Mond and the two Non-Executive Directors is responsible 
for making recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its 
cost.  The Committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for each of the 
Executive Directors, including pension rights and compensation payments. The Board itself determines the 
remuneration of D E M Mond and the Non-Executive Directors. The Committee meets as required.  
 
2. The Audit Committee includes the two Non-Executive Directors.  Its prime tasks are to review the scope of 
the external audit, to receive regular reports from Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP, and to review the half-yearly 
and annual accounts before they are presented to the Board, focusing in particular on accounting policies 
and areas of management judgment and estimation. The Committee is responsible for monitoring the 
controls, which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported to the shareholders. The 
Committee acts as a forum for discussion of internal control issues and contribute to the Board’s review of 
the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control and risk management systems and processes. It advises the 
Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration for both audit and non-audit work, 
and discusses the nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors. It reviews and monitors the 
independence of the auditors especially with regard to non audit work. It meets at least twice a year 
including immediately before the submission of the annual and interim financial statements to the Board.   
 
Any new Non-Executive Directors will be asked to join both Committees.   
 
No formal nomination Committee exists in view of the stage of development of the Group. Instead appointments to 
the Board by the Chief Executive and other Executive Directors are discussed with the Non-Executive Chairman. 
Appointments are made after an evaluation of the skills, knowledge, and expertise required ensuring that the Board 
as a whole has the ability to ensure that the Group can continue to compete effectively in its market place.

Internal Control 
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness. The Board 
has designed the Group’s system of internal control in order to provide the Directors with reasonable assurance that 
its assets are safeguarded, that transactions are authorised and properly recorded and that material errors and 
irregularities are either prevented or would be detected within a timely period. However, no system of internal 
control can eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives or provide absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.  The key elements of the control system in operation are: 
 
a. The Board meets regularly with a formal schedule of matters reserved to it for decision and has put in place 
an organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility defined and with appropriate delegation of 
authority;  
 
b. There are procedures for planning, approval and monitoring of capital expenditure and information systems 
for monitoring the Group’s financial performance against approved budgets and projections;  
 
The process adopted by the Group accords with the guidance contained in the document “Internal Control Guidance 
for Directors on the Combined Code” issued by the ICAEW. 
 
The Audit Committee receives reports from the external auditors on a regular basis and from Executive Directors of 
the Group. During the period, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control as described 
above. The Board has considered whether the Group’s internal controls processes would be significantly enhanced 
by an internal audit function and has taken the view that at the Group’s current stage of development, this is not 
required. The Board will continue to review this matter each year. The Board receives periodic reports from all 
Committees. 
 
There are no significant issues disclosed in the financial statements for the period ended 30 June 2010 and up to the 
date of approval of the report and financial statements that have required the Board to deal with any related material 
internal control issues. 
 
Relations with Shareholders 
The Group values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors. Effective two-way communication with 
fund managers, institutional investors and analysts is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as 
performance, policy and strategy. During the period the Directors have had meetings with analysts and institutions 
and will continue to do so. 
 
There is also an opportunity, at the Company’s Annual General Meeting for individual shareholders to raise general 
business matters with the full Board and notice of the Company’s Annual General Meeting is circulated to all 
shareholders at least 20 working days before such meeting. The Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
13 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ Report and the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. 
  
UK Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company Financial Statements for each financial 
year.  The directors are required by the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange to prepare Group financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS")  as adopted by the European 
Union (“EU”) and have elected to prepare the company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
  
The Group financial statements are required by law and IFRS adopted by the EU to present fairly the financial 
position and performance of the group; the Companies Act 2006 provides in relation to such financial statements 
that references in the relevant part of that Act to financial statements giving a true and fair view are references to 
their achieving a fair presentation. 
 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period.  
  
In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
  
a. select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  
b. make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  
c.  for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs 
adopted by the EU; and for the company financial statements state whether applicable UK accounting 
standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Company 
financial statements; 
 
d. prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Group and the Company will continue in business; 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Group’s and the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of 
the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the ClearDebt Group plc website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT 
 
14 
 
The Board’s Remuneration Committee, which currently comprises Gerald Carey (Non-Executive Chairman), 
Anthony Leon ( Non-executive director) and David Mond (Chief Executive Officer), makes recommendations to the 
Board within agreed terms of reference in determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Directors, 
including pension rights. 
 
Members of the Committee who have a personal financial interest in the matters to be decided are not involved in 
decisions.  In arriving at its recommendations, the Committee has access to professional advice from both within and 
outside the Company.   
 
Remuneration Policy 
Each remuneration package is reviewed against a background of published comparative information on the 
remuneration of Executive Directors in similar positions, taking into account the industry, the region of 
employment, the type of work and the size of the Company.  The extent to which the recommended remuneration is 
above or below average takes account of the Director’s qualifications and length of service with the Company, the 
Director’s actual performance and the performance of the Company.  This will remain the policy for forthcoming 
years. 
 
Directors’ Emoluments 
The emoluments of the Directors during the financial year ended 30 June 2010 were as follows:

2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of Preparation 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as 
adopted by the European Union (IFRS) and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis for the reasons outlined in the Directors’ 
Report on page 6. 
 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis.  The principal accounting policies adopted 
are set out below. 
 
Critical Accounting Estimate and Judgements 
The preparation of the financial information in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various 
other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of 
making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are both readily apparent from other 
sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on 
an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods in the revision affects both 
current and future periods. 
 
The principal balances that have been estimated relate to:- 
- estimates of future cash flows for the goodwill impairment review ( see note 10) 
- estimates in respect of the future recoverability of the deferred tax asset in respect of losses brought 
forward ( see note 15) 
- estimates of the fair value of intangible assets acquired ( see note 18) 
- estimates of future cash flows linked to contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions 
 
Basis of Consolidation 
Where the company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
another entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.  The consolidated 
financial statements present the results of the company and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) as if they formed a single 
entity.  Inter-company transactions are therefore eliminated in full. 
 
Business Combinations 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.  
In the consolidated statement of financial position, the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.  The results of acquired operations are 
included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained. 
 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.  Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities 
assumed and equity instruments issued, plus any direct costs of acquisition. 
 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries or business is recognised as a separate asset on the statement of 
financial position after the recognition at fair value of any other intangible assets identified at the time of 
acquisition. 
 
Goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being recognised immediately 
and charged to the consolidated income statement.  Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the ground income 
statement on the acquisition date.  The Group carries out annual impairment tests for goodwill.  Impairment losses 
in respect of goodwill are not reversed. 
 
Negative Goodwill 
Negative goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries or business is recognised in full on the date of acquisition 
and is recorded in the consolidated income statement. 
 
Impairment 
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangibles other than goodwill and property, 
plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the 
impairment loss (if any).  Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, the 
Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value is use.  In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future 
cash flows have been adjusted. 
  ClearDebt Group plc 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
For the year ended 30 June 2010

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount, in which case the 
impairment loss is treated as expenses in the consolidated income statement.  
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset 
(cash-generating unit) in prior years.  A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless 
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a 
revaluation increased. 
 
Other Intangible Assets 
Internal and externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised over 
their useful economic lives.  The amortisation expense is shown separately on the face of the Consolidated Income 
Statement.  The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the methods used 
to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:- 
 
Development costs   - 4 years straight line 
Software development costs  - 4 years straight line 
Intangible assets - Debt management back books - 1 year straight line 
Intangible assets – Insolvency back books  - 3 years straight line  
Other intangibles   - 1 year straight line 
 
Expenditure arising from the Group’s development costs and software development is recognised only if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
- an asset is created that can be identified; 
- it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; 
- the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably; 
- the Group has the intention to complete the asset and the ability and intention to use or sell it; 
- sufficient resources are available to complete the development and to either sell or use the asset. 
 
Where the criteria have not been achieved, software development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the 
period in which it is incurred. 
 
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of amounts receivable or received in relation to a range of services provided 
to clients as follows: 
 
Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVA) 
Fees are earned for arranging and administering IVAs on behalf of individuals experiencing debt problems.  
Generally, revenue is accrued based upon the stage of completion of specific client contracts where the outcome can 
be assessed with reasonable certainty and the value for that service has been agreed between the Group and the 
client. 
 
Nominee fees 
Nominee fees are recognised upon the approval of an IVA proposal at a creditors meeting. 
Supervisory fees 
Supervisory fees are accrued on a monthly basis over the duration of the arrangement as the service is provided. 
 
Protected Trust Deeds (PTD) 
Fees earned in respect of PTDs are recognised when received.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Debt management services 
Fees are receivable for the management of debts on behalf of clients experiencing financial difficulties.  Fees are 
recognised upon receipt of client payments on the basis that these arrangements are informal and there is no 
certainty that economic benefits will accrue until a payment is received. 
Commissions 
The Group also receives commission income from the referral of loans and other products.  Commissions are 
recorded as they become due. 
 
Prepayment Card services 
The Group receives a revenue share from the issue and usage charges in respect of the ClearCash prepaid 
MasterCard. Income and charges are recognised in the period in which they were incurred by the card user.   
 
Property, Plant and Equipment 
All property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write 
off the cost less residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: 
 
Leasehold improvements  - 25% straight line 
Fixtures and fittings   - 25% straight line 
 
Residual value and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually. 
 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event 
which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.  If the effect of 
time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows as a pre-
tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. 
 
Share-based Compensation 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of 
options or warrants.  The fair value determined is recognised as an expense if it relates to trading activities or in the 
share premium account if it relates to the issue of equity instruments.  The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or warrants granted, excluding the impact 
of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets).  Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in the assumptions about the number of options or warrants that are expected to become 
exercisable.  At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options or warrants that are 
expected to become exercisable.  It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income 
statement, and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the remaining vesting period. 
 
The proceeds received net of any attributed transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options or warrants are exercised. 
 
Non vesting conditions which are not satisfied during the vesting period, are treated as cancellations and any 
remaining expense is accelerated in the period of failure. 
 
Share based payments associated with share options granted to employees of subsidiaries of the parent company are 
treated as an expense of the subsidiary company to be settled by equity of the parent company. The share based 
payment expense increases the value of the parent company’s investment in the subsidiaries and is credited to the 
Share based payment reserve. 
 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Leasing 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease. 
 
Financial Instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group has 
become a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are classified as loans and other receivables in accordance with IAS 39, measured on initial 
recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.  
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the consolidated income statement 
when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.  The allowance recognised is measured as the difference 
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term 
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are classified as other loans and 
receivables in accordance with IAS 39. 
 
For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of amounts as defined above. 
 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.  An 
instrument will be classified as a financial liability when there is a contractual obligation  to deliver cash or another 
financial asset to another enterprise. 
 
Trade and other payables  
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest 
method. They are classified as “Other liabilities” in accordance with IAS 39. 
 
Borrowings 
Interest-bearing bank loads and overdrafts are classified as “other liabilities” in accordance with IAS 39.  They are 
initially recorded at their fair value, net of any issue costs associated with borrowings.  Borrowings are subsequently 
stated at amortised cost. 
 
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, are expensed to the income statement 
over the term of the instrument using an effective rate of interest and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the 
liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. 
 
Secured Convertible Loan notes 
Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity 
component. At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan 
notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the 
liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2. Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their 
relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.  The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly 
against equity. 
 
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for 
similar non-convertible debt to the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to 
the carrying value of the convertible loan note. 
 
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred tax expense.  Taxable losses differ from 
net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that 
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are next taxable or deductible.  The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by 
the reporting date. 
 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities in the financial statements are the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, 
and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.  Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable 
temporary differences  and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probably that taxable profits will 
be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.  Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition 
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax 
profit nor the accounting profit. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled based upon tax rates that have been exacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.  
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged 
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. 
 
Segmental Reporting  
An operating segment is a component of an entity: 
 
a) That engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including 
revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity),  
b) Whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision maker to make 
decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment, and 
c) For which discrete financial information is available.

The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share of 0.11p (2009:  0.13p) each has been based on the profit 
for the relevant financial year and on 308,340,567 shares (2009: 306,213,855).  This represents the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue.  The profit for the period for the purpose of calculating the diluted 
earnings per share is the same as for the basic earnings per share calculation.  
 
The profit for the year ended 30 June 2010 and the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of 
calculating the diluted earnings per share are the same as for the basic earnings per share calculation.  This is 
because the outstanding options and convertible loan notes were exercisable at a price above the average share price 
in the year and would therefore not be dilutive under the terms of IAS 33.

Impairment reviews 
 
The total carrying value of £4,457,892 relating to goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.  This comprises 
£3,068,986 relating to the insolvency business and £1,388,906 relating to the debt management business. 
 
For the purposes of impairment review the recoverable amount has been calculated as the value in use based on 
discounted future cash flow projections for a five year period. 
 
Goodwill arising on ClearDebt acquisition (insolvency business) – critical accounting estimates and 
judgements in relation to the impairment review on the insolvency business 
 
Monthly revenue projections assume that the number IVA cases approved will nearly quadruple over the next 2 
years through the acquisition of new lead sources before falling by 20% and increasing by 2.5% per annum 
thereafter. Nominee fees per case are expected to remain at current levels together with average supervisory fees, 
and IVAs lasting a maximum of 5 years.  Expenses are expected to rise 51% in the first year, 12% in the second 
year and fall by 11% in year 3 before increasing by 2.5% over the remaining two years.  The appropriate discount 
factor used in the calculations is 10%. 
 
Assumptions are based on recent experience and estimates of how economic conditions may affect levels of activity 
in the business. 
 
The Group’s cost of capital could increase to 37% or insolvency income fall short of projections by 17.25% without 
a matching fall in expenses before the carrying value of this part of goodwill would exceed the value in use. 
 
Impairment review on the debt management business 
 
Projections have been produced covering a five year period.  Revenues are expected to grow 20% in the first year, 
4% in the second year before falling by 10% and then increasing at 2.5% per annum over the remaining period.  
Expenses are expected to increase by 2.5% in year 1 and remain constant in year two and three before rising by 
2.5% per annum, thereafter.  
 
The assumptions are based on recent experience of monthly growth and estimates of how economic conditions will 
affect levels of activity in the business.  The discount factor used in the calculations is 10%. 
 
The Group’s debt management income would need to fall short of projections by 30% without a matching fall in 
expenses or the Group’s cost of capital increase to 74% before the carrying value of this part of goodwill would 
exceed the value in use. 
 
Goodwill arising on the purchase of the software and database of The Debt Advice Portal 
 
Projections have been produced covering a five year period.  Revenues are expected to grow 14% on over the first 
year and grow by 2.5% over the remaining period.  Expenses are expected to remain constant over the period. 
 
The assumptions are based on recent experience and the continued development of the portal and expansion of the 
referrer database.  The discount factor used in the calculations is 10%. 
 
The Group’s income from referrers would need to fall short of projections by 74% before the carrying value of this 
part of goodwill would exceed the value in use.

On 16 April 2010 £2.3m of 3 year 10% Secured Convertible Loan notes were issued by CDG (Guernsey) Limited,  a 
wholly owned subsidiary of ClearDebt Group plc, to  investors. Holders of the loan notes are entitled to interest on 
the loan notes at a rate of 10% per annum payable on a quarterly basis and have an option to convert all or part of 
their holdings at par into ordinary shares at any time in ClearDebt Group plc at a price of 1.8p per share. At the end 
of the 3 year period the principal is repayable in cash plus a premium of 25% in respect of any holdings that are not 
converted into ordinary shares at the loan note holder’s option. 
 
The Loan Notes are secured by way of a debenture dated 19 April 2010 over the assets of the Group. The Company 
has also entered into a cross guarantee with CDG (Guernsey) Limited in respect of the convertible loan notes. 
 
In accordance with IAS 39 the directors have calculated the net present values of the cash flows in respect of the 
interest and principal payments (assuming all are redeemed in cash and not taken as shares) over the next three years 
discounted at a rate of 17% which the directors consider would have been the interest payable on a bank loan 
without the convertible element. Accordingly the loan notes are recorded as a financial liability at £2,065,350 as at 
30 June 2010. An equity reserve has been created being the difference in value of the loan at inception and the 
£2.3m issue value, representing the equity element of the instrument.  
 
D E M Mond has converted £500,000 of the loans due to himself for £500,000 of the secured convertible loan notes 
at the time of issue of the loan notes in April 2010. 
 
The loan to D E M Mond of £700,000 ( 2009: £1,200,000) is repayable on 31 March 2012 or earlier at the Group’s 
discretion although there is a confirmation in place that this support will continue should the Group not be in a 
position to repay the loan and continue to meet other liabilities as they fall due.  Loan repayments may only be made 
with permission of the secured convertible loan note holders on condition that forecasts show minimum working 
capital of £500,000 for the 6 months following repayment.  Interest of £115,513 (2009: £126,600) was paid by the 
Group to D E M Mond in the year in respect of his loans. Interest of £44,924 was paid to the secured convertible 
loan note holders in the year (2009: £nil).  ClearDebt Group plc

Provision for liabilities and charges – deferred taxation  
 
On 2 December 2009 the Group purchased the goodwill and assets of certain subsidiaries of Relax (see note 18). 
Following the estimation of the fair values of the assets purchased the Group provided £105,840 in respect of 
deferred taxation in relation to the acquisition. During the year £37,101 of this provision has been released to the 
profit and loss account based upon the revenue received to date as a proportion of the total estimated revenue to be 
received at the time of acquisition.

On 25 May 2010 shareholders approved a reorganisation of the share capital splitting each old 2p Ordinary Share 
into a new 0.5p Ordinary share and a 1.5p Deferred Ordinary share.  
 
The Deferred Ordinary Shares of 1.5p each carry the same rights as the new Ordinary 0.5p shares save that they do 
not carry any rights to vote at general meetings or any rights to receive dividends. The Deferred Ordinary Shares are 
not capable of transfer at any time without the prior written consent of the Directors and have the right to repayment 
of the paid up capital only on any winding up or return of capital. It is the intention of the Board to seek Court 
approval to cancel the Deferred Ordinary Shares and the Share Premium Account in due course.   
 
The Company has granted equity settled share options to selected directors and employees under an EMI scheme. 
The exercise price is the market value of the shares at the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. If the 
options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant then they are forfeited. 
  
At 30 June 2010 there were 11,750,000 (2009: Nil) share options outstanding over the Company’s ordinary shares at 
an exercise price of 2.0p per share.

These share options are normally exercisable between 7 October 2012 and 7 October 2019 providing the employee

The options outstanding at 30 June 2010 had a weighted average exercise price of 2p and a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 9 years and 3 months. 
 
The fair value of options granted under the scheme is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The inputs into

No warrants were exercised during the year.  All the above warrants expired unexercised on 17 July 2010.  
 
On 13 March 2007 the Company entered into a referral agreement with Money Helper.  The agreement provided for 
the issue of up to 10 million warrants subject to certain vesting conditions at a price of 3p per ordinary share.  These 
warrants would have been exercisable up until 28 March 2010.  No warrants have been issued to Money Helper and 
accordingly none have vested for issue under the agreement or will be issued under the agreement. 
 
On 22 June 2007 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Abacus (Financial Consultants) Limited

certain performance targets were met in the financial periods up to and including the year ended 30 June 2010. None 
of the performance targets have been met and accordingly no new shares have or will be issued under the agreement.

18. Acquisition 
 
On 2 December 2009 the Group purchased from Relax Group the goodwill and assets of certain subsidiaries of 
Relax.  The assets purchased comprised the goodwill of the IVA business which traded as Synergi Partners; the 
Debt Management business which traded under the name of Debtcare; and the Protected Trust Deed business which 
traded under the name of Adie Financial Services or AFS.  
 
The total consideration due to the Administrator was £2,700,000 which has been paid in full.  
 
The assets acquired were exclusively intangible assets represented by the future income stream due from the 
collection of the back books of IVA, PTD and DMP cases managed by each business. At the date of acquisition the 
fair values of the assets purchased comprised the following:

Included in the results for the year are revenues of £2,601,090 and a pre tax profit of £120,817 excluding the gain on 
purchase of a bargain asset of £252,914. 
 
We have estimated the timing of, and the expected future income due, from the back books acquired less a provision 
for future expected delinquency together with the estimated costs necessary to collect in the income. This has been 
produced on a net present value basis to provide an estimate of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.  
 
The fair value of the net assets acquired was £2,952,914 which is in excess of the £2.7m cost of acquisition. 
Accordingly under IFRS the consolidated income statement has been credited with a gain on bargain purchase of 
£252,914 in the period and has been included in separately disclosable items.

20. Financial instruments 
 
It is not the Group’s policy to invest in financial derivatives.  Although the financial risks are considered to be 
minimal at present, future interest rate, liquidity and foreign currency risk could arise and the Board will review its 
existing policies in the coming period.  The Group finances its operations from cash resources, short term loans and 
convertible debt. 
 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s objective is to minimise its exposure to the effects of fluctuations in interest rates whilst balancing this 
against the need to minimise borrowing costs.  To manage exposure to interest rate risk the Group has taken all 
borrowings on a fixed interest rate.  The only assets that attract a cash flow risk are cash and cash equivalents. 
 
Liquidity risk 
It is the Group’s policy to manage liquidity in order to achieve continuity of funding.  This is managed by detailed 
projections and monitoring of expenditure with significant items of expenditure requiring approval of senior 
management. 
 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group has no overseas assets or liabilities. 
 
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets 
All the financial assets of the Group were floating rate or non interest bearing assets.  Floating rate financial assets 
comprise cash deposits on money market deposits at call and interest was received at a rate of between 0.5% and 
1.4%.  At 30 June 2010 interest bearing financial assets of the Group totalled £541,504 (2009: £584,593). 
 
Credit risk 
The Group’s objective is to minimise credit risk as far as possible whilst maximising returns on financial assets.  
The financial assets of the Group are placed on money markets with the Group’s bankers and other banks.  As such 
the Group is exposed to counter party risks with respect to deposits placed with its bankers.  Financial institutions in 
which deposits are made are selected based on their credit rating as well as the returns offered. 
 
There is an inherent risk of default in trade receivables.  The Group minimises its risk by ensuring that IVAs are 
only entered into appropriately to minimise the risk of failure of the IVA.  The risk of default will generally only 
arise if an IVA fails in the first 6 months. 
 
Details of exposure and ageing of the trade receivables are shown at note 12.  The total exposure to the Group at 30 
June 2010 in respect of trade receivables and cash amounts to £1,546,667 (2009: £1,152,679).

The Group defines capital as equity and long term debt. 
 
The Group’s objective for managing capital is to balance the risk and reward to shareholders by ensuring an

The operating leases represent leases on the office premises used by the Group at its Timperley and Staveley, 
Chesterfield sites as well as office equipment. These leases are due to expire between November 2010 and 
November 2012. 
 
 
22.   Contingent Liabilities  
 
In December 2009 certain insolvency assets of Relax were purchased from its Administrator and the insolvency 
related employees were taken on as part of the purchase. Claims have been received by a number of employees of 
the former Relax companies who did not work in the insolvency businesses alleging that they should have 
transferred to Company as a result of the acquisition. These claims are being vigorously defended and are listed for 
preliminary hearings over the coming months on various points of law initially. Should the claims not be struck out 
they will proceed to tribunal hearings where we are confident of success given the legal advice received at the time 
of the acquisition. All legal costs are being borne by the Company’s employment insurers although there could be 
potential liabilities in respect of any awards that may ultimately be made against the Company.  
 
The directors are satisfied on the basis of information presently held that no provision is required at the present time.  ClearDebt Group plc

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.     Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with UK 
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). 
 
Deferred Taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less 
tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.  Timing differences are the differences between the 
Company taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and 
losses in tax arrangements in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements. 
 
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that 
there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be 
deducted. 
 
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  Deferred tax is measured on a 
non-discounted basis. 
 
Cash Flow Statement 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by FRS1 not to present a cash flow statement. 
 
Investments  
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost except where in the opinion of the directors, there has been permanent 
diminution in the value of the investments, in which case an appropriate adjustment is made. 
 
Share-Based Compensation 
Equity-settled share based payments are measured at the fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of 
options or warrants.  The fair value determined is recognised as an expense if it relates to trading activities or in the 
share premium account if it relates to the issue of equity instruments.  The total amount to be expensed over the 
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or warrants granted, excluding the impact of 
any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and growth targets).  Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in the assumptions about the number of options or warrants that are expected to become exercisable.  At 
each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimates of the number of options or warrants that are expected to 
become exercisable.  It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
and a corresponding adjustment to reserves over the remaining vesting period. 
 
The proceeds received net of any attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share 
premium when the options or warrants are exercised. 
 
Non vesting conditions which are not satisfied during the vesting period are treated as cancellations and any 
remaining expense is accelerated in the period of failure. Share based payments associated with share options 
granted to employees of subsidiaries of the parent company are treated as an expense of the subsidiary company to 
be settled by equity of the parent company. The share based payment expense increases the value of the parent 
company’s investment in the subsidiaries and is credited to the Share based payment reserve. 
 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural 
considerations.  ClearDebt Group plc

1.   Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Tangible Fixed Assets  
All tangible property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Depreciation is provided at rates calculated 
to write off the cost less residual value of each asset over its expected useful life, as follows: 
 
Fixtures and fittings   -  25% straight line 
 
Residual value and estimated remaining lives are reviewed annually. 
 
Other Intangible Assets 
Internal and externally acquired intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and subsequently amortised over 
their useful economic lives. The significant intangibles recognised by the Group, their useful economic lives and the 
methods used to determine the cost of intangibles acquired in a business combination are as follows:- 
 
Other intangibles – websites and databases  -  3 years straight line 
 
Loss attributable to the Members of the Parent Company 
 
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own profit 
and loss account for these financial statements.  The loss dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was 
£435,574 (2009: £198,643).

On 25 May 2010 shareholders approved a reorganisation of the share capital splitting each old 2p ordinary share into 
a new 0.5p Ordinary share and a 1.5p Deferred Ordinary share.  
 
The Deferred Ordinary Shares of 1.5p each carry the same rights as the new Ordinary 0.5p shares save that they do 
not carry any rights to vote at general meetings or any rights to receive dividends. The Deferred Ordinary Shares are 
not capable of transfer at any time without the prior written consent of the Directors and have the right to repayment 
of the paid up capital only on any winding up or return of capital. It is the intention of the Board to seek Court 
approval to cancel the Deferred Ordinary Shares and the Share Premium Account in due course.

9.    Share capital (continued) 
 
On 13 March 2007 the Company entered into a referral agreement with Money Helper.  The agreement provided for 
the issue of up to 10 million warrants subject to certain vesting conditions at a price of 3p per ordinary share.  These 
warrants would have been exercisable up until 28 March 2010.  No warrants have been issued to Money Helper and 
accordingly none have vested for issue under the agreement or will be issued under the agreement. 
 
On 22 June 2007 the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Abacus (Financial Consultants) Limited 
for £1.2m in cash together with a deferred consideration payable of up to £5m which was to be satisfied by the issue 
of up to 222,222,222 new shares at a price of 2.25 pence each. The deferred consideration was payable provided 
certain performance targets were met in the financial periods up to and including the year ended 30 June 2010. None 
of the performance targets have been met and accordingly no new shares have or will be issued under the agreement. 
 
10.   Acquisition  
 
On 2 December 2009 the Company purchased from Relax the goodwill and assets of certain subsidiaries of Relax.  
The assets purchased comprised the goodwill of the IVA business which traded as Synergi Partners; the Debt 
Management business which traded under the name of Debtcare; and the Protected Trust Deed business which 
traded under the name of Adie Financial Services or AFS.  
 
The total consideration due to the Administrator was £2,700,000 which has been paid in full.  
 
The assets acquired were exclusively intangible assets represented by the future income stream due from the 
collection of the back books of IVA, PTD and DMP cases managed by each business. At the date of acquisition the 
fair values of the assets purchased comprised the following:

13.   Contingent Liabilities  
 
In December 2009 certain insolvency assets of Relax were purchased from its Administrator and the insolvency 
related employees were taken on as part of the purchase. Claims have been received by a number of employees of 
the former Relax companies who did not work in the insolvency businesses alleging that they should have 
transferred to the Company as a result of the acquisition. These claims are being vigorously defended and are listed 
for preliminary hearings over the coming months on various points of law initially. Should the claims not be struck 
out they will proceed to tribunal hearings where we are confident of success given the legal advice received at the 
time of the acquisition. All legal costs are being borne by the Company’s employment insurers although there could 
be potential liabilities in respect of any awards that may ultimately be made against the Company.  
 
The directors are satisfied on the basis of information presently held that no provision is required at the present time.

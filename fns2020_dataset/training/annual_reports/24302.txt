Pioneering Animal Genetic 
Improvement
Genus is a world-leading animal genetics 
company. We provide farmers with superior 
genetics that enable them to produce 
higher-quality animal protein more 
efficiently, in the form of meat and milk.
Genus is a market leader in porcine, dairy and beef genetics 
and is uniquely positioned as a global player, with a dedicated, 
multi-species research and development (‘R&D’) function and 
an international distribution network.
Genus at a Glance
What We Do
Genus applies DNA analysis to accelerate 
genetic improvement and deliver it to 
our customers, quickly and efficiently. 
We breed and distribute the genes of the 
world’s best pigs and bulls, scientifically 
selecting livestock whose offspring are 
designed to increase the profitability of our 
customers, who are some of the world’s 
leading farmers and food producers.
In the porcine market, we sell genetically superior 
boars and sows that produce offspring with 
desirable characteristics, such as feed-efficient 
growth or leaner meat.
In the dairy and beef markets, our primary 
product is bull semen, which is delivered 
through artificial insemination to improve our 
customers’ herds and their efficiency. We also 
offer genetically superior embryos, through our 
subsidiary IVB.
How We Operate
Genus sells under well-known trademarks: ‘PIC’ 
for pigs and ‘ABS’ for dairy and beef cattle. During 
the year, we served our customers through three 
business units:
Genus PIC, which serves porcine customers in North 
America, Latin America and Europe.
Genus ABS, which serves dairy and beef customers  
in North America, Latin America and Europe.
Genus Asia, which serves porcine, dairy and beef 
customers in fast-growing Asian markets.
Our Asia unit was established in 2012 to create a strong base 
in the region’s diverse and fast-changing markets. In FY17, 
we will integrate the Asia unit’s porcine and bovine operations 
into the global PIC and ABS units, respectively.

Implementing a  
Successful Strategy
Chairman’s Introduction 
“ Genus delivered another 
strong performance in 201 6, 
with a second consecutive year 
of robust profit growth.”
Genus PIC and our Asian operations were the driving forces behind 
this growth, with Genus ABS seeing profits decline as its dairy 
customers faced further falls in milk prices.
The Group’s strategy focuses on creating differentiated products, 
targeting key markets, and sharing in the value we deliver to 
customers. We made further strong progress against each of 
these objectives. Our research and development programmes 
are producing genetic gains that offer increased productivity, 
efficiency and profit to our customers. We aim to be at the 
forefront of science in our field and in the year developed 
or acquired exclusive rights to gene editing technology and 
applications. We also made good progress in preparing our 
Genus Sexed Semen technology for commercialisation.
China and India are the world’s largest porcine and dairy markets 
respectively. We signed further royalty agreements in China and 
opened a world-class bull stud in India, positioning us for future 
growth in these markets. 
As well as increasing our strategically important royalty revenues, 
we continued to demonstrate the value of our genetics through 
new proprietary indices targeted at traits that create value for 
commercial customers thus helping customers to understand 
the benefits of our superior genetics and allowing us to share 
in the value we add.
Developing our Board and People
The latest independent evaluation of the Board and its 
Committees shows that the Board continues to provide strong 
and effective leadership. Succession planning and diversity are 
important focus areas for us and having previously identified the 
need for an additional Non-Executive Director, we were delighted 
to appoint Lysanne Gray to the Board during the year. Lysanne 
brings considerable experience of risk management, audit, 
business operations and the food sector, broadening the range 
of skills and knowledge on the Board.
Mike Buzzacott will be retiring from the Board at this year’s  
Annual General Meeting, after more than seven years as a 
Non-Executive Director and chairman of the Audit Committee. 
On behalf of the Board I want to acknowledge his significant 
contribution during this time, particularly in transforming the 
Committee into an effective value adding resource, whilst 
developing and embedding our risk management processes.  
We thank him for his contributions and wish him well for the future.
More information on the Board and our corporate governance 
arrangements can be found on pages 44 to 87.

Customer 
Centric
We are one team, dedicated to 
helping customers thrive. We 
anticipate their needs and help 
them seize opportunities, acting 
as partners to improve quality, 
efficiency and output. If we’re not 
adding value for our customers, 
we stop and think again.
Results 
Driven
We are proactive, determined to 
be the best we can be and to exceed 
expectations. We redefine standards 
for ourselves, our customers and 
our industry. Every one of us takes 
pride in delivering the highest level 
of performance. If something can 
be improved, we find a simpler, 
better way to do it.
Pioneering
We are an innovative, forward-
thinking company. We have the 
courage and confidence to explore 
new ideas and the energy and 
enthusiasm to deliver them. We are 
creative, tenacious and resourceful 
in every area of our work.
People 
Focused
We are a business rooted in science 
but built around our people. We 
inspire, challenge and support 
everyone to perform, develop and 
grow. We treat others with respect 
and we invite views and feedback 
to help us improve.
Responsible
We are ethical to our core. We feel 
a deep sense of responsibility to 
our customers, colleagues, animals, 
communities and shareholders. 
We are honest, reliable and 
trustworthy. We mean what we 
say and do what we say.
Our Values
Genus employs over 2,600 people in 26 countries, whose expertise 
and dedication enable us to innovate and deliver for customers. I 
want to thank everyone for helping to make this another successful 
year. In recognition of our people’s importance, we continue to 
invest in developing their skills and ensuring we have a strong 
pipeline of critical talent coming through the organisation. To 
enhance our proprietary, differentiated products for customers, 
in the last year we have focused on recruiting, retaining and 
developing employees who can help us explore and harness 
outstanding science.
The Board recognises its responsibility for setting the behaviours 
and ethical standards we want to see throughout Genus. Our 
values (see right) underpin our culture, which is one of respect, 
openness and fairness.
Since the year end, we have been focused on the court case 
with Inguran LLC trading as Sexing Technologies (‘ST’) in Madison, 
Wisconsin. The jury’s verdict, delivered in mid-August, confirmed 
that ST had wilfully maintained monopoly power in the market 
for processing bovine sexed semen since July 2012, but that ABS 
had infringed two patents and breached confidentiality under our 
existing contract with ST. We are currently awaiting the court’s 
decision on our request for an injunction which, if granted, will 
allow us to terminate the existing ST contract and remove the 
contractual prohibitions preventing the launch of our GSS product 
in the short term. Full details of the case can be found in note 7 
but as shareholders will readily understand this is an important 
milestone in the development of the ABS dairy business.
Returns to Shareholders
The Board aims to balance the need to invest in the business, 
so we can capture the growth opportunities we see in front of us, 
with the requirement to offer shareholders an attractive return 
on capital and rising dividends.
We are recommending a final dividend of 14.7 pence per 
share, giving a total dividend for the year of 21.4 pence per 
share, following the interim dividend of 6.7 pence. This represents 
an increase of 10% over last year’s total dividend of 19.5 pence. 
The final dividend will be paid on 2 December 2016, to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 18 November 2016.
Summary
This was a pleasing year for Genus, with robust financial 
performance in often difficult markets, and good progress 
with our strategy. In the coming year, the Board will continue 
to focus on successfully implementing the Group’s strategy, the 
competitive landscape, managing risk and continuing to enhance 
governance. 2017 will see us step up our investment in research 
and development, as we look to further develop and progress 
our differentiated product offerings and position the business 
for long-term success.

Rapid Innovation and 
Strong Fundamentals
Genus is a leader in the porcine and 
bovine genetics markets and benefits 
from significant barriers to entry supported 
by its investment in technology.
Our Investment Case
Leading 
international 
market position 
Genus is a world leading 
provider of genetically elite 
breeding stock to pork, 
beef and milk producers 
globally, competing largely 
with national and regional 
farmer-owned cooperatives. 
Our international breadth 
reduces our reliance on any 
individual market or segment.
Focused, 
multi-species, 
technology-driven 
business model
Genus is exclusively focused 
on pioneering animal 
genetic improvement, 
by leading the way in 
adopting new technology. 
Our proprietary genomic 
selection and gene editing 
capabilities can be applied 
across multiple species. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Positive  
long-term market 
fundamentals 
Growth in global demand 
for animal protein increases 
competition for finite 
resources, such as water 
and land. Farmers are 
increasingly looking to 
genetics and technology 
to help them meet this 
demand more efficiently, 
so they can compete 
effectively.
Barriers 
to entry 
 
Genus invests heavily in 
proprietary technologies 
to produce ever-higher 
performing animals, raising 
the bar for our competitors. 
Our branded, strategic 
distribution network 
serves more than 40,000 
customers globally.
Cash generative  
with a strong 
financial position 
In the last five years 
we have converted over 
90% of our adjusted 
operating profit into cash 
and maintained net debt 
below 1.5 times EBITDA. 
Our recently renewed debt 
facilities provide us with 
£50m of headroom and 
expire in 2021. This enables 
us to invest in technology 
and accelerate genetic 
gain, further differentiating 
our products from 
the competition’s. Genus plc

Long-Term Demand Drivers for 
Animal Genetic Improvement
Our Market
There are sustainable long-term 
drivers of global demand for 
animal protein and the way it 
is supplied. Genetic improvement 
is critical to addressing the 
associated challenges.
2. Supply Constraints and Uncertainty
Volatile weather and increasing competition for scarce resources, 
such as water and land, can constrain animal protein production. 
These factors can also affect the availability of raw materials, 
particularly animal feed, which indirectly impacts protein 
production. This puts pressure on producers to be as efficient 
as possible.
3. More Integrated Supply Chains
Supply chains are vertically integrating, resulting in fewer 
participants in the chain. This increases transparency of where 
food comes from, giving consumers more influence over food 
producers, and driving demand for higher-quality animal protein 
and more disease-resistant animals, with less use of drugs.
4. Protein Producers Becoming Larger and 
Increasing Use of Technology
Producers are increasingly looking to technology to become more 
efficient. For example, dairy farmers are rapidly adopting embryo 
technology, so they can select both male and female parents 
and deliver a step change in the quality of their milking herds.
Producers also seek efficiency gains through scale. In porcine, 
large scale integrated production represents the majority 
of capacity in the US and Brazil, and is growing fast in China. 
Larger producers typically measure performance in more detail 
and better understand the benefits of superior genetics.

1. Growing Demand for Animal Protein
The global population is expected to grow by over 1 billion 
between 2015 and 2030, with the proportion of urbanised 
populations increasing from 54% to 60% of the total over 
the same period. Urbanised populations tend to become 
wealthier, leading to greater appetite for animal protein.

Over 1.2 billion pigs are produced for slaughter globally each 
year in the markets in which PIC operates, of which around half 
are produced in China.
The majority of pigs in Asia come from small scale production 
facilities, which typically employ less technology. However, the 
drive for efficiency is causing a shift in production towards larger, 
more integrated production with higher use of technology. 
This will lead to an increased demand for higher quality genetics, 
growing PIC’s addressable market. PIC currently supplies over 
60% of the world’s top pork producers.
Market Opportunity in Beef
Market Opportunity in Porcine
The vast majority of beef cattle in our target markets are bred 
on pasture by releasing bulls for natural breeding. Less than 
10% of beef animals in these markets are serviced through AI, 
although this offers access to elite genetics. Competing demands 
for land and resources are expected to increase the drive for 
efficiency and quality. This is expected to give rise to demand for 
better genetics delivered through AI, as well as new technology, 
including IVF and gender skew. ABS currently has around a 20% 
share of the addressable AI market.
Market Opportunity in Dairy
Elite genetics are sourced internationally from donor parents and 
delivered through artificial insemination (‘AI’). As the use of AI 
increases, so does ABS’s market. There is also a large spread in 
milk yield between countries with similar AI levels, presenting an 
opportunity to increase productivity by displacing locally sourced 
semen with elite genetics, and through adopting technology. 
To compete in this market, genetics providers must be able to 
produce elite genetics, distribute them globally and effectively 
communicate their benefits. A small but growing market segment 
is also adopting in vitro fertilisation (‘IVF’) and gender skew 
technologies, to accelerate genetic improvement in their herds.
In the short term, milk prices affect farmer profitability and their 
demand for elite genetics. The past two years have seen falling 
milk prices in key markets, reducing demand for elite genetics. Genus plc

Our Core  
Strengths
Genetically elite animals
We own genetically elite pork, beef and 
dairy breeding herds, and also have strategic 
partnerships with third-party bovine breeders.
Leading technology and know-how
We have a team of over 90 PhD scientists 
in-house, and collaborative relationships 
with leading research institutions. We also 
have cutting-edge technologies that enable 
us to skew the chances of getting male or 
female offspring, produce embryos and 
edit animals’ genes.
Global supply chain and distribution
We produce bovine semen from our facilities 
across four continents, and sell it through 
our own staff and independent third-party 
resellers. We also produce embryos in the US 
and Latin America. In porcine, we genetically 
manage herds in over 40 countries. More than 
95% of these herds are third-party owned, 
reducing our farming and commodity risk.
Strong customer base
In bovine, we serve over 40,000 customers 
globally, including some of the world’s leading 
beef and dairy producers. In porcine, we 
serve over 60% of the world’s leading pork 
producers, and engage most of them in 
multi-year supply agreements.
Our Business  
Model
Produce differentiated products
Our customers want higher performing animals that 
require less feed to grow, are more resistant to disease 
and produce higher quality protein. We produce animals 
with desirable characteristics by continuously selecting the 
highest performing animals in our herds and throughout 
our supply chain to breed superior generations using our 
technology and know-how, in a continuous cycle.
Distribute genetics quickly and efficiently  
to our customers
To give our customers the number of elite pigs they 
need, we deliver live animals and semen to third-party 
‘multipliers’ or our customers, who then multiply our pigs 
over four generations to deliver slaughter pigs. Our global 
supply chain and distribution quickly gets our latest 
genetics to customers.
We distribute bovine genetics as semen, embryos and live 
animals. We produce and process these in strategically 
located studs and laboratories, both owned and third 
party, and sell them directly in 21 countries, and through 
distributors in approximately 50 countries. We offer sexed 
bovine genetics, as well as elite frozen embryos.
To maximise our products’ performance in customer herds, 
our global technical service teams advise on nutrition, 
reproduction, health and other areas.
Our Business Model
Genus uses genome science to produce more efficient 
pigs and cattle for farmers. We deliver these animals into 
our customers’ herds as efficiently as possible and we 
link the amount we charge our customers to the 
benefits our superior animals deliver for them. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Delivering For  
Our Stakeholders
Customers
Our genetically superior animals help our customers 
to produce better quality and quantity of meat or 
milk at lower cost.
Consumers and communities
Our animals help to reduce the volume of feed 
and water required to produce meat and milk. This 
lessens our customers’ environmental impact and 
increases the availability of safe, affordable animal 
protein for all.
Our people
Genus employees have the opportunity to develop 
themselves and harness cutting edge science to 
deliver value for our customers, whilst benefiting 
communities, animal welfare and the environment.
Investors
As we share in the value that our products deliver 
to customers, we deliver attractive returns to 
our investors.
Share in the value created
We price our products to reflect the value they deliver 
for our customers.
Our bovine genetics sold as semen are valued using 
both public and, increasingly, proprietary economic 
indices, which capture a weighted basket of desirable 
characteristics. Embryos are priced based on the 
genetic merit of both parents, determined through 
their respective index rankings.
Our porcine genetics are measured through our indices 
aimed at customer profitability, and are primarily sold 
on multi-year pricing models, with an upfront payment 
equal to the cost of production and a deferred royalty 
linked to the volume of pigs produced. This creates 
customer loyalty and aligns our interests with theirs. Genus plc

Key Performance Indicators
Increasing Genetic Control and Product Differentiation
T argeting Key Markets and Segments
We monitor and measure our strategic progress by reference to 
the three parts of our strategy: increasing genetic control and 
product differentiation; targeting key markets and segments; 
and sharing in the value delivered.
Measures the genetic gain we achieve in our 
porcine nucleus herds. 
Definition
The index measures the marginal economic 
value improvement in customers’ US$ 
profitability, per commercial pig per year, 
on a rolling three-year average. Prior years’ 
index ratings have been updated, to reflect 
the latest results from genomic selection 
and the economic values of pork production.
Performance
Implementing genomic selection technology 
in 2013 led to an immediate step change in 
genetic gain value improvement. This continued 
in 2016, with an improvement of US$3.15.
Monitors our success in developing bulls that 
are highly ranked, because of their genetic 
performance and economic merit.
Definition
The number of our generally available Holstein 
bulls listed in the top 100 Net Merit US$ rankings 
for progeny tested and the top 100 Genomic 
Net Merit rankings for genomically tested sires.
Performance
Genus maintained a competitive industry 
line-up. Holstein proven bulls declined due to a 
limited pipeline of genomic bulls several years 
ago. We have continued to strengthen our 
current position in the genomic bull category.
  Genomic

Tracks our global unit sales growth in dairy 
and beef.
Definition
The change in volume of dairy, beef and sorted 
units of semen, delivered to customers in 
the year.
Performance
Total bovine volumes declined 6% to 17.3 million 
doses in tough dairy markets, with Europe and 
North America particularly challenging. Beef 
units grew 4% as farmers continued to increase 
use of beef semen in dairy cows.
Tracks the growth in the number of pigs with 
PIC genetics globally.
Definition
The change in volume of both direct and 
royalty animal sales, using a standardised 
MPEs measure of the slaughter animals that 
contain our genetics. Results include MPEs 
from Agroceres PIC, our Brazilian JV, and prior 
years have been restated for consistency.
Performance
Volumes grew 4% to 136 million MPEs with 
strong double digit growth in Asia from our 
China, Russia and Vietnam businesses and 
strong royalty volume growth across all regions. 
Volumes of upfront animals, where MPEs are 
counted at the time of initial sale, declined 
as planned.   Genus plc

To track underlying profit generation.
Definition
Operating profit including share of JVs, adjusted 
to exclude IAS 41 valuation movements on 
biological assets, amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, share-based payments 
and exceptional items.
Performance
£54.3m, up £3.1m (up £4.6m in constant 
currency) due to strong performances across 
our porcine businesses, particularly in China, 
partially offset by declines in our Europe and 
North America dairy businesses and increased 
investment in R&D.
Monitors our success in converting profits 
into cash.
Definition
Cash generated by operations before capital 
expenditure, investments, interest, tax and 
dividends, expressed as a percentage of 
adjusted operating profit (excluding JVs).
Performance
Cash conversion of 88% was consistent with 
historical averages, following two very strong 
years that benefited from a step change in 
working capital management and the benefit 
of the exit from the Quebec nucleus in 2015.
Monitors porcine profitability by unit.
Definition
Net porcine adjusted operating profit globally, 
expressed per MPE. Results include share of 
Agroceres PIC, our Brazilian JV.
Performance
£0.51, up £0.08 in actual and constant currency, 
helped by strong growth in our China porcine 
business and higher royalty volumes across all 
sales regions.

depreciation and amortisation (excluding JVs).
Performance
1.4, up 0.2 on last year, reflecting the increase 
in net debt from £71.8m to £89.7m primarily 
as a result of foreign exchange movement on 
our US Dollar borrowings, partially offset by 
higher EBITDA.
Monitors bovine profitability by unit.
Definition
Net dairy and beef adjusted operating 
profit globally, expressed per dose of semen 
delivered. Excludes India, as its characteristics 
are substantially different to the rest of our 
bovine business.
Performance
£0.60, down £0.28 (down £0.23 in constant 
currency) due to weak dairy markets in Europe 
and North America, along with impacts from 
foreign exchange rates. The longer term trend 
has been caused by higher cost of genomic 
bulls, increased product development to build 
our own genetic improvement capability 
and currency impacts, particularly in Latin 
America. Initiatives to address this trend include 
producing bulls internally, launching our GSS 
technology and building IVF capability, along 
with cost efficiency and pricing actions.  Genus plc

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Genus supplies biological products to agricultural customers 
and is exposed to a wide range of risks and uncertainties.
Some of these risks relate to current 
business operations in our global 
agricultural markets, while others relate 
to future commercial exploitation of our 
extensive R&D portfolio. The table below 
outlines the principal risks and uncertainties 
affecting Genus and how we manage them.
The Directors confirm that they have 
undertaken a robust assessment of the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group.
More information on the types and levels 
of risks the Board is prepared to seek and 
accept in executing the strategy, and 
how we define risk appetite and identify 
and manage risks, can be found in the

 • Increased competition to secure 
elite genetics.
Dedicated teams align our 
product development to customer 
requirements, while our technical 
services help customers make best 
use of our products. We frequently

Commercialising GSS 
technology
 • Launching a new product technology 
carries technical, production and 
financial risks.
 • Failure to commercialise our GSS 
technology due to intellectual property 
(‘IP’) and other disputes.
We have a rigorous process to prepare 
for the successful commercial launch 
of our GSS technology, supported 
by dedicated internal resources 
and external expert advice.
We also initiated legal proceedings in 
the US, in relation to anti-trust issues 
which, together with patent counter-
claims, went to trial in August 2016. 
1
No change. The initial verdicts 
in the legal proceedings create 
a path to commercialisation but 
further rulings by the Court are 
awaited to bring clarity to the 
next steps. Technical progress 
to scale up for commercial 
launch also progressed well, 
reducing launch risk. 
Developing and 
commercialising gene 
editing technologies 
 • Failure to successfully develop 
and commercialise gene editing 
technologies due to technical, IP, 
market, regulatory or financial barriers. 
 • ‘Game-changing’ technology secured 
by competitors. 
Our R&D Portfolio Management Team 
oversees our research, ensures we 
correctly prioritise our R&D investments 
and assesses the adequacy of resources 
and its IP freedom to operate. Formal 
collaboration agreements are in place 
with key partners to ensure responsible 
exploration and development of the 
technologies and the protection of IP. 
The Board is updated regularly on key 
development projects.

 • Failure to identify appropriate 
investment opportunities or to 
perform sound due diligence.
 • Failure to successfully integrate an 
acquired business.

therefore demand for our products 
and services.
 • Increase in our operating costs, 
due to commodity pricing volatility.
We continuously monitor markets 
and seek to balance our costs and 
resources in response to market 
demand. We actively monitor and 
update our hedging strategy to manage 
our exposure. Our porcine royalty 
model and extensive use of third-
party multipliers mitigates the impact 
of cyclical price reductions or cost 
increases in pig production.

No change.
Funding pensions
 • Exposure to costs associated with 
failure of third-party members of joint 
and several liabilities pension scheme.
 • Exposure to costs as a result of external 
factors (such as mortality rates, interest 
rates or investment values) affecting 
the size of the pension deficit.
We are the principal employer for the 
Milk Pension Fund and chair the group 
of participating employers. The fund is 
now closed to future service and has an 
agreed deficit recovery plan, based on 
the 2015 actuarial valuation. We monitor 
the strengths of other employers in 
the fund and have retained external 
consultants to provide expert advice.
n/a
No change. The trustees’ 
decision to grant future 
pension increases on the basis 
of the movement in CPI, rather 
than RPI, will reduce costs. 
However, this is currently being 
partially offset by the impact 
of falling bond yields following 
the EU referendum in the UK. Genus plc

Increasing Genetic Control and 
Product Differentiation
Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory 
Syndrome Virus (‘PRRSv’) is the most 
significant and harmful disease faced 
by pig farmers. Millions of pigs and 
piglets suffer from the virus each year, 
which causes reproductive failure, 
reduced growth and premature death. 
Despite being a challenge for the pork 
industry for more than a quarter of a 
century, there is still no cure.
Case Study  
Tackling Disease with Breakthrough Technology
In December 2015, we announced that 
our long-standing collaboration with 
the University of Missouri had produced 
a major breakthrough – the first pigs 
resistant to this devastating disease. Using 
gene editing, the University was able to 
breed pigs that do not produce a protein 
necessary for PRRSv to spread. Early stage 
studies showed that these pigs stayed 
healthy and gained weight normally when 
exposed to the virus. We are now working 
to further develop this technology and 
expect that it will take at least five years to 
obtain any required regulatory approvals 
and make PRRSv resistant animals 
available to farmers.
Our work will be aided by our new strategic 
collaboration with Caribou Biosciences – 
our largest technology driven alliance 
to date. Caribou is a leader in the 
revolutionary field of CRISPR-Cas9 
gene editing, which allows precise and 
controllable changes to the genome. 
Genus has a worldwide exclusive licence 
to use the technology to develop new 
traits in pigs, cows and potentially other 
livestock species, with PRRSv being one of 
our first targets. This collaboration will 
ensure that Genus remains at the forefront 
of developing and applying technology 
to support animal well-being.  Genus plc

Case Study 
Pursuing Growth in 
the World’s Largest 
Dairy Market
India offers a major opportunity for Genus. 
With a population of 1.25 billion people, 
it is the biggest dairy market in the world. 
However, milk yield and production 
efficiency are low and local restrictions 
have hindered genetic improvement, 
including a ban on importing bulls and 
limits on importing semen.
In view of these restrictions, we explored 
other ways of giving farmers access to our 
much-needed genetics, and identified a 
way of importing elite North American 
genetics in the form of embryos, and 
implanting them in carefully selected 
animals. We needed a local partner to 
help with the process and joined forces 
with the Chitale family, who owned the 
only private stud in India.
As we grew the range of locally housed 
bulls, it became clear that we needed 
a larger production facility. We formed 
a joint venture with the Chitale family 
and in early 2016, opened a truly 
world-class facility, incorporating the 
very latest practice in areas such as bull 
handling, production and health and 
safety. The stud is the leading facility 
of its type in India and one of the 
most advanced in the world.
At full capacity, the stud will be able 
to produce more than 7 million semen 
straws a year. It also has room for 
expansion and is compliant with 
our GSS project, so we are ready to 
implement this when it comes on 
stream. Increasing production is being 
supported by further development of 
our commercial infrastructure and offer 
within India. This includes expanding 
our range of distributors and 
distribution models and developing 
a tailored Indian index for genetics, 
so we can breed for Indian conditions 
and economics.  Genus plc

Case Study 
Expanding Our  
IVF Offering 
In 2015 we acquired a majority holding in IVB, 
the world leader in bovine in vitro fertilisation 
(‘IVF’). While IVF and artificial insemination 
(‘AI’) both allow farmers to improve their 
herds’ genetics on the male side, IVF enables 
them to select elite female genetics as well. 
This allows our customers to accelerate 
annual genetic improvement in their herds.
In 2015/16, ABS and IVB have worked 
together to expand IVB’s geographical 
footprint and its product offering. IVB has 
established a new presence in Mexico, which 
is an exciting market with the largest ‘cow 
pocket’ in Latin America. Mexico offers 
tremendous potential to implement IVF 
technology and to leverage ABS’s strong 
presence. The new operation includes a 
laboratory equipped with the very latest 
technology. IVB has also relocated a complete 
team from Brazil, to ensure its technicians in 
Mexico have substantial experience of IVF. 
This will ensure Mexican producers receive the 
same high quality as our Brazilian customers.
The laboratory in Mexico can produce either 
fresh or frozen embryos for dairy producers. 
IVB’s new Direct Transfer process has 
simplified the freezing and transferring of 
embryos, so they can be implanted in one 
step, similar to AI. Early results show this new 
methodology is achieving equal or better 
results than previous freezing techniques, 
strengthening customers’ confidence in Direct 
Transfer. IVB and ABS have also begun selling 
high genetic merit embryos in Brazil and we 
continue to target the progressive farms 
segment, which has a high level of technology 
adoption and the scale to implement it. Genus plc

Leadership Through Innovation
Sharing in the Value Delivered
Case Study 
Positioning Genus for 
Further Success in China
China is the world’s largest porcine market and 
offers major long-term opportunities for us. 
When we first established a presence in China, 
its differing risk profile led us to operate through 
owned and joint venture farms. In line with our 
global strategy, we are now transitioning to 
contracted production with trusted partners, 
helping to mitigate our exposure to farming 
and commodity price risk.
Riverstone became our first multiplier and 
royalty-based customer in 2014. This year we 
signed a seven-year agreement with the Yunnan 
Shennong Agricultural Industry Group, to enable 
them to establish 50,000 sows for a new 
production facility. The agreement includes 
a multiplication farm, with the capacity to 
produce 30,000 grandparent gilts a year, and 
the establishment of a sire line nucleus, which 
will double our capacity to produce high-quality 
terminal boars in China. Both will initially be 
stocked with the latest high-health great-
grandparent animals from PIC’s genetic nucleus 
in the US. In addition, we signed an agreement 
with Jinluo group, China’s biggest slaughter 
plant, to supply terminal boars for its 50,000 
sow commercial system.
These agreements, and the long-term royalty 
arrangements involved, give us resilient revenues 
and enable us to share in the value created by 
our proprietary genetics.
With this firm foundation in place, we will 
now be integrating our porcine operations in 
China and our other Asian markets into the 
global PIC organisation. This will help us deliver 
a consistent customer experience worldwide, 
while maintaining flexibility to address local 
market needs. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Case Study 
Preventing Post-Calving 
Disorders Through 
Advanced Genetics 
Cows making the transition from giving 
birth to becoming productive members of 
the milking herd can suffer from a number 
of significant health problems. In fact, 
three-quarters of disease in dairy cows 
occurs in their first 30 days in milk and as 
many as half of high-producing cows are 
affected. This means dairies can lose up to 
10% of the herd each year due to transition 
cow problems, resulting in substantial time, 
money and productivity costs.
In August 2015, we launched our 
TransitionRight™ genetics, giving farmers the 
first genetic solution to multiple post-calving 
disorders. Some of the key problems 
TransitionRight™ addresses are mastitis, 
metritis and ketosis, which typically cost US 
farmers between US$200 and US$350 per 
case. By choosing a 5-star TransitionRight™ 
sire, farmers can save an average of US$100 
per lactation compared with a 3-star sire and 
US$200 compared with a 1-star sire. This 
saving reflects lower treatment costs, labour 
and lost profits, as well as avoiding additional 
housing, care, monitoring and feeding 
expense. At the same time, reducing the 
incidence of post-calving disorders is 
beneficial for animal welfare.
Customers worldwide have responded 
positively to TransitionRight™’s introduction 
and have quickly incorporated 
TransitionRight™ into their genetic selection 
criteria. As a result, we have seen growing 
demand for high-ranking 4-star or 5-star 
TransitionRight™ units.  Karim Bitar

Robust Performance
Chief Executive’s Review
“ In 201 7 , we will further 
accelerate our efforts to develop 
and apply the science and 
technology that is essential 
to our longer-term success.”
Chief Executive
2016 was another good year for Genus. The Group performed 
well overall and we met our financial and operational goals, as 
the breadth of our business by geography and species helped 
drive growth, despite challenges in some of our markets. We 
also made strong progress with implementing our innovation-
led strategy, as we develop Genus into a company, based on 
leading-edge science and biotechnology.
Group Performance
Genus achieved a robust performance in 2016, with adjusted 
profit before tax including joint ventures (‘JVs’) rising 7% (10% 
in constant currency) to £49.7m. On a statutory basis, profit 
before tax rose 5% to £60.9m. Porcine volumes rose by 4%, 
although bovine volumes were 6% lower in tough dairy markets. 
Strategically important revenues such as porcine royalties rose 
strongly, however, total revenue was 3% lower.
Genus PIC had another strong and successful year, despite 
challenging conditions for our customers in most regions, 
achieving a 9% growth in adjusted operating profit including 
JVs in constant currency. Profits were up in all regions and 
the business achieved strong growth in royalty volumes and 
revenues. Over the last few years we have repositioned PIC’s 
European operations away from low margin up-front parent 
gilt sales towards royalty contracts, particularly with integrated 
pork producers, and we saw encouraging results in the year 
from this work. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information
 Genus plc
 Annual Report 2016

With dairy customers facing depressed milk prices across major 
markets, Genus ABS had a tough year and saw adjusted operating 
profits fall by 16% in constant currency. We took tactical actions 
on costs and margins to protect short-term performance and 
strategic actions outlined below to position the business for 
long-term growth. IVB, the world’s leading supplier of bovine IVF 
services and products, was successfully integrated following our 
acquisition of 51% in March 2015 and delivered an encouraging 
performance in its first full year in Genus. Our Asian operations 
achieved very strong results across the region, more than 
doubling operating profit including joint ventures. Growth in China 
stood out, as we saw the benefit of our work to focus on large 
scale pork producers while reducing farming risk in this business. 
We also benefited from strong porcine market conditions in 
China. Performance in Russia also improved as porcine import 
restrictions were lifted. 
Strategic Progress
R&D is the starting point for our innovation-led strategy to 
enable us to increase genetic control and product differentiation. 
Genomic selection techniques continue to advance and our 
application of them to accelerate genetic gains in porcine 
continues in our nucleus herds and is now starting to feed into 
performance gains for our customers. We also apply these 
techniques in bovine, developing proprietary indices such as 
TransitionRight™ (see the case study on page 25) focused on dairy 
health traits and progressing our internal breeding programme, 
which is now producing some of our most elite bulls.
On 1 September 2016, we formed De Novo Genetics, a majority-
owned Holstein breeding strategic partnership, with De-Su, the 
world’s leading independent Holstein breeder. De Novo will further 
accelerate the proportion of bulls Genus produces internally by 
combining ABS’s and De-Su’s elite Holstein breeding programmes. 
This will gives us greater control of the genetics we need in order 
to create differentiated solutions that help commercial dairy 
farmers increase profitability through improved herd productivity, 
health and efficiency.
We made excellent technical progress with our GSS technology 
in 2016, as we prepared it for commercialisation. Our litigation 
against ST went to trial in August 2016 and, while there are several 
issues still pending with the Court, the initial verdict’s finding that 
ST had wilfully maintained a monopoly should give us a path to 
the commercial launch of the technology. This could be within 
the next few months if our request for an injunction releasing us 
from our contract with ST is granted. The jury’s findings that our 
technology infringes two of ST’s patents and specifying royalties 
to be paid to ST will be subject to further review by the Court and 
is not expected to delay commercialisation. We look forward to 
bringing competition to this important market.
Gene editing is becoming a key part of our technology platform 
that could transform Genus over time. Our collaboration with 
the University of Missouri produced a major breakthrough during 
the year, by using gene editing to create the first pigs resistant 
to the devastating PRRSv disease. We are working to develop 
this technology, aided by our new strategic collaboration with 
biotechnology pioneer Caribou Biosciences. This gives us an 
exclusive worldwide licence to use the revolutionary CRISPR-
Cas9 gene editing technology to develop new traits in pigs, 
cows and potentially other livestock species. Since the end of 
the year, we have also announced an exclusive worldwide licence 
with Washington State University, for patents and know-how 
relating to gene editing targets for BRD.
Genus continued to target key growth markets during the year, 
with particular progress in India and China. India is the world’s 
largest dairy market and the opening of our joint venture’s new 
bull stud was an important milestone for Genus. This new stud 
is one of the most advanced designs in the world. China is the 
biggest pork producer globally and we strengthened our position 
by signing landmark royalty agreements with three key Chinese 
integrated pork producers.
People and Organisation
With Genus Asia now well established and growing successfully, 
we intend to integrate its porcine and bovine operations into 
PIC and ABS in the coming year. This will support our strategy 
for each species and help us to deliver a consistent experience 
to customers around the world. Jerry Thompson, who has 
successfully led Asia, will take on a new role to further focus our 
efforts in establishing a greater presence with beef customers 
globally as COO Genus ABS Beef. He will work closely with Saskia 
Korink, who will now lead our global Genus ABS Dairy operations.
Our employee pulse survey continued to show that our 
people find Genus an engaging and stimulating place to work. 
They are committed to our vision and understand our strategy 
for achieving it. I want to thank all my colleagues for their 
contribution to delivering for our customers, which in turn 
enables Genus to succeed.
Outlook
Over the last two years, Genus has grown adjusted profit before 
tax in double digits in constant currency. In 2017, we will further 
accelerate our efforts to develop and apply the science and 
technology that is essential to our longer-term success. This will 
lead to a significant step up in R&D investment in 2017 resulting 
in profit for the year being similar to 2016 in constant currency. 
However, we anticipate a benefit from exchange rates, with 
Sterling having declined sharply towards the end of 2015/16. 
Overall, we expect to make further strategic progress in 2017 
and to perform in line with market expectations.

Strategic Progress – Genus PIC
“ We have strengthened our 
foundations for long-term 
success by harnessing leading-
edge technologies.”
Bill Christianson
Chief Operating Officer, Genus PIC
We have continued to grow our porcine business by 
accelerating increases in genetic gain and providing 
world-class products and services. In parallel, we have 
strengthened our foundations for long-term success 
by harnessing leading-edge technologies. During the 
year, we made the following progress against our 
strategic objectives:
Increasing Genetic Control and Product 
Differentiation
 • Harnessed genomics to accelerate genetic gain and 
completed assimilation of genes from Génétiporc 
into our genetic improvement programme.
 • Streamlined our range of Camborough gilts and elite 
terminal boars, to help provide a clear and consistent 
product offering.
 • Worked with R&D colleagues on technologies that 
could aid development of new proprietary products; 
examples include our ground-breaking work to 
develop pigs resistant to Porcine Reproductive and 
Respiratory Syndrome Virus (‘PRRSv’), undertaken 
in collaboration with the University of Missouri.
Targeting Key Markets and Segments
 • Strengthened relationship with large accounts; 
we are currently doing business with more than 
60% of the globally largest accounts.
 • Standardised processes and ways of working, such 
as a global approach to key account management.
 • Explored new ways of working with smaller 
customers, to help meet their needs effectively  
and efficiently.
 • Achieved particular success in Europe following  
our restructuring in 2013, with growth of 22%.
 • Continued to build relationships with key industry 
stakeholders, including holding our latest global 
symposium in May 2016: this was attended by 
around 300 customers, helping us to strengthen 
existing contacts, make new connections and 
associate PIC with the latest thinking.
Sharing in the Value Delivered
 • Ran more product validation trials in more regions 
than ever before, consistently demonstrating the 
value of our products and enabling us to strengthen 
our pricing-for-value strategy in several markets.
 • Continued to transition to a royalty pricing model 
in regions where this is relatively new, with volume 
increases of 8% in Europe, 16% in Latin America and 
6% in Asia, resulting in 76% of our global business 
utilising the royalty model.
Priorities for FY17
 • Continue to pursue our global strategy, tailored as 
needed for local markets.
 • Integrate our Asian porcine operations into our global 
structure, to help deliver a consistent customer 
experience worldwide.
 • Significantly expand our global supply chain. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Operating Review – Genus PIC
Market
Market conditions for Genus’s porcine customers were challenging 
in most regions over the past year. High output, along with 
geopolitical instability in Brazil, Russia and the EU, significantly 
affected profitability across the animal protein value chain. 
Global meat price indices for pork reached a 12-year low. 
North American producers maintained a positive net return for 
the fiscal year, despite these challenging macroeconomic factors. 
A strong export programme, coupled with relatively low cost of 
production, delivered an estimated average of £5 profit per head 
to producers in the United States. Additionally, farm debt ratios in 
the US were low which continued to support expansion in 2015/16. 
The outlook for prices in North America is challenging in the near 
term, but a 6% forecast increase in slaughter capacity in the US 
during 2017 is providing some optimism to the industry. This will 
support overall demand, along with an expected 5% increase 
in exports.
In Europe, the porcine industry suffered from increased 
production and export bans. This led to oversupply and pork prices 
declining around 9% compared with the previous year, leaving 
prices about 20% below the average for the last five years and 
resulting in producers making significant losses. The outlook 
for producers is a bit more encouraging, as prices have recently 
started to rise and some herd contraction has taken place. It is 
also anticipated that exports to China should remain stable.
In Latin America, disease and economic volatility continue to 
challenge producers’ profitability. In Mexico, porcine epidemic 
diarrhoea virus (‘PEDv’) and PRRSv have affected supply and 
contributed to higher pig prices. The political turmoil and recession 
in Brazil have hampered the otherwise promising performance 
of the Latin America pig industry. Even so, Brazil was the fourth 
largest pork producer in 2015/16 and continues to be a major 
participant in the global market. Firm exports to Russia and 
China, in conjunction with strong domestic demand, has Brazil on 
track to increase pork production 3% by the end of the calendar 
year, in spite of elevated input costs. Despite these challenges, 
Latin America remains a growth market.

Performance
During 2015/16, Genus PIC performed strongly. Adjusted operating 
profits including joint ventures were £68.7m, up 9% in constant 
currency, and margins expanded by 4% to 36%. Volumes grew by 
2%, with all regions contributing strong growth in royalty volumes. 
Revenue was 2% lower, primarily due to lower sales of up-front 
animals. However, strategically important royalty revenues rose 
by 13% in constant currency.
In North America, profits were up 8% in constant currency, on 
volume growth of 3%. Strong customer uptake of high genetic 
merit boars through the CBV plus and CBV max pricing structures, 
in addition to high health in customer herds, contributed to 
royalty growth of 9%. A number of customers expanded their 
herds, which contributed to high breeding stock sales volumes.
Latin American profits improved 12% in constant currency, 
on 3% volume increases, helped by a strong operating profit 
performance in Mexico, up 29%. In Brazil, the PIC Agroceres joint 
venture also performed well, with a 23% increase in constant 
currency operating profit, but the rest of the region declined 
due to lower animal shipments to Venezuela, where customers’ 
access to foreign currency was curtailed.
In Europe, volumes were slightly down, with an 8% increase in 
royalty volumes and a 14% decline in up-front volumes, in line 
with the strategic direction of the business. Revenue declined by 
9% due to the lower up-front sales but operating profit increased 
22% in constant currency. The strategic repositioning of the 
PIC Europe business over the last few years, to focus on royalty 
business with larger producers, is starting to show benefits despite 
the tough trading environment in the European pig industry. 
Overall, PIC’s successful execution of its strategy has enabled 
continued positive momentum globally. Genus plc

Strategic Progress – Genus ABS
“ Despite difficult conditions in 
the global dairy market, ABS has 
continued to evolve a broader 
and increasingly differentiated 
range of solutions…”
Saskia Korink Romani
Chief Operating Officer, Genus ABS
Despite difficult conditions in the global dairy market, 
ABS has continued to evolve a broader and increasingly 
differentiated range of solutions to help dairy and beef 
customers ‘Profit from Genetic Progress’. During the year, we 
made the following progress against our strategic objectives, 
whilst also implementing a number of short-term, profit-
focused initiatives to counter the market headwinds:
Increasing Genetic Control and Product 
Differentiation
 • Expanded our elite dairy female programme with 20% 
of our new bulls sourced from it in 2016. In September 
2016 we formed De Novo Genetics in partnership with 
the US’s leading independent Holstein breeder.
 • Strengthened our beef nucleus herd, which is 
expected to deliver 900 bulls to our PowerLine beef 
bull programme by 2019.
 • Launched proprietary indices to help customers 
identify dairy sires with offspring more resistant 
to diseases after giving birth, resulting in price and 
volume increases for high health status bulls.
 • Harnessed IVB’s IVF technology to expand our 
genetic improvement solutions and launched new 
direct transfer frozen embryos in Brazil combining 
elite female and male genetics.
 • Supplied IVF services to a major US dairy customer. 
 • Prepared to launch our proprietary Genus Sexed 
Semen technology in key markets.
Targeting Key Markets and Segments
 • Embedded customer segmentation in our dairy 
business and created a distinct customer experience 
for different segments.
 • Upgraded our proprietary Genetic Management 
System (GMS 2.0), enabling advanced customisation 
and incorporation of genomic data.
 • Established IVB’s operations with new laboratories 
in the US and Mexico, and expanded operations 
in Mozambique.
 • Delivered efficiency savings by reducing sales and 
service staff in Europe and reduced distribution costs.
Sharing in the Value Delivered
 • Implemented a new pricing-to-value strategy in the 
US and UK, based on an ‘ABS Value Index’.
 • Demonstrated and captured a share of the value of 
higher fertility genetics with customers in Brazil.
 • Increased prices in Latin America by over 20% to 
counter the impact of exchange rate devaluations.
Priorities for FY17
 • Drive profit recovery through focus on value and 
cost initiatives.
 • Accelerate delivery of differentiated genetics 
produced internally through De Novo partnership.
 • Harness new technologies and roll out our 
proprietary GSS, to build business with new and 
existing customers. 
 • Continue to grow IVB with large enterprise customers 
and distribute frozen direct transfer embryos to 
medium size customers.
 • Focus on the exciting opportunities in beef, by 
establishing a global team to help us evolve 
proprietary products, continue developing our 
technology and enhance differentiation. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Operating Review – Genus ABS
Market
Conditions in the dairy and beef markets affect our customers’ 
profitability and in turn their willingness, at least in the short term, 
to invest in genetics.
During the year, milk prices remained depressed across major 
markets, with further declines in the US and Europe. Continued 
milk production growth in key regions such as EMEA and 
continued weak import demand from markets such as Russia, 
China and the Middle East led to prices of the main dairy 
commodities being between 20% and 50% below their three-year 
averages. It looks likely that prices will not improve sustainably 
until early 2017.
In Europe, the continuing trade ban imposed by Russia and weak 
exports to China, following previous stockpiling, were exacerbated 
by a supply increase as quotas were lifted and mild weather 
helped production. In the US, demand has remained solid and 
milk production growth has slowed, but higher milk imports 
have affected the supply/demand equation. However, lower feed 
costs have reduced the impact on operating margins compared 
with the rest of the globe. In Brazil, the deepening economic 
recession has led to a further deterioration in dairy demand and 
a fall in farm-gate prices of 18% in real terms, resulting in the 
first contraction in milk production since 1993. Meanwhile, the 
Argentina dairy industry has been badly affected by some of the 
worst flooding in over a decade.
Beef prices in the US were volatile, with a downward trend in 
the first half of 2015/16 and a return towards normal levels by 
the end of the year. In Brazil, cattle prices remained stable in 
the worsening economy, helped by a combination of female 
retention, which has reduced finished cattle going to market, 
and higher exports with the opening of the US as an export 
destination and the devaluation of the Brazilian Real. The outlook 
for global beef prices is broadly stable.

volume decrease and a 3% decline in revenues. Excluding IVB, 
Genus ABS’s revenues were 9% lower. Europe, and to a lesser 
extent North America, were key contributors to the lower results. 
In response to the challenging conditions, ABS took robust actions 
to reduce costs, particularly in Europe, and to raise prices, especially 
in Latin America to counteract the significant currency depreciation 
there. Global beef volumes and revenues increased in the year.
In North America, profits decreased by 8% in constant currency, 
driven by a 9% conventional dairy volume decrease, although 
this was partially offset by increased sorted semen volumes (up 
14%), a higher blend and strong cost management. Beef had 
another strong year, with volumes up 1% over the record prior year, 
including the continued increased use of beef semen in dairy cows.
In Europe, profits decreased by 16% in constant currency. The 
severe weakness in the dairy market drove significant volume 
decreases in the UK, France and the European distributor business. 
However, beef volumes increased by 13% as customers sought 
to trim dairy herd sizes by producing beef cross-bred offspring for 
slaughter. A strong focus on cost reduction, including reducing 
employee numbers and improving service margins, also helped 
to mitigate profit pressures in the second half, even as the market 
prices fell further.
In Latin America, profits were up 20% in constant currency, 
despite volumes declining 10% in tough dairy markets, 
exacerbated by drought in Brazil and flooding in Argentina. In 
actual currencies, profits reduced as a result of the significant 
devaluations across the region. In response, Genus ABS took the 
lead in increasing selling prices in key markets such as Brazil, 
Argentina and Mexico and by June, prices were on average 
24% higher. Our ongoing efforts to manage local supply chain 
costs and operating expenses have also been beneficial. Beef 
performed solidly, given the adverse conditions in Brazil and 
Argentina, with flat volumes.
IVB made a strong contribution to the full year results and 
exceeded our expectations, delivering revenues of £9.3m and 
total operating profit of £2.3m in its first full year of ownership. Genus plc

the previous year. In particular, we saw a recovery within China, 
the world’s largest porcine market, following two years of losses 
in the industry. Rising demand, coupled with limited supplies 
following reductions in the country’s sow herd, placed a premium 
on available animals and pushed up prices to record highs. 
In parallel, the market within Russia rebounded as the country 
reopened its borders to imports of pigs from North America 
and the EU. Demand for pork also remained high in our other 
target markets.
In contrast, conditions for our bovine business were challenging. 
Dairy prices remained low, reflecting the global picture. Milk prices 
fell in Australia and are likely to reduce the number of cows and 
farms within the country. Low prices within China continue to drive 
consolidation of the country’s dairy industry. Although prices in 
India remained stable, the country experienced a major drought 
which affected production and demand.
Performance 
2016 was a year of significantly improved performance, increasing 
operating profit by 138%, with tailwinds from the revitalisation of 
porcine markets in China and Russia. The performance, however, 
also shows that the business has benefited from the strategic 
decisions and investments made in recent years and the tailoring 
of our business model to the needs of each market. 
Porcine
Overall results were significantly higher than for the preceding 
year. Volumes rose by 19%, leading to increases of 22% in revenue 
and over 300% in operating profit including joint ventures in 
constant currency.
Operating profits in China rose by over £6m, as prices increased and 
demand for breeding animals grew. Our business also continued to 
reap the benefits of our move away from owned farms to a more 
contracted production model, which is helping us reduce farming 
exposure and commodity price risk. During the year, we signed 
further multiplication and royalty-based contracts with major 
producers, as summarised in the case study on page 24.

In Russia, we increased profits by 75% in constant currency 
through growth in key accounts, following the re-starting of 
imports to the country. This was also aided by more than doubling 
our sire-line pricing, to reflect the value delivered by our high-
quality genetics. In contrast, profit in the Philippines fell by 9%, 
mainly due to lower up-front margins during the transition to 
a royalty business model.
In Vietnam, where we operate in partnership with GreenFeed, 
profits rose by 92%. We also renewed our porcine franchises 
in Australia and Korea on improved terms, increasing sire-
line pricing significantly in the process, and we signed a new 
franchise in Ukraine.
Across the region, we continued to expand the use of our royalty 
model, which provides extra revenue streams and additional 
resilience in the event of a fall in demand for new breeding 
animals. Royalty revenues across the region rose by 32%. 
Bovine 
Despite difficult market conditions, bovine volumes rose by 2% 
and operating profits by 8%. In China, we further strengthened 
our relationships with key distributors and in Russia, performance 
improved following the refocusing of the business in the prior year. 
We continued to build our business in India and strengthened our 
capabilities in the country with the beginning of operations at our 
new Brahma stud, a joint venture with BG Chitale (see case study 
on page 22).
Our Australian business increased operating profit, aided by 
innovative promotions to mitigate the impact of falling milk prices. 
Operating profit fell in Japan, however, influenced by fewer top 
bulls in local rankings and the strength of the US Dollar.
We also invested in skills and structure to drive performance 
of our bovine business, including appointing our first Regional 
Director for bovine. Genus plc

Strategic Progress – Genus R&D
“ Our R&D programme delivers 
increased genetic control and 
differentiated products for 
customers, by applying 
pioneering technologies.”
Dr Jonathan Lightner
Chief Scientific Officer and Head 
of Genus R&D
During the year, we made significant progress on several 
fronts, with potentially major benefits for animal well-
being, customer productivity and the sustainability of 
protein production.
Genomic Selection 
 • Accelerated genetic gain for porcine customers by 
harnessing genomics and integrated Génétiporc’s 
genes into our genetic improvement programme.
 • Expanded our elite dairy female programme from 
which we sourced 20% of our new Holstein bulls 
in the US in 2016. In September 2016, we entered 
into partnership with the US’s leading independent 
Holstein breeder thereby significantly increasing 
our ability to produce bulls internally.
 • Strengthened our beef nucleus herd, which is 
expected to deliver 900 bulls to our Powerline 
programme by 2019.
 • Introduced TransitionRight™ indices, enabling 
customers to identify dairy sires that produce 
daughters more resilient to health problems 
after giving birth.
Gene Editing
 • Demonstrated the potential benefits of this 
pioneering technology for animals, customers 
and consumers, during a transformative year.
 • Secured an exclusive global licence to the IP involved 
in our ground-breaking work with the University of 
Missouri, which used gene editing to develop the first 
pigs resistant to PRRSv.
 • Agreed an exclusive licence and collaboration 
with Caribou Biosciences, giving us access to its 
market-leading and proprietary CRISPR-Cas9 gene 
editing technology and know-how, which will help 
us accelerate our work on PRRSv and explore other 
applications.
 • Secured an exclusive global licence from the 
Washington State University to gene editing 
work targeting BRD.
Gender Skew 
 • Continued to invest in our proprietary GSS 
technology, thoroughly testing it to ensure it can 
deliver the highest calibre product on a global 
and commercial scale, with field trials resulting 
in thousands of successful pregnancies.
 • Pursued our legal case with ST.
Priorities for FY17
 • Continue to develop proprietary indices, built around 
traits of economic importance to customers.
 • Continue to work with the Roslin Institute on 
genotype by sequencing, which has the potential 
to be the next leap in genomic science.
 • Harness our collaboration with Caribou Biosciences 
and strengthen internal skills, to help build a gene 
editing trait development capability.
 • Prioritise the successful launch and roll-out of GSS.
 • Develop our elite dairy female programme and ability 
to produce bulls internally, working closely with our 
new partner.
 • Develop relationships with regulatory authorities to 
facilitate the future approval of gene edited products. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

in technology improvements to the current GSS system, which 
included new detection approaches with the promise of further 
improvements in fertility. We also continue to build our internal 
capabilities in intellectual property development, regulatory 
affairs and research strategy.
Bovine product development expenditure was unchanged in 
constant currency. We invested in both dairy and beef in our 
internal heifer nucleus breeding programmes, and in genetic 
services resources to develop proprietary breeding indices and 
predictive genomic mating, to deliver higher genetic control and 
differentiation. We also made several key dairy bull acquisitions to 
strengthen our global line up. Depreciation of dairy bulls increased 
year over year, reflecting the continued rising cost of competitive 
bulls in the genomic era, however progeny testing costs and 
management overheads were reduced.
Porcine product development expenditure increased by 12%, 
driven in large part by a decline in slaughter by-product revenues 
from our nucleus herds resulting from lower pork prices, partially 
offset by lower feed prices, and by the non-recurrence of a 
Canadian government support payment in FY15. We also increased 
investment in growing the breadth and depth of our genomic 
testing of animals and continued to expand our global product 
validation programme.
Performance
Our investment in R&D for the year increased by 16% in constant 
currency and capital spending also increased. This reflected 
our investments in gene editing capabilities and licensing, 
genome science, advancing our GSS initiative, and furthering 
our computational capabilities in bovine and beef product 
development. In porcine product development, increases in 
global volume and related dissemination costs, along with lower 
slaughter prices and higher product validation costs, drove the 
year over year increase. In September 2016, we also formed a 
new strategic partnership (De Novo Genetics) with the world’s 
leading independent Holstein breeder, strengthening our ability 
to produce our own elite bulls.
As in previous years, our research focused on genomic evaluation, 
gender skew and animal health and welfare. Research expenditure 
increased by 67% this year, in part due to significant advancements 
in gene editing and our partnerships with the University of Missouri 
and Caribou Biosciences, as well as related legal expenses and 
capability building. We also invested in core informatics capabilities 
and expanded research efforts in a number of promising areas.
In genomic evaluation, we continued to explore the frontiers of 
genomic information and its use in animal genetic improvement. 
We are actively exploring genotype by sequencing approaches 
that could be applied across our animal systems. We successfully 
initiated our multi-year collaboration with the Roslin institute, 
exploring genotype by sequencing opportunities in our PIC 
system. This project is partially funded by a grant from the 
UK government.
In gender skew, where costs were largely capitalised, we 
completed additional testing of our commercial scale capabilities. 
We completed final commercial performance tests of our GSS 
technology, refined our manufacturing processes and initiated the 
production and inventory of units for commercial sale, pending 
the outcome of our Court proceedings. We also invested  Stephen Wilson

Financial Review
“ Genus delivered a solid financial 
performance in the year ended 
30 June 201 6.”
Genus delivered a solid financial performance in the year ended 
30 June 2016, with adjusted profit before tax up 7% (up 10% 
in constant currency) and cash conversion of 88%. Adjusted 
earnings per share were also up 7% (10% in constant currency). 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax was 5% higher and earnings 
per share were 23% higher in actual currency, primarily due to a 
lower statutory tax rate. We continue to use adjusted results as 
our primary measures of financial performance as they better 
reflect our underlying progress. Unless stated otherwise, this 
financial review quotes constant currency adjusted growth rates, 
which better reflect the Group’s underlying performance.
The effect of exchange rate movements on the translation of our 
overseas profits was to reduce the Group’s adjusted profit before 
tax for the year by £1.5m or 3% compared with FY15. At the end of 
the period, Sterling devalued sharply following the UK referendum 
on Brexit. While this had little effect on 2015/16 profits, it had a 
significant translational impact on the year-end balance sheet.
Revenue
Revenue declined by 3% in actual and constant currency to 
£388.3m (2015: £398.5m) during the period. In porcine, Asia 
revenue growth of 22%, primarily in Russia and China, was offset 
by the planned continued reduction in up-front sales in Europe. 
Lower porcine by-product sales were the result of lower pig prices 
and there was a 4% decline in global bovine revenue, due to the 
poor dairy market conditions. 
Adjusted Operating Profit Including Joint Ventures
Adjusted operating profit including JVs was £54.3m (2015: 
£51.2m), up 9% in constant currency and 6% in actual currency. 
Genus’s share of JV profits was higher at £6.4m (2015: £4.6m), 
helped by the strong performance of the Besun JV in China due 
to improved market conditions and lower production costs.
Profits in Genus Asia, excluding JVs, almost doubled with 98% 
growth, helped by Asia Porcine growing by more than 200%. 
PIC China performed very strongly, buoyed by exceptional market 
conditions and reduced production costs resulting from the shift 
from owned farms to more contracted production. The Russia, 
Vietnam and franchise porcine businesses also achieved strong 
double-digit growth, with Russia helped by the country reopening 
its borders to pig imports. Asia Bovine grew 8%, helped by 
improvements in our Australia and Russia businesses following 
restructuring in the prior year. 
Genus PIC had a strong year, with profits up 9%. Volume growth 
of 2% continues to be affected by the shift to royalty contracts, 
with volumes recognised later in the sales cycle. There was also 
some reduction in up-front volumes in Europe during the second 
half of the year, as market conditions remained challenging for 
our customers.

Dairy producers have suffered two years of reducing milk prices 
and Genus ABS began a vigorous drive to mitigate the profit 
impact of these weak market conditions. Operating profit fell 16% 
before minority interest, on a volume decline of 9%. The actions 
focused on cost efficiencies in Europe and North America and 
pricing in Latin America. IVB performed ahead of expectations 
in its first full year of ownership.
R&D costs increased by 16%, as planned, as Genus pursued 
key strategic initiatives to further strengthen its proprietary 
differentiated offerings. This included intellectual property 
creation and protection in gene editing capabilities, aided by our 
new partnerships with the University of Missouri and Caribou 
Biosciences, and further advances in our GSS initiative. We also 
continued to invest in product development, including expansion 
of the beef and dairy elite heifer programmes, which produced 
encouraging results. Net porcine product development costs also 
increased, driven largely by the decline in slaughter by-product 
revenues from our nucleus herds resulting from lower pork prices.

Performance by Species
The table below shows our global performance by species, after allocating product development costs specific to each species.
Dairy and beef revenues declined 4% and volumes declined 6% in tough dairy markets, with Europe and North America particularly 
challenging. Operating profit declined by 32% due to lower volumes and adverse currency cross rates. Actions are continuing to reduce 
cost run rates and increase selling prices in key markets.
Porcine revenues grew by 1%, with royalty income up 17% to £97.8m. Volumes were up 4% (including Agroceres PIC, our JV in Brazil), 
with growth strongest in Asia. Profits were up 22% on 2015, with growth in all regions, a focus on pricing appropriately for the value of 
our genetics and strong execution of our business model.

Finance Costs
Net finance costs remained at £4.6m (2015: £4.6m) and include IAS 19 pension interest of £2.2m (2015: £2.3m). The cost of higher 
average borrowings in the year, following recent acquisitions and the investment in GSS technology, was offset by interest savings 
from the lower financing rates achieved in the new facility agreement and the maturing of fixed interest rate swaps.
Exceptional Items
There was a £36.3m net exceptional credit in 2016 (2015: £5.1m expense), including an exceptional credit of £43.9m, from changing 
the index used for pension and deferred pension increases in the Milk Pension Fund from RPI to CPI, and a £0.3m settlement gain related 
to the Milk Pension Fund. Exceptional costs were £6.9m for ongoing legal fees and damages in Genus ABS’s case against ST, £0.2m for 
acquisition and integration related expenses, primarily St Jacobs and IVB, and other items of £0.8m including restructuring costs.

Amortisation of acquired intangible assets (6.1) (6.1)
Share-based payment expense (3.8) (1.4)
Exceptional items 36.3 (5.1)
Statutory profit before tax 60.9 57.8
Our statutory profit before tax was £60.9m (2015: £57.8m). The statutory results benefited from the £36.3m net exceptional 
credit described above but were reduced by a £17.1m decline (2015: £24.9m increase) in the net IAS 41 valuation of biological assets 
(see below). These items, which tend to be volatile and mostly non-cash, are less representative of the Group’s underlying performance 
and have been excluded from adjusted results.
Taxation
The effective rate of tax for the year, based on adjusted profit before tax, was 25.8% (2015: 26.0%). The effective rate remains higher 
than the UK corporate tax rate. This is due to the mix of overseas profits, particularly the proportion of profits generated in the US and 
Latin America, where the statutory tax rates are typically between 30 and 39%, and the impact of withholding taxes on the repatriation 
of funds to the UK.
The tax rate on statutory profits was 19.7% (2015: 31.1%). In addition to the factors mentioned above, there was a favourable impact on 
the statutory tax rate in the year, due to the reversal of deferred tax at US rates on the reduction in the IAS 41 biological assets valuation, 
while the exceptional pension credit carried deferred tax at 18%. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Earnings Per Share
Adjusted basic earnings per share increased by 7% to 60.7 
pence (2015: 56.8 pence) and rose 10% in constant currency. 
Basic earnings per share on a statutory basis were 81.1 pence 
(2015: 65.7 pence), an increase of 23%, reflecting the lower 
statutory tax rate in the year.
Biological Assets 
A feature of the Group’s net assets is its substantial investment 
in biological assets, which under IAS 41 are stated at fair value. 
At 30 June 2016, the carrying value of biological assets was 
£354.4m (2015: £315.9m), as set out in the table below:
Biological assets

Represented by:
Porcine 184.7 148.1
Dairy and beef 169.7 167.8
354.4 315.9
The movement in the overall carrying value of biological assets, 
excluding the effect of exchange rate translation increases of 
£49.8m, includes:
• a £9.4m increase in the carrying value of porcine biological 
assets, due principally to an increase in the number of animals 
sold on royalty contracts; and
• a £26.5m decrease in the carrying value of dairy and beef 
biological assets, arising from the impact of lower current year 
volumes from dairy bulls and an increase in the proportion of 
future semen sales from younger genomic animals not yet 
in our asset base. 
The historical cost of these assets, less depreciation, was £42.5m 
at 30 June 2016 (2015: £34.1m), which is the basis used for the 
adjusted results.
Retirement Benefit Obligations
The Group’s retirement benefit obligations at 30 June 2016, 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, were £44.5m 
(2015: £63.1m) before tax and £34.9m (2015: £49.9m) net of 
related deferred tax. The largest element of the liability relates to 
the multi-employer Milk Pension Fund, where the deficit reduced 
due to the change in pension increases from RPI to CPI, partially 
offset by the impact of falling bond yields. We account for this 
scheme on the basis of Genus being responsible for 75% of the 
plan’s IAS 19 deficit, together with the IFRIC 14 additional liability 
for agreed deficit repair contributions in excess of this valuation. 
During the year, contributions payable in respect of the Group’s 
defined benefit schemes amounted to £6.7m (2015: £6.1m).
Cash Flow
Cash generated by operations remained solid at £43.3m  
(2015: £50.7m). Conversion of adjusted operating profit into  
cash was 88% (2015: 107%) before capital expenditure, 
investments, interest, tax and dividends, with 2015 
benefiting from the exit from the Quebec porcine nucleus.
The cash outflow from investments was £7.2m, primarily relating 
to the acquisition of St Jacobs and an investment in Caribou 
Biosciences. This compares with £9.6m, net of cash acquired, 
from the acquisition of Birchwood and IVB in 2015. The increase in 
capital expenditure of £3.8m to £18.6m (2015: £14.8m) included 
investment in a licence to Caribou Bioscience’s gene editing 
technology and in GSS capacity and technology. The total cash 
outflow for the year after these investments, interest, tax and 
dividends was £3.7m (2015: inflow £1.9m).

Net Debt
Net debt increased from £71.8m to £89.7m at 30 June 2016, 
primarily due to exchange movements increasing net debt 
by £13.6m, as most of our borrowings are in US Dollars. These 
exchange movements were particularly pronounced following 
the UK’s decision to leave the EU.
During the year, we agreed new five-year borrowing facilities on 
improved terms. At the end of June 2016 there was substantial 
headroom of £49.8m under the renewed facilities of £169.7m, 
which run to February 2021. The Group’s financial position 
remains strong.
Our borrowing ratios are strong. Interest cover was 35 times 
(2015: 32 times). The ratio of net debt to EBITDA, as calculated 
under our financing facilities, moderately increased to 1.4 times 
(2015: 1.2 times) primarily due to the impact of exchange rate 
movements on our US Dollar borrowing.
Return on Invested Capital
We measure our return on invested capital on the basis 
of adjusted operating profit including JVs after tax, divided 
by the operating net assets of the business, stated on the 
basis of historical cost, excluding net debt and pension liability. 
This removes the impact of IAS 41 fair value accounting, the 
related deferred tax and goodwill. The return on invested 
capital decreased to 19.1% after tax (2015: 21.7%). This reduction 
largely reflects the translational impact on the balance sheet 
of exchange rate movements at the end of the year.
Dividend
Reflecting the Board’s continuing confidence in the Group’s 
prospects, it is recommending to shareholders a final dividend 
of 14.7 pence per ordinary share, resulting in a total dividend for 
the year of 21.4 pence per ordinary share, an increase of 10% for 
the year. Dividend cover remains consistently strong, with the 
dividend covered 2.8 times by adjusted earnings (2015: 2.9 times).

Our People and Culture
“ We are a business rooted 
in science but built around 
our people.”
Catherine Glickman
Group HR Director 
and Chair of the CSR 
Committee
Our Approach
We are a business rooted in science but built around our people. We 
have employees in 26 countries covering a wide range of disciplines, 
from PhD qualified geneticists and veterinarians to livestock 
technicians and accountants. Over the last year, to support the 
development of an increasingly proprietary offer for customers, we 
have focused on recruiting, retaining and developing employees 
who can help us explore and harness what science makes possible.
Our global framework consists of ways to attract, engage, 
motivate and reward: it is now well embedded in every business. 
The framework is built on our values, which were developed with 
input from colleagues. The values underpin our culture of respect, 
openness and fairness, guiding how we work and behave.
Using Our Diversity
Genus takes diversity seriously. We appoint the best people to 
do the job, with a focus on talent right across the leadership 
team. The appointment of Lysanne Gray as a Non-Executive 
Director has enhanced Board diversity. Lysanne brings financial 
and operational expertise to the Board from the food sector. 
We continue to deploy our expert teams globally, particularly in 
Technical Services, Genetic Services and Animal Health, using their 
We have embraced important areas such 
as anti-bribery and corruption, training 96% 
of staff and exceeding our FY17 target, 
animal well-being, safe animal handling 
and health and safety, which has been a 
core focus for us this year. We have also 
continued to strengthen our sales 
academies for both ABS and PIC, which 
deliver training for key account managers 
around the world and help us enhance 
our relationships with current and 
potential customers.
More than three-quarters of employees responded 
and among the highlights were that:
•  89% of respondents understood the Genus vision 
and 78% felt regularly informed about business 
progress and plans (an increase of 8% on the 
previous survey).

improvement and 79% understood our 
business strategy.
•  83% said they enjoy working at Genus and the

All staff have clear performance objectives 
and two reviews per year. These assess 
progress, enable career discussions and 
inform talent management.
We aim for every employee to have a development 
plan and offer support to help them succeed, from 
formal training to coaching and mentoring. We have 
also continued to roll out bespoke development 
programmes, including our Advanced Leadership 
Programme for senior managers, for which we ran a 
very successful event in Dublin, and our programme 
for people managers, Managing High-Performing 
Teams, which we extended to our managers in Asia.
Processes have been embedded across the 
business, with robust discussions on the 
quality and depth of successors, emergency 
cover and stretching development plans.
We have maintained our systematic 
programme that shares information 
about the business and nurtures effective 
dialogue with employees. We also 
introduced innovations, such as 
broadcasting our 2015 Global Leadership 
Conference to all employees through 
a live webcast and Q&A session.

The policies and practices 
that helped our Company 
increase performance

Human Rights
We are committed to protecting the human rights of our employees 
and the people who come into contact with our business. During 
the year, we continued to comply with our human rights policy.
Looking Further Ahead
In 2017 , our focus will be on resourcing business growth and training 
staff to support the initiatives we are delivering, whilst sustaining 
performance management, development and talent management. 
We will also review our reward mechanisms, specifically our Group 
incentive plans and staff commission structures, to ensure they are 
aligned with the needs of the business. 
Case Study  
Enhancing Recruitment 
We are committed to nurturing talent to create a 
strong internal succession plan, coupled with recruiting 
new and specialist skills, as we evolve as an agricultural 
biotechnology company.
During the year, we launched a dedicated recruitment 
portal – linked to our corporate website – to showcase 
what is special about our Company and outline the 
wide range of roles we offer. The site contains short 
films of colleagues giving their views and provides links 
to our global business websites for specific vacancies.
We have also encouraged employee referrals for 
recruitment, with colleagues across the Company 
harnessing their personal networks to bring in talent.
We recruited across a range of roles, including a 
production team to deliver our new GSS products offer 
for bovine customers and personnel to help us offer IVF 
in the United States and Mexico. We invested in senior 
roles for our R&D team, including applied genomics, 
trait development and intellectual property expertise. 
We also continued to promote talent from within, with 
examples including the promotion of Dr Katie Olson 
to Global Director for Dairy Product Development 
within ABS.

We are committed to delivering results 
responsibly. ‘Responsible’ is one of our 
core values as a business and we have 
developed policies, practices and an 
organisational culture that ensures our 
Company and all the people within it act 
in an ethical, honest and trustworthy 
manner at all times. 
This year, we have developed a new online portal to 
communicate our approach, practices and impact. This can be 
found by visiting our website at www.genusplc.com. The portal 
provides more detailed and regularly updated information, 
to complement the summary we provide below. 
Our Foundation for Success 
Our commitment to operating responsibly is overseen by the 
Board. The Corporate Social Responsibility (‘CSR’) Committee 
defines our strategy, reviews our policies and practices, 
monitors external developments and advises the Genus 
Executive Leadership Team (GELT) and the Audit Committee. 
Responsible Business 
It recommends annual goals and initiatives, and identifies 
the key performance indicators for monitoring and reporting 
our performance, which are summarised opposite.
The Committee comprises senior leaders who lead different 
aspects of the programme. They meet quarterly to set objectives 
and review progress. The full list of members is provided on 
our website.
A dedicated sub-committee focuses on animal well-being. 
Among its achievements this year were an update of the 
Company’s global principles for animal well-being, including 
global standards and policies, and the introduction of new online 
training, which is mandatory for all employees, irrespective of 
their role. The membership of this sub-committee can also be 
found on our dedicated ‘Responsibility’ page on our website.
Our Framework and Performance 
We translate our commitment to responsible business into a 
framework involving five pillars, which are summarised opposite 
together with our key achievements and objectives. More detailed 
information on our performance is included on our website.
We have previously included a section on employees in this 
framework but have removed this to avoid duplication of 
material in the ‘Our People and Culture’ section of this report. 
Achievements against the targets are included on page 40.
Greenhouse Gas (‘GHG’) Reporting
Our GHG emissions are primarily methane produced by our 
animals and carbon dioxide (‘CO
2
’) from consuming fuel and 
other materials, and transport. Our primary intensity ratio 
is based on animal weight, which is a key driver of our GHG 
emissions. Our secondary intensity ratio is based on turnover.
Our primary intensity ratio includes emissions which are 
impacted mainly by the number and age of animals but also by 
emissions from our direct distribution and travel. Animal weight 
reduced by 2,500 tonnes, driven by exiting owned farms in the 
US and China, and emissions reduced as a result. However, 
emissions from other sources such as direct distribution 
remained constant and as a result the primary intensity ratio 
increased. Our secondary intensity ratio was stable year to year.
Our Reporting Approach
We use operational control as our reporting approach. We have 
determined and reported the emissions we are responsible for 
within this boundary and believe there are no material omissions. 
Emissions from
2016

Scope 3 – material usage and waste and indirect distribution and 
travel 28,433 21,160
Total emissions 109,886 112,291
Primary intensity measure – Animal weight (tonne) 10,249 12,723

Secondary intensity ratio – Scope 1, 2 & 3 (tCO

Annual emissions figures have been calculated based on actual ten-month data for July to April extrapolated to full year.
GHG data is therefore reported for assets, which are mainly 
rented or leased, that are otherwise not referred to elsewhere 
in the financial statements. We omitted JVs and some livestock 
held at third-parties due to our limited authority to introduce 
and implement operating policies.

Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
In my previous letters, I have noted that 
strong governance is a business necessity, 
with a critical influence on the Group’s 
ability to implement its strategy and 
achieve long-term success. I am pleased 
to report that the latest independent 
external evaluation of the Board shows 
that we continue to provide the strong 
and effective leadership Genus needs.
At the same time, we recognise the 
need to further develop our governance 
practices. In the year ahead, we will 
maintain our focus on strategy, including 
the competitive landscape; developing our 
risk agenda in light of our strategy; and 
succession planning, including diversity 
and the skills mix on the Board. This will 
help us to ensure Genus creates value 
for all our stakeholders, whether through 
our high-quality and differentiated 
offer for customers, rewarding work for 
our people, support for suppliers and 
communities, or through growth and 
returns to shareholders.
Set out opposite are some of the 
governance highlights of the year. 
More information on each area, and our 
governance activities more generally, can 
be found in the Corporate Governance 
Statement on pages 50 to 87.

Genus’s long-term success. It approves 
our strategy and corporate goals and 
monitors our performance against them. 
It determines that we have the necessary 
resources, systems and controls to achieve 
our objectives, and it sets the culture and 
standards of behaviour we want to see 
throughout Genus.
The Board is also responsible for other 
critical decisions, including approving the 
corporate budget and ensuring we have 
the right funding, approving material 
contracts, approving material acquisitions 
and investments, and reporting 
to shareholders.
This Corporate Governance Statement 
explains how we structure the Board and 
its Committees, how the Board oversees 
the Group and its main activities during 
the financial year.
Board Composition
The Board comprises six independent Non-
Executive Directors (‘NEDs’), including the 
Chairman, and two Executive Directors – 
the Chief Executive and the Group Finance 
Director. This gives us a large majority of 
independent Directors on the Board.

A Broad Base of Relevant Experience
Colour the individual bits on 
top of each curve
The Board has a good mix of well-
established and newer NEDs. In recent 
years, we have broadened the range of 
skills and experience on the Board through 
Non-Executive appointments, giving us 
an appropriate blend of different areas 
of expertise, long-standing knowledge 
of the Group and its markets, and fresh 
perspectives. This helps to ensure the 
Board provides even-handed oversight, 
works in a constructive and focused 
manner and has the capabilities to 
manage the challenges of a complex and 
evolving global business environment.
Almost all our Directors have held 
leadership positions in international 
companies, with several having run 
businesses overseas. Half our Directors, 
including the Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, have significant financial 
experience, while several have strong 
backgrounds in scientific research or in 
leading science-based businesses.
As Genus grows, the Board must evolve 
to keep pace. We consider diversity in its 
broadest sense when recruiting, while 
ensuring the Board has the skills it needs. 
During the year we recruited our first 
female NED, Lysanne Gray, who brings 
a wide range of relevant experience to 
the Board, including knowledge of the 
food industry. More information about 
our approach to Board composition 
and recruitment can be found in the 
Nomination Committee report on 
pages 57 to 58.
The Board believes that all of the NEDs are 
independent in character and judgement, 
and that there are no relationships or 
circumstances that are likely to affect (or 
could appear to affect) their judgement. 
Following the performance evaluation 
described on page 54, the Board also 
confirms that all the Directors continue 
to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to their roles.
As required by the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, all the Directors will 
offer themselves for election at the next 
AGM, with the exception of Mike Buzzacott 
who is retiring. Details can be found in the 
Notice of AGM at the end of this report. If 
re-elected to the Board at the AGM, Nigel 
Turner will reach the ninth anniversary 
of his original appointment as a NED in 
January 2017. Following review, the Board 
is satisfied that Nigel remains independent 
and that he has no connection with the 
Company’s operational activities.
Board Roles and Responsibilities
To ensure we have clear responsibilities at the top of the Company, the Board has set 
out well-defined roles for the Chairman and Chief Executive. These, along with the 
responsibilities of our other Directors, are summarised in the table below.
Title Individual(s) Responsibilities
Chairman Bob Lawson As Chairman, Bob’s primary responsibility is to lead 
the Board and ensure it operates effectively. He 
achieves this in part through promoting an open 
culture, which gives people the courage to challenge 
the status quo, and holding meetings with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executives 
present. Bob is also responsible for the Board’s 
communications with shareholders. 
Chief  
Executive
Karim Bitar Karim is responsible for devising and implementing the 
Company’s strategy and managing the Company’s 
day-to-day operations. He is accountable to the 
Board for the Company’s development, in line with its 
strategy, and taking into account the risks, objectives 
and policies set out by the Board and its Committees.
Group  
Finance 
Director
Stephen Wilson Stephen is responsible for supporting the Chief 
Executive in devising and implementing the strategy, 
and managing the Group’s financial and operational 
performance.
Senior 
Independent 
Non-Executive 
Director
Nigel Turner Nigel provides a sounding board for the Chairman 
and is an alternative line of communication 
between the Chairman and other Directors. He leads 
meetings of the Non-Executive Directors, without 
the Chairman present, to appraise the Chairman’s 
performance and consults with shareholders in the 
absence of the Chairman and Chief Executive. 
Non-Executive 
Directors

to 43, and at www.genusplc.com.
The R&D Portfolio Management Team 
(‘R&D PMT’) meets twice a year. It 
provides a forum for prioritising our R&D 
programmes, monitoring their progress 
and assessing the quality of our R&D 
infrastructure, personnel and pipeline. 
The R&D PMT’s meetings during the year 
were held in Chicago and Basingstoke.
The R&D PMT’s principal responsibilities are 
to periodically:
• review and prioritise the Company’s 
investment in research, development 
and technology;
• assess the quality and competitiveness 
of the Company’s R&D pipeline, 
including considering its risk profile;
• oversee and encourage the ideation 
management process; and
• approve patent and other IP strategies 
for new technologies, based on 
business and technical opportunities.
R&D PMT Special Focus Areas in 2016
In addition to the standing agenda 
items, in 2016 the R&D PMT reviewed two 
strategic proposals. These were:
• a comprehensive review of gene 
editing technology and IP, resulting 
in our collaboration with Caribou 
Biosciences; and
• an organisational capability building 
plan, to support Genus’s advancing 
pipeline of gene editing traits, 
which was used when forming the 
FY17 budget. Genus plc

Board Strategy Review
One of the Board’s key responsibilities is 
to approve the Company’s strategy and 
monitor its performance against strategy. 
To understand how well our strategy 
is working and to ensure it remains 
appropriate, the Board holds an annual 
strategy review each January. Relevant

the ground, the markets and the needs 
of our key customers. The Board met 
with some of the largest customers in 
the US, providing insight into customer 
perspectives of Genus and the drivers 
of their purchasing decisions. The 
visit was also motivating for our local 
management teams, enabling them to 
engage with the Board at a local level.
At this year’s review, the Board was 
taken through:
• A review of global industry trends 
and challenges.
• An update on each business unit’s 
and R&D’s strategic goals and ways to 
accelerate the time required to reach 
such goals. 
• An update on strategic initiatives and 
their anticipated financial impact over 
the next five years.
• An overview of the likely transformation 
steps for the business in line with the 
strategic goals.
• A review of projects designed to share 
the value of our differentiated products 
with our customers.
Board Visit to the US
We want to ensure that the Board has 
first-hand experience of key areas of our 
business and markets, so we include an 
annual site visit in the Board calendar.
In May 2016, the Board spent a week 
visiting our operations and facilities in 
the US. This included meeting the senior 
management of ABS, PIC and R&D 
business units and key members of their 
North American teams, and receiving 
business update presentations. The Board 
also received presentations from leading 
industry experts and key customers. Genus plc

Board Induction and Training
A good induction is a key part of ensuring 
new Board members can fully contribute, 
so we get the most benefit from their 
experience. Our induction programme has 
three main elements:
• helping our Board members to conduct 
themselves effectively, through a 
course run by Spencer Stuart, one of 
the world’s leading global executive 
search and leadership consulting firms;
• ensuring our Directors understand the 
legal and regulatory aspects of being 
a Board member; and
• an introduction to our business, 
through site visits and meetings with 
our management teams.
Induction for Lysanne Gray
Following Lysanne Gray’s appointment 
on 1 April 2016, she underwent a 
comprehensive induction. This included:
• A visit to our US businesses in May 2016, 
as part of the May Board meeting. 
This covered a tour of our facilities 
in DeForest and Dekorra; a series of 
presentations from our ABS and PIC 
business teams, led by their Chief 
Operating Officers; presentations on 
our approach to R&D and a tour of our 
facilities; and visits to a number of PIC 
and ABS customers.
• Ad hoc updates on the latest 
developments in corporate governance, 
provided by internal and external 
presenters.
• Meetings with Executive Directors 
and the Company Secretary and 
senior managers.
• A meeting with the auditor Deloitte LLP.
Board Evaluation
We assess the Board’s effectiveness over 
a three-year cycle, using a mixture of 
internal and external evaluations.
Year 1
External Board effectiveness review 
produces an action plan for areas 
of focus
Year 2
Follow-up questionnaire by same 
external evaluation consultant, to 
monitor progress with the focus areas
Year 3
Internal questionnaires and interviews 
with the Chairman
This was the first year in our three-year cycle and we therefore had a formal, rigorous 
and independent external review. This evaluation was facilitated by Dr Tracy Long of 
Boardroom Review, who has no other connection with the Group.
The Chairman agreed the scope of the review, which included individual interviews with 
each of the Board members and observation at the February 2016 Board and Committee 
meetings. Boardroom Review generated a written report on areas for improvement for 
the Board which was followed up with a presentation to the Board at the May Board 
meeting and then separate discussion of the principal outcomes of the Board review.
The Evaluation’s Conclusions
During the review, the Board demonstrated particular strengths in the following areas:
• Board culture, with an appropriate balance of challenge and support, and style 
of chairmanship;
• strategic alignment and knowledge of the competitive landscape;
• financial reporting and the oversight of risk management from the Audit Committee;
• approach to remuneration and alignment with shareholders’ interests; and
• effective forward agenda planning, prioritisation of issues and quality of information.
In addition, it was noted that the skills and composition of the Board was adding value 
to the business and that it has a healthy blend of NED perspectives and experience, 
drawn from relevant executive and portfolio careers, a mix of longer serving and newer 
Directors, and a size which enables all the NEDs to contribute.
Areas of Focus for 2017
The evaluation identified areas for the Board to consider during the next year, including 
continuing focus on:
• strategy, including competitor landscape and shareholder expectations;
• development of the risk agenda, in line with the Company’s strategic objectives; and
• succession planning, including diversity and the mix of skills on the Board, to identify 
any current and future skills gaps.
Progress Against 2016 Areas of Focus
Last year’s internal Board effectiveness review identified a number of areas for the Board 
to focus on during 2016. The table below shows our progress against these objectives.
Focus area Progress
Continued oversight of competitor activity. Competitors’ ongoing activities are 
monitored through our business 
development team and the Board is updated 
at each Board meeting of material activities 
in the sector. Deep dives in the competitor 
activities are scheduled bi-annually.
Further training in corporate governance. In addition to corporate governance 
updates provided by our auditor and 
Company Secretary, new corporate counsel 
was invited to brief the Board on recent 
legislation changes during the year.
Further exposure to the science that 
underpins our R&D programmes.
A dedicated Board science education 
session, presented by the Chief Scientific 
Officer, was held in December 2015, along 
with the periodic R&D updates provided to 
the Board.
Further focus on succession planning and 
gender diversity.
A formalised succession planning process, 
as part of Nomination Committee 
meetings, has been introduced to ensure 
that the Company is better prepared for 
Board succession.

Risk Management and Internal Control
The Board is responsible for our risk 
management system and for reviewing 
our controls and risk mitigations.
The risk management system is designed 
to identify, evaluate and prioritise the risks 
and uncertainties we face, and applies 
to the Board, the Audit Committee, GEL T, 
our businesses and our divisional business 
reviews. The Board sets the Group’s risk 
appetite, which defines the types and levels 
of risks that the Board is prepared to seek and 
accept as the Company executes its strategy. 
The Board then monitors our risk exposure 
against the risk appetite for our principal 
risks and ensures appropriate executive 
ownership for all risks. This ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group has been 
in place for the year under review and up to 
the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. Our principal risks and our 
mitigations for them are summarised on 
pages 18 and 19.
The Board performed its annual risk review 
in May 2016. This review involved a review 
of its risk appetite and a fresh assessment 
of the types and levels of risk facing Genus 
as it executes its strategy. This top-down 
assessment was designed to identify and 
evaluate any new or emerging risks and 
identify whether the risk register covered 
all relevant risks. To further assist its 
understanding of risk, the Board continued its 
programme of visits to our local operations 
and received regular political, economic 
and industry risk updates from the relevant 
business groups. The Board also sought regular 
updates on a number of specific risks during 
the year, including the Group’s work on its:
• emerging market strategy, in particular, 
progress in China; 
• the GSS project, particularly in light of 
the litigation the Group initiated, as 
detailed in note 7;
• the in-licensing of IP rights, particularly 
those relating to gene editing assets; and
• acquisition and integration of companies.
Internal Control
The Board, with the help of the Audit 
Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness 
of our internal control system, as well as 
our financial, operational and compliance 
controls and our risk management.
The review considered our internal control 
self-assessment process, designed to 
assess compliance with our minimum 
control standards, the independent 
internal audit programme and the reports 
management prepared when the Board 
approved the interim and final results and 
financial statements. It also assessed:
• whether we had identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled significant 
risks; and
• whether any significant weaknesses 
had arisen, and if so, whether we had 
addressed them.
The assessment also took into account any 
risk or control issues we identified through 
our divisional business reviews, Board and 
GELT meetings, and insurers’ reviews.
We have an internal control continuous 
improvement work programme and routinely 
identify opportunities to strengthen our 
control environment and improve our risk 
management capabilities. However, the 
Board has not identified or been told of any 
material weaknesses in our internal controls.
Risk Management Framework
The roles and responsibilities within our risk 
management framework are set out below:
The Board
• Has overall responsibility for the 
Group’s risk management and internal 
control systems.
• Approves our strategic objectives.
• Monitors the nature and extent of risk 
exposure against risk appetite, for our 
principal risks.
• Provides direction on the importance 
of risk management and risk 
management culture.
GELT
• Identifies, addresses and mitigates risks 
Group-wide.
• Monitors our risk management process 
and internal controls.
Audit Committee
• Supports the Board in monitoring risk 
exposure against risk appetite.
• Reviews the effectiveness of our risk 
management and internal control system.
Risk Management and Internal 
Audit Function
• Oversees the risk management 
process and provides guidance on risk 
management.
• Maintains the risk schedule created in 
consultation with senior management.
• Engages with senior management, to 
review risks and their mitigation.
Our Internal Control System
The key elements of our internal control 
systems are set out below. An internal 
control system cannot completely eliminate 
the risks we face or ensure we do not have a 
material misstatement or loss.
Management Structure
The Board sets formal authorisation levels 
and other controls that allow it to delegate 
authority to run our businesses to the Chief 
Executive, GEL T and their management 
teams. Our management supplements these 
controls by setting the operating standards 
that each subsidiary needs for its business 
and location.
GELT regularly reviews our performance 
against strategy, budget and a defined set 
of operational key performance indicators. 
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, 
Group General Counsel and Company 
Secretary and the Group Financial 
Controller also hold monthly reviews 
with each business unit.
Quality and Integrity of Our People
We strive to operate with high integrity in 
everything we do. Our control environment 
depends on high-quality people who 
maintain our ethical standards. We ensure 
our people’s ability and integrity through 
our recruitment standards, training and 
consistent performance management. 
The Board approves appointments to our 
most senior management positions.
Information and Financial 
Reporting Systems
We create detailed operational budgets 
for the year ahead, along with five-year 
strategic plans, which the Board reviews 
and approves. We then monitor our 
performance throughout the year, so we 
can address any issues. The information 
we consider includes our monthly financial 
results, key performance indicators and 
variances, updated full-year forecasts 
and key business risks.
The main internal control and risk 
management processes relating to our 
preparation of consolidated accounts are 
our Group-wide accounting policies and 
procedures, segregation of duties, system 
access controls, a robust consolidation 
and reporting system, various levels 
of management review and centrally 
defined process control points and 
reconciliation processes.
Investment Appraisal
We control our capital expenditure through 
our budget process and by having clear 
authorisation levels, above which our 
businesses must submit detailed written 
proposals to the Board for approval.
We carry out due diligence for business 
acquisitions and material licences, and 
conduct post-completion reviews of major 
projects, to ensure we identify areas for 
improvement and correct any areas of 
underperformance or overspend.
Internal Audit
Our internal audit activities are provided by 
in-house and external resources, under the 
leadership of our Head of Risk Management 
and Internal Audit. During the year, 
Internal Audit completed a risk-based audit 
programme agreed by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee reviews the results of 
these audits and the subsequent actions 
we take, which we also communicate to 
the external auditor.
All business units complete risk and control 
self-assessments twice a year. Internal Audit, 
as part of their work programme, perform 
independent reviews of these assessments 
to identify any deficiencies in our controls 
and how we should address them. External 
audit also provides observation on the control 
environment as part of their audit work. 
The results are communicated to senior 
management and the Audit Committee.
Accountability Genus plc
Annual Report 2016

Our Chief Executive and Group Finance Director regularly meet 
institutional investors, to discuss our strategy and progress, and to 
understand how investors view our business. The Chairman also 
attends certain meetings. The majority of these meetings take 
place after we release our interim and preliminary results.
During the year, our investor relations programme included 
meetings in several global locations as set out in our Investor 
Relations Calendar. The Board sets time aside during its meetings 
to discuss feedback from shareholder meetings, including relevant 
feedback obtained by independent brokers and our advisers. 
This allows all Directors to understand major shareholders’ views.
The AGM also gives the Board an opportunity to communicate 
with both private and institutional investors, and we welcome 
their involvement. All our Board members will be available to 
answer questions at the AGM on 17 November 2016.
Key Themes Discussed in Shareholder Meetings
Our meetings with shareholders during the year covered a wide 
range of topics. The common themes included:
• Genus’s operational and financial performance.
• Market conditions, particularly in dairy, and our initiatives to 
address them.
• Strategic progress across the Group.
• Progress with R&D and our increased spending to accelerate 
the programme.
• Progress with integrating and building on the IVB acquisition.
• Capturing a share of the value we deliver to customers.
• The opportunity for PRRSv resistant pigs.

Introduction
The Nomination Committee’s primary role is to keep the Board’s 
structure, size and composition under review and to manage 
appointments to the Board. This year, the Committee increased 
its focus on formalising this review process and succession 
planning for the Board. This approach is in line with the 
increased importance being attached to the work of nomination 
committees more generally, recognising their critical role in 
ensuring companies have an effective and well-balanced Board. 
The Committee also spent considerable time overseeing 
the search for an additional NED, which culminated in the 
appointment of Lysanne Gray. Lysanne brings considerable 
experience of risk management, audit, business operations and 
the food sector.
In addition, the Committee has progressed its review and 
analysis of each Board member’s skills and experience, to identify 
any current or future skills gaps that will need to be filled to 
successfully implement the Group’s strategy.

The Committee has written terms of reference, which set out 
the authority delegated to it by the Board. These are available 
from our website: www.genusplc.com. Copies of contracts of 
service and letters of appointment between the Directors and the 
Company will be available for inspection at the Registered Office 
of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting on 17 November 2016, and at the 
place of the Annual General Meeting from at least 15 minutes 
prior to the Annual General Meeting until its conclusion.
The Committee’s biographies, along with information on Genus’s 
other Board members, can be found on pages 46 to 47.
Committee Roles and Responsibilities
The Committee is responsible for:
• making recommendations to the Board on the structure, 
size and composition of the Board and its Committees;
• evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence, 
knowledge and diversity on the Board;
• succession planning for the Directors and other senior 
executives;
• identifying suitable candidates to become Directors, 
based on merit; and
• recommending a candidate for Board approval.
The Committee met three times in the year primarily to discuss 
the new NED appointment and succession planning.
The Committee’s Main Activities During the Year
Appointment of Lysanne Gray
The Chairman leads the process for making appointments to 
the Board. In appointing a new NED, the Committee sought 
a candidate who could chair the Audit Committee, following 
Mike Buzzacott’s retirement at the 2016 AGM. The Committee 
also had a strong desire to increase the Board’s diversity. With 
this in mind, the Committee looked for candidates with the 
following attributes:
• Functional experience
 – a serving or recently retired chief financial officer or senior 
divisional finance executive; and
 – experience of UK plc accounting.
• Career experience
 – global experience, preferably in an adjacent sector; and
 – literate in IT systems for an expanding global business.
• Personal characteristics
 – high integrity and honesty;
 – able to add value on ethics, stakeholder management  
and/or regulatory issues;
 – collegiate in style; and
 – willing to constructively challenge and support.
To reach the widest possible candidate pool, we engaged Egon 
Zender, an executive search firm, which has also provided the 
business with occasional executive coaching services, and 
provided a clear recruitment brief, as well as seeking referrals 
from the Board. The Chairman identified candidates for interview, 
who were presented to the Committee and Executive Directors. 
Following a one-to-one interview process, the Committee 
received feedback on each candidate. Candidates were assessed 
consistently throughout the process, against the role specification.
Lysanne Gray was the outstanding candidate and the Committee 
was pleased to appoint her. The Board considered that Lysanne’s 
great depth of experience in risk management, audit and 
business operations, together with her exposure to UK corporate 
governance and experience in the food sector, will bring additional 
value to the Board as Genus continues to deliver its strategy.
Succession Planning Process
During the year, the Committee formalised and committed to 
the following succession planning process. It has three phases:
• Assessment. The Committee reviews the likely tenure of the 
NEDs, their independence and their skill sets and, in light of the 
Group’s direction, identifies possible skills gaps for future years.
• Approach. The Committee encourages the development 
of high-calibre internal candidates, to create a pipeline of 
potential Executive Directors, and identifies potential new 
NEDs who could fill key positions (such as Committee chairs) 
or positions generated by the Group’s strategic direction.
• Execution. The Committee holds at least two meetings each 
year, including one to discuss succession planning, and other 
meetings as required to discuss appointments or retirements.
Diversity Policy
Genus recognises and embraces the benefits of Board diversity. 
A diverse Board has members with different skills, backgrounds, 
regional and industry experiences, race, gender and other 
qualities. By bringing these differences to bear in its discussions 
and decision-making, a diverse Board can help Genus to maintain 
its competitive advantage. Diversity also links directly to our 
values, not only by being people focused and responsible, but 
by encouraging new ideas which deliver for our customers and 
ultimately drive our results. Our Board diversity policy therefore 
aims to ensure that we consider diversity in its broadest sense.
Women make up 25% of our senior management and Genus 
will continue to make all Board appointments based on 
individual merit.

Dear Shareholder
The Audit Committee acts on behalf of the Board and shareholders, 
to ensure the integrity of the Company’s financial reporting, 
evaluate its system of risk management and internal control, and 
oversee the performance of the internal and external auditors. We 
design our annual work programme to deliver these commitments.
During the financial year, we focused on risk management, 
internal control and the Group’s financial reporting processes. 
We have supported the Board in considering its risk appetite and 
in reviewing the long-term viability statement and supporting 
analysis. We have carefully considered the critical accounting 
policies and judgements, the quality of disclosures, compliance 
with financial reporting standards and reviewed the half-year and 
Annual Report and Accounts, together with the related external 
audit reports. We have also reviewed the effectiveness of internal 
and external audit, discussed the outcomes of these assessments 
and agreed any actions that were needed. The Committee was 
satisfied with the performance of the internal audit function and 
the external auditor during the year.
In April 2016, we welcomed a new member to the Committee with 
the appointment of Lysanne Gray. When I step down from the Board 
in November 2016, Lysanne will be appointed Chair of the Audit 
Committee. I am happy to report that the Committee membership 
continues to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
related guidance, with all members being NEDs, and maintains 
a sound range of financial, commercial and scientific expertise 
required to fulfil its role effectively. More details on this, and the 
appointment and induction process for new members, are in the 
Corporate Governance Statement of this Annual Report.

Ensuring the Company’s Financial 
Reporting Integrity
“ The Committee continued 
to focus its efforts on risk 
management, internal control 
and the Group’s financial 
reporting processes.”
Chairman of the Audit Committee Genus plc
Annual Report 2016
60
The Committee’s members are Non-Executive Directors with 
a wide range of financial, commercial and scientific research 
expertise, appropriate for fulfilling the Committee’s duties. In 
FY16, the Committee met the UK Corporate Governance Code’s 
requirement that at least one Committee member should have 
recent and relevant financial experience, with Mike Buzzacott 
and Lysanne Gray both having this experience.
The Committee has formal terms of reference, approved by the 
Board, that comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
These are available from our website: www.genusplc.com.
Our annual review of these terms took place during the year. 
The Committee also assessed its own effectiveness, through 
a structured questionnaire, and concluded that it was effective.
Committee Role and Responsibilities
The Committee’s role and responsibilities include reviewing 
and monitoring:
• the financial reporting process and any significant financial 
reporting judgements;
• the integrity of the Group’s financial statements and any 
formal announcements relating to financial performance; 
• the Company’s reporting to shareholders; 
• the effectiveness of the Group’s accounting systems and 
control environment, including risk management and the 
internal audit function; and 
• the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the Group’s 
external auditor, including any non-audit services it provides to 
the Group. 
The Committee also:
• ensures that the Company maintains suitable confidential 
arrangements for employees to raise concerns; and
• reviews the Company’s systems and controls for 
preventing bribery.
The Committee reports its findings to the Board, identifying 
any matters that require action or improvement, and making 
recommendations about the steps to be taken.
The Committee’s Main Activities During the Year
During the year, the Committee held five meetings and invited the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, 
the Group Financial Controller, the Head of Risk Management and 
Internal Audit, and senior representatives of the external auditor 
to attend these meetings. The Committee members and I also 
held separate private sessions during the year with the Head 
of Risk Management and Internal Audit and the external audit 
partner. At its five meetings, the Committee focused on:
Financial Reporting
The main areas of focus and matters where the Committee specifically considered management’s judgements are set out below:
Financial reporting area Judgement and assumptions considered
Biological assets valuation In compliance with IAS 41, Genus records its biological assets at fair value in the Group 
balance sheet (£354.4m), with the net valuation movement excluding foreign exchange 
translation shown in the income statement. At each reporting period, the Committee 
was updated on the methodology and outcomes of the biological assets valuation. 
Having noted that the methodology was unchanged during the year, the Committee 
debated and considered management’s assumptions and estimates, and discussed 
and reviewed the external auditor’s report on this area. The Committee was satisfied 
with management’s accounting treatment including the income statement increase 
of £9.4m in the value of porcine and the reduction of £26.5m in the value of bovine 
biological assets. 
Goodwill and intangible assets Genus has £86.0m of goodwill and £78.0m of intangible assets on the Group balance 
sheet. These balances are tested for any indications of impairment by reference to 
the forecasts for the relevant cash generating units. Within intangible assets, Genus’s 
policy is to capitalise certain development costs and to perform periodic impairment 
reviews of the carrying amounts. At the balance sheet date, the Group had £17.8m of 
capitalised development expenses in respect of GSS, as well as £7.7m in associated 
fixed assets. During the year, the Committee reviewed progress against plans, the costs 
incurred and the project’s timelines to full operation and the outcome of the litigation 
with ST. The Committee discussed management’s reports in detail, including whether 
any known issues might block the project’s completion. The Committee also discussed 
management’s goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews, the external auditor’s 
work, including its assessment of management’s models supporting the estimates 
and judgements. After due challenge and debate, the Committee was satisfied with 
management’s assumptions and judgements.
Pensions The Committee received and reviewed management reports on the treatment of pension 
costs and also received and considered the external auditor’s pensions accounting input. 
The Committee considered management’s recommendations were appropriate, including 
the treatment of the gain of £43.9m due to the change in pension increases from RPI to 
CPI and the use of the 2015 valuation schedule of contributions giving rise to the IFRIC 14 
additional liability of £14.9m. The Committee continued to review the status of the other 
parties who are jointly and severally liable for the Milk Pension Fund deficit and concurred 
with management’s assumptions for reporting Genus’s share of the fund.

Monitoring Business Risks
The Committee reviewed the Group-wide 
risk management process designed to 
identify, evaluate and mitigate risks. 
In the external auditor’s presence, 
the Committee discussed the risks 
identified with the Chief Executive and 
Group Finance Director, along with 
management’s plans to mitigate them. In 
view of their importance during the year, 
the Committee ensured that the Board 
received and discussed detailed input from 
management on the following key risks 
and mitigations:
• GSS: this is the risk that we are unable 
to commercialise our GSS technology. 
The Board continued to receive regular 
updates throughout the year on go-to-
market readiness, as well as the legal 
proceedings relating to the anti-trust 
and patent issues connected with this 
key initiative.
• Pensions: the Board was updated on 
the status of discussions with the Milk 
Pension Fund in relation to the decision 
to move benefit indexation to CPI and 
the progress of the triennial valuation.
• Health and Safety: the Board received 
updates on the controls and mitigation 
activities in place and/or being 
implemented to manage this risk, both 
on Company and third-party premises.
The Committee also commissioned work 
on IT security and data protection from 
a new Group CIO and on biosecurity and 
continuity of supply, both of which will 
report back in FY17.
Internal Control System
Our risk management process and system 
of internal controls are described in detail 
on pages 18 and 19. The Committee 
reviewed a refreshed approach to 
monitoring the Group’s implementation 
of controls and the results of the key 
financial controls self-assessment process, 
which is performed on a six-monthly 
basis. The Committee further reviewed 
Internal Audit’s findings at each scheduled 
meeting, and the Group’s whistle blowing 
policy and bribery prevention procedures 
and conducted its annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
controls and disclosures. 
The Committee’s review of the Group’s 
system of internal control did not identify 
any material deficiencies. However, Genus 
routinely identifies and actions control 
improvement opportunities and the 
Committee discussed with management 
various opportunities to further strengthen 
the Company’s system of internal control.
Oversight of External Audit and 
Internal Audit
Internal Audit
The Committee reviewed and agreed the 
internal audit function’s scope, terms of 
reference, resources and activities. The Head 
of Risk Management and Internal Audit 
provided regular reports to the Committee 
on the work undertaken and management’s 
responses to proposals made in the internal 
audit reports issued during the year. The 
Committee continued to meet the Head 
of Risk Management and Internal Audit 
without management being present. The 
Committee reviewed and was satisfied with 
the internal audit function’s performance.
External Audit
The external auditor, Deloitte LLP, was 
first appointed as the Company’s external 
auditor for the period ended 30 June 2006. 
In 2015, the Committee oversaw a formal 
audit retender process for the audit of the 
financial year ending 30 June 2016. The 
process concluded with the selection and 
subsequent reappointment of Deloitte LLP. 
The new audit partner’s first audit period is 
the financial year ended 30 June 2016.
The Committee reviewed and agreed the 
external auditor’s scope of work and fees, 
held detailed discussions of the results 
of its audits and continued to meet the 
external auditor without management 
being present. The Committee reviewed 
the external auditor’s objectivity and 
independence and the Company’s policy 
on engaging the external auditor to 
supply non-audit services. The Committee 
received details of the external auditor’s 
non-audit services to the Group, reviewed 
the nature and monetary levels of these 
services, which stood at 33% of audit 
fees, and reviewed compliance with 
the Company’s Non-Audit Services by 
Auditor Policy. See note 8 for further 
details. The Committee was satisfied that 
using Deloitte for such services did not 
impair its independence as the Group’s 
external auditor.
The Committee assessed the external 
auditor’s performance in conducting the 
audit for the June 2015 year end, based 
on questionnaires completed by key 
finance staff and Committee members. 
The questionnaires covered the external 
auditor’s fulfilment of the audit plan, the 
auditor’s robustness and perceptiveness 
in its handling of key accounting and audit 
judgements, the content of the external 
auditor’s reports, and cost effectiveness. 
The Committee also considered any 
regulatory reviews performed on the 
external auditor. While noting some 
opportunities for further improvement, the 
Committee concluded that the external 
auditor was effective and was satisfied 
with the plan put forward by the external 
auditor to respond to the opportunities for 
improvement identified.

Letter from the Chairman
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2016.
Accelerating Strategic Progress
We have seen a year of significant progress for Genus. We have 
reported a second year of double-digit adjusted profit before tax 
growth in constant currency coupled with significant advances 
in delivery of our strategy. You will see examples of this progress 
throughout the Annual Report, but particular highlights include 
the successful integration and growth of our IVB business, 
preparations for the commercial launch of our proprietary 
sexed semen technology and an industry breakthrough with 
the generation of the first PRRSv resistant pigs. Our strategy is 
transforming the business into an agricultural biotechnology 
pioneer, with a strong pipeline of innovation. Gene editing, 
in particular, has the potential to be transformative for our 
business, although the time frame to develop and realise 
these opportunities is long term.
In light of this strategic progress, during the year the 
Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) reviewed the 
Company’s Remuneration Policy to assess whether it supports 
delivery of the Group’s strategy. Maintaining this momentum 
requires stable leadership and aligning reward to reflect the 
progress made. We identified specific goals that we wanted 
to achieve through our approach to remuneration as follows:
• flexibility to recognise very significant biotechnology and 
strategic Company milestones;
• ability to retain and attract top talent from a global talent pool;
• alignment of the interests of the executive and shareholders.
Having considered the progress made and the strategic direction 
of Genus together with these goals, our conclusion is that changes 
to the executive reward structure are required. We believe that 
these are important and necessary changes at a pivotal time for 
the business. Having discussed this as a Committee and with a 
number of our key shareholders, we believe these are important 
changes for our Remuneration Policy for 2017 and beyond, and 
will be seeking approval for this at the AGM, one year ahead of 
the normal cycle.
This remuneration report is therefore split into two sections:
• the proposed new Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(‘Remuneration Policy’); and
• the Annual Report on Remuneration (‘Remuneration Report’).
Our Revised Remuneration Policy from 2017
As we transform Genus, we need the ability to recognise better 
the key strategic milestones for the Company (‘Company 
Directors’ Remuneration Report
Section A: Annual Statement
A Pivotal Y ear for Genus in Advancing 
and Delivering Our Strategy
“ Our strategy of transforming 
the business into an agricultural 
biotechnology pioneer requires 
important and necessary 
changes to the structure of 
reward at a pivotal time for

Milestones’), particularly as their benefit may only be reflected 
some years later in traditional incentive plan measurements. 
We also need the flexibility to recognise and retain key individuals 
who exist as part of a global talent pool, now and in the future, 
so that we optimise the execution of these initiatives to maximise 
the Company’s long-term performance and shareholder value.
Our core bonus opportunity for each Executive Director will 
remain at 125% of salary. This will continue to be measured using 
a combination of financial and non-financial metrics, and 25% of 
the award made under the core bonus element will continue to 
be made in shares and deferred for three years.
We will introduce a new element to the annual bonus to recognise 
progress towards and achievement of Company Milestones. Such 
milestones are significant events in the Company’s development. 
At the start of the year the Committee will determine what needs 
to be achieved during the year to ultimately achieve the Company 
Milestone(s). Any awards under this element (up to 75% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Group Finance 
Director) will be made fully in shares and deferred for three years. 
This allows us to recognise industry-changing events for Genus 
that build future long-term value for shareholders and retain 
individuals who will continue to make such events happen. We 
will retrospectively disclose the Company Milestones within our 
Remuneration Report so shareholders have full visibility of the 
significance we have placed on particular strategic events.
As a result the total possible opportunity under the annual bonus 
will increase from 125% of salary to 200% for the Chief Executive 
and to 175% for the Group Finance Director.
Financial targets will continue to govern at least half of any 
award under the annual bonus. If awards were made under all 
elements of the bonus, the total award in shares deferred for 
three years would increase from 25% of any award to over 50% of 
the annual award for the Chief Executive. This change is designed 
to recognise progress, drive alignment with the business and aid 
retention of executives through increased shareholding.
We believe it is important for our Executive Directors to be fully 
aligned to Company performance through significant shareholding 
levels in the business. Alongside the change to annual bonus, 
we are doubling the Executive Directors’ minimum shareholding 
requirement to 200% of salary (currently 100%).
In order to complement the above policy changes, you will see 
some amendments to the way we propose to implement the 
Remuneration Policy for 2017 in relation to the Genus plc 2014 
Performance Share Plan (‘2014 PSP’). Having reviewed market 
conditions, changes to our business strategy and the level of 
awards coming through our existing plans, we will adjust the EPS 
range for performance such that the annual EPS growth range will 
be set at a threshold level of 5% for 20% vesting (currently 6%) 
through to 15% for full vesting (currently 20%). The previous range 
was set ahead of the decision to accelerate further investment 
in research and development as part of our strategy, which 
has potential to create significant value for shareholders. We 
believe that this amended range continues to reflect stretching 
performance against our agreed strategy, and that annual 15% 
EPS growth should warrant full awards under the 2014 PSP. 
This change will be made for awards granted from 2016.
To support our transformation towards becoming an animal 
biotechnology business, we also propose that certain costs in 
connection with the development of gene editing are excluded 
from the calculation of awards. We want to encourage vigorous 
pursuit of the opportunities: because expenditure year on year 
will be variable, we want to ensure that considerations of the 
remuneration impact do not influence executive decision-making. 
By excluding gene editing, we drive the behaviours we seek from 
the executives and encourage management to invest for the 
long-term interests of shareholders. We will follow this approach 
in determining the vesting of long-term awards in 2017 and 2018.
Shareholder Engagement
The Committee consulted major shareholders in July and August 
2016 on the proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy. We are 
grateful to our shareholders for their time and feedback, which 
was challenging but supportive: they were very understanding of 
the direction the business is taking and wish to retain, as we do, 
the current management team to deliver on the potential.
Outcomes for 2016 Remuneration
In reaching the 2016 outcomes, the Committee has excluded 
amounts charged to the Profit and Loss account and cash flows 
which were incurred in relation to our investment in gene editing. 
This investment opportunity was not foreseen when targets 
were set. Management reacted quickly to secure this value for 
shareholders and to build our IP position following the PRRSv 
resistant pig discovery. We have therefore excluded these costs 
from the calculation of awards under the annual bonus and 
performance share plan. The Committee is firmly of the view that 
this is the right approach and creates an appropriate alignment 
between underlying performance and reward.
Adjusted profit before tax, after an adjustment of £0.9m 
of gene editing investment, grew 12% in constant currency. 
The performance of PIC, and specifically the business in China, 
resulted in good Group performance overall. The Committee 
therefore determined that 78.2% of maximum annual bonus 
should be awarded to the Chief Executive and 78.2% to the 
Group Finance Director.
Under the long-term incentive, following adjustment for gene 
editing costs and share-based payments as explained further 
within this report, the 2013 award partially vested. The three-
year EPS growth rate was 25.4% and RPI was 5.7%, resulting in an 
average annual EPS growth over the period of RPI+6.6%. 34.4% 
of the award will vest for Chief Executive and 31.4% for Group 
Finance Director.
Shareholders’ Views
The Committee was delighted that it received 99.55% approval 
of the Remuneration Report in 2015. We will continue to engage 
with shareholders, taking into account shareholder views and 
best practice.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders 
for their continued support. The Committee hopes that the 
report is clear and succinct and, as always, would welcome 
feedback. If you wish to contact me, please email me at 
remunerationchair@genusplc.com. The Committee looks 
forward to your support for our Remuneration Report at

Section A: Annual Statement continued
This Remuneration Report has been prepared so it complies with the provisions of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts & Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which set out the disclosures required for Directors’ remuneration as at the 
reporting date. The report is also in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Conduct Authority’s Listing Rules.
The legislation requires the auditor to report to the Company’s members on the ‘auditable parts’ of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and to state whether, in its opinion, the parts of the report that have been subject to audit have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the legislation. We have highlighted the parts of this report which have been audited. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Section B: Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
The revised Remuneration Policy is set out in this section. It is being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM to be held on 
17 November 2016. This is one year earlier than originally intended, as a result of the changes the Committee is proposing. The 
Remuneration Policy is intended to apply, subject to shareholder approval, for three years from the 2016 AGM. Where a material change 
to this policy is considered, the Company will consult with major shareholders prior to submitting the revised policy to all shareholders 
for approval.
Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report
The key objectives of the Remuneration Policy are that:
• pay should be competitive, so we can attract and retain 
the best people;
• fixed pay (base salary, pension and benefits) should take 
account of appropriate external benchmarks (both in 
the UK where we are listed and globally) and pay for our 
other employees;
• short and long-term incentive pay should provide the 
opportunity to earn upper quartile total remuneration, 
subject to delivering our above-market long-term 
growth aspirations;
• we can recognise significant biotechnology and strategic 
Company Milestones;
• incentive pay should be directly linked to the Group’s 
strategy, with targets relating to our key performance 
indicators (using non-financial ‘input’ measures and/or 
‘output’ measures such as earnings per share) and should 
be stretching, in light of our strategic plan;
• incentive structures should be simple, reward long-term 
sustained growth and key strategic milestones, rather 
than volatile performance;
• the policy should be clearly aligned with shareholders’ 
interests, take due account of current best practice and 
not encourage undue risk taking; and
• policy principles for Executive Directors should apply 
to the members of the Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’), with appropriate tiering through the 
wider workforce.
How we are Evolving Reward to Meet Identified Goals

Benefits generally include a car allowance 
and insured benefits (e.g. life assurance 
and private medical insurance).
Where Executive Directors are recruited 
from overseas, or required to relocate 
on an international assignment, benefits 
more tailored to their geographical 
location may be provided and may include 
relocation costs and/or tax equalisation 
arrangements as necessary.
Where revised benefits are offered in a 
geographic location or across the Group, 
Executive Directors are likely to be eligible 
to receive those benefits on similar terms.
If the Company introduces an all-employee 
share plan, Executive Directors will be 
eligible to participate on the same terms 
as other employees.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Pension is provided by way of contribution 
to a personal pension or as a salary

Maximum Maximum Maximum
Annual percentage increases are generally 
consistent with the range awarded across 
the Group and in line with the salary awards 
for the home country that the executive 
works in.
Percentage increases in salary above 
this level may be made in certain 
circumstances, such as a change in 
responsibility or a significant increase 
in the role’s scale or the Group’s size

The car allowance value is limited to 
£20,000 per annum.
The value of insured benefits will vary year 
on year, based on the cost of providing 
insured benefits, and is included in the total

Annual Bonus
The bonus is split into two parts:
A Core Bonus element incentivises against 
a combination of financial targets and 
personal objectives.
A Company Milestone element incentivises 
achievement of significant Company 
Milestones. This element is included at the 
discretion of the Committee.
In combination, these elements support 
achievement of the Group’s goals.
Operation
25% of the payments under the Core 
Bonus element are made in Company 
shares deferred for three years subject to 
continued service. The remaining award 
is payable in cash.
Payments under the Company Milestone 
element are made fully in Company 
shares deferred for three years subject to 
continued service.
Malus and clawback provisions may 
apply for a period of three years from the 
point of award, in the event of a material 
misstatement of the Group’s financial results.
Share awards are made under the Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan (‘DSBP’). Awards (under 
either the Core Bonus element or Company 
Milestone element) will vest after three 
years, subject to continued service.
A dividend equivalent provision operates, 
enabling dividends to be paid (in cash or 
shares) on deferred shares that vest.
Maximum
Core Bonus opportunity: 125% of salary
The Committee has the discretion to award 
an additional variable award (up to 75% of 
salary for the Chief Executive, up to 50% 
of salary for other Executive Directors) to 
reward achievement of company milestones 
under the Company Milestone element. 
The Committee has the discretion to 
determine in which year the award is 
earned, and can choose to recognise 
achievement in a subsequent year. 
The maximum award in any year will 
be up to 75% for the Chief Executive, 
50% for other Executive Directors.
Therefore the maximum under the 
annual bonus is 200% of salary for 
the Chief Executive, 175% for other 
Executive Directors.
Performance Conditions
Core bonus awards are subject to 
achievement against a sliding scale of 
challenging financial targets and personal 
objectives, which the Committee sets 
each year to reflect the priorities for the 
year ahead.
The specific performance measures, 
targets and weightings are set every year 
to align with the Company’s strategy. 
Financial targets govern the majority of 
Core Bonus payments and are typically 
linked to the Group’s key performance 
indicators (e.g. profit and cash generation),
with a minority earned based on 
performance against personal objectives.
The Company Milestone element 
may be included by the Committee to 
incentivise and reward the achievement 
of pre-determined Company Milestones.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust 
the bonus outcome in light of overall 
underlying performance. Any adjustment 
made will be disclosed within the following 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
For financial performance targets under 
the Core Bonus element, bonus is earned 
on a graduated scale. The level of payment 
at threshold is set annually but will not 
exceed 25% of maximum. Maximum 
awards (100% payable) are for substantial 
outperformance against targets.
A summary of the performance targets for 
2017 is included on page 74.
Changes
Additional element of bonus (Company 
Milestone element) worth a maximum of 
75% of salary per annum for significant 
strategic achievements. Awards from this 
element in deferred shares further align 
executives with shareholders and supports 
a long-term and significant personal 
shareholding requirement. In years 
when a Company Milestone element is 
included, the annual bonus maximum 
increases from 125% to 200% of salary 
for the Chief Executive, 175% for other 
Executive Directors.

achieve superior returns to shareholders 
over a three-year period, to retain key
individuals and align their interests 
with shareholders.
To align executives and shareholders.
Operation Operation
Eligibility to receive awards is at the 
Committee’s discretion each year.
Awards vest three years from grant, 
subject to continued employment and 
satisfaction of challenging three-year 
performance targets.
For awards granted from 2014, the after-tax 
number of vested shares must be held for 
at least a two-year period following vesting.
A dividend equivalent provision enables 
dividends to be paid (in cash or shares) on 
shares that vest.
Malus and clawback provisions may apply 
for a period of three years, in the event of 
a material misstatement of the Group’s 
financial results.
Executives are expected to achieve a 
shareholding of 200% of salary, by retaining 
50% of the net of tax number of vested 
shares under the Company’s DSBP and PSP.
In addition, the Chief Executive Officer 
will retain the entire after tax number of 
Restricted Stock that was granted to him 
shortly after his appointment.
Maximum Maximum
Maximum annual award of 200% of 
salary (300% of salary in exceptional 
circumstances, such as recruitment).
Not applicable.
Performance Conditions Performance Conditions
Awards vest based on three-year 
performance against a challenging range 
of targets, aligned with the delivery of the 
Company’s long-term strategy.
Financial targets (including adjusted EPS 
growth) will determine the vesting of a 
majority of awards granted in any year.
Targets are typically structured as a 
challenging sliding scale, with no more 
than 20% of the maximum award vesting 
for achieving the threshold performance 
level through to full vesting for substantial 
outperformance of the threshold.
The awards will also be subject to an 
underpin that enables the Committee to 
scale back (but not scale up) vesting, if the 
Group’s performance over the period is not 
considered to reflect the progress made 
against its strategic business targets.
A summary of the performance targets for 
2017 is given on page 80.
The Committee will review performance 
conditions annually, in terms of the 
range of EPS targets and the metrics and 
weightings applied to each element of 
the PSP. Any revisions to the metrics and/
or weightings will only take place if it is 
necessary because of developments in 
the Company’s strategy and, where these 
are material, following dialogue with the 
Company’s major shareholders. Should the 
Committee believe that a major change 
of the current approach is appropriate (for 
example, replacing a primary performance 
metric with an alternative), this would only 
take place following a revised Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy being tabled 
to shareholders.

Approach to Recruitment Remuneration
Area Policy and operation
Overall When hiring a new Executive Director or making internal promotions to the Board, the Committee will apply 
the same policy as for existing Executive Directors, as detailed in the Remuneration Policy. The rationale for the 
package offered will be explained in the next Annual Report on Remuneration.
For internal promotions, commitments made prior to appointment will typically be honoured, as the executive 
transitions to the new remuneration arrangements. Awards made in the transition year would be pro-rated 
to reflect the remaining period of the vesting period or financial year. Any award will take into consideration 
awards granted prior to promotion.
Base salary Base salary would be set at an appropriate level, to recruit the best candidate based on their skills, experience 
and current remuneration.
If the salary is initially set at a discount to those offered in companies of a similar size, geographical reach and 
complexity, the salary will be increased over a period of time to bring the salary to the desired level, subject to 
individual performance.
Benefits Benefits provisions would be in line with the normal policy. In addition, reimbursement of legal fees in 
connection with recruitment may be reimbursed.
Where appropriate, the executive may also receive relocation benefits or other benefits reflecting normal 
market practice in the territory in which the Executive Director is employed.
Pension Pension provision would be in line with normal policy.
Annual bonus Incentive awards would be made under the annual bonus, in line with the normal policy. The maximum award 
under the Policy is 200% of salary.
Where an individual joins after the start of a scheme year, awards may be pro-rated for the portion of the 
financial year.
Long-term incentives Awards under the Performance Share Plan would be granted in line with the policy outlined for the current 
Executive Directors.
In the event of internal promotion, existing awards made under the Plan will continue over their original 
vesting period and remain subject to their terms at the date of grant. The Committee may choose to make an 
additional award (on the same basis as other Executive Directors), subject to the overall limit permitted under 
the Plan in any year.
Where an individual joins after the start of the incentive grant, an award may be made to bring the executive 
onto the ‘in-flight’ cycle, subject to the limits set out in the policy. Awards may be pro-rated for the portion of 
vesting period served.
Buy-out awards In addition to normal incentive awards, buy-out awards may be made to reflect value forfeited through an 
individual leaving their current employer.
If required, the Committee would seek to reflect the nature, timing and value of awards forgone in any 
replacement awards. Awards may be made in cash, shares or any other method as deemed appropriate by the 
Committee. Where possible, share awards will be replaced with share awards. Where performance conditions 
apply to the forfeited awards, performance conditions will be applied to the replacement award or the reward 
size adjusted downwards.
In establishing the appropriate value of any buy-out, the Committee would also take into account the value of 
the other elements of the new remuneration package.
The Committee would aim to minimise the cost to the Company. However, buy-out awards are not subject to a 
formal maximum. Any awards would be no more valuable than those being replaced.
Malus and Clawback
Malus and clawback may operate in respect of the annual bonus and long-term incentives. These provisions enable the Company to 
reduce the payout and vesting levels or to recover the relevant value from cash bonus payout or vesting of shares. These provisions 
could take effect in the event of erroneous or misstated financial accounts or other performance indicators within two years of the 
reporting date.
Discretions
The Committee retains certain discretions, which are set out in full in the plan rules. These include but are not limited to:
• the timing of any bonus payment;
• the impact of a change of control or restructuring; and
• any adjustments required as a result of a corporate event (such as a transaction, corporate restructuring, special dividend or 
rights issue).

In line with the 2004 and 2014 PSP plan rules, the Committee can amend the performance conditions and/or measures in respect of 
any award or payment, if one or more event(s) occur which would lead the Committee to consider that it would be appropriate to do so, 
provided that such an amendment would not be materially less difficult to satisfy than the unaltered performance condition would have 
been, but for the event in question.
Should the Committee use any of the discretions set out above, they would, where relevant, be disclosed in the next Annual Report on 
Remuneration. The views of major shareholders would be sought. Discretion in relation to the Company’s Share Incentive Plan scheme 
would be exercised within the parameters of the HMRC approved plan status and the listing rules.

Remuneration Policy for Other Employees
The remuneration structure for the Genus Executive Leadership Team (‘GELT’) follows the same approach as the Executive Directors but 
with a lower maximum opportunity. Eligibility for the Company Milestone element below the Executive Directors is based on the Chief 
Executive’s recommendations and subject to approval by the Committee. The Committee approves the annual objectives and targets 
for GELT together with salary awards, bonus targets and out-turns.
For the tier of management below GELT, the remuneration structure consists of base salary, benefits, pension, bonus and long-term share 
awards. Performance measures are tailored to reflect the position of the individual and the part of the business in which they operate.
Below the leadership group, the structure and amount of remuneration vary by work level. Generally, at less senior levels of the Group, 
total remuneration is less weighted towards performance-related pay, consisting of base salary, bonus and benefits relevant to the 
local jurisdiction and market practice. The maximum provision and incentive opportunity available are determined by the seniority and 
specialism of the role.
The Group HR Director is invited to present to the Committee on the proposals for salary increases for the employee population generally 
and any other changes to the Remuneration Policy. The Committee approves the share award policy for all employees and the value of 
awards to all executives and potential new hires.
The Company did not consult with employees when drafting the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
How Shareholders’ Views are Taken into Account
We consulted shareholders on the changes we are proposing for the new policy, specifically the short term bonus and EPS range for the 
long term award. During July and August, we spoke to four of our largest shareholders, sharing the business progress and remuneration 
proposals. We explained that, when the original policy was approved in 2014, the rate of return was expected to be higher. Investments 
that we have recently made – PRRSv resistant pigs, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, IVB Brasil – have brought forward costs, which in the short 
term, will impact EPS growth. We shared that we want to retain the very high calibre management team, and incentivise them to deliver 
on the opportunities. We are grateful to our shareholders for their time and feedback, which was challenging but supportive: they were 
very understanding of the direction the business is taking and wish to retain, as we do, the current management team to deliver on 
the potential. Genus plc
Annual Report 2016

The Committee remains committed to ongoing dialogue with the Company’s shareholders and will continue to consult with 
shareholders in the future. 
Service Contracts, Compensation for Loss of Office and External Appointments Policy
Executive Directors
Under the Executive Directors’ service contracts, the Company is required to give 12 months’ notice of termination of employment, while 
the Executive Directors are required to give six months’ notice. If either party serves notice, the executives can continue to receive basic 
salary, benefits and pension for the duration of their notice period, during which time the Company may require the individual to fulfil 
their duties or assign a period of garden leave.
Under the Chief Executive’s contract, the Company may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice of up to 12 months’ base salary and 
benefits, in the event of it terminating his employment. These payments may be made on a monthly basis, in which case the principles 
of mitigation apply and he would be obliged to seek alternative employment, with the payments reducing to the extent that he receives 
alternative income.
Under the Group Finance Director’s contract, the Company may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice of up to 12 months’ base 
salary, in the event of it terminating his employment. These payments may be made on a monthly basis, in which case he would be 
required to take all reasonable steps to find alternative employment. The principles of mitigation may apply, which means the Company 
may reduce the monthly payments based on his actual earnings during the period for which the monthly payments are made, or the 
Company’s assessment of the earnings that he could have received if he had sought alternative employment.
In certain circumstances, such as gross misconduct, the Company may terminate employment immediately without notice or payment. 
The Committee may make any statutory entitlements or payments to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination 
of any existing or future Executive Director as necessary. The Committee also retains the discretion to meet any outplacement costs, if 
deemed necessary.
There are no enhanced provisions in the event of a change of control. Executive Directors’ service contracts, which include details of 
remuneration, will be available for inspection at the AGM or at the Company’s registered office.
Paying the cash element of annual bonuses is normally contingent on the executive being in employment and not under notice at the 
payment date, unless the Committee determines otherwise, for example in the event of a good leaver circumstance such as death, 
retirement, injury or disability, redundancy or employment being transferred outside the Group. The payment of any bonus will be pro-
rated for the period of service and subject to the relevant performance conditions being achieved.
The vesting of any deferred share bonus awards is determined by the DSBP rules. In general, awards lapse when employment ceases. 
However, the deferred share bonus award will vest in certain good leaver circumstances, such as death, retirement, injury or disability, 
redundancy, employment being transferred outside the Group or any other reason the Committee decides.
The vesting of any awards granted under the 2004 PSP is determined by the plan’s rules. In general, awards lapse when employment 
ceases. However, awards may vest in certain good leaver circumstances, such as death or any other reason the Committee decides. This 
vesting is based on the extent to which the performance target has been satisfied. The Committee may decide to reduce the award pro 
rata, reflecting the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed.
The vesting of any awards granted under the 2014 PSP will depend on the business’s performance, based on the full performance period, 
subject to the Committee’s final judgement. Awards will be pro-rated based on the time that the individual was employed, although 
the Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it thinks it is inappropriate to do so. Alternatively, the Committee can decide 
that a good leaver’s award will vest when he leaves, subject to the performance conditions measured at that time and the pro-rating 
described above. This treatment will apply in the case of death.
In the event of a change of control, the treatment detailed above for good leavers under the 2004 PSP and 2014 PSP would apply.
Non-Executive Directors
All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement. Their appointment is for a fixed term of three years and is subject to one 
month’s notice of termination by either the Company or the Non-Executive Director, and to annual re-election at the Company’s AGM, in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Outside Appointments
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that this 
can broaden the Director’s skills and experience. When Stephen Wilson was appointed in January 2013, he was permitted to retain 
his Non-Executive Directorship of Xchanging plc and the associated remuneration. Stephen Wilson retired from this appointment on 
5 May 2016.

participation in a pension plan.
Annual bonus £525,545 £356,129 For the short-term bonus award, after adjustment for gene 
editing costs, the Group’s financial performance meant 
that awards for both the Chief Executive and Group Finance 
Director were 78.2% of maximum. This is made up of:
 • Adjusted profit before tax growth in constant currency of 
12% (excluding gene editing costs) ➝ up to 60% of bonus 
– 67.9% achieved.
 • Cash generation of £18.6m (excluding gene editing 
investment) ➝ up to 15% of bonus – 100% achieved.
 • Non-financial strategic targets ➝ up to 25% of bonus 
– The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director both 
received 90% for this element (22.5%).

targets and adjustment for gene editing costs on page 76.
Performance 
Share Plan
£385,283 £208,521 The adjusted EPS figure was 60.7p. The figure used for 
determining vesting of PSP awards includes the impact of the 
cost of share based payments. In addition, the Committee 
exercised discretion to exclude the impact of gene editing 
costs incurred, resulting in a revised EPS number of 57.1p. 
This EPS level exceeds the threshold for these awards and 
therefore the Tier 1 awards granted to the Chief Executive 
and to the Group Finance Director (on 26 September 2013) 
partially vest.
This is calculated using the average share price for the final 
quarter of the financial year ending 30 June 2016, which 
was 1,532p.

Introduction
There are extensive legal and best practice disclosure obligations with which we comply in this section of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM, with the new Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 
Section B being subject to a separate binding vote at this year’s AGM.
Balancing this formality with a desire to have a clear and understandable report, we have split this section into the following chapters:
1. What the Executive Directors were paid in 2016.
2. What the Executive Directors can earn in 2017.
3. The process the Committee followed to arrive at these decisions.
4. How the Chief Executive’s pay compares to shareholder returns over the past six years and to employees’ pay.
5. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees.
6. Details of the Directors’ shareholdings and rights to shares.
7. Details of the Directors’ contracts and Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment.
1. What the Executive Directors Were Paid in 2016
Executive Directors’ Single Total Remuneration Figure (Audited)
The following table shows a single total figure of remuneration for the 2016 financial year for each of the Executive Directors and 
compares this figure to the prior year. Variable pay remains in line with last year, based on another year of good overall performance.

1 Benefits comprise a car allowance of £20,000 for Karim Bitar and £12,000 for Stephen Wilson, insured benefits include life assurance and private medical insurance and 
a medical screen.
2 Executive Directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension shown in the Pension column.
3 Bonus earned excludes gene editing costs incurred in 2016 (outlined in the following section) and includes the 25% which is deferred into Company shares for three years.
4 The value of long-term incentives is determined by the number of awards vesting in relation to performance ended 30 June 2016. Dividend equivalents are not added 
to awards made under the long-term incentives. The value shown for 2016 is based on the average share price for the final three months of the 2016 financial year 
(which was 1,532p).
5 The 2015 values shown in the previous Annual Report have been updated to reflect the actual value at vesting (share price was 1,496p (vesting 8 December 2015) 
for awards for the Chief Executive and 1,431p (vesting 29 February 2016) for awards for the Group Finance Director). 
How the Bonuses for 2016 Were Calculated
The 2016 bonuses for Executive Directors were calculated by reference to performance against a challenging sliding scale of profit, 
cash flow and personal targets. As disclosed in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s letter, the Committee exercised discretion to 
exclude costs relating to gene editing incurred in the year when calculating awards under the plans. These costs were unforeseen at the 
time of setting targets for these awards and the Committee believes that the targets remain as stretching as when the awards were 
originally made. This ensured management’s reward was not unfairly affected by decisions to make the right long-term investment 
decisions on behalf of the business. 
The following are the results achieved in each element of the annual bonus incentive in a year of solid performance.

1 Adjusted PBT in constant currency (actual currency was £49.7m). 
2 Adjusted PBT excludes gene editing costs of £0.9m, as agreed by the Remuneration Committee. Without this adjustment the award level would have been 49.6% of maximum 
for this part of the bonus. 
3 Cash flow excludes gene editing costs of £0.9m and capital expenditure of £2.0m, as agreed by the Remuneration Committee. Without this adjustment the award would 
have been 78% of maximum. The financial elements of the bonus are payable on a straight-line basis between each threshold, target and stretch level.

How the Long-Term Incentive Figure Was Calculated in the Single Total Remuneration Table
Karim Bitar’s and Stephen Wilson’s 2014 PSP awards granted on 26 September 2013 were both subject to an adjusted EPS performance 
condition, based on the growth in adjusted EPS from a base year of 2013 compared to the adjusted EPS in 2016. These awards were 
granted under our former policy. The performance targets were as follows in relation to the awards:
Tier 1
The range of targets applicable to awards with a value of 125% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary to the Group Finance 
Director were as follows:
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS*
% of award
vesting**
<RPI +4% Nil
RPI +4% 30%
RPI +11% 100%
Tier 2
The range of targets applying to an additional award with a value of 75% of salary were as follows:
Per annum growth in adjusted EPS*
% of award
vesting***
<RPI +9% Nil
RPI +9% 10%
RPI +10% 20%
RPI +11% 35%
RPI +20% 100%
* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be computed based on a simple average annual growth rate.
** From RPI +4%, a linear scale of 10% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied.
*** From RPI +11%, a linear scale of 7% vesting per % increase in adjusted EPS was applied.
As with the short-term award, the Committee exercised discretion to calculate the long-term award after the exclusion of gene editing 
costs incurred in 2016, to avoid a perverse impact on the Executives’ remuneration. 
The adjusted 2016 EPS after the cost of share based payments and adjusting for costs relating to gene editing was 57.1p. The 
comparable base 2013 adjusted EPS figure after the cost of share based payments was 45.5p. This represents a three-year growth rate 
of 25.4%. RPI over the three-year period was 5.7%. As a consequence, the average annual growth in EPS was RPI+6.6%. By applying the 
performance condition calibration, the resulting level of vesting is 34.4% for Karim Bitar and 31.4% for Stephen Wilson. The different level 
of overall vesting reflects the higher level of award made to Karim Bitar under Tier 1 above. 
Karim Bitar’s award was over a maximum of 73,107 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 25,149 shares and these will vest on 
27 September 2016. Stephen Wilson’s award was over a maximum of 43,347 shares, so the actual level of vesting is 13,611 shares 
and these will vest on 27 September 2016.
The Company’s average share price for the period 1 April 2016 to 30 June 2016 was 1,532p, meaning that the value of Karim Bitar’s 
award was £385,283 and Stephen Wilson’s award was worth £208,521.
Material Contracts
There have been no other contracts or arrangements during the financial year in which a Director of the Company was materially 
interested and/or which were significant in relation to the Group’s business.
Payments for Loss of Office and Payments to Former Directors (Audited)
There were no payments for loss of office in the year. John Worby ceased to be a Director on 31 March 2013. Consistent with the terms 
of the relevant incentive plans, and as set out in previous Remuneration Reports, he was treated as a ‘good leaver’ on his retirement. 
His outstanding long-term incentive award granted on 7 December 2012 which was subject to performance ended 30 June 2015 vested 
on 8 December 2015. 23.4% of this award vested and as a result 3,089 shares were transferred to John with a value of £42,134, based on 
the share price on the date of transfer of £13.64.
Executive Directors’ External Appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to accept an external non-executive position, with the Board’s approval. Any fees received in respect of 
these appointments may be retained by the executive. Stephen Wilson received £42,436 in relation to his Non-Executive Directorship at 
Xchanging plc for the period from 1 July 2015 to 5 May 2016.

2. What the Executive Directors Can Earn in 2017
A summary of this chapter is given on page 74.
Base Salary
The Committee reviews the Executive Directors’ base salaries prior to each financial year, taking into account factors such as individual 
and corporate performance, an assessment of market conditions and, most importantly, the salary increases applicable to the Group’s 
other UK employees.
The Executive Directors’ current salary levels (with effect from 1 July 2016 and paid in September) are as follows:
• Karim Bitar: £548,114 (2% increase from 2016); and
• Stephen Wilson: £371,423  (2% increase from 2016).
The Committee determined that salaries would be increased by 2%, reflecting the average increase awarded across the UK employee 
population. It did not refer to other market benchmarking data this year when making this decision.
Salary awards will move to a September review date from 2017, with no backdating of awards.
Benefits
The Executive Directors will receive the following benefits-in-kind, namely a car allowance, life assurance, an annual medical screen and 
private medical insurance.
Pension
In lieu of Company pension contributions, the Company pays Karim Bitar and Stephen Wilson a taxable pension allowance of 25% and 
15% of basic salary per annum respectively.
Performance-Related Annual Bonus
Consistent with the proposed Remuneration Policy, the Company bonus scheme for the 2016/17 financial year for the Executive Directors is:
Value of bonus Maximum up to 200% of salary comprising:
A core bonus element of 125% of salary based on profit, cash and personal objectives
A Company Milestone element of up to 75% and 50% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
the Group Finance Director respectively.
Bonus Chief Executive
On target value of bonus 62.5% (core bonus element) plus 37.5% (Company Milestone 
element); total on-target 100%.
Maximum bonus 200% of salary.
Group Finance Director
On target value of bonus 62.5% (core bonus element) plus 25% (Company Milestone element); 
total on-target 87.5%.
Maximum bonus 175% of salary.
Performance measures Adjusted profit before tax – 80% of salary weighting.
Cash generation – 20% of salary weighting.
Personal objectives – 25% of salary weighting.
Company Milestone target – 75% of salary weighting for Chief Executive.
 – 50% of salary weighting for Group Finance Director.
Calibration of profit target No bonus is payable unless the prior year’s result is exceeded. Thereafter, the core bonus 
award is determined on the following basis:
Growth on prior year adjusted profit before tax (‘PBT’)*
Payout (profit 
element)
Percentage of 
salary awarded
0% 0% 0%
10% p.a. delivers 50% 40%
15% p.a. 100% 80%
Straight-line payout between performance points.
* In constant currency and excluding gene editing costs.
Calibration of cash generation target The cash target is the budgeted figure, with a specific range of £3m below the target and £3m 
above. Specific numbers were set (rather than a percentage range) to ensure the executives 
were focused on actual cash generation.
Calibration of personal objectives Personal objectives are linked to successful implementation of objectives for the Executive 
Directors. It would be commercially sensitive to disclose them in advance. We will disclose 
retrospective performance against these targets.
Company Milestone Company Milestones represent pivotal and significant events in the Company’s development, 
which reposition the Company as an agricultural biotechnology pioneer. Such events would be 
significant strategic achievements and long-term value creating.
The Committee has determined that this element of the annual bonus will be included for 
2016/17 for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. The target and whether this has 
been achieved will be disclosed retrospectively. Genus plc
Annual Report 2016
80
Bonus deferral Of the 125% core bonus element, 25% will be deferred by way of shares for three years and 
will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver circumstances.
For achievement of the Company Milestone element, any award of up to 75% of salary for the 
Chief Executive and 50% for the Group Finance Director will be deferred by way of shares for 
three years and will vest subject to continued employment, other than in certain good leaver 
circumstances.
Malus and clawback The Committee can apply malus to deferred bonuses and claw back any element of paid 
bonuses that should not have been awarded or paid, in the event of a material misstatement 
of the Group’s annual results.
Long-Term Incentives
Awards to be granted in 2016 will be granted in line with the policy approved by shareholders and under the 2014 Performance Share 
Plan. The Chief Executive will be granted an award over shares worth 200% of salary and the Group Finance Director will be granted an 
award over shares worth 175% of salary. These awards are in line with those in 2015.
The performance targets for the awards to be granted in 2016 will primarily relate to average annual growth in adjusted EPS, measured 
over three years and excluding gene editing costs. The same approach will govern awards due to vest in 2017 and 2018.
The range of targets for the 2016 awards is as follows:
Average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’)*
Vesting 
(% award)
Less than 5% p.a. 0%
5% p.a. 20%
15% p.a. 100%
Straight-line vesting between performance points
* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share based payments and 
gene editing.
The Committee remains convinced that using adjusted EPS is the correct approach, for the reasons set out in the Performance 
and Remuneration Statement earlier. The Committee believes the above targets are appropriately challenging, that they incentivise 
executives to deliver the Company’s growth strategy and are therefore aligned with shareholders’ interests. They also adhere to the 
principles of transparency and simplicity, to maximise the incentive provided to participants by the 2014 PSP.
As with awards currently granted under the 2014 PSP, the Committee will retain the ability to scale back vesting based on EPS 
performance if it does not consider the vesting result to be consistent with the progress achieved against the Company’s strategy 
during the performance period. This is considered appropriate to broaden the executive team’s focus beyond financial performance.
2014 PSP awards granted in 2016 will continue to require the executives to retain the after-tax number of shares vesting in 2019 for two 
years. Clawback and malus provisions may be applied at the Committee’s discretion, if the Company’s results are found to have been 
materially misstated within three years of vesting.
3. The Process the Committee Followed to Arrive at These Decisions
The Committee complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code. It makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of 
reference, on remuneration for the Executive Directors and other members of GELT. The Committee’s full terms of reference are available 
on the Company’s website at www.genusplc.com.
During 2016, the Committee comprised:
Director Independent status Attendance at meetings
Nigel Turner (Chairman) Yes 6/6
Mike Buzzacott Yes 6/6
Duncan Maskell Yes 6/6
Lykele van der Broek Yes 6/6
Lysanne Gray* Yes 2/3
Bob Lawson Yes 6/6
* Lysanne Gray joined the Board on 1 April 2016.
**  Due to prior commitments pre-appointment, Lysanne Gray was unable to attend the April 2016 Remuneration Committee meeting following her appointment. 
However, Lysanne was provided with all Committee materials and submitted feedback via the Chairman prior to the meeting.

None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest (other than as shareholders), conflicts of interests arising from 
cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business. The Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director attend 
meetings at the invitation of the Committee, but are not present when their own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee 
is supported by the Group HR Director and the Finance and Company Secretariat functions.
During the year, the Committee continued to use PwC for advice it considers is of value, objective and independent. PwC’s fees were 
£88,900 for its remuneration advice to the Committee. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with 
its Code of Conduct. Separate teams within PwC provide unrelated advisory services including taxation, international assignments 
and acquisition related services to the Group.
During the year to 30 June 2016, the Committee met six times and considered the following matters:
August 2015 September 2015 November 2015
 • Review of Directors’ Remuneration 
Report.
 • Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report 2015.
 • The terms of the 2015 and 2016 
Executive Annual Bonus Plan, and the 
individual bonuses payable for 2015, 
in light of the Group’s and individuals’ 
performances.

and approval of the vesting levels of 
long-term share incentive awards 
granted in 2012.
 • The individual long-term share incentive 
awards under the Company’s 2014 
PSP and 2014 Executive Share Option 
Plan, and the associated performance 
measures and targets.

How Employees’ Pay is Taken into Account
While the Company does not consult employees on matters of Directors’ remuneration, the Committee does take account of the policy 
for employees across the workforce when determining the Remuneration Policy for Directors.
The Group HR Director facilitates this process, presenting to the Committee the pay structures across the organisation and how they fit 
the Group’s Remuneration Policy. The process includes an annual staff engagement survey that includes questions on pay, as well as 
consulting employees informally on their views of the current overall Remuneration Policy. This forms part of the feedback provided to 
the Committee and is used by the Group HR Director to assess the Policy’s ongoing effectiveness and the changes that should be made.
When setting the Executive Directors’ base salaries, the Committee compares the salary increases proposed for each Executive Director 
within those proposed for employees in their geographical location, as well as considering the typical increase proposed across the 
Group as a whole. Genus plc

which were last reviewed in 2012, increased to £55,000 which total amount includes, for each of them, their fees for their extra services 
in respect of the time commitment and responsibilities attributed to their membership of the Board’s Committees. The additional 
services from the responsibilities of chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees were also recognised with an additional fee of 
£5,000, giving the Chairs of these Committees a total fee of £60,000.
Fees will continue at this level for 2017.

Stephen Wilson 46,753 £637,243 (175%) 20 01.07.15–30.06.18
* The closing average share price over the three days prior to the award being granted has been used to determine the maximum face value of the awards. This was £13.63 
for Karim Bitar and Stephen Wilson (award granted on 14 September 2015).
The awards were granted as nil-cost share options and vesting will be subject to achieving a challenging sliding scale of adjusted EPS 
growth target and a strategic underpin, consistent with our approved Remuneration Policy. The adjusted EPS growth performance target 
for the above awards is:
Average annual growth in adjusted EPS

* Growth in adjusted EPS over the three-year performance period will be calculated on a simple average annual growth rate after the cost of share based payments and 
adjusted for gene editing costs.

Directors
The Directors and the dates of their 
respective appointments are listed on 
pages 46 and 47.
Equal Opportunities/Employees 
with Disabilities
Genus values diversity and aims to 
make best use of everyone’s skills and 
abilities. We are therefore committed 
to equal opportunities at every stage of 
our employees’ careers. Our policy on 
employees with disabilities is to fully and 
fairly consider people with disabilities for 
all vacancies. We interview and recruit 
people with disabilities and endeavour 
to retain employees if they become 
disabled while they work for us. Where 
possible, we will retrain employees who 
become disabled and adjust their working 
environment, so they can maximise 
their potential.
Political Contributions
The Group does not make political 
contributions.
Dividend
The Board is recommending to 
shareholders a final dividend of 14.7 
pence per ordinary share, resulting in a 
total dividend for the year of 21.4 pence 
per ordinary share, an increase of 10% 
for the year. It is proposed that the final 
dividend will be paid on 2 December 2016 
to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 18 November 2016.
Capital Structure
Note 29 gives details of the Company’s 
issued share capital and any movements 
in the issued share capital during the year. 
In accordance with the Company’s current 
Articles of Association, the Company is 
restricted to issuing up to a maximum of 
75,989,400 ordinary shares. Consistent 
with current company law and standard 
practice for listed companies, under the 
new Articles of Association proposed to be 
adopted at the 2016 AGM, this restriction 
would be removed and, if the new Articles 
are adopted, the Directors’ powers to 
allot shares will be limited to the amount 
set out in the resolution proposed at the 
AGM, that is £4,073,315.80 (representing 
two-thirds of the Company’s current 
issued share capital). 
The Company has one class of ordinary 
share. All issued shares are fully paid and 
each share has the right to one vote at the 
Company’s general meetings. There are 
no specific restrictions either on the size 
of a holding or on the transfer of shares, 
which are both governed by our Articles 
of Association and prevailing legislation. 
No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital.
Details of the Company’s employee share schemes are set out in note 28. In connection 
with these schemes, the Genus plc Employee Benefit Trust holds shares in the Company 
from time to time and abstains from voting in respect of any such shares.
For additional information on capital risk management including financial instruments, 
see note 24.
Authority to Acquire the Company’s Own Shares
No shares were bought back by the Company, under the authority of the shareholders’ 
resolutions of 19 November 2015, in the period since 20 November 2015 and up to the 
date of this report.
Substantial Shareholdings
As at 1 September 2016, we were aware of the following material interests in the 
Company’s ordinary shares:
Fund manager Shareholding %
Landsdowne Partners 5,988,888 9.82
Baillie Gifford & Co 4,437,236 7.27
Columbia Threadneedle Investments 3,298,406 5.41

Norges Bank Investment Mgt 2,048,785 3.36
M&G Investment Mgt 1,901,531 3.12
There have been no material changes in shareholding since 30 June 2016.
No other person has notified an interest in the Company’s ordinary shares, which is 
required to be disclosed to us.
Going Concern and Long-Term 
Viability Statement
After making enquiries, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resources 
to continue its operational existence 
for the foreseeable future and for a 
period of at least 12 months from 
the date of this report. Accordingly, 
the Directors continue to adopt and 
consider appropriate the going concern 
basis in preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts.
During the year we agreed new five-
year borrowing facilities on improved 
terms. At 30 June 2016 the Group had 
net debt of £89.7m (2015: £71.8m) and 
had substantial headroom of £49.8m 
under the renewed facilities of £169.7m, 
which run to February 2021. The Group’s 
financial position remains strong.
In addition, in accordance with provision 
C.2.2 of the 2014 revision of the Code, 
the Directors have assessed the viability 
of the Group over a three-year period 
to June 2019. This period is deemed 
appropriate given the visibility the 
Company has to its product development 
pipeline, for example, as a result of the 
genetic lag of approximately three years 
between the porcine nucleus herds 
and customers’ production systems. 
In addition, the nature of the principal 
risks and uncertainties affecting Genus 
including the agricultural markets 
in which it operates were taken into 
account in determining the three year 
period. The Directors have considered 
Genus’s current financial position, its 
planned capital expenditure as well as 
the financing facilities available to the 
Group. They also assessed the potential 
impact, in severe but plausible scenarios, 
of the principal risks and uncertainties, 
set out on pages 18 to 19, and in 
particular the impacts of biosecurity, 
market down-turn, continuity of supply 
and the recent court case regarding 
our GSS technology. The assessment 
took into account the likely degree of 
effectiveness of current and available 
mitigating actions.
Based on this assessment, the Directors 
have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they 
fall due over the period to June 2019. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Provision of Information to the Company’s Auditor
Each of the Directors at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:

information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 Companies Act 2006.
Appointment of Auditor
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as auditor and a resolution to reappoint it will be proposed at the

Directors’ Responsibilities Statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Financial Statements for 
each financial year. Under that law, the 
Directors are required to prepare the 
Group Financial Statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation and have elected to prepare 
the Parent Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law) including FRS 101 
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’. Under 
company law, the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company 
for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the Financial 
Statements; and
• prepare the Financial Statements on 
the going concern basis, unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group Financial 
Statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies;
• present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to 
enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that 
are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the Financial 
Statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information 
included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of Financial 
Statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Responsibility Statement
We confirm that to the best of 
our knowledge:
• the Financial Statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of 
the Company and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole;
• the Strategic Report includes a fair 
review of the development and 
performance of the business and 
the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
• the Annual Report and Financial 
Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable, and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model 
and strategy.

Opinion on Financial  
Statements of Genus plc
In our opinion:
 • the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent 
Company’s affairs as at 30 June 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
 • the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union;
 • the Parent Company Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure 
Framework; and
 • the Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group Financial Statements, Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation.
The Financial Statements comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of 
Comprehensive Income, the Group and Parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Group and Parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Statement of Cash Flows and the related 
notes 1 to 53. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group Financial Statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent 
Company Financial Statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101.
Going concern and the Directors’ 
assessment of the principal risks 
that would threaten the solvency 
or liquidity of the Group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement regarding the 
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the Financial 
Statements and the Directors’ statement on the longer-term viability of the Group contained 
within the Directors’ Report on page 86. 
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
 • the Directors’ confirmation on page 88 that they have carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, 
future performance, solvency or liquidity;
 • the disclosures on pages 18–19 that describe those risks and explain how they are being 
managed or mitigated;
 • the Directors’ Statement on page 88 that they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements and their identification of 
any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least 
twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements;
 • the Directors’ explanation on page 86 as to how they have assessed the prospects of 
the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be 
appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over 
the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any 
necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did 
not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions 
can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors 
and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We also confirm we have not provided any 
of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest 
effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of 
the engagement team.
The risks identified are the same risks as in the prior year except that the prior year report included 
one further risk related to accounting for acquisitions as there was a significant acquisition; 
no similar acquisitions were made in the current year.
The Audit Committee has requested that while not currently required under International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we include in our report any significant key observations 
in respect of these assessed risks of material misstatement.

Fair value of biological assets under IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’
Risk description The Group calculates the fair value of biological assets through the use of discounted cash flow 
models and recent transaction prices. As at 30 June 2016, the total fair value of biological assets 
is £331m.
The valuation models and related data inputs and assumptions require a number of 
management estimates as explained in note 15 to the Financial Statements. This is disclosed 
as a critical judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty in note 4.
For bovine asset valuations the key assumptions include: the future demand for semen (sales 
volume); estimated production volume, unit prices and marketable life for each bull; the discount 
rate applied to the future cash flows; and the percentage of bulls which are expected to be 
actively marketed.
For porcine asset valuations the key assumptions include: the percentage of production animals 
expected to be sold; the expected sales price; the expected useful life; and the discount rate 
applied to the future cash flows. In addition, for the pure line pigs, the number of future 
generations from which output is attributable to the current herd.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
Our response to this risk considers the separate elements of the fair value calculations: the basis 
for management’s estimates and judgements applied in the key assumptions; the validity of 
transactional data used for other inputs; and the mechanical integrity of the models themselves. 
For the bovine asset valuations, our audit work included obtaining an understanding of 
management’s processes surrounding the compilation of the future demand, marketable life 
and production volume forecasts. We considered the appropriateness of projected prices, volume 
growth rates against historical trends and current performance, and analysed management’s 
historical forecasting accuracy. 
For the porcine asset valuations our audit work included consideration of the appropriateness 
of management’s assessment of the number of future generations from which output is 
attributable to the current herd and expected useful lives. We tested the expected percentages 
of animals to be sold, retained and slaughtered as well as recent selling prices by reference 
to historical transactional data. For all other assumptions in each model we challenged the 
significant estimates with reference to third party or historical transactional data as appropriate. 
For both species’ valuation models, we used internal valuation experts in our testing of the 
discount rates applied to the cash flows. 
We also tested the mechanical integrity of the spreadsheets used to calculate the fair values 
using analytical tools and performed sensitivity analyses on the key assumptions.
Key observations We are satisfied that the assumptions and inputs used within the IAS 41 models prepared by 
management for bovine and porcine are appropriate.
Valuation of pension schemes and post-retirement benefits
Risk description The Group operates several defined benefit pension schemes, for which there is judgement in 
determining the net deficit valuation under IAS 19. At 30 June 2016, the net deficit is £44.5m 
and the aggregate scheme liabilities are £357m. 
The valuation of the aggregate pension net deficit is based on a number of assumptions disclosed 
in note 27 such as the discount rate, inflation rate and life expectancy. This is disclosed as a critical 
judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty in note 4.
Genus is party to the Milk Pension Fund, a multi-employer pension scheme and is exposed to the 
risk of additional liabilities from the default of other scheme members beyond its current 75% 
share of the liabilities.
As part of the 2015 Triennial Valuation process, the trustees of the Milk Pension Fund changed 
the index used for pension and deferred pension increases from RPI to CPI. As a result a gain 
of £43.9m was recorded, as set out in note 27. Following this change the net present value of 
deficit repair contributions of £34.3m exceeds the IAS 19 valuation of the net liability of £19.4m, 
and thus an additional liability has been recorded under IFRIC 14. Strategic Report Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information

Valuation of pension schemes and post-retirement benefits
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
In conjunction with our actuarial specialists, we have evaluated the appropriateness of 
management’s methodology and assumptions used to value the defined benefit pension 
schemes, including the change from RPI to CPI, by benchmarking the assumptions to those 
used in the external market as at the same date.
In addition, we circularised the independent actuaries and investment managers responsible 
for managing the pension funds to provide supporting evidence for the source inputs into the 
pension valuations, including membership data.
In response to the risk of additional liabilities for the multi-employer scheme arising from other 
employers, we have considered the financial strength and stability of remaining employers in the 
scheme and their ability to contribute to the deficit through a review of the most recent publicly 
available financial information.
In respect of the judgement over the use of the revised Schedule of Contributions to calculate 
the additional minimum funding liability under IFRIC 14, we have reviewed the relevant 
correspondence between the Company, the employer group and the trustees. We have 
considered the deadline for the agreement of the Schedule of Contributions as set out in Code 
of Practice issued by The Pensions Regulator and the extent of the powers held by the Trustees 
to set the contribution rates for each employer. 
Key observations From the work performed above, we are satisfied that all assumptions applied in respect of the 
valuation of the scheme assets and liabilities are appropriate and that the fair value of the net 
deficit of the Milk Pension Fund is calculated appropriately.
Impairment of goodwill
Risk description The Group has £86.0m of goodwill on its balance sheet, as set out in note 14. There is a risk 
regarding potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill arising from historical acquisitions.
In management’s impairment assessment there are a number of key judgements used to 
determine the recoverable amount, including the identification of cash-generating units (‘CGUs’), 
growth rates in future cash flow forecasts, the cost savings to be derived from the Genus Sexed 
Semen (‘GSS’) project and discount rates applied to these forecasts.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
We challenged the assumptions used by management in their annual impairment assessment by 
comparing the projected growth rates and forecast cash flows against historical trends achieved 
in the business in the wake of what has been challenging market conditions. We analysed 
historical budgeting accuracy to assess the reliability of management’s forecasts. We reviewed 
third-party market data sources used by management in their forecast models. 
We reviewed and challenged management’s identification of CGUs and the level of CGU 
aggregation at which goodwill is allocated and monitored, which is consistent with last year.
We agreed the projected cost savings from the GSS project to detailed plans and forecasts 
and verified that the impact of the recent court ruling was included within management’s 
assessment appropriately.
We evaluated management’s assessment of the sensitivity of the Group’s impairment 
assumptions to reasonably possible changes and considered the associated disclosures 
provided by the Group in relation to its impairment review within note 14. 
We used valuation specialists within the audit team to challenge the discount rates applied 
to these cash flows by reference to market data, including the risk premium applied to each 
CGU. This involved benchmarking the rates against, for example, other companies operating 
in similar regions.
Key observations We have assessed the impairment calculations on goodwill on each CGU and are satisfied that 
the assumptions applied within the models are appropriate. Genus plc

Impairment of capitalised development costs
Risk description As set out in note 14 the Group capitalises development costs in relation to the Genus Sexed 
Semen project. The total capitalised to date is £17.8m.
There is a risk regarding potential impairment of development costs capitalised, including 
the impact of the recent court rulings in relation to the ongoing case with Sexing Technology, 
as well as whether the costs capitalised meet the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
Management assesses these costs for impairment by using a net present value model for the 
project. This model includes the following assumptions subject to judgement: the projected 
cash flows, growth rates and discount rates applied.
How the scope of our audit 
responded to the risk
We tested the development costs capitalised to assess whether they meet the criteria for 
capitalisation as set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’. 
We reviewed management’s assessment of the carrying value of costs capitalised and challenged 
the assumptions applied to the total project with reference to Board-approved forecasts and 
historical growth rates. We reviewed the project specific risk premium added to the discount rate 
in conjunction with our valuation specialists. We discussed the progress of the project with project 
managers and discussed the impact of the related litigation with management and external 
legal advisors.
We also assessed whether the additional future costs to be incurred by the Company as a result 
of the recent court ruling have been correctly incorporated within the impairment assessment. 
Key observations We have assessed the impairment calculations for capitalised development costs and are 
satisfied that the assumptions applied within the models are appropriate. We are satisfied that 
the costs capitalised meet the criteria set out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered 
by the Audit Committee discussed on pages 60–61.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, 
and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the Financial Statements that makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed 
or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating 
the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £2.2m (2015: £2.3m), which is 5.3% (2015: 5.8%) of 
pre-tax profit before exceptional items and changes in fair value of biological assets, and below 1% 
(2015: 1%) of equity. We have used a profit-based measure given the Group is listed and therefore 
shareholders focus on profitability as adjusted for the exceptional items and changes in fair value 
of biological assets to avoid distortion that could otherwise arise due to non-recurring items and 
fair value movements.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences 
in excess of £0.1m (2015: £0.1m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the Financial Statements. 
Our audit work at the components was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each 
individual entity which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from £1.1m to £1.7m 
(2015: £1.1m to £1.9m).

An overview of the scope of 
our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, 
including Group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group 
level. Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work 
at 22 components (2015: 20). Eleven of these were subject to a full audit (2015: twelve), whilst the 
remaining eleven (2015: eight) were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our 
testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material misstatement and of the materiality 
of the Group’s operations at those locations. The change in number of components within scope 
reflects the impact of acquisitions and certain entities which are no longer significant to the Group 
following internal restructuring.
These 22 components represent the principal business units and account for 99% (2015: 85%) 
of the Group’s net assets, 88% (2015: 78%) of the Group’s revenue and 92% (2015: 86%) of the 
Group’s profit before tax. 
Full audit
Specified audit 
procedures Total
Revenue 74% 13% 87%
Profit before tax 58% 22% 80%
Net assets 85% 14% 99%
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking audit work to address the 
risks of material misstatement identified above. 
At the Parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical 
procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit 
of specified account balances.
The Group audit team continued to follow a programme of planned visits. The lead audit partner 
visited the USA, UK, Mexico and Brazil components during the current and previous year. In years 
when we do not visit a significant component we include the component audit team in our team 
briefing, discuss their risk assessment, and review documentation of the findings from their work.
In 2016, the Group audit team held a global team briefing with all component audit teams to 
assess the risks facing the Group on an international scale and to plan the work to be performed.
Opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 • the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for 
which the Financial Statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required 
to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate 
for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 • the Parent Company Financial Statements are not in agreement with the accounting records 
and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures 
of Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to 
report arising from these matters.

Our duty to read other information  
in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 • materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Financial Statements; or
 • apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the 
Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 • otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between 
our knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the 
Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies 
or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of 
Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Financial Statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Financial Statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also 
comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology 
and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. 
Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team and 
independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might 
state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
Financial Statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Financial 
Statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the Financial Statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances 
and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the Financial 
Statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited Financial Statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. Reporting entity
Genus plc (the ‘Company’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. Its registered office 
is Matrix House, Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG21 4DZ. The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2016 
comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’). We have used the equity method to account for 
the Group’s interests in joint ventures and associates. Genus at a Glance on pages 2 and 3 explains the Group’s operations and 
principal activities.
2. Basis of preparation
We have prepared the Group Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted 
by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Unless otherwise stated, we have consistently applied the significant accounting policies set out below to all periods presented in these 
Group Financial Statements. 
The going concern statement has been included in the Directors’ Report on page 86 and forms part of these statements.
In the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, we have separated the disclosure of certain pension related items comparative 
amounts to conform to the current year’s presentation and to increase clarity. In the Group Statement of Cash Flows we have included 
the cash acquired on acquisition within investing activities in the comparative period. In note 5 we have reclassified certain assets in the 
comparative period, in note 6 we have reallocated porcine semen sales from ‘Sale of animals, semen, embryos and associated products 
and services’ to ‘Royalties – animal and semen’ to conform to the current year’s presentation and to increase clarity, in note 9 we have 
restated comparative amounts to incorporate casual employees to conform with the current period definition, in note 16 we have 
with separated out construction in progress comparative amounts and in note 24 operating profit sensitivity has been restated to be 
consistent with current year assumptions.
Functional and presentation currency
We present the Group Financial Statements in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. All financial 
information presented in Sterling has been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
Use of estimates
Preparing financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect our application 
of accounting policies and our reported assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 
We review our estimates and underlying assumptions on an ongoing basis, and recognise revisions to accounting estimates in the 
period in which we revise the estimate and in any future periods affected.
Note 4 provides information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and the critical judgements we made in applying 
accounting policies that have the most effect on the amounts we recognised in the financial statements.
Non-GAAP measures – adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share exclude the net IAS 41 
valuation movement on biological assets, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, exceptional items 
and other gains and losses.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide shareholders with useful information about the Group’s trading performance. The 
reconciliation between operating profit from continuing operations and adjusted operating profit from continuing operations is shown 
on the face of the Group Income Statement. 
3. Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole
This section sets out our significant accounting policies that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy 
is generally applicable to a specific note to the Financial Statement, the policy has been described in that note. We have also detailed 
below the new accounting pronouncements that we will adopt in future years and our current view of the impact they will have on our 
financial reporting.
Accounting convention
We prepare the Group Financial Statements under the historical cost convention, except for our biological assets and derivative financial 
instruments. In accordance with IFRS, we measure: biological assets at fair value less point-of-sale costs, which represent the costs of 
distribution and selling expenses; share-based payment expense; pension liabilities; and certain financial instruments at fair value.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities the Group controls. We have control when we have the power to govern the entity’s financial and operating 
policies, so benefitting from its activities. In assessing control, we take into account potential voting rights that we can currently exercise 
or convert. We fully consolidate the results of subsidiaries we acquire from the date that control transfers to the Group. We cease 
consolidating the results of subsidiaries we cease to control from the date that control passes.
In preparing the Group Financial Statements, we eliminate intra-Group balances and any unrealised income and expenses arising 
from intra-Group transactions. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the 
investment, to the extent of our interest in the investee. We eliminate unrealised losses in the same way as unrealised gains, but only 
to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Foreign currencies
We record foreign currency transactions in the relevant Group entity’s functional currency, at the exchange rate on the transaction date. 
At each balance sheet date, we retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the exchange rate on 
the balance sheet date. We recognise the foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation in the Group Income Statement.
When non-monetary assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency, we translate them at the exchange rate 
at the transaction date. When non-monetary assets and liabilities are stated at fair value in a foreign currency, we translate them at the 
prevailing exchange rate on the date we determined the fair value.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the prevailing 
exchange rates at the balance sheet date. We translate these operations’ revenues and expenses using an average rate for the period. 
When exchange differences arise from translating foreign operations into Sterling, or from the fair value movement of related effective 
hedges, we take them to the foreign currency translation reserve. When we dispose of a foreign operation, we release these differences 
to the income statement. Exchange movements on inter-Company loans designated as long-term funding are taken to the foreign 
currency translation reserve, together with any related taxation.
The principal exchange rates were as follows:
Average Closing
2016 2015 2014 2016 2015 2014
US Dollar/£ 1.47 1.57 1.64 1.34 1.57 1.71
Euro/£ 1.33 1.32 1.20 1.20 1.41 1.25

Mexican Peso/£ 25.38 22.68 21.44 24.66 24.68 22.18
Revenue
Revenue is the value of sales and royalties receivable from customers, net of trade discounts and value added tax.
The principal components of the Group’s revenue and their respective accounting treatments are:
• Revenue from the sale of bovine and porcine semen, porcine breeding animals, embryos and ancillary products, which we recognise 
when risks and rewards transfer to the customer or distributor. This is either when we ship to customers or on delivery, depending on 
the terms of sale.
• We recognise royalties when receivable. We receive royalty payments from certain porcine customers based on key performance 
variables, such as the number of pigs born per litter, the number of litters born per sow and the average slaughter weight of the 
animals born. This amount is confirmed directly to Genus by the customer. 
• Revenue from consulting and other services, which represent the amounts we charged for services we provided during the year, 
including recoverable expenses but excluding value added tax. We recognise services provided but not yet billed as revenue, based 
on a fair value assessment of the work we have delivered and our contractual right to receive payment. Where unbilled revenue is 
contingent on a future event, we do not recognise any revenue until the event occurs. 
• Revenue from the slaughter of porcine animals is recognised when the risks and rewards transfer to the slaughterhouse. 
Research and development
We undertake research with the aim of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge, and recognise this expenditure in the income 
statement as we incur it.
The Group constantly monitors its research activities. When research projects achieve technical feasibility and are commercially viable, 
our policy is to capitalise further development costs within intangible assets in accordance with IAS 38.
Our development activities include developing and maintaining our porcine genetic nucleus herd and our bovine pre-stud herds. We do 
not capitalise development expenditure separately for these herds, as their fair value is included in the fair value of the Group’s biological 
assets, in accordance with IAS 41.
We disclose the costs of research and herd development activities, as required by IAS 38.
New standards and interpretations

3. Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole 
continued
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
At the date of authorisation of these Group Financial Statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been 
applied in preparing these Group Financial Statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted 
by the EU):
• Amendments to IFRS 11 ‘Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations’, IAS 27 ‘Equity Method in Separate Financial 
Statements’, IAS 1 ‘Disclosure Initiative’, IAS 12 ‘Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses’;
• Amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 28 ‘Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception’;
• Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 ‘Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation’;
• ‘Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2012 – 2014 Cycle’;
• IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’;
• IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory Deferral Accounts’;
• IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’; and
• IFRS 16 ‘Leases’.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new pronouncements on its results, financial position and cash flows. It is not 
practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
4. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3 or in the specific note the policy relates to, the Directors 
are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are 
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the 
period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
Determination of the fair value of biological assets (note 15)
Determining the fair values of our bovine and porcine biological assets requires significant judgement and assumptions.
Bovine: The key judgements are in respect of the forecast sales volumes, the expected unit prices, the animals’ useful lifespan and the 
discount rate we apply. 
Porcine: The key judgements and assumptions are in respect of the animals’ useful lifespan, the proportion that go to slaughter, the 
mix of boars and gilts and, in the case of the animals in the pure line herds, the number of future generations attributable to the current 
herds, the fair value prices achieved on sales, the animals’ expected useful lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate we apply.
Defined benefit pension schemes (note 27)
Amounts recorded in the Financial Statements in respect of defined benefit pension schemes are also based on significant estimates. 
Judgements required included the extent to which we should provide for any amounts that might become payable under our joint and 
several liability in respect of the Milk Pension Fund, and the extent of additional liability required under IFRIC 14.
Impairment of goodwill, intangible and tangible assets (note 14)
Determining whether goodwill, intangible and tangible assets are impaired requires us to consider any specific impairment indicators 
and to estimate the value in use of the cash-generating units to which we have allocated goodwill, intangible and tangible assets. 
The value in use calculation requires us to estimate the future cash flows arising from the cash-generating unit and the appropriate 
discount rate, in order to calculate present value.
5. Segmental information
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the 
Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive and the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their 
performance. For management purposes, the Group’s operating and reporting structure comprises four operating segments; Genus 
PIC, Genus ABS, Genus Asia and Research & Development. These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its segmental 
information. The principal activities of each segment are as follows:
Genus PIC – our global porcine sales business excluding Asia
Genus ABS – our global bovine sales business excluding Asia
Genus Asia – our porcine and bovine business in Asia
Research and Development – our global spend on research and development

During the year, a gain of £43.9m arose as a result of changing the index used for pensions and deferred pension increases in the Milk 
Pension Fund from RPI to CPI, and a £0.3m settlement gain arose from members leaving the same scheme. See note 27.
Litigation
Litigation includes legal fees of £5.4m (2015: £2.8m) related to the action by ABS Global, Inc. (‘ABS’) against Inguran, LLC (aka Sexing 
Technologies (‘ST’)) and £1.5m (US$2m) for up-front damages related to patent infringement and confidential information.
On 14 July 2014, ABS, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, launched a legal action against ST, in the US District Court for the 
Western District of Wisconsin alleging, among other matters, that ST: (i) has a monopoly in the processing of sexed bovine semen in 
the US; and (ii) unlawfully maintains this monopoly through anticompetitive contractual provisions and the repeated acquisition of 
exclusive patent rights related to semen processing. The legal action aimed to remove these barriers and allow free and fair competition 
in the sexed bovine semen processing market (‘ABS Action’). On the same date, ABS also filed an Inter-Partes Review application 
(‘IPR’) challenging the validity of one of ST’s group patents, US Patent No. 7,195,920 (the ‘’920 patent’) before the US Patent Office. 
Subsequently, ABS also filed IPRs challenging the validity of ST’s group patents US Patent No. 7,820,425 (the ‘’425 patent’), US Patent 
No. 8,206,987 (the ‘’987 patent’) and US Patent No. 8,198,092 (the ‘’092 patent’).
ST and its subsidiary XY Inc. filed an Answer and Counterclaim to the ABS Action, denying any anticompetitive activities, and alleging, 
among other matters that: (i) ABS fraudulently induced ST to enter into the parties’ semen sorting agreement; (ii) that the Company and 
ABS repudiated and breached the agreement; and (iii) that the Company and ABS have infringed the ’920, ’425, ’987 and ’092 patents. 
On 29 April 2015, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (‘PTAB’) ruled that ABS had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing 
on its assertion that relevant claims of the ’987 patent were invalid and declined to order the institution of a trial. On 11 January and 
15 April 2016, the PTAB ruled that the ’920 and ’425 patents were unpatentable. ST has appealed these decisions. The parties await 
a decision of the PTAB on whether a hearing will be instituted on the validity of the ’092 patent. 
On 21 July 2016, the Court issued its Summary Judgment decision which, among other things, confirmed that ST’s fraudulent 
inducement claim failed as a matter of law.
On 1 August 2016, the litigation commenced in the US District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. On 10 August 2016, the jury 
determined that the Company and ABS had proved that ST had wilfully maintained monopoly power in the market for sexed bovine 
semen processing in the US since July 2012, but had not proved that they had suffered injury to date as a result. On 11 August 2016, 
the jury also determined that (i) ST’s ’987 and ’092 patents were valid and infringed and (ii) that ABS had materially breached the 
confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties. On 12 August 2016, the jury determined 
that (i) the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per straw on 
commercialisation of the Genus Sexed Semen technology for the use of ST’s ’987 patent; (ii) the Company and ABS should pay ST 
an up-front payment of US$500,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of ST’s ’092 patent; and (iii) ABS had 
materially breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties and damages 
were determined to be US$750,000.
In response to the verdicts reached the Company and ABS has sought an injunction from the Court to allow, among other things, ABS 
to terminate the 2012 semen sorting agreement and to provide relief from the restrictive provisions under that agreement. The parties 
have also commenced the Court briefing on post-trial motions. The Company and ABS has sought, among other things, judgment as a 
matter of law that the ’987 patent is invalid and that the ’092 patent is not infringed, or alternatively a new trial on the patent claims. 
The Group plans to commercialise its sexed semen technology in the US and globally and introduce competition into the market.
Acquisitions and integration
During the year, £0.2m of expenses were incurred in relation to acquisition and integration, principally £0.1m in relation to In Vitro Brasil 
S.A. and £0.1m for St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. See note 36.
Other (including restructuring)
Included within ‘other’ is a £1.4m provision for prior year receivables from Venezuelan customers due to government restrictions 
on foreign exchange and a £0.8m provision for restructuring the European ABS business, partially offset by income of £1.4m from 
an historical insurance reclaim. Genus plc

future tax charges and sets out the tax assets and liabilities held across the Group together with our view on whether or not we expect 
to be able to make use of these in the future.
Accounting policies
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. We recognise tax in the income statement, unless:
• it relates to items we have recognised directly in equity, in which case we recognise it in equity; or
• it arises as a fair value adjustment in a business combination. 
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay (or recover), using the tax 
rates and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments to tax payable in respect 
of previous years.  Genus plc
Annual Report 2016
108
11. Taxation and deferred taxation continued
Deferred tax is tax we expect to pay or recover due to differences between the carrying amounts of our assets and liabilities in our 
Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in calculating our taxable profit. We account for deferred tax using the 
balance sheet liability method. 
We generally recognise deferred tax liabilities for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets to the extent that we will 
probably have taxable profits to utilise deductible temporary differences against. We do not recognise these assets and liabilities if the 
temporary difference arises from:
• our initial recognition of goodwill; or
• our initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects neither our 
taxable profit nor our accounting profit.
We recognise deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences arising on our investments in subsidiaries, and interests in joint 
ventures and associates, except where we can control the reversal of the temporary difference, and it is probable that it will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
We calculate deferred tax at the tax rates we expect to apply in the period when we settle the liability or realise the asset. We charge or 
credit deferred tax in the income statement, except when it relates to items we have charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.

The tax rate for the year depends on our mix of profits by country, particularly the high proportion of profits we generate in North 
America, and our ability to recognise deferred tax assets in respect of losses in some of our smaller territories. Tax is calculated using 
prevailing tax legislation, reliefs, and existing interpretations and practice. However tax laws may change in the future as countries 
reform their tax legislation to implement the OECD’s BEPS recommendations and such future changes could impact the Group’s 
future tax charge and effective tax rate.
The tax credit attributable to exceptional items is £5.4m (2015: charge of £1.6m).

Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities
At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses which were available for offset against future profits, with a potential tax 
benefit of £15.2m (2015: £11.9m). We have recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of £2.5m (2015: £1.5m) of these benefits as we 
expect these losses to be offset against future profits of the relevant jurisdictions in the near term. We have not recognised a deferred 
tax asset in respect of the remaining £12.7m (2015: £10.4m), due to uncertainty about the availability of future taxable profits in the 
relevant jurisdictions.

We have not recognised deferred tax liabilities totalling £4.5m (2015: £3.9m) for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be 
payable on the unremitted earnings of certain overseas subsidiaries. This is because we can control the timing and reversal of these 
differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

UK deferred tax assets and liabilities are stated at 18%. The Government intends to enact a further reduction in the main tax rate down 
to 17% effective from 1 April 2020. As this tax rate was not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the relevant rate reduction 
is not yet reflected in these Financial Statements, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
We estimate that the future rate change to 17% would reduce our UK net deferred tax asset recognised at 30 June 2016 from £4.2m to 
£4.0m. The actual impact will be dependent on our deferred tax position at that time. Genus plc

14. Intangible assets
Our Group Balance Sheet contains significant intangible assets, mainly in relation to goodwill, acquired technology, customer 
relationships and our Genus Sexed Semen (‘GSS’) development project. We recognise that accounting for intangible assets is an area 
which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. See note 4.
Accounting policies
Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed 
to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill
When we acquire a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the goodwill arising is the excess of the acquisition cost (‘CGUs’), excluding 
transaction costs, over our interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. 
Identifiable assets include intangible assets which could be sold separately or which arise from legal rights, regardless of whether 
those rights are separable.
We state goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. We allocate goodwill to cash-generating units, which are the 
smallest identifiable Group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets 
or Groups of assets. We do not amortise goodwill but we do test it annually for impairment. 
IAS 21 requires us to treat the following as assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, rather than of the acquiring entity:
• goodwill arising on acquisition of a foreign operation; and
• any fair value adjustments we make on acquisition to the carrying amounts of the acquiree’s assets and liabilities.
We therefore express them in the foreign operation’s functional currency and retranslate them at the balance sheet date.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets that we have acquired in a business combination since 1 April 2005 are identified and recognised separately from 
goodwill, where they meet the definition of an intangible asset and we can reliably measure their fair values. Their cost is their fair value 
at the acquisition date.
After their initial recognition, we report these intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. This is the same basis as for intangible assets acquired separately. 
The estimated useful lives for intangible assets are as follows:
Software     2 to 10 years
Porcine and bovine genetics technology 20 years
Multiplier contracts    15 years 
Customer relationships   10 to 17 years
Patents and licences   term of agreement
Intangible assets acquired separately
We carry intangible assets acquired other than through a business combination at cost less accumulated amortisation and any 
impairment loss. We charge amortisation on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and review the useful life and 
amortisation method at the end of each financial year, accounting for the effect of any changes in estimate on a prospective basis.
Impairment
We review the carrying amounts of our tangible and intangible assets at each balance sheet date, to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any indication exists, we estimate the asset’s recoverable amount. 
For goodwill, and tangible and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, we estimate the recoverable amount at each balance 
sheet date. The recoverable amount is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, we discount 
the estimated future cash flows to their present value, using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.8% (2015: 10.8%), which is derived from 
the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. For some countries we add a premium to this rate, to reflect the risk attributable to that 
country. If the asset does not generate largely independent cash inflows, we determine the recoverable amount for the CGU that 
the asset belongs to.
We recognise an impairment loss in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its 
recoverable amount. 
When we recognise an impairment loss in respect of a CGU, we first allocate it to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated 
to CGUs, and then apply any remaining loss to reduce the carrying amount of the unit’s other assets on a pro rata basis.
Reversals of impairment
We reverse an impairment loss in respect of assets other than goodwill when the impairment loss may no longer exist and we have 
changed the estimates we used to determine the recoverable amount.
We only reverse an impairment loss to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount it would have 
had, net of depreciation or amortisation, if we had not recognised the impairment loss.

to GSS.
During the year, we acquired a worldwide licence to use Caribou Biosciences, Inc.’s leading CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology platform.
Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill
To test impairment, we allocate goodwill to our operating segments. These are the lowest level within the Group at which we monitor 
goodwill for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each operating segment are as follows:
2016 
£m 
2015 
£m 
Genus PIC 56.7 49.2
Genus ABS 21.9 17.2
Genus Asia 7.4 7.5
86.0 73.9
We test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. We determine the 
recoverable amount of our CGUs by using value in use calculations. The key assumptions for these calculations relate to discount rates, 
growth rates, expected changes to selling prices, direct costs and the cost saving derived from the GSS project.
We have estimated the pre-tax discount rate using the Group’s weighted average cost of capital (‘WACC’). We risk adjusted the discount 
rate for risks specific to each market, adding between nil and 16% to the WACC as appropriate. The post-tax WACC of 8.0% (2015: 8.0%) 
we applied to our cash flow projections equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10.8% (2015: 10.8%). Our estimates of changes in 
selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and our expectations of future changes in the market. Genus plc
Annual Report 2016
114
14. Intangible assets continued
The annual impairment test is performed immediately before year end and is based on cash flows derived from our most recent 
financial and strategic plans approved by management and extrapolate cash flows beyond this period using estimated growth rates. 
Short-term profitability and growth rates are based on past experience, current trading conditions and our expectations of future 
changes in the market.
We have applied annual growth rates to cash flows in the five-year financial and strategic planning period. A growth rate of 2.5% 
(2015: 2.5%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond this period. 
Genus PIC and Genus ABS CGUs are deemed to be significant. The individual country assumptions used to determine value in use for 
these CGUs are:
Risk adjusted discount rate Short-term growth rates (CAGR) Long-term growth rates
2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015
Genus PIC 8–23% 11–26% 6–12% 1–14% 2.5% 2.5%
Genus ABS 8–19% 11–26% 1–15% 3–19% 2.5% 2.5%
The rates towards the higher end of the range above represent those which are applied to our smaller entities and those in emerging 
markets and hence appear high relative to others.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on all of the key assumptions noted above and we believe that no reasonable potential change 
in any of them would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount. 
15. Biological assets
The Group applies quantitative genetics and biotechnology to animal breeding. We use these techniques to identify and select animals 
with the genes responsible for superior milk and meat, high health and performance traits. We sell breeding animals and semen to 
customers, who use them to produce offspring which yield greater production efficiency, milk and meat quality, for the global dairy 
and meat supply chain. We recognise that accounting for biological assets is an area which includes critical accounting judgements 
and key sources of estimation uncertainty. See note 4.
Accounting policies
Biological assets and inventories
In bovine, we use research and development to identify genetically superior bulls in a number of breeds, primarily the Holstein dairy 
breed. Each selected bull has its performance measured against its peers, by using genomic evaluations and progeny testing of its 
daughters’ performance. We collect and freeze semen from the best bulls, to satisfy our customers’ demand. Farmers use semen from 
dairy breeds to breed replacement milking stock. They use the semen we sell from beef breeds in either specialist beef breeding herds, 
for multiplying breeding bulls for use in natural service, or on dairy cows to produce animals to be reared for meat.
We hold our bovine biological assets for long-term internal use and classify them as non-current assets. We transfer bull semen to 
inventory at its fair value at the point of harvest, which becomes its deemed cost under IAS 2. We state our inventories at the lower 
of this deemed cost and net realisable value.
Sorting semen is a production process rather than a biological process. As a result, we transfer semen inventory into sexed semen 
production at its fair value at the point of harvest, less the cost to sell, and it becomes a component of the production process.  
We carry sexed semen in finished goods at production cost. 
In porcine, we maintain and develop a central breeding stock (the ‘nucleus herd’), to provide genetically superior animals. These genetics 
help make farmers and food processors more profitable, by increasing their output of consistently high-quality products, which yield 
higher value. So we can capitalise on our intellectual property, we outsource the vast majority of our pig production to our global multiplier 
network. We also sell the offspring or semen we obtain from animals in the nucleus herd to customers for use in commercial farming. 
Pig sales generally occur in one of two ways: ‘upfront’ and ‘royalty’. Under upfront sales, we receive the full fair value of the animal at the 
point we transfer it to the customer. Under royalty sales, the pig is regarded as comprising two separately identifiable components: its 
carcass and its genetic potential. We receive the initial consideration, which is approximately the animal’s carcass value, at the point we 
transfer the pig to the customer. We retain our interest in the pig’s genetic potential and receive royalties for the customer’s use of this 
genetic potential. 
The breeding animal biological assets we own, and our retained interest in the biological assets we have sold under royalty contracts, 
are recognised and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date. We recognise changes in fair value in the income statement, 
within operating profit for the period. 
We classify the porcine biological assets we are using as breeding animals, as non-current assets and carry them at fair value. The 
porcine biological assets we are holding for resale, which are the offspring of the breeding herd, are carried at fair value and classified 
as current assets. We split our retained interest in the genetics from royalty sales between current and non-current assets, based on 
the remaining expected life of the animals.

Determination of fair values – biological assets
IAS 41 ‘Agriculture’ requires us to show the carrying value of biological assets in the Group Balance Sheet. We determine this carrying 
value according to IAS 41’s provisions and show the net valuation movement in the income statement. There are important differences 
in how we value our bovine and porcine assets, as explained below.
Bovine – we base the fair value of proven bulls, bulls with a genomic evaluation and bulls on test, on the net cash flows we expect to 
receive from selling their semen, discounted at a current market-determined pre-tax rate. Proven bulls are those we have evaluated 
through daughter proofs and whose semen we actively market. Genomic bulls are those we market on their estimated genetic value. 
We adjust the fair value of the bovine herd and semen inventory we manage where a third party has a share in semen sales from 
a particular bull. The significant assumptions determining the fair values are the expected future demand for semen, estimated 
production value, each bull’s expected marketable life and, for bulls on test, the percentage whose production we expect to actively 
market. In assessing the sales price, we use independent statistical data for the bulls. This data is produced three times a year in 
all our major markets. In addition, we estimate which markets we will sell the semen in, as well as domestic and export prices.  
Bulls that have not yet entered our testing programme have a fair value equivalent to their acquisition and rearing costs. 
Porcine – the fair value of porcine biological assets includes the animals we own entirely and our retained interest in the genetics of animals 
we have sold under royalty arrangements. The fair value of animals we own is calculated using the animals’ average live weights, plus a 
premium where we believe that their genetics make them saleable. We base the live weight value and the genetic premium on recent 
transaction prices we have achieved. The significant assumptions in determining fair values are the breeding animals’ expected life, the 
percentage of production animals that are saleable as breeding animals, and the expected sales prices. For our retained interest in the 
genetics of animals sold under royalty contracts, we base the initial fair value on the fair values we achieved in recent direct sales of similar 
animals, less the amount we received upfront for the carcass element. We then remeasure the fair value of our retained interest at each 
reporting date. The significant assumption in determining the fair value of the retained interest is the animals’ expected life.
We value the pigs in our pure line herds, which are the repository of our proprietary genetics, as a single unit of account. We do this 
using a discounted cash flow model, applied to the herds’ future outputs at current prices. The significant assumptions we make are the 
number of future generations attributable to the current herds, the fair value prices we achieve on sales, the animals’ expected useful 
lifespan and productivity, and the discount rate.
Non-recognition of porcine multiplier contracts where no contractual interest is retained by the Group
To manage commercial risk, a very large part of our porcine business model involves selling pigs to farmers (‘multipliers’) who produce 
piglets on farms we neither manage nor control. We have the option, but not the obligation, to buy the offspring at slaughter market 
value plus a premium. Because the offspring have superior genetics, we can then sell them to other farmers at a premium.
We do not recognise the right to purchase offspring on the balance sheet, as we enter into the contracts and continue to hold them for the 
purpose of receiving non-financial items (the offspring), in accordance with our expected purchase requirements. This means the option is 
outside the scope of IAS 39. We do not recognise the offspring as biological assets under IAS 41, as we do not own or control them.

15. Biological assets continued
Bovine biological assets include £7.8m (2015: £6.0m) representing the fair value of bulls owned by third parties but managed by the 
Group, net of expected future payments to such third parties and are therefore treated as assets held under finance leases.
There are no movements in the carrying value of the bovine biological assets in respect of sales or other changes during the year.
The current market-determined post-tax rate used to discount expected future net cash flows from the sale of bull semen is the Group’s 
weighted average cost of capital. This has been assessed as 8.0% (2015: 8.0%).
Decreases due to harvest represent the semen extracted from the biological assets. Inventories of such semen are shown as biological 
asset harvest in note 19.
Included in increases due to purchases is the aggregate increase arising during the period on initial recognition of biological assets in 
respect of multiplier purchases, other than parent gilts, of £49.4m (2015: £43.3m).
Decreases attributable to sales during the period of £152.0m (2015: £166.3m) include £49.6m (2015: £37.0m) in respect of the reduction 
in fair value of the retained interest in the genetics of animals, other than parent gilts, transferred under royalty contracts.
Porcine biological assets include £69.3m (2015: £65.2m) relating to the fair value of the retained interest in the genetics in respect of 
animals, other than parent gilts, to customers under royalty contracts.
Total revenue in the period, including parent gilts, includes £127.2m (2015: £114.5m) in respect of these contracts, comprising £38.1m 
(2015: £37.4m) on initial transfer of animals to customers and £89.1m (2015: £77.1m) in respect of royalties received.
For pure line porcine herds, the net cash flows from the expected output of the herds are discounted at the Group’s required rate of 
return, adjusted for the greater risk implicit in including output from future generations. This adjusted rate has been assessed as 11.0% 
(2015: 11.0%). The number of future generations which have been taken into account is seven (2015: seven) and their estimated useful 
lifespan is 1.3 years (2015: 1.3 years).

16. Property, plant and equipment 
We make significant investments in our property, plant and equipment. All assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Accounting policies
We state property, plant and equipment at cost, together with any directly attributable expenses of acquisition, or at their latest 
valuation, less depreciation and any impairment losses. Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, we account for them separately.
We charge depreciation to the income statement on a straight-line basis, over the estimated useful lives of each part of an asset. 
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
• Freehold buildings  10 to 40 years
• Leasehold buildings   over the term of the lease
• Plant and equipment  3 to 20 years
• Motor vehicles   3 to 5 years
We do not depreciate land and assets not available for use. Genus plc

17. Equity accounted investees
We hold interests in several joint ventures and associates where we have significant influence.
Accounting policies
Joint ventures are entities over whose activities we have joint control, under a contractual agreement. The Group Financial Statements 
include the Group’s share of profit or loss arising from joint ventures.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. The Group 
Financial Statements include the Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted 
basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date it ceases. When our share of losses exceeds our interest in an 
associate, we reduce the carrying amount to nil and stop recognising further losses, except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations or made payments on an associate’s behalf.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures or associates are initially recognised in the Group Balance sheet at cost and 
adjusted thereafter to recognised the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the joint ventures and 
associates. Related party transactions with the Group’s joint ventures and associates primarily comprise product and services. As 
each arrangement is a separate legal entity and control rights are substantially equal with the other parties, there are no significant 
judgements required to be made.

18. Other investments
We hold a number of unlisted investments, mainly comprising our strategic investment in Caribou Biosciences, Inc.
Accounting policy
Available for sale (‘AFS’) financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated as AFS or are not classified as: (a) loans and 
receivables; (b) held-to-maturity; or (c) financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss.
AFS equity investments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured 
are measured at cost less any identified impairment losses at the end of each reporting period.

19. Inventories
Our inventory primarily consists of bovine semen, raw materials and ancillary products.
Accounting policies
Inventory (excluding biological assets) is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the basis of weighted 
average costs and comprises direct materials and, where appropriate, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred 
in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

Trade receivables
The average credit period our customers take on the sales of goods is 61 days (2015: 59 days). We do not charge interest on receivables 
for the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. We provide for all receivables based upon knowledge of the customer and historical 
experience, and estimate irrecoverable amounts by reference to past default experience.
No customer represents more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables (2015: nil).
At 30 June 2016, £50.5m (2015: £45.0m) of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance, net of provision are debtors with a carrying amount of £14.7m (2015: £19.6m) which 
are past due at the reporting date but which we have not provided for, as there has been no significant change in credit quality and we 
consider the amounts are recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables 
is 48 days (2015: 45 days).

Receivables denominated in currencies other than Sterling comprise £29.5m denominated in US Dollars (2015: £21.5m), £11.3m

21. Cash and cash equivalents
We hold cash and bank deposits which have a maturity of three months or less, to enable us to meet our short-term 
liquidity requirements.
Accounting policies
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of our 
cash management and are included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings less than one year. We only include them in cash 
and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows.

22. Trade and other payables
Our trade and other payables mainly consist of amounts we owe to our suppliers that have been invoiced or are accrued. They also 
include taxes and social security amounts due in relation to our role as an employer.
Accounting policies
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

are a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
23. Provisions
A provision is a liability recorded in the balance sheet, where uncertainty over the timing or amount that will be paid, and is therefore 
estimated. The main provisions we hold are in relation to legal and restructuring matters.
Accounting policies
We recognise a provision in the balance sheet when an event results in the Group having a current legal or constructive obligation, and 
it is probable that we will have to settle the obligation through an outflow of economic benefits. If the effect is material, we discount 
provisions to their present value.

Other provisions mainly relate to legal (£0.5m) and restructuring (£0.4m) provisions. The timing and cash flows associated with the 
restructuring costs and a majority of legal claims are expected to be less than one year. However, for some legal claims the timing 
of cash flows may be long-term in nature. The property provision mainly represents the discounted future costs of properties (net of 
expected rental income) not occupied by the Group or sublet. The timing of the cash flow associated with property is dependent upon 
the remaining term of the associated lease.

24. Financial instruments
This note details our treasury management and financial risk management objectives and policies, as well as the exposure and 
sensitivity of the Group to credit, liquidity, interest and foreign exchange rate risk, and the policies in place to monitor and manage 
these risks.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates our access to domestic and international 
financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the Group’s operations, through internal risk reports that 
analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks. These risks include market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk 
and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
We seek to minimise the effects of these risks by hedging them using derivative financial instruments. Our use of financial derivatives 
is governed by policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate 
risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity. The 
Board of Directors regularly reviews our compliance with policies and exposure limits. The Group does not enter into or trade financial 
instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Key financial risks and exposures are monitored through a monthly report to the Board of Directors, together with an annual Board 
review of corporate treasury matters.
Financial risk
The principal financial risks our activities expose us to are risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and 
commodity prices. We use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate, foreign currency risk and 
commodity price risk, including:
• forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the sale of goods and purchase of supplies in 
foreign currencies;
• interest rate swaps, to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
• forward commodity contracts, to hedge commodity price risk.
Accounting policies
Financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that provides a 
residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial 
assets. The accounting policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Put option arrangements over non-controlling interest
The potential cash payments related to put options issued by the Group over the equity of subsidiary companies are accounted for as 
financial liabilities when such options may only be settled by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed 
number of shares in the subsidiary.
The amount that may become payable under the option on exercise is initially recognised at present value within borrowings with 
a corresponding charge directly to equity. The charge to equity is recognised separately as written put options over non-controlling 
interest, adjacent to non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries.
Such options are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, in order to accrete the liability up 
to the amount payable under the option at the date at which it first becomes exercisable; the charge arising is recorded as a financing 
cost. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognised with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet 
date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts and forward commodity contracts are their quoted market price at the balance sheet 
date, which is the present value of the quoted forward price. Genus plc
Annual Report 2016

24. Financial instruments continued
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument in equity, in the hedging reserve. 
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the Group Income Statement.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, we recycle in the Group 
Income Statement the associated gains and losses that we had recognised in equity. We do this in the same period or periods that the 
asset or liability affects the Group Income Statement, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, 
or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and 
we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no longer expect the hedged transaction to 
take place, we immediately recognise in the Group Income Statement the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
Net investment hedges
Where we have designated a derivative financial instrument as hedging the variability of the net assets of an overseas subsidiary, 
which arises from the spot or forward exchange rate translation risk associated with the subsidiary’s functional currency, we recognise 
the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised 
immediately in the Group Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative 
gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to. 
We only apply net investment hedge accounting in the Group Financial Statements. 
Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that Group entities can continue as a going concern, while maximising the return to 
shareholders by optimising our debt and equity balance. The Group’s capital structure consists of debt, which includes the borrowings 
disclosed in note 25, cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Parent, comprising issued capital, 
reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 29. 
Gearing ratio
The Group keeps its capital structure under review. The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. The gearing 
ratio at the year end was as follows:
2016 
£m
2015 
£m
Debt (see note 25) 123.7 93.1
Cash and cash equivalents (see note 21) (34.0) (21.3)
Net debt (see note 30) 89.7 71.8
Equity 368.1 305.1
Net debt to equity ratio 24% 24%
Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 25.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Parent.
Categorises of financial instruments
We have categorised financial instruments held at valuation into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs 
to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 13. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure fair 
value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, we base the category level on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the 
fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety. We have estimated the fair values of the Group’s outstanding interest rate 
swaps by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value 
measurements as defined by IFRS 13. We have not categorised any financial instruments as Level 1 or Level 3.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group is mainly exposed to movement in the US Dollar, Euro, Brazilian Real and Mexican Peso exchange rates.
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against these currencies. 10% is the 
sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents our assessment of a 
significant change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary 
items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. It includes external loans, as well as 
loans to foreign operations within the Group where the loan is denominated in a currency other than the lender or borrower’s currency. 
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit when Sterling weakens against the relevant currency. A strengthening of Sterling 
against the relevant currency would produce an equal but opposite reduction in profit, and the balances below would be negative. 
The impact on other equity is minimal, due to the net investment hedging in place.

Interest rate risk management
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as Group entities borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. We manage this 
risk centrally, by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, using interest rate swaps. We regularly 
review our hedging activities, to align with our interest rate views and defined risk appetite, thereby ensuring we apply optimal 
hedging strategies to minimise the adverse impact of fluctuations in interest expense through different interest rate cycles. 
The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section 
of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
We have determined the sensitivity analyses below, based on the Group’s exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-
derivative instruments, at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, we prepared the analysis assuming the liability outstanding 
at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk 
internally to key management personnel and is our assessment of a significant change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 30 June 
2016 would decrease or increase by £0.5m (2015: decrease/increase by £0.5m). This impact is smaller than would otherwise be the case, 
due to the effects of fixed rate hedging.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts, 
calculated on agreed notional principal amounts. These contracts enable us to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash 
flow exposures on the variable rate debt we hold. We determine the fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date by discounting 
the future cash flows, using the yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract. This fair value is disclosed 
below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly basis. The corresponding floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 3 month LIBOR. 
We settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Interest rate swap contracts that exchange floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges, to reduce our cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swaps and the interest 
payments on the loan occur simultaneously and we recognise the amount deferred in equity in profit or loss, over the period that the 
floating rate interest payments on debt affect profit or loss.
Commodity hedges

and winter wheat commodity futures.

Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the Group. We have a 
policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties. We regularly monitor our exposure and the credit ratings of our counterparties, 
and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties. Credit exposure on financial 
instruments is controlled by counterparty limits that the Board reviews and approves annually. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. We carry out ongoing 
credit evaluation of the financial condition of accounts receivable.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for managing liquidity risk rests with the Board of Directors. We manage this risk by maintaining adequate 
reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles 
of financial assets and liabilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables
The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade payables 
and other creditors. We have drawn up the table based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, using the earliest date 
on which we can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. Genus plc

As part of its interest rate strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge floating LIBOR rates. As a result, 
bank loan and overdrafts include borrowings of US$110m (£82.3m) fixed at 1.10%, excluding applicable bank margin.
Also included in the above is an unsecured agricultural development loan in the US of £0.1m (2015: £0.1m), which is interest free.
26. Finance lease liabilities
A finance lease is a commitment to make a payment in the future in relation primarily to plant and machinery and motor vehicles.
Accounting policies
We classify leases as finance leases whenever the lease terms transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to us. 
All other leases are operating leases.
We recognise the assets we hold under finance leases at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments, each of which we determine at the start of the lease. We include our corresponding liability in the balance sheet, as a finance 
lease obligation. 
We apportion lease payments between finance charges and a reduction in our lease obligation, so we achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining liability. We recognise finance charges directly in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable 
to qualifying assets, in which case we capitalise them in accordance with our general policy on borrowing costs.

value of the leases is approximately equal to the carrying amount. Genus plc

27. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes covering many of its employees. The 
principal funds are the Milk Pension Fund and Dalgety Pension Fund in the UK, which are defined benefit schemes. The assets of these 
funds are held separately from the assets of the Group and are administered by trustees and managed professionally. We recognise that 
accounting for retirement benefit obligations is an area which includes critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty. See note 4.
Accounting policies
Defined contribution pension schemes
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to the income statement 
as they become payable under the scheme rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amount we have 
paid as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for some of its employees. These schemes are closed to new members and to 
further accrual. We calculate our net obligation separately for each scheme, by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees 
have earned, in return for their service to date. We discount that benefit to determine its present value, and deduct the fair value of 
the plan’s assets (at bid price). The liability discount rate we use is the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate 
bonds, with terms to maturity approximating our pension liabilities. Qualified actuaries perform the calculations, using the projected 
unit method. 
We recognise actuarial gains and losses in equity in the period in which they occur, through the Group Statement of Comprehensive 
Income. Actuarial gains and losses include the difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets, and experience 
gains and losses on scheme liabilities.
The retirement benefit obligations include those relating to the Milk Pension Fund defined benefit scheme. Genus and the other 
participating employers are jointly and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. We account for our section of the scheme 
and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, and provide for any amounts we believe we will have to pay under our joint and 
several liability. The joint and several liability also means we have a contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that we have not 
accounted for. 
Under the joint and several liability, we initially recognise any changes in our share of orphan assets and liabilities in the income 
statement. After this initial recognition, any actuarial gains and losses in the orphan assets and liabilities are recognised directly into 
equity through the Group Statement of Changes in Equity, in the period in which they occur.
Retirement benefit obligations
The financial position of the defined benefit schemes as recorded in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, are aggregated for disclosure 
purposes. The liability split by principal scheme is set out below.

Overall net pension liability 44.5 63.1
Overall, we expect to pay £7.1m (2016: £6.7m) in contributions to defined benefit plans in the 2017 financial year.
The defined benefit plans are administered by trustee boards that are legally separated from the Group. The trustee board of each 
pension fund consists of representatives who are employees, former employees or are independent from the Company. The boards of 
the pension funds are required by law to act in the best interest of the plan participants and are responsible for setting certain policies, 
such as investment and contribution policies, and the governance of the fund.
The defined benefit pension schemes exposes the Group to actuarial risks such as longer than expected longevity of members, lower 
than expected return on investments and higher than expected inflation, which may increase the liabilities or reduce the value of assets 
of the plans.
The UK pensions environment is regulated by The Pensions Regulator whose statutory objectives are set out in legislation and 
include promoting and improving understanding of the good administration of work-based pensions, protecting member benefits 
and regulating occupational defined benefit and contribution schemes. The Pensions Regulator is a non-departmental public body 
established under the Pensions Act 2004 and sponsored by the Department for Work and Pensions, operating within a legal regulatory 
framework set by the UK Parliament. The Pensions Regulator’s statutory objectives and regulatory powers are described on its website 
at thepensionsregulator.gov.uk.

27. Retirement benefit obligations continued
All defined benefit schemes are UK registered as an occupational pension plan with HMRC and are subject to UK legislation and oversight 
from The Pensions Regulator. UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently and that valuations are undertaken at 
least every three years. Separate valuations are required for each scheme. Within 15 months of each valuation date, the plan trustees 
and the Group must agree any contributions required to ensure that the plan is fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure.
Funding plans are individually agreed for each Group’s defined benefits pension scheme with the respective trustees, taking into account 
local regulatory requirements.
The publication by the International Accounting Standards Board in June 2015 of its Exposure Draft of amendments to IFRIC 14, ‘IAS 19 
– The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction’, has provided additional clarity on the role 
of trustees’ rights in an assessment of the recoverability of a surplus in an employee pension fund. The trustees of the defined benefits 
schemes have neither a unilateral right to wind up the plan and purchase annuities nor a unilateral right to improve members’ benefits 
and consequently the Exposure Draft as currently proposed is not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s results.
The Milk Pension Fund (‘MPF’)
The MPF was previously operated by the Milk Marketing Board and was also open to staff working for Milk Marque Ltd (the principal 
employer, now known as Community Foods Group Limited), National Milk Records plc, First Milk Ltd, hauliers associated to First Milk Ltd, 
Dairy Farmers of Britain Ltd (which went into receivership in June 2009) and Milk Link Ltd.
We have accounted for our section of the scheme and our share of any orphan assets and liabilities, which together represent 
approximately 75% of the MPF (2015: 75%). Although the MPF is managed on a sectionalised basis, it is a ‘last man standing scheme’, 
which means that all participating employers are jointly and severally liable for all of the fund’s liabilities. With effect from 30 June 2013, 
Genus’s remaining active members ceased accruing benefits in the fund and became deferred pensioners.
On 11 January 2016, The trustees of the MPF agreed with a request from the employers to change the index used for pension and 
deferred pension increases from RPI to CPI. The members of the scheme were informed of this change on 17 February which is effective 
for increases starting in 2016. As a result of the change, Genus recorded a gain of £43.9m.
The most recent actuarial triennial valuation of the MPF was at 31 March 2015 and was carried out by professionally qualified actuaries. 
The valuation has been agreed by the trustees and is currently being reviewed by The Pensions Regulator before final sign off.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that:
• investment returns on existing assets would exceed fixed interest gilt yields by 1.1% per annum;
• CPI price inflation is expected to be 0.9% per annum lower than RPI price inflation; and
• pensions in payment and pensions in deferment would increase in future in line with CPI price inflation, subject to various minimum 
and maximum increases.
At 31 March 2015, the market value of the fund’s assets was £403m. This represented approximately 87% of the value of the uninsured 
liabilities which were £465m at 31 March 2015.
The deficit in the fund as a whole, by reference to the 31 March 2015 valuation, was £62m (of which Genus’s notional share was £47m). 
This shortfall is being addressed by additional contributions from the participating employers. Under the trustee prepared schedule of 
contributions, Genus will be required to make deficit repair contributions of £5.6m per annum commencing 31 March 2016, and rising 
thereafter by 3.4% per annum until 31 August 2022, in addition to funding operating expenses of the scheme. Genus has assessed its 
additional pension liability under IFRIC 14 by reference to this schedule of contributions, resulting in an amount of £14.9m (2015: £nil) 
being recognised in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Dalgety Pension Fund (‘DPF’)
The most recent actuarial valuation of the DPF was at 31 March 2015 and carried out by professionally qualified actuaries. 
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted in the 2015 valuation were that investment returns on existing assets would be 4.1% per 
annum before retirement and 2.2% per annum after retirement and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would be 3.3% 
per annum. 
The market value of the available assets at 31 March 2015 was £31.6m. The value of those assets represents approximately 101% of 
the value of the uninsured liabilities, which were £31.3m at 31 March 2015. Under the funding agreement, the Company will not have 
to make deficit repair contributions.
The disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by an independent actuary based on accurate calculations carried out as 
at 31 March 2015 and updated to 30 June 2016. 
There is a £15.5m reserve held by the trustees of DPF against future unknown liabilities materialising. As the economic benefit to Genus 
of this amount is not certain, it is treated as a contingent asset.
In addition to the aggregate asset and liabilities disclosed, a bulk annuity policy was secured with an insurance company in July 1999, 
which matched the benefit entitlement of the almost all of the fund’s current and deferred pension liabilities at that time. During the 
year, an additional bulk annuity policy was purchased by the scheme for £3.9m. The value of these policies and related liabilities at 
30 June 2016 were £703m (2015: £694m).  Genus plc

Other defined benefit scheme in deficit
The Group operates a closed defined benefit scheme for a small number of former employees of the National Pig Development 
Company Limited. The total market value of scheme assets and liabilities at 30 June 2016, under the provisions of IAS 19 were 
£5.2m (2015: £5.0m) and £6.5m (2015: £6.0m), respectively. 
Other unfunded schemes
When the Group acquired Sygen International plc, it also acquired three unfunded defined benefit schemes and an unfunded retirement 
health benefit plan, which it now operates for the benefit of the previous Group’s senior employees and executives. 
The scheme liabilities for the three unfunded defined benefit schemes amount to £8.0m (2015: £6.7m), based on IAS 19’s methods 
and assumptions. This amount is included within pension liabilities in the Group Balance Sheet. Interest on pension scheme liabilities 
amounted to £0.2m (2015: £0.2m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.8% (2015: 3.8%) and that 
inflation and pension payment increases would be 2.7% per annum (2015: 3.1%).
The scheme liabilities for the unfunded retirement health benefit plan amounted to £0.9m (2015: £1.1m), based on IAS 19’s methods 
and assumptions. This amount is included within retirement benefit obligations in the Group Balance Sheet. Interest on plan liabilities 
amounted to £0.1m (2015: £0.1m).
The principal assumptions used to calculate the plan liabilities were that the discount rate would be 2.8% (2015: 3.8%) and that the long-
term rate of medical expense inflation would be 6.7% (2015: 7.1%).

Actuarial assumptions and sensitivity analysis
Principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date (expressed as weighted averages):
2016 2015
Discount rate 2.8% 3.8%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) 1.6% 2.0%
Retail Price Index (RPI) 2.7% 3.1%
The mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the schemes’ actuaries and reflect the latest available 
tables, adjusted for the experience of the scheme where appropriate. For 2016, the mortality tables used are 97% of the SN2A tables, 
with birth year and 2014 CMI projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% for males and females (2015: the 
mortality tables used are 90% of the SN1A tables, with birth year and 2011 CMI projections, subject to a long-term rate of improvement 
of 1.25% for males and females).
The following table shows the assumptions used for all schemes and illustrates the life expectancy of an average member retiring at age 
65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 in 20 years’ time.
2016 
Years
2015 
Years
Retiring at balance sheet date at age 65 Male 22.9 23.4
Female 25.1 25.9
Retiring at age 65 in 20 years’ time Male 24.6 25.2
Female 26.9 27.8
Duration of benefit obligations
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 30 June 2016 was 17.5 years (2015: 17.5 years).
Sensitivity analysis
Measurement of the Group’s defined benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions. The sensitivity analysis below 
shows how a reasonably possible increase or decrease in a particular assumption would, in isolation, result in an increase or decrease 
in the present value of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2016.

The sensitivity analysis may not be representative of an actual change in the defined benefit obligation, as it is unlikely that changes 
in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another.
The sensitivities assume the fund’s assets remain unchanged. However, in practice changes in interest rates and inflation will also affect 
the value of the fund’s assets. The fund’s investment strategy aims to hold matching assets which should move broadly in line with the 
liabilities of the funds so as to protect partially against changes in interest rates and inflation.
This sensitivity analysis has been prepared using the same method as adopted when adjusting results of the latest funding valuation 
to the balance sheet date. This is the same approach adopted in previous periods.

28. Share-based payments
We have a number of share plans used to award shares to Directors and senior management as part of their remuneration. A charge 
is recognised over the vesting period in the consolidated income statement to record the cost of these, based on the fair value of the 
award on the date of grant. 
Accounting policies
We recognise the fair value of share awards and options granted as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity. 
We measure the fair value at the grant date and spread it over the vesting period of each option. We use a binomial valuation model to 
measure the fair value of options, and a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure the fair value of share awards. We adjust the amount 
we recognise as an expense, to reflect the estimated performance against non-market related conditions and the number of share 
awards and options that actually vest at the end of the vesting period.
The Group recognised a total share-based payment expense of £3.8m (2015: £1.4m), including National Insurance contributions 
of £0.4m (2015: £nil).
Share awards
There are 1,122,448 conditional share awards outstanding at 30 June 2016. These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors 
and senior management under the 2004 Performance Share Plan on 10 September 2010, 7 December 2012, 26 September 2013 and 14 
March 2014, and under the new 2014 Performance Share Plan on 20 November 2014 and 14 September 2015. In accordance with the plans’ 
terms, participants have received a conditional annual award of shares or nil cost option awards which will normally vest after three years, 
with the proportion of the award vesting depending on growth in the Group’s adjusted earnings per share. Further details of the plan’s 
performance conditions are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In the year ended 30 June 2016, awards were granted on 14 September 2015, with an aggregate fair value of £5,316,000. The fair value of 
services received in return for share awards granted is based on the fair value of share awards granted, measured using a Black-Scholes 
valuation model. At the date of grant, the fair value of a share awarded was £13.14, based on an expected dividend yield of 1.33%.

restricted stock share awards were granted to senior management in connection with recruitment. In accordance with the awards’ 
terms, participants have received a conditional annual bonus award of shares or nil cost option awards, which will normally vest 
between one and three years, providing the participant is employed by the Group at that time.
In the year ended 30 June 2016, 39,775 bonus share awards were granted on 14 September 2015, with an aggregate fair value of 
£539,000, and 5,351 restricted stock share awards were granted in total on 18 December 2015 and 22 December 2015, with an

29. Capital and reserves
Called up share capital is the number of shares in issue at their par value. A number of shares were issued in the year in relation to 
employee share schemes.
Accounting policies
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the amounts of the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.
Own shares
We include the transactions, assets and liabilities of the Group-sponsored Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust (‘QUEST’) in the 
Group Financial Statements. In particular, the trust’s purchases of the Company’s shares are deducted from shareholders’ funds until 
they vest unconditionally with employees.

32. Capital commitments
At 30 June 2016, outstanding contracted capital expenditure amounted to £0.7m (2015: £0.8m). 
33. Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are potential future cash outflows, where the likelihood of payments is considered more than remote but is not 
considered probable or cannot be measured reliably.
The retirement benefit obligations referred to in note 27 include obligations relating to the Milk Pension Fund defined benefit scheme. 
Genus, together with other participating employers, is joint and severally liable for the scheme’s obligations. Genus has accounted for its 
section and its share of any orphan assets and liabilities, collectively representing approximately 75% of the MPF. As a result of the joint 
and several liability, Genus has a contingent liability for the scheme’s obligations that it has not accounted for.

36. Acquisition of subsidiaries
We completed the purchase of St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. during the year.
Accounting policies
Business combinations
We use the purchase method to account for all business combinations. The cost of acquisition is the aggregate of the fair value at 
the date of exchange of assets we give, liabilities we incur or assume, and equity instruments we issue in exchange for control of the 
acquiree. We recognise acquisition related costs in the profit and loss as we incur them. 
We recognise the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, which meet the conditions for recognition under 
IFRS 3, at their fair values at the acquisition date. The exceptions are non-current assets (or disposal Groups) that are classified as held 
for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 ‘Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’, which we recognise and measure 
at fair value less costs to sell. 
Acquisition of interests from non-controlling shareholders
In transactions with non-controlling parties that do not result in a change in control, the difference between the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received and the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted is recognised in equity.
On 31 March 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of St Jacobs Animal Breeding Corp. (St Jacobs), a bovine breeding 
company based in Vermont, US. St Jacobs’ core capabilities are around the ability to identify and source genetics that target the 
Type or show cattle orientated segment of the dairy market.
The amounts recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below.
£m
Intangible assets identified
– Trade name 0.7
Biological assets 1.9
Inventory 0.1
Financial liabilities (1.1)
Total identifiable assets 1.6
Goodwill (note 14) 1.9
Total consideration 3.5
Satisfied by:
Net cash outflow arising on acquisition of subsidiary 3.5
The goodwill of £1.9m arising from the acquisition consists largely of future growth and synergies expected from combining the acquired 
operations with existing Genus operations. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisition and integration related costs included within exceptional items amount to £0.1m.
St Jacobs contributed no revenue and £0.1m profit to the Group for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance 
sheet date.
If the acquisition of St Jacobs had been completed on the first day of the financial period, Group revenues and Group profit would have 
been no increase and £0.7m, respectively.

37. Post balance sheet events
On 1 August 2016, the litigation commenced against Inguran, LLC (aka Sexing Technologies (‘ST’)). See note 7. On 10 August 2016, 
the jury determined that the Company and ABS had proved that ST had wilfully maintained monopoly power in the market for 
sexed bovine semen processing in the US since July 2012, but had not proved that they had suffered injury to date as a result. On 
11 August 2016, the jury also determined that: (i) ST’s ’987 and ’092 patents were valid and infringed; and (ii) that ABS had materially 
breached the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties. On 12 August 2016, the jury 
determined that: (i) the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front payment of US$750,000 and an ongoing royalty of US$1.25 per 
straw on commercialisation of the GSS technology for the use of ST’s ’987 patent; (ii) the Company and ABS should pay ST an up-front 
payment of US$500,000 and ongoing royalty of US$0.50 per straw for the use of ST’s ’092 patent; and (iii) ABS had materially breached 
the confidentiality obligations under the 2012 semen sorting agreement between the parties and damages were determined to 
be US$750,000.
In response to the verdicts reached the Company and ABS has sought an injunction from the Court to allow, among other things, ABS 
to terminate the 2012 semen sorting agreement and to provide relief from the restrictive provisions under that agreement. The parties 
have also commenced the Court briefing on post-trial motions. The Company and ABS has sought, among other things, judgement as 
a matter of law that the ’987 patent is invalid and that the ’092 patent is not infringed, or alternatively a new trial on the patent claims. 
The Group plans to commercialise its sexed semen technology in the US and globally and introduce competition into the market.
On 1 September 2016, we formed De Novo Genetics, a 51% majority-owned Holstein breeding strategic partnership, with De-Su 
Holsteins, LLC, the world’s leading independent Holstein breeder, for an initial and deferred cash consideration of £5.7m (US$7.5m), and 
performance related deferred consideration which will not exceed £1.5m (US$2m). De Novo will further accelerate the proportion of bulls 
Genus produces internally by combining ABS’s and De-Su’s elite Holstein breeding programmes. This will gives us greater control of the 
genetics we need in order to create differentiated solutions that help commercial dairy farmers increase profitability through improved 
herd productivity, health and efficiency.

39. Accounting information and policies
Basis of preparation
The Parent Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101, ‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’ (‘FRS 101’) and the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Act’). FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a 
‘qualifying entity’ as defined in the standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the 
individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements 
of EU-adopted IFRS.
For all periods up to and including the year ended 30 June 2015, the Company prepared its financial statements in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Policies (‘UK GAAP’).
The Company Financial Statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain 
financial assets and financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006. The Financial Statements have been 
prepared on a going concern basis as set out in note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc. The accounting policies 
set out below and stated in the relevant notes have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements. 
These are the first financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with FRS 101. The Company’s date of transition to FRS 
101 is 1 July 2014. The Company has notified its shareholders in writing about the disclosure exemptions used by the Company in these 
Financial Statements, and no objections were received.
FRS 101 sets out amendments to EU-adopted IFRS that are necessary to achieve compliance with the Act and related Regulations. 
Other than a £0.5m reclassification of software assets from tangible fixed assets to intangible fixed assets, this transition is not 
considered to have a material effect on the Financial Statements and therefore no transitional note has been prepared.
The Company will continue to prepare its Financial Statements in accordance with FRS 101 until such time as it notifies shareholders 
of any change to its chosen accounting framework.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, business combinations, financial instruments, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain 
assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards issued not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. 
Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Genus plc.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own income statement in this Annual Report. 
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of Company Financial Statements in conformity with FRS 101 requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of the Company Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the 
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key area of judgement that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review 
for impairment of investment carrying values and valuation of share-based payments.
Significant accounting policies applied in the current reporting period that relate to the Financial Statements as a whole
Taxation
We provide for current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, at the amounts we expect to pay or recover, using the tax rates 
and the laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Pensions
A number of our employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes. We charge contributions to profit and loss as they 
become payable under the schemes’ rules. We show differences between the contributions payable and the amounts actually paid 
as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet. The schemes’ assets are held separately from those of the Company.
Certain former employees of the Company are members of one of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, further details of which 
are given in note 27 of the Group Financial Statements. The schemes are all multi-employer defined benefit schemes, whose assets 
and liabilities are held independently from the Group but within their sponsored Group company. 
Foreign currencies
We record transactions in foreign currencies at the rate ruling at the transaction date or at the contracted rate, if the transaction 
is covered by a forward foreign currency contract. We retranslate monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at the prevailing rate of exchange at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate. All differences are taken 
to the income statement.

 Annual Report 2016

39. Accounting information and policies continued
Own shares
The Company has adopted FRS 101, which requires us to recognise the assets and liabilities associated with the Company’s investment 
in its own shares in the Company’s Financial Statements, where there is de facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Company’s own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust remain deducted from shareholders’ funds until they 
vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes
The Company’s Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards, which 
vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three-year period.
We measure the cost of these awards by reference to the shares’ fair value at the award date. At the end of each financial reporting 
period, we estimate the extent to which the performance criteria will be met at the end of three years, and record an appropriate charge 
in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves. Changes in estimates of the number of 
shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments
We have implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with subsidiary 
undertakings under FRS 101, whereby the Company has granted rights to its shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings under 
an equity-settled arrangement, and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed the Company for these rights. Under this arrangement, the 
Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiary’s Financial Statements as a cost of investment in the subsidiary 
and credits equity with an equal amount. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Our activities expose us primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
We use interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk. We also use forward foreign currency contracts, implemented through a medium-
term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap, to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar 
net assets of subsidiaries. Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial 
Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
Our use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Group’s policies, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The notes 
to the Group Financial Statements include information about the Group’s financial risks and their management, and its use of financial 
instruments and their impact on the Group’s risk profile, performance and financial condition.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the swap at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties. 
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, which is the present value of the 
quoted forward price.
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as hedging the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, we recognise the effective part of any gain or loss on the instrument directly in the hedging reserve. 
We recognise any ineffective portion of the hedge immediately in the profit and loss account.
If we hedge a forecast transaction that subsequently results in our recognising a financial asset or liability, then we reclassify the 
associated gains and losses that we had recognised directly in equity into profit or loss. We do this in the same period or periods that 
the asset or liability affects profit or loss, which are the periods when we recognise the interest income or expense.
If we expect a hedged forecast transaction to occur but the hedging instrument has expired, been sold, terminated or exercised, 
or we have revoked the designation of the hedge relationship, then the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and 
we recognise it in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If we no longer expect the hedged transaction 
to occur, we immediately recognise in the profit and loss account the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or we revoke designation of the hedge relationship, 
the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until we dispose of the investment it relates to.
We treat derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts as separate derivatives, when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with unrealised 
gains and losses reported in the income statement. Genus plc

41. Intangible assets
Accounting policies
Patents, licences and software are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation. The amortisation period is determined 
by reference to expected useful life, which is reviewed at least annually. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the estimated useful life. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic 
benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as 
changes in accounting estimates.

42. Tangible assets
Accounting policies
We state fixed assets at cost, together with any incidental acquisition expenses, or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any 
provision for impairment. We calculate depreciation on a straight-line basis, to write the assets down to their estimated residual values 
over their estimated useful lives. The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows:
Leasehold improvements  period of lease
Equipment   3 to 20 years
We review the carrying value of fixed assets for impairment, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable.

Accounting policies
Shares in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment. 
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, then we estimate the recoverable amount. 
If the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating unit is less than the value of investment, it is considered to be impaired and we 
write it down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.

At the balance sheet date, the amounts owed by Group undertakings were £463.6m (2015: £454.3m). The carrying amount of these 
assets approximates their fair value. There are impaired receivable balances of £nil (2015: £nil). Of the amounts owed by Group 
undertakings, £336.0m (2015: £323.1m) is interest-bearing.
45. Deferred taxation
Accounting policies
We recognise deferred taxation in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, 
where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred 
at the balance sheet date. 
We only recognise deferred taxation assets if we consider it more likely than not that we will have suitable profits from which we can deduct 
the future reversal of the underlying timing differences. Timing differences are differences arising between the Company’s taxable profits 
and its results as stated in the Financial Statements, and which are capable of reversing in one or more subsequent periods.
We only recognise deferred taxation in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that, 
at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable. 
We measure deferred taxation on a non-discounted basis, at the tax rates we expect to apply in the periods in which we expect the 
timing differences to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The movements in deferred taxation are as follows:

14. That subject to and conditional on the passing of resolution 13, the Directors be empowered, pursuant to sections 570 and 573 
of the Act, to allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority conferred 
by resolution 13 or by way of a sale of treasury shares as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided 
that this power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities:
14.1 in connection with an offer of securities (but in the case of the authority granted under paragraph 13.2.2 of resolution 13 
above an offer of such securities by way of rights issue only); and 
14.2 otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph 14.1 above, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £305,498.68 being 3,054,986 
Ordinary Shares representing not more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 5 October 2016 (being the 
latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), 
 and shall expire upon the expiry of the general authority conferred by resolution 13 above, save that the Company may, before such 
expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors 
may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the power had not expired.
 In this resolution, ‘rights issue’ has the same meaning as given in resolution 13.
15. That subject to and conditional on the passing of resolution 13, the Directors be authorised in addition to any authority granted 
under resolution 14 to allot equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the Act) for cash pursuant to the authority 
conferred by resolution 13 or by way of a sale of treasury shares as if section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment 
or sale, provided that this power shall be:
15.1 limited to the allotment of equity securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of £305,498.68 representing not more than 
5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 5 October 2016 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this 
Notice); and
15.2 used only for the purposes of financing (or refinancing, if the authority is to be used within six months after the original 
transaction) a transaction which the Directors of the Company determine to be an acquisition or other capital investment 
of a kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights most recently published by the 
Pre-Emption Group prior to the date of this Notice,
 and shall expire upon the expiry of the general authority conferred by resolution 13 above, save that the Company may, before such 
expiry, make an offer or agreement which would, or might, require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the Directors 
may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such offer or agreement as if the power had not expired. 
16. That the Company be generally and unconditionally authorised to make market purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) 
of the Act) of Ordinary Shares on such terms and in such manner as the Directors think fit provided that: 
16.1 the maximum aggregate number of Ordinary Shares hereby authorised to be purchased is 6,109,973 (representing 10% of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 5 October 2016, being the latest practicable date before publication of 
this Notice); 
16.2 the minimum price, exclusive of any expenses, which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is 10 pence; 
16.3 the maximum price, exclusive of any expenses, which may be paid for an Ordinary Share is an amount equal to the higher of: 
(a) 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for an Ordinary Share, as derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List, for the five business days immediately before the day on which such share is contracted to be purchased; 
and (b) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary Share in 
the Company on the trading venues where the market purchases by the Company pursuant to the authority conferred by this 
resolution 16 will be carried out; and 
16.4 the authority conferred by this resolution shall expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting next 
following or the close of business on the day which is 15 months after the date of its passing (whichever occurs first) unless 
previously renewed, varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting, except that the Company may, before such expiry, 
enter into a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares under the authority hereby conferred prior to the expiry of such 
authority, which will or may be completed by or executed wholly or partly after the expiration of this authority, and may 
purchase its Ordinary Shares in pursuance of any such contract. 
17. That: 
17.1 the current Articles of the Company (‘Current Articles’) be amended by deleting all the provisions formerly in the Company’s 
Memorandum of Association (‘Memorandum’) which, by virtue of section 28 of the Act, are treated as provisions of the 
Company’s Articles; and
17.2 the Articles produced to the meeting and initialled by the Chairman of the meeting for the purpose of identification be 
adopted as the new Articles (the ‘New Articles’) of the Company in substitution for, and to the exclusion of, the Current Articles.
18. That a General Meeting, other than an Annual General Meeting, may be called on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and that such 
authority shall expire on the conclusion of the Company’s Annual General Meeting next following.  Genus plc

The Directors consider that all the resolutions to be considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests of the Company 
and its members as a whole and are therefore likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole. 
The Directors unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of all the proposed resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their 
own beneficial holdings which amount in aggregate to 112,841 shares representing approximately 0.185% of the existing issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company.

Explanatory Notes 
This section contains an explanation of each of the resolutions to be put to the Annual General Meeting. Resolutions 1 to 13 are ordinary 
resolutions requiring the approval of a simple majority of shareholders present (in person or by proxy) and voting at the Annual General 
Meeting. Resolutions 14 to 18 are special resolutions requiring the approval of 75% of shareholders present (in person or by proxy) 
and voting at the Annual General Meeting.
Resolution 1 – To Receive the Annual Report and Accounts 
The Chairman will present the Annual Report and Accounts to the AGM.
Resolution 2 and 3 – Approval of (i) the Directors’ Remuneration Report; and (ii) the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
The Company is required to offer an annual advisory vote on the implementation of the Company’s existing remuneration policy in 
terms of the payments and share awards made to Directors during the year (the ‘Director’s Remuneration Report’) and a separate 
binding vote on the Company’s forward looking remuneration policy (the ‘Directors’ Remuneration Policy’) at least once every three 
years, or earlier if a change is made to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy, or if the advisory vote is not passed by shareholders.
Resolution 2 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Report (other than the part containing the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy) as set out on pages 62 to 64 and 73 to 85 respectively of the Company’s Annual Report 2016. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report gives details of the Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2016. The report also includes details 
of the Remuneration Committee’s representations and activities. The Company’s auditor Deloitte LLP has audited those parts of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report which are required to be audited and their report is issued in the Company’s Annual Report 2016.
Resolution 3 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy given the changes made to it as outlined in the letter 
from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee within the Directors’ Remuneration Report (the ‘Revised Policy’). The Revised Policy 
is contained in pages 65 to 72 of the Company’s Annual Report 2016. The Revised Policy is designed to ensure that reward is aligned with 
the business strategy. The Revised Policy provides greater flexibility to recognise very significant biotechnology and strategic Company 
milestones and the ability to recognise and retain key individuals in order to maximise the Company’s long-term performance and 
shareholder value. 
Subject to such approval, the proposed effective date of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy is 17 November 2016, being the date of the 
Annual General Meeting, and all payments from that date by the Company to the Directors and any former Directors must be made 
in accordance with such policy if approved (unless a payment has been separately approved by a shareholder resolution).
If the Directors’ Remuneration Policy is not approved for any reason, the Company will, if and to the extent permitted by the Act, 
continue to make payments to Directors in accordance with the existing Remuneration Policy. 
Resolution 4 – Final Dividend
Final dividends must be approved by shareholders but must not exceed the amount recommended by Directors. If the meeting 
approves the final dividend it will be paid out in accordance with resolution 4. An interim dividend of 6.7 pence per ordinary share 
was paid on 30 March 2016 to shareholders on the register at 4 March 2016.
Resolutions 5 to 11 – Re-election/Election of Directors
In accordance with provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors of the Company are required to offer themselves for 
annual re-election. This is the first meeting at which Lysanne Gray stands for election. Biographies of all of the current Directors can be 
found on pages 46 and 47 of the Company’s Annual Report 2016. The Board has confirmed, following a performance review, that all 
Directors standing for re-election continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment to their roles. The Board has considered 
whether each of the independent Non-Executive Directors is free from any relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise 
of his or her independent judgement and has determined that each continues to be considered to be independent. 
Mike Buzzacott is retiring from the Board at the end of this year’s Annual General Meeting and is not seeking re-election. The whole of 
the Board would like to thank Mike for his hard work and dedication to the Company over the years.
Resolution 12 – Appointment of Auditor and Auditor’s Remuneration
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are presented, to hold office until the end of 
the next such meeting. Following the conclusion of an external audit tender carried out in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code in the year ended 30 June 2016, this resolution is recommended by the Audit Committee and proposes the reappointment of the 
Company’s existing auditor, Deloitte LLP and gives authority to the Audit Committee to agree the auditor’s remuneration. 
Resolution 13 – Authority to Allot Shares
Resolution 13 is proposed as an ordinary resolution and seeks the approval of shareholders, in accordance with section 551 of the Act, 
to authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares for a period as stated in resolution 13. Resolution 13 provides for two alternatives 
dependant on whether resolution 17 is passed or not. 
The existing Articles limit the number of Ordinary Shares which can be allotted by the Company to a maximum of 14,889,663 (as set out 
in resolution 13.1). If resolution 17 is passed, and the New Articles are adopted by the Company, this limitation will no longer apply. 
In the event that resolution 17 is passed, the Company is, in accordance with institutional guidelines, seeking the authority to allot 
shares representing up to two-thirds of the Company’s issued share capital, provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the 
Company’s issued share capital is only used to allot shares pursuant to a fully pre-emptive rights issue. Genus plc
Annual Report 2016
160
In light of the Investment Association guidelines, the Board considers it appropriate that Directors be granted authority to allot shares 
in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £4,073,315.80 representing two-thirds of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 5 October 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). If the Company wishes to 
allot more than a nominal amount of £2,036,657.90 (representing one-third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital) then any 
additional amount can only be allotted pursuant to a rights issue. 
The Directors have no current intention to exercise this authority (other than in relation to the Company’s employee share schemes) 
and intend to comply with the guidance issued by the Investment Association. However, if the Directors do exercise this authority, 
the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice as regards to its use. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the 
Company in treasury.
Resolutions 14 and 15 – Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights 
Resolutions 14 and 15 are special resolutions and give the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the Company 
pursuant to the authority granted under resolution 13 above for cash without complying with the pre-emption rights in the Act in certain 
circumstances. 
Resolution 14 will permit the Directors to allot:
(a) equity securities up to a nominal amount of £4,073,315.80, representing two-thirds of the Company’s issued share capital as at 
5 October 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document) on an offer to existing shareholders on a pre-emptive 
basis (that is including a rights issue or an open offer), with one-third being available only in connection with a rights issue (in each 
case subject to any adjustments, such as for fractional entitlements and overseas shareholders, as the Directors see fit); and 
(b) equity securities up to a maximum nominal value of £305,498.68, representing approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at 5 October 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document) otherwise than in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders. 
Resolution 15 is being proposed as a separate resolution to authorise the Directors to allot a further 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company (as at 5 October 2016, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice) otherwise than 
in connection with a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders for the purposes of financing a transaction (or refinancing within 
six months of the transaction) which the Directors determine to be an acquisition or other capital investment contemplated by 
the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of Principles (the “Pre-Emption Group Principles”).
The Pre-Emption Group Principles were revised in March 2015 to allow the authority for an issue of shares for cash otherwise than in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer to be increased from 5% to 10% of the Company’s issued share capital, provided that the Company 
confirms that it intends to use the additional 5% authority only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which 
is announced contemporaneously with the issue or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the 
announcement of the issue (a ‘Relevant Acquisition or Specified Capital Investment’). The Directors believe that it is appropriate to seek 
this additional 5% authority in resolution 15 to give the Company the flexibility that this resolution affords. In line with Pre-Emption 
Group 2016 guidance, the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights is being proposed as two separate resolutions. 
The Board intends to adhere to the provisions in the revised Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles and to not allot shares for cash 
on a non pre-emptive basis in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding 
treasury shares) within a rolling three-year period, without prior consultation with shareholders. 
The authority contained in resolutions 14 and 15 will expire upon the expiry of the authority to allot shares conferred in resolution 13 
(that is at the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or, if earlier, on the close of business on the day which is 
15 months from the date of these resolutions). The Directors’ existing authority expires at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
Resolution 16 – Authority to Purchase Own Shares 
Resolution 16, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks authority for the Company to purchase up to 10% of its Ordinary 
Shares at, or between, the minimum and maximum prices specified in this resolution. This power would be used only after careful 
consideration by the Directors, having taken into account market conditions prevailing at that time, the investment needs of the 
Company, its opportunities for expansion and its overall financial position. The Directors would exercise the authority to purchase 
Ordinary Shares only if they considered it to be in the best interests of shareholders as a whole and if the purchase could be 
reasonably expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
Under the Act, the Company is allowed to hold its own shares in treasury following a purchase of its own shares, instead of cancelling 
them. Such shares may be resold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under the Company’s share incentive 
schemes but all rights attaching to them, including voting rights and any right to receive dividends, are suspended whilst they are held 
in treasury. If the Directors exercise the authority conferred by resolution 16, the Company will have the option of holding repurchased 
shares in treasury. 
If resolution 16 is passed at the Annual General Meeting, it is the Company’s current intention to hold in treasury all of the shares it 
may purchase pursuant to the authority granted to it. However, in order to respond properly to the Company’s capital requirements 
and prevailing market conditions, the Directors will reassess at the time of any and each actual purchase whether to hold the shares in 
treasury or cancel them, provided it is permitted to do so. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the Company in treasury.

 Annual Report 2016
 161
At 5 October 2016 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), options were outstanding to subscribe for 
1,833,739 Ordinary Shares, representing 3% of the issued share capital at that date. If the full authority to purchase such shares (existing 
and sought) was exercised, they would represent 3.3% of the Company’s issued share capital as at that date (assuming there have 
been no other changes to issued share capital in the meantime). The authority sought at the Annual General Meeting will expire at the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting next following, or the close of business on the day which is 15 months from the date of this 
resolution (whichever is earlier).
Resolution 17– Adoption of New Articles 
Resolution 17, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks shareholder approval for the Company to adopt New Articles at the 
2016 Annual General Meeting, principally in order to reflect developments in practice and legislation, and to provide clarification and 
additional flexibility. The Company’s Current Articles were adopted in 2008.
The first part of the resolution deals with the changes to the Company’s Articles to reflect the Act provisions relating to the Company’s 
Memorandum and share capital. Under section 28 of the Act, all provisions of the Company’s Memorandum existing at 1 October 2009, 
including the objects clause, are deemed to now form part of the Company’s Articles. It is not necessary under the Act for a company 
to set out its objects. The Act provides that, unless the articles state otherwise, a company’s objects will be unrestricted. 
The other key provision of the Memorandum which is deemed to form part of the Company’s Articles is the provision relating 
to authorised share capital. The Act removed the requirement for a company to place limits on its authorised share capital. 
By adopting the New Articles which do not contain the objects clause or the authorised share capital statement, the Company will, 
in accordance with market practice for listed companies, remove from its Articles these provisions, which were deemed to form part of 
the Company’s Articles under section 28 of the Act. This means that the Company’s objects will be unrestricted and the Company can, 
in accordance with institutional investor guidelines, seek an authority at each AGM for the directors to allot new shares without any 
limitation in its Articles of Association. 
The other principal changes being proposed in the New Articles are summarised in Appendix 1 starting on page 162 of this document. 
Other changes, which are of a minor, technical or clarifying nature, have not been noted.
A copy of the Current Articles and the proposed New Articles that reflect these amendments will be available for inspection during 
normal business hours (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excepted) at the offices of the Company (with address Matrix House, 
Basing View, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG21 4DZ) up until the close of the meeting. Copies will also be available at the offices of 
Buchanan Communications, 107 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6DN on the morning of the meeting from 9.00 am until its conclusion.
A copy of the Current Articles and the proposed New Articles can also be found in the Investors section of the Company’s website 
at www.genusplc.com 
Resolution 18 – Notice Period for General Meetings 
Resolution 18, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks the approval of shareholders to reduce to 14 clear days the notice 
period required for a general meeting. The notice period required for general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) for listed 
companies is 21 days but the Company may provide a shorter notice period of 14 clear days provided two conditions are met. The 
first condition is that the Company offers a facility for shareholders to vote by electronic means. This condition is met if the Company 
offers a facility, accessible to all shareholders, to appoint a proxy by means of a website. The second condition is that there is an annual 
resolution of shareholders approving the reduction of the minimum notice period from 21 days to 14 days. Annual General Meetings 
will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of 
routine for general meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests 
of the shareholders as a whole.

APPENDIX 1
SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Under resolution 17, the Company is proposing to adopt the New Articles. Set out below is a summary of the principal changes made 
to the Current Articles, which are in addition to those set out in the explanatory notes for resolution 17 on page 161. The New Articles 
also include some other minor modernising and clarificatory amendments which are not detailed below. Article references below 
are to the New Articles. 
Disclosure of Interests (Article 38) 
The New Articles include changes in relation to the powers of the Company regarding notices served under Section 793 of the Act 
that require the disclosure of details of interests in shares in the Company. If there is a default in complying with a notice, the new 
powers allow the Company to require shares held in uncertificated form to be converted into certificated shares. The definition 
of what constitutes a default in supplying the information requested by the Company is stated in the New Articles to include the 
Company knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the information provided is false or materially incorrect.
Untraced shareholders (Article 39)
As under the Current Articles, the Company may sell the shares of shareholders who have been untraced for a period of 12 years or 
more and use the proceeds of that sale for the purposes of its business. The former shareholder must currently be listed as a creditor 
in its accounts, so that they may subsequently claim the proceeds at any time. The New Articles treat the proceeds of such a sale as 
forfeited by the former shareholder, who will only be listed as a creditor for three years, after which they have no further right to claim 
the proceeds. Under the Current Articles, the Company is required to provide notice to untraced shareholders of its intention to sell 
their shares by way of an advertisement in a national newspaper and in a local newspaper. Under the New Articles, the Company must 
instead send a notice to the last registered address of the shareholder and use reasonable steps to trace the shareholder including, 
if appropriate, using a tracing agent. 
Notice of general meetings (Articles 41, 42 and 43)
A number of technical amendments have been made to the provisions relating to calling and attending shareholder meetings to bring 
these in line with best practice.
Under the New Articles, if there are not sufficient Directors to form a quorum in order to call a general meeting, any shareholder may call 
a general meeting (there is no equivalent provision under the Current Articles).
Under the Current Articles, accidental failure to provide notice of a meeting to a shareholder or the non-receipt of a notice of a meeting 
by a shareholder will not invalidate the meeting. The New Articles clarify that, in addition, a failure to give notice due to circumstances 
outside the Company’s control will not invalidate the meeting. This is designed to cover a postal strike or other similar situations.
Quorum (Articles 44 and 45)
The quorum for a general meeting under the Current Articles is three persons entitled to attend and vote, each being a shareholder 
present in person or by proxy or a corporate representative of a shareholder (and attending within 15 minutes of the time set for the 
meeting). Article 44 of the New Articles states that two persons (attending within 30 minutes) can constitute a quorum and makes 
it clear that two persons who are proxies for the same shareholder, or representatives of the same body corporate, can constitute 
a quorum for a general meeting.
Amendments to resolutions (Article 54)
If written notice is received of a proposed amendment to an ordinary resolution, the New Articles impose an additional condition to 
such amendment being accepted – that the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the Chairman of the meeting, 
materially alter the scope of the resolution. The New Articles state that only the Chairman of the meeting may propose an amendment 
to correct a clear error in a special resolution.
Demand for a Poll (Article 56)
The New Articles give a majority of the Directors present at the meeting the right to demand a poll as well as the Chairman of the 
meeting. The New Articles have also increased the minimum number of shareholders required to call a poll from three (as under the 
Current Articles) to five in order to bring this provision in line with the Act. 
Voting rights (Articles 62 and 67)
The New Articles clarify that: (i) on a show of hands, corporate representatives have the same rights as the corporation would be entitled 
to; (ii) a proxy may have more than one vote on a show of hands if they have been instructed by more than one shareholder on how 
to vote; and (iii) a shareholder, proxy or corporate representative entitled to more than one vote does not need to use all of their votes, 
or cast the votes they use, in the same way. 
The New Articles also state that the Company is not bound to enquire whether a proxy or corporate representative is voting 
in accordance with their appointing shareholders’ instructions.

 Annual Report 2016

Proxies (Articles 69 to 72)
Various technical amendments have been made to the provisions relating to proxies.
The deadlines for receipt of termination of proxy authority have been brought into line with the deadlines for receipt of proxies. The New 
Articles also, in accordance with the Act, permit the Directors to determine whether non-working days should be taken into account for 
the calculation of the time periods for receipt of proxies. 
Corporate representatives (Article 75)
The New Articles expressly confirm that corporations who are shareholders of the Company have the right to appoint multiple corporate 
representatives and, in line with best practice, also allow the Company to require a corporate representative to produce a certified copy 
of the resolution appointment before permitting them to exercise their powers. 
Number of Directors (Article 76)
In line with normal practice, the New Articles lower the minimum number of Directors from three to two and do not prescribe 
a maximum number.
Annual retirement of Directors (Article 81)
The New Articles do not contain any of the provisions in the Current Articles relating to retirement by rotation of Directors at annual 
general meetings. Instead, in order to reflect what happens in practice, and consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the 
New Articles provide that all Directors will retire annually and be subject to election at annual general meetings (with the exception 
of a Director appointed between the notice of meeting being sent out by the Company and the meeting, who will retire at the first 
annual general meeting for which notice is given after their appointment).
Termination of a Director’s appointment (Articles 84 and 85)
The New Articles provide an additional means for shareholders to remove a Director by special resolution without the need to follow 
the special notice procedure set out in sections 168 and 169 of the Act. This is in addition to the statutory right in those sections for 
a shareholder to remove a Director by ordinary resolution and does not affect that right.
The New Articles provide that in the case of a Director who holds any executive office, he shall cease to be a Director if his executive 
appointment is terminated or expires and the Directors resolve that he should cease to be a Director. The New Articles do not include 
a provision which states that a Director’s appointment may be terminated by a resolution of the Board in circumstances where 
the Director has been suffering mental ill health. This is in response to developments in mental health legislation and is in line with 
the removal of the equivalent provisions in the model articles for public companies.
Borrowing powers (Article 93)
The Board’s borrowing power threshold remains at four times the amount of the Company’s share capital and reserves. A number 
of technical amendments have been made to the borrowing powers in order to clarify how the constituent elements of the threshold 
are to be calculated. In particular: how the foreign currency calculation is carried out; allowing capital and reserves to be adjusted as 
the Directors may reasonably consider appropriate to reflect any change in the Group companies since the date of the last audited 
consolidated balance sheet of the Group and the inclusion of provisions on how any pension deficit or surplus should be treated. 
In line with best practice, the New Articles also remove the provision in the Current Articles which provide a thirty day grace period 
before there is a breach of the articles.
Delegation to persons and Committees (Article 95)
The New Articles follow a broader and simplified approach to delegation of powers by Directors, in line with the Act’s model articles 
for public companies and other listed companies, allowing the Directors to delegate as they decide is appropriate. 
Directors’ remuneration (Article 96)
Under the Current Articles, the Company may pay fees to the Directors of up to £250,000 in aggregate each year (or such higher figure 
as may be approved by ordinary resolution) and may also pay additional fees for any special or extra services (for example in relation 
to Committee membership). These fees are exclusive of any salary or other remuneration paid to Executive Directors as employees. 
The basic limit was set some years ago, and the Directors’ fees are in any event now approved by shareholders as part of the Directors’ 
remuneration policy. To provide greater flexibility the New Articles increase the reference to the basic annual aggregate amount to 
£650,000, and continue to allow for further payments for specific services. The Board has no current plans to change its approach 
to the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors and such fees must in any event be in accordance with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
as approved from time to time by shareholders.
Other interests and offices (Articles 100 and 101)
If a Director is interested in a transaction or is an officer of or employed by or interested in a body corporate in which the Company 
is interested, provided that he has disclosed his interest, the New Articles confirm that such interests, offices or employment will not 
infringe the duty in relation to conflicts as codified in the Act. The New Articles also contain standard exemptions from disclosure 
in relation to directorships of other companies in the Group. Genus plc

Dividend payment procedure and unclaimed payments (Articles 114 to 117)
Although the Current Articles permit the payment of dividends by electronic means, the New Articles allow the Directors to determine 
how dividends are paid to shareholders, which method shall be the default method for paying dividends and whether shareholders may 
(or may not) make an election for a distribution channel other than the default. The Board has no current plans to change the payment 
arrangements but it is important that the Company is able to cater for new developments and changes in practice, including considering 
the efficiency and costs saving that would flow from a change to electronic only payment.
The New Articles provide that if the Company sells the shares of an untraced shareholder, then any dividend or other money unclaimed 
in respect of those shares will be forfeited after a period of three years. 
Scrip dividends (Article 118)
The New Articles state that a resolution to authorise a scrip dividend can only be for a maximum three-year period, instead of the 
current five-year period. This amendment has been made to bring the New Articles in line with new institutional investor guidance. 
In addition, certain changes have been made for clarification in relation to the process for electing to receive scrip dividends.
Notices and other communications (Articles 122, 125, 126 and 129)
The New Articles also cover the service of notice in the event of a postal strike; it has been amended to allow the Company in such 
circumstances to serve notices only on those shareholders who receive notices via electronic means, provided that, as before, the 
Company also puts an advert in two national newspapers and sends a confirmatory hard copy notice if the postal service is available 
again within seven days of the meeting.
In relation to notices, documents or information sent by the Company to a shareholder, which have been returned undelivered on three 
consecutive occasions, the New Articles provide that the shareholder will only be entitled to be sent further communications upon 
provision of a new postal or electronic address to the Company. 
Destruction of documents (Article 138)
The New Articles permit documents to be destroyed earlier than the relevant date authorised by the articles, provided that a copy of the 
document (whether made electronically, by microfilm, by digital imaging or by any other means) has been made which is not destroyed 
before that date.
Change of name (Article 139)
Under the New Articles, in line with the Act, the Company is permitted to change its name by a resolution of the Directors in addition to 
by special resolution of the shareholders.
Power to indemnify Directors (Article 141)
The provisions in the New Articles relating to the indemnification of Directors do not, unlike the Current Articles, set out the limitations 
of the Act in full but are still expressed to be subject to them. It is clarified that the provision also applies to directorships of all 
subsidiary companies.

General Notes
This Notice is being sent to all members and to any person nominated by a member of the Company under section 146 of the Act to 
enjoy information rights. Information regarding the Annual General Meeting, including the information required by section 311A of the 
Act, is available from www.genusplc.com.
Proxies
Members will find an attendance card and a form of proxy enclosed with this Notice. If you are attending the Annual General Meeting, 
you should bring the attendance card with you. Only holders of Ordinary Shares, or their duly appointed representatives, are entitled to 
attend, vote and speak at the Annual General Meeting. Any member so entitled may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak and 
to vote instead of him or her. A proxy need not be a member of the Company but must attend the Annual General Meeting to represent 
you. Your proxy could be the Chairman, another Director of the Company or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. 
Your proxy must vote as you instruct and must attend the meeting for your vote to be counted. Details of how to appoint one or more 
proxies are set out in the notes to the proxy form. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to 
exercise rights attached to different shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. A 
vote withheld is not a vote in law, which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. 
If no voting indication is given, your proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. Your proxy will vote (or abstain from 
voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the Annual General Meeting.
To be valid, a duly executed form of proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting together, if appropriate, with the power of attorney or 
other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a duly certified copy of such power or authority must be deposited at the offices of 
Equiniti Registrars, Freepost RTHJ-CLLL -KBKU, Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, LANCING, BN99 8LU at least 48 hours before the 
time appointed for holding the Annual General Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Alternatively, proxies may be appointed by having 
an appropriate CREST message transmitted, if you are a user of the CREST system (further details are below). In the case of a member 
which is a company, the proxy form must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an officer of the company or 
an attorney for the company.
To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have 
appointed a proxy using the hard copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy proxy form, please 
contact Equiniti Limited, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing BN99 6DA. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) 
also applies in relation to amended instructions. Where two or more valid separate appointments of proxy are received in respect of the 
same share in respect of the same meeting, the one which is last sent shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in 
person if they wish to do so.
The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been 
nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with section 146 of the Act (‘nominated persons’). Nominated 
persons may have a right under an agreement with the registered member who holds shares on their behalf to be appointed (or to have 
someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively, if nominated persons do not have such a right, or do not wish to exercise it, they may 
have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the shares as to the exercise of voting rights.
Voting record date
Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the time by which a person must be entered on the register 
of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting is 6.30pm on 15 November 
2016 (or if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned, members on the register of members not later than 6.30pm on the day that is two 
working days prior to the reconvened Annual General Meeting). Changes to entries on the register of members after the relevant time 
will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the Annual General Meeting.
Documents on display
Copies of contracts of service and letters of appointment between the Directors and the Company and the New Articles will be available 
for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company during normal business hours until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, 
and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes prior to the Annual General Meeting until its conclusion.
CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for this 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 November 2016 at 11.00am and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described 
in the CREST Manual found on the Euroclear website www.euroclear.com. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, 
and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance 
with Euroclear UK and Ireland Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in 
the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or to an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by the 
latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this Notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the 
issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time, any change of 
instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. Genus plc

CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK and Ireland 
Limited do not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will 
therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if 
the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means 
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting 
service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated 
Securities Regulations 2001, as amended.
Corporate Representatives
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers 
as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
Total Voting Rights
As at 5 October 2016 (being the latest practicable date before publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share capital comprised 
61,099,737 Ordinary Shares of 10 pence each. As at the date of this Notice, no shares are held by the Company in treasury. Each Ordinary 
Share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company 
as at 5 October 2016 is 61,099,737. The Company’s website, referred to above, will include the contents of this Notice, information on the 
number of shares and voting rights and, if applicable, any shareholders’ statements, shareholders’ resolutions or shareholders’ matters 
of business received by the Company after the date of this Notice.
Questions
Under section 319A of the Act, the Company must cause to be answered at the Annual General Meeting any question a member asks 
relating to the business being dealt with at the Annual General Meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the 
preparation for the Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; the answer has already been given on 
a website in the form of an answer to a question; or it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Annual 
General Meeting that the question be answered.
Requisition Rights
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the 
Company to publish on its website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the Company’s Accounts (including the 
auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstances connected 
with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in 
accordance with section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the members requesting any such website publication to pay its 
expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on its website under 
section 527 of the Act, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement 
available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Act to publish on its website.
Voting at the meeting
In order for the voting preferences of all shareholders including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, 
to be taken into account, a poll will be conducted on all resolutions at the Annual General Meeting this year. Each shareholder and proxy 
present at the meeting will be invited to complete a poll card indicating how they wish to cast their votes in respect of each resolution. 
The results of the voting will be posted on the Company’s website after the meeting. Except as provided above, members who have 
general queries about the Annual General Meeting should call Equiniti registrars on 0371 384 2290. Lines open 8.30am to 5.30pm, 
Monday to Friday (excluding UK public holidays). If calling from overseas, please call the Equiniti overseas helpline number of +44 121 
415 7047. No other methods of communication will be accepted. You may not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice 
of Annual General Meeting, or any related documents (including the proxy form) to communicate with the Company for any purposes 
other than those expressly stated.

services
yc O was founded in monaco in 2003 by current 
d irectors g ary Wright and c harlie birkett as a 
superyacht management company. h aving both spent 
many years working on board superyachts, it was their 
aim to build on their own experiences and knowledge 
to provide clients and captains with the kind of reliable 
shoreside support which was unavailable at that time. 
Eight years on, yc O has grown to become a global 
force in superyacht management, with a burgeoning 
sales and charter brokerage division. yc O has also 
expanded its scope of operations to include crew 
recruitment, fuelling and superyacht concierge  
and provisioning. 
Our listing on the l ondon stock Exchange’s a Im 
provides yc O clients with an exceptional level of 
transparency and regulation in its operations which 
is unique in the industry.
YCO & YCO Crew In yacht management, yc O has become known for 
an innovative, pioneering approach, after introducing 
corporate management techniques to the industry 
and developing the groundbreaking yacht management 
software yc O l IVE, which continued to be developed 
and improved in 2010. 
t he yc O project management division has been 
involved in some of the most significant new build 
projects of recent years and several major superyacht 
refits and rebuilds. t he department’s engineers and 
technical personnel work alongside administrative 
staff in monaco offices and onsite at major 
European shipyards. 
With monthly retainers from yacht management 
and project management providing a stable revenue 
platform, the c ompany now focuses on strengthening 
the profitable brokerage arm of the business, both in 
sales and charter, where revenue is generated on a 
commission basis.
yc O c rew continues to offer specialist yacht crew 
recruitment services in palma and a ntibes, charging 
a fixed fee per placement. In 2010 yc O c rew also 
provided its services out of monaco headquarters, 
to support the needs of the yc O yacht 
management division. 
Ya Cht Fuel Servi Ce S
yacht f uel services has continued to source and 
resell fuel to yachts around the world from offices in 
l ondon and f rance. a lthough yfs and its services 
fall outside the c ompany’s core service offering, the 
division operates as a profitable standalone business.
Ya Cht h elp Gr Oup

d uring 2010 the c ompany closed yacht h elp g roup 
in spain and f rance, moving all services and personnel 
into the yc O yacht management division in monaco. 
services include assistance with day to day operations, 
provisioning and charter concierge. Revenue is earned 
on a time and mark-up basis. d uring 2010 the travel 
division within yc O c oncierge launched the yc O f ly 
service, enabling crew on the c ompany’s managed 
yachts to obtain discounted travel airfares worldwide.  OVERVIEW

I am delighted to deliver my maiden statement as

my predecessor, peter Jay for his continued support 
and hard work during his tenure, which saw a critical 
period of transition for the g roup. 
t hrough the continued restructuring of the g roup, 
I am pleased to report that yc O has significantly 
increased its profitability and it remains wholly 
focused on maintaining this trend. 
In 2010, yc O continued to extend its reach 
worldwide. a permanent presence in the m iddle East 
was established in d oha and the g roup continues to 
explore opportunities to increase its levels of activity 
across a wider geographical base.
t he board was strengthened during the period 
with Ian petts appointed as f inance d irector, after 
serving yc O in monaco since 2008 and Rishi malliwal, 
an experienced corporate lawyer, joining as n on-
Executive d irector.

r eview OF b u Sine SS Operati On S
bro Kerage 
a fter an encouraging performance by the brokerage 
division in 2009 the board took the opportunity to 
further strengthen the team during 2010, attracting 
four well regarded sales and charter brokers from a 
leading competitor. t he ongoing recruitment and 
retention of industry leading employees remains core 
to our strategy. Overall, both sales and charter 
performed ahead of expectations, both in terms of the 
sales, and also in securing new c entral a gency yachts.
d uring the period yc O continued to offer its clients 
industry innovating services, most recently an ipad 
based application designed as a brokerage tool. a 
superyacht search facility, ‘yachtbox’ is the first 
application of its kind and was well received at its 
launch at the monaco yacht show. 
Manage Ment
a s well as increasing the number of yachts under 
management, yc O took delivery of two new 
superyachts from the prestigious g erman shipyard 
l ürssen (one above 80m and one above 120m). both 
yachts had been overseen by yc O project 
management throughout construction and moved 
seamlessly to the Operational management fleet. 
Overall the department has maintained a satisfying 
market share and its reputation among captains and 
owners for its knowledge and service levels continues 
to grow.
t he g roup continued to develop its management 
service offering globally by transferring management 
personnel permanently to the g ulf. yc O continues to 
look to developing regions in the superyacht market 
for potential growth opportunities.
yco c re W
yc O crew achieved improved results, making more 
placements in 2010 than in 2009. In palma, yc O c rew 
relocated to larger offices and is now able to offer 
logistical support to yc O managed yachts based or 
passing locally. t he division remains an excellent 
client source for the c ompany’s yacht management 
division and as such the board was satisfied with its 
performance and looks to strengthen the recruitment 
team in 2011. 
yacht f uel s ervices
t he fuel services division maintained its position in the 
marketplace, performing in line with expectations. In 
early 2010 the division remained affected by reduced 
transatlantic yachting traffic however, and the board 
continues to review its position within the g roup.
yacht h elp g roup  
(no W yco c lient concierge)
d uring the year the decision was taken to withdraw 
yhg operations from s pain and f rance, with all 
activity transferred to yc O’s expanded offices in 
monaco and palma (yc O c rew). n ow ‘yc O c lient 
c oncierge’, the division’s service offering has been  bus In Ess REVIEW
13 yc O g ROup plc annual RE pORt & acc Ounts 2010
further strengthened by a partnership with a leading 
global concierge provider with offices in 60 further 
cities worldwide. t he board views this as a positive 
development of yc O’s existing concierge services, 
an area of the business which has traditionally 
differentiated yc O from competitor charter firms.
Finan Cial r eview We are very pleased with our financial performance 
over the period after posting a small maiden profit 
in 2009. profits have increased dramatically from 
break even to close to £1m before exceptional items 
of £330k, which includes European Vat provision of 
£150k, goodwill of £102k for the liquidation of yacht 
h elp g roup g ibraltar and fixed asset write off of 
£78k for the closure of offices in palma and barcelona. 
a n increase in charter contracts and office expansion 
means that cash is slightly lower than forecast at 
£500k but yc O remains largely free of debt and 
very well positioned for further growth in 2011.
OutlOO k yc O remains focused on building on the excellent 
client, operational and personnel achievements made 
in 2010. It will do this through the ongoing development 
of our client services as well as leveraging the yc O 
brand through strategic marketing initiatives that will 
help ensure yc O maintains its position as a leader in 
the superyacht industry. a s part of this yc O intends 
to implement an Employee Incentive scheme in 2011 
to retain and attract the industry’s leading talent – 
being the only uk listed superyacht services company 
gives yc O a unique industry advantage in this respect. 
 
t he superyacht marketplace is showing signs of 
gradual recovery. In 2010, the number of superyacht 
sales across the industry was higher than the previous 
year and in the first quarter of 2011 yc O has seen an 
increase in enquiries for sales, charter and yacht 
management. With several prospects also 
commissioning the build of new yachts, yc O is 
currently involved commercially with every major 
shipyard in northern Europe, a significant milestone. 
a s founders of yc O, g ary Wright and I are pleased 
with the c ompany’s performance and welcome new 
arrivals to the board and the g roup, in particular the 
new d irector of sales and c harter, n eil c heston. We 
would like to thank the whole yc O team for enabling 
us to achieve very encouraging results for 2010. 
t he g roup is confident that in this improving market, 
with its industry leading client service offering and team 
of highly respected yacht managers and brokers, yc O 
can continue to build on the momentum gained in 2010 
and accordingly the board looks forward with optimism.

t he more lucrative brokerage side of the industry was 
the most heavily affected by the downturn, however 
2010 showed a stronger start to the year than 2009 
across the industry. 
t he mediterranean remained the most popular 
cruising ground although the c aribbean showed signs 
of recovery after two quiet seasons. t his is possibly 
as a result of increased piracy risk en route to the 
alternative destinations of the seychelles and maldives, 
now avoided by many private vessels. 
l ed by new d irector of sales and c harter, n eil 
c heston, who joined from c amper & n icholson 
International, the strengthened brokerage teams 
will work to increase yc O’s market share in 2011, 
particularly in sales brokerage. t he division remains 
a focus for improvement. 
yacht Manage Ment
several yacht owners approached yc O looking to 
improve efficiency onboard during and following 
the downturn. a dditionally, with over 200 new 
superyachts delivered across the industry in 2010, 
the yacht management division was able to bid for 
and win new contracts. 
d evelopment of yc O l IVE continued throughout the 
year as feedback from users reported that the online 
management tool has become an integral part of their 
yachts’ management.
yc O placed orders for two large new builds for 
clients in 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 shows 
promise. With several projects under way, the board 
plans to expand this division within Europe.
c re W r ecruit Ment
t here remained a demand for yacht crew throughout 
2009 and 2010 for newly delivered yachts. h aving lost 
market share in 2009, yc O c rew performed ahead 
of expectations with 167 placements in 2010 – a 43% 
increase. t he division remains an excellent source for 
new yacht management business and the team will be

In 2010 the board’s focus was to continue monitoring 
efficiency and cost control, but also to invest in core 
services, enabling development and growth in these areas.
strengthening the teams in yacht management and 
brokerage enabled both divisions to increase their market 
share and overall, revenue in all core areas of business 
has increased. 
In light of gradually improving market conditions, yacht 
f uel services remains the sole area showing no growth in 
turnover or profitability. With limited or no cross-selling 
potential to the wider g roup, the board will continue to 
assess the position of this subsidiary going forward. 
Overall, the g roup’s consolidated results demonstrate a 
continued turnaround. In 2011, the board will continue 
with a similar approach to cautious, strategic investment 
and growth in core areas of business and an ongoing 
analysis of secondary services.

Directors’ r eport for the year en De D 31 December 2010
The Directors present their report with the financial statements of the Group and 
Company for the year ended 31 December 2010.
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY
The principal activity of the Group in the year under review was the supply of 
services and marine fuel to the world’s superyachts, captains and their owners.
REVIEW OF BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
A detailed appraisal of business developments is on pages 2 to 21.
KEY RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Directors are optimistic about the business development in 2011. However this 
is dependent upon factors such as oil prices, volatility of the US Dollar and Euro 
exchange rates and global economic stability. The exchange rate risk is partly 
mitigated by buying and selling in the same currency.

The profit for the year after tax is £491,560, which has been allocated against 
reserves. No dividends will be distributed for the year ended 31 December 2010.

(2009 – 52 days) in the year under review. f INANCIAL STATEMENTS
27 y CO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2010
LISTING
The Company’s Ordinary shares have been traded on London’s Alternative 
Investment Market (AIM), since 28 May 2008. Arbuthnot Securities Limited are the 
Company’s Nominated Advisor and Broker. The closing mid market share price at  
31 December 2010 was 13.25p (31 December 2009 – 8.00p).
PUBLICATION OF ACCOUNTS ON GROUP WEBSITE
f inancial statements are published on the Group’s website. The maintenance and 
integrity of the website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the financial statements contained therein.
EMPLOYEE CONSULTATION
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its employees and has 
continued to keep them informed on matters affecting them as employees and on 
the relevant matters affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved 
through informal meetings, staff bulletins, internal websites and meetings with  
staff representatives.
INDEMNITY OF OFFICERS
The Group may purchase and maintain, for any Director or officer, insurance against 
any liability and the Group does maintain appropriate insurance cover against legal 
action brought against its Directors and officers.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency 
risk. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and 
borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than Pound Sterling (£). The 
Group maintains a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by 
matching foreign currency income with foreign currency costs.
Given the nature of the business for the time being, the Group does not consider it 
necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts in managing its foreign exchange 
risk resulting from cash flows from transactions denominated in foreign currency.
The Group prepares periodic working capital forecasts for the foreseeable future, 
allowing an assessment of the cash requirements of the Company, to manage liquidity 
risk. The Directors have considered the risk posed by liquidity and are satisfied that 
there is sufficient growth and equity in the Company. The Group has an overdraft 
facility with the bank for £300,000 and is being charged at an interest rate of 4.25% 
per annum above HSBC’s Sterling base rate. The overdraft facility is due for renewal 
in December 2011.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors consider that the Company  
and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  
the foreseeable future. f or this reason they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements. This is reflected in note 1 to the  
financial statements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The Directors are responsible for preparing the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the financial 
statements in accordance with International f inancial Reporting Standards (If RS) as 
adopted for use in the European Union. The financial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and 
of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; ■ ■
make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; ■ ■
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is ■ ■
inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business; and
to follow If RS as adopted by the European Union. ■ ■
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the 
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
DONATIONS
The Group has not made any political donations during the year (2009 – nil). The 
Group did make donations of value of £1,000 to the Sea Keepers Association, an 
organisation which monitors the seas; and contributions to the value of £20,000 to 
the costs of Chris f oot’s expedition to the South Pole to raise funds and awareness 
for Combat Stress, an organisation dedicated to the support of former military 
personnel (2009 – nil). 
STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO 
AUDITORS
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined 
by Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company’s auditors are 
unaware, and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to 
establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
AUDITORS
In accordance with section 485 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution that Jeffreys 
Henry LLP, be reappointed as auditors of the Company will be put to the Annual 
General Meeting.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD:
C BIRKETT 
c hief e xecutive o fficer Date: 30 May 2011 28
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance to 
commensurate with the Group’s size and the interests of shareholders. As the Group 
grows, policies and procedures that reflect the Principles of Good Governance and 
Code of Best Practice as published by the Committee on Corporate Governance 
(commonly known as the ‘Combined Code’) will be developed. So far as is 
practicable and appropriate, taking into account the size and nature of the Company, 
the Directors will take steps to comply with the Combined Code.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board comprises of four Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors. 
All the Directors with the exception of I Petts, R Malliwal and S Lidbetter served 
throughout the year. The Directors’ biographies are set out on pages 22 to 23 and 
demonstrate a range of relevant experience. C Smith resigned as a Director in the 
year.
The Board meets at least four times a year as issues arise which require Board 
attention. The Board has a formal schedule of matters specially referred to it for 
decision. The Directors are responsible for the management structure and 
appointments, considering strategy and policy, approval of major capital investments 
and transactions, and are responsible for significant financing matters.
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee, 
the roles and responsibilities for both of which are discussed below. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE
An Audit Committee has been established and currently comprises of P Jay, S 
Lidbetter and R Malliwal who all have considerable and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee, which has Terms of Reference agreed by the Board, meets at 
least twice a year and is responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the financial 
information reported to the shareholders and the systems of internal controls. This 
committee provides an opportunity for reporting by the Company’s auditors.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring, in discussion with the auditors, 
the integrity of the financial statements and announcements of the Company; 
reviewing the Company’s internal financial controls and risk management systems; 
reviewing and monitoring the external auditor’s independence, objectivity and 
effectiveness of the audit process taking into consideration relevant UK and other 
relevant professional and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is also 
responsible for making recommendations to the Board to be put to shareholders for 
their approval in general meeting in relation to the appointment, reappointment and 
removal of the external auditor and to approve the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditor. Other responsibilities include reviewing the 
Company’s internal audit function, and where there is no internal audit function and 
considering annually whether there is a need for an internal audit function and 
making recommendation to the Board, and to review arrangements by which the 
staff of the Group will be able to raise concerns about possible improprieties in 
matters of financial reporting or other matters related to the Group.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice a year, consists of P Jay, S 
Lidbetter and R Malliwal. Based on the Terms of Reference approved by the Board, 
the Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the 
Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chief Executive 
Officer, the Chairman and other members as it is designated to consider. It is also 
responsible for setting the remuneration for all Executive Directors, the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary; to recommend and monitor the level and structure of 
remuneration for senior management; and determining targets for any performance-
related pay schemes operated by the Group. The Remuneration Committee is also 
responsible for determining the policy and scope of pension arrangements for each 
Executive Director and for ensuring that contractual terms on termination and any 
payments made are fair to the individual and the Company. The Remuneration 
Committee will determine the terms and conditions of service of Executive 
Directors. This includes, agreeing the policy for authorising claims for expenses  
from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman, and within the terms of the 
agreed policy, recommending the total individual remuneration package of each 
Executive Director including, where appropriate bonuses, incentive payments  
and share options.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
Communications with shareholders are very important and therefore are given a 
priority. The Company maintains a website www.ycogroup.com for the purpose of 
improving information flow to shareholders as well as potential investors. It contains 
the information about the Company’s activities and the interim report. Shareholders 
are welcome to enquire on any matter relating to the business and their 
shareholdings. The Company encourages the shareholders to attend the Annual 
Meeting, at which they will be given the opportunity to put questions to the 
Chairman and other members of the Board.
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company’s system of 
internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. They are designated to safeguard 
the assets of the Company and to ensure the reliability of the financial information 
for both internal use and external publication. The controls that include inter alia 
financial, operational and compliance matters and management are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. A system of internal control can provide only reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance that material financial irregularities will be detected or that risk of 
failure to achieve business objectives is eliminated. The Board has considered the 
need for an internal audit function but because of the size and nature of its 
operations does not consider it necessary at the current time.
In 2011, as part of a review of internal controls and procedures, the Group appointed 
a combined anti money laundering and compliance officer.

GENERAL INFORMATION
yCO Group PLC is a company incorporated in England and Wales and quoted on 
the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. The address of 
the registered office is disclosed on the inside back cover of the financial statements. 
The principal activity of the Group is described on page 26. The Company changed 
to its present name on 16 July 2009 upon the successful reorganisation of the Group.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Goin G concern The financial statements have been prepared on the assumption that the Group is a 
going concern. When assessing the foreseeable future, the Directors have looked at 
a period of twelve months from the date of approval of this report.
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position are set out in the Chief Executive Officer’s 
Report and Director’s Report on pages 12–13 and 26–27 respectively. In addition 
note 22 to the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; and its 
exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes 
in trading performance, show that the Group should be able to operate within the 
level of its current facility. The Group will open negotiations with the bank in due 
course and has at this stage not sought any written commitments that the facility will 
be renewed.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the annual report and financial statements.
Were the Group to be unable to continue as a going concern, adjustments would 
have to be made to the balance sheet of the Group to reduce balance sheet values 
of assets to their recoverable amounts, to provide for future liabilities that might  
arise and to reclassify non-current assets and long-term liabilities as current assets 
and liabilities.
b asis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
f inancial Reporting Standards and If RIC interpretations issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European Union and  
with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under If RS. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical  
cost convention.
n ew an D amen De D stan Dar Ds a Dopte D by the company The Company has adopted the following new and amended If RSs as of  
1 January 2010:
If RS 3 (revised), ‘Business combinations’ and consequential amendments to IAS ■ ■
27, ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, IAS 28, ‘Investments in 
associates’ and IAS 31, ‘Interests in joint ventures’, effective prospectively to 
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning 
of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
 The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business 
combinations, with some significant changes. f or example, all payments to 
purchase a business are to be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with 
contingent payments classified as debt subsequently remeasured through the 
statement of comprehensive income. There is a choice on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis to measure the minority interest in the acquiree either at fair 
value or at the minority interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. 
All acquisition-related costs should be expensed.
IAS 27 (revised), ‘Consolidated and separate financial statements’, (effective from ■ ■
1 July 2009). The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with 
non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control 
and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses. The 
standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost. Any remaining interest 
in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss. The Company will apply IAS 27 (revised) prospectively to transactions 
with non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
IAS 38 (amendment), ‘Intangible assets’. The amendment is part of the IASB’s ■ ■
annual improvements project published in April 2009 and the Company will apply 
IAS 38 (amendment) from the date If RS 3 (revised) is adopted. The amendment 
clarifies guidance in measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a 
business combination and it permits the grouping of intangible assets as a single 
asset if each asset has a similar useful economic life. The amendment will not 
result in a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
IAS 32 (amendment), ‘f inancial instruments: presentation – classification of rights ■ ■
issue’, is effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 f ebruary 2010 and 
amended the definition of a financial liability in order to classify rights issues (and 
certain options or warrants) as equity instruments in cases where such rights are 
given pro-rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entity’s 
non-derivative equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed number of the entity’s 
own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency. This amendment will 
have no impact on the Company after initial application.
If RS2, Share-based Payment: Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment ■ ■
Transactions effective 1 January 2010. The IASB issued an amendment to If RS2 
that clarified the scope and the accounting for Group cash-settled share-based 
payment transactions. The Company adopted this amendment as of 1 January 
2010. It did not have an impact on the financial position or performance of  
the Company.
IAS 39 f inancial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement – Eligible Hedged ■ ■
Items effective 1 July 2009. The amendment clarifies that an entity is permitted to 
designate a portion of the fair value changes or cash flows variability of a financial 
instrument as a hedged item. This also covers the designation of inflation as a 
hedged risk or portion in particular situations. The Company has concluded that 
the amendment will have no impact on the financial position or performance of 
the Company, as the Company has not entered into such hedges.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are 
mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2010, but are 
not currently relevant for the Company:
n otes to the f inancial s tatements f INANCIAL STATEMENTS
41 y CO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2010
If RIC 17, ‘Distributions of non-cash assets to owners’, effective for annual periods ■ ■
beginning on or after 1 July 2009. This is not currently applicable to the Company, 
as it has not made any non-cash distributions.
If RIC 18, ‘Transfers of assets from customers’, effective for transfers of assets ■ ■
received on or after 1 July 2009. This is not relevant to the Company, as it has not 
received any assets from customers.

been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2011 and 
have not been early adopted:
IAS 24 (Amendment), ‘Related party transactions’. The amended standard is ■ ■
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011. It clarified 
definition of a related party to simplify the identification of such relationships and 
to eliminate inconsistencies in its application. The revised standard introduces a 
partial exemption of disclosure requirements for government-related entities. The 
Company does not expect any impact on its financial position or performance.
If RIC 14 (Amendment), ‘Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement’. The ■ ■
amendment to If RIC 14 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 
January 2011 with retrospective application. The amendment provides guidance 
on assessing the recoverable amount of a net pension asset. The amendment 
permits an entity to treat the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement as 
an asset. The amendment is deemed to have no impact on the financial 
statements of the Company.
If RS 9, ‘f inancial instruments: classification and measurement’, as issued reflects ■ ■
the first phase of the IASB work on the replacement of IAS 39 and applies to 
classification and measurement of financial assets as defined in IAS 39. The 
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013. In 
subsequent phases, the IASB will address classification and measurement of 
financial liabilities, hedge accounting and derecognition. The completion of this 
project is expected in early 2011. The adoption of the first phase of If RS 9 might 
have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Company’s assets. At 
this juncture it is difficult for the Company to comprehend the impact on its 
financial position and performance.
If RIC 19, ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments’, is effective for ■ ■
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010. The interpretation clarifies that 
equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as 
consideration paid. The equity instruments issued are measured at their fair value. 
In case that this cannot be reliably measured, the instruments are measured at the 
fair value of the liability extinguished. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or 
loss. The adoption of this interpretation will have no effect on the financial 
statements of the Company.
Improvements to If RS (issued in May 2010). The IASB issued improvement to ■ ■
If RSs, an omnibus of amendments to its If RS standards. The amendments have 
not been adopted as they become effective for annual periods on or after 1 
January 2011 or 1 July 2010. The amendments listed below, are considered to have 
a reasonable possible impact on the Company:
– If RS 3 Business combinations
– If RS 7 f inancial instruments: disclosures
– IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements
– IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements
The Company expects no impact from the adoption of the above amendments on 
its financial position or performance.
c onsoli Dation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which yCO Group PLC has the power to govern the 
financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 
one half of the voting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that 
are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the 
Group controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on 
which control is transferred to yCO Group PLC. They are deconsolidated from the 
date that control ceases.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of 
subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of 
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the 
date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination 
are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the 
extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair 
value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between 
Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated but 
considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries have been changed or adjusted upon consolidation where necessary to 
ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
i ntan Gible assets (a) Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the 
Group’s share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or associate at 
the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
‘intangible assets’. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates is included in ‘investments in 
associates’ and is tested for impairment as part of the overall balance. Separately 
recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less 
accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill 
relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. 
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or Groups of cash-generating 
units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the 
goodwill arose. The Group allocates goodwill to each business segment in each 
country in which it operates. 42
n otes to the f inancial s tatements continue D
f ixtures, fittings and equipment 5% – 35% on cost
Motor vehicles   16% – 25% on cost
The asset’s residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted if 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date. An asset’s carrying amount is written down 
immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than 
its estimated recoverable value.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the 
carrying amount and are recognised within other (losses) or gains in the income 
statement. When revalued assets are sold, the amounts included in other reserves 
are transferred to retained earnings.
r evenue reco Gnition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the 
sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is 
shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the Group.
 
yacht sales and berth brokerage: revenue is recognised as a commission on the sale 
price on contractual completion of the yacht, tender or berth sale, net of any joint 
agent broker fees. Third party broker introductory agents who are not joint agents 
to the principle contract are recognised as a cost of goods sold on date of 
completion.
 
New build brokerage: Revenue is recognised as non refundable stage payment 
instalments as the client pays the shipyard for key build milestones and percentage of 
completion.
 
yacht charter brokerage: Revenue is recognised as a commission on date of signing 
and exchange of My BA or equivalent Charter Contract, net of any joint agent broker 
fees. yacht charter clients forward to the brokers escrow account a 50% Charter 
deposit on the day of contract exchange. The broker commission is contractually 
secured on this deposit even in the event of cancellation by either the Charterer or 
Owner. Sub brokers and introductory agents are expensed as cost of goods sold on 
date of contract exchange.
 
yacht management and project management income: Revenue is earned on a 
monthly retainer basis using a straight line basis over the contract term.
 
Crew placement: Turnover arising from the placement of candidates is recognised at 
the time the candidate commences full time employment.
 
yacht f uel Services: Revenue from fuel-related services is recognized when services 
are performed, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably 
assured. We record the gross sale of fuel-related services as we generally have 
latitude in establishing the sales price, have discretion in supplier selection, maintain 
credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement.
 
yacht concierge and provisioning: Revenue is recognised on a time and mark-up basis 
as the service is performed, or as the goods are delivered to the vessel. 
 
(b) Trademarks and licences
Acquired trademarks and licences are shown at historical cost. Trademarks and 
licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. 
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of 
trademarks and licences over their estimated useful lives.
Licences  20% – 33% on cost
(c) Software
Acquired software and websites are shown at historical cost. They have a finite 
useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is 
calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of software and website 
over their estimated useful lives.
Software  15% – 33% on cost
(d) Product development
Product development expenditure is capitalised when it is considered that there is a 
commercially and technically viable product, the related expenditure is separately 
identifiable and there is reasonable expectation that the related expenditure will be 
exceeded by future revenues. f ollowing initial recognition, product development is 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment 
losses. The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to have finite life. 
Amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this expense is taken to the 
income statement. Useful lives are also reviewed on an annual basis. Product 
development cost will not be amortised whilst the project is still in its development 
phase. Once the development is completed, the costs are transferred to software as 
an intangible asset.
i mpairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to 
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to 
amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An 
impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. f or the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable 
cash flows (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that 
suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date.
p roperty, plant an D equipment Tangible non-current assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation. Historical 
cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. 
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits 
associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All 
other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the 
financial year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided at the following 
annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life. f INANCIAL STATEMENTS
43 y CO GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2010
current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferre D tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary 
differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying 
amounts in the financial statements. However, the deferred income tax is not 
accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction 
other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax 
rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is 
realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
o peratin G leases Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets of the Group at 
their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the 
statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are 
treated as reduction of the lease obligation on the remaining balance of the liability. 
f inance expenses are recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly 
attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with 
the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see below). Contingent rentals are 
recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.
Rental leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are 
retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under 
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged to the 
income statement.
Commissions and introductory fees can be received from suppliers, these 
commissions are recognised after the service and/or goods have been supplied to our 
client by the sub contractor and/or referred supplier and are reasonably and 
contractually recoverable.
Dividend income: is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
f unctional currency translation i) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of the Group are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the 
functional currency), which is mainly Euros (€). The financial statements are 
presented in Pounds Sterling (£), which is the Group’s presentation currency.
ii) Transactions and balances
f oreign currency transactions are translated into the presentational currency using 
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. f oreign exchange gains and 
losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii) Group companies
The results and financial position of all Group entities (none of which has the 
currency of a hyper-inflationary economy) that have a functional currency different 
from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as 
follows:
(a) assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing 
rate at the date of that balance sheet;
(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average 
exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the 
cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); 
and
(c) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component  
of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign operations, and of borrowings and other currency instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ equity. When a 
foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were 
recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss 
on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are 
treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differed from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes 
items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The entity’s liability for  44

Non-derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value plus, for 
instruments not at fair value through profit or loss, any directly attributable 
transactions costs, except as described below. Subsequent to initial recognition 
non-derivative financial instruments are measured as described below.
A financial instrument is recognised when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. f inancial assets are derecognised if the 
Group’s contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial assets expire or if the 
Group transfers the financial assets to another party without retaining control or 
substantially all risks and rewards of the asset. Regular purchases and sales of financial 
assets are accounted for at trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits itself to 
purchase or sell the asset. f inancial liabilities are derecognised if the Group’s 
obligations specified in the contract expire or are discharged or cancelled.
f air values The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities such as cash and cash 
equivalents, receivables and payables of the Group at the balance sheet date 
approximated their fair values, due to the relatively short-term nature of these 
financial instruments.
The Company provides financial guarantees to licensed banks for credit facilities 
extended to a subsidiary company. The fair value of such financial guarantees is not 
expected to be significantly different as the probability of the subsidiary company 
defaulting on the credit lines is remote.
s hare-base D compensation The fair value of the employees, Directors and suppliers services received in 
exchange for the grant of the options and warrants are recognised as an expense. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting year is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market 
vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market 
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are 
expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision 
to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding 
adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited 
to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options and warrants 
are exercised.
s hare capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are 
shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
c ritical accountin G estimates an D Ju DGements The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Group to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported 
amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on 
historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that 
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of

The Company has adopted If RS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 
2009. If RS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal 
reports about components of the Company that are regularly reviewed by the chief 
operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segments and to 
assess their performance. In contrast, the predecessor Standard (IAS 14 Segment 
Reporting) required an entity to identify two sets of segments (business and 
geographical), using a risks and returns approach, with the entity’s ‘system of internal 
financial reporting to key management personnel’ serving only as the starting point 
for the identification of such segments. f ollowing the adoption of If RS 8, the 
identification of the Group’s reportable segments has changed. See details in Note 2.
c ash an D cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks, 
other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or 
less, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet.
i nventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is 
determined using the first-in, first-out (f If O) method. The cost of finished goods and 
work in progress comprises raw materials and other direct costs. It excludes 
borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
t ra De receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A 
provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the 
Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of 
the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the 
debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in 
payments is considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
t ra De payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method.
b orrowin Gs Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between  
the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised  
in the income statement over the year of the borrowings using the effective  
interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance 
sheet date.
f inancial i nstruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt 
securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and 
borrowings, and trade and other payables. f INANCIAL STATEMENTS

causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below:
(a) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered any 
impairment. The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and 
the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these 
cash flows. Actual outcomes could vary.
(b) Impairment of intangibles (other than goodwill)
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a review for 
impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in 
use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
(c) Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When a 
review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based  
on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions  
and estimates.
(d) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment
Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to their residual values over 
their estimated useful lives as set out above. The selection of these residual values 
and estimated lives requires the exercise of management judgement.
(e) Share-based compensation
The fair value of options and warrants are determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions 
(for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. 
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options 
that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original 
estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
2. SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
In prior years, segment information reported externally was analysed on the basis of 
the types of goods supplied and services provided by the Group’s operating divisions 
(i.e. marine fuel and support services). However, information reported to the 
Group’s chief operating decision maker for the purposes of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance is more specifically focused on the category of 
goods and services. The principal categories are support services and client services. 
The Group’s reportable segments under If RS 8 are therefore as follows:
Support services relate to the goods and services provided to the yacht to enable 
the yacht to operate (i.e.: marine fuel and lubricants).
Client services relate to the services provided on behalf of client (i.e.: yacht 
management, yacht sales, yacht purchase, yacht charter, charter marketing, crew 
recruitment, new construction, project management, provisioning and concierge).
Information regarding the Group’s reportable segments is presented below.

has two classes of dilutive potential Ordinary shares being those share options 
granted to employees and suppliers where the exercise price is less than the average 
market price of the Group’s Ordinary shares during the year and the shares to be

The trademarks, patents and licenses relate to a license held by a Spanish subsidiary 
which was disposed of in 2009.
Software and product development relate to the websites, which meet the definition 
of an intangible asset.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the 
intangible assets may be impaired, by considering the value in use is greater than the 
recoverable amount. If an indication exists an impairment review is carried out. At 
the year end, there was no indication of impairment of the value of the intangibles.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that the 
goodwill may be impaired, by considering the net present value of discounted cash 
flows forecasts. If an indication exists an impairment review is carried out. At the 
year end, there was no indication of impairment of the value of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (CGU) identified according 
to the country of operation and business segment.
During the year a transfer of goodwill from support services to client services 
occurred due to integration of yacht Help Group into concierge Monaco.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:

Total  
£
Europe 1,794,265 13,436,342 15,230,607
The recoverable amount of CGU is determined based on value-in use calculations. 
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets 
approved by management covering a four year period. Cash flow beyond four year 
periods is extrapolated using the price earnings ratio to determine the terminal value.
The key assumptions used for value in use calculations are as follows:
Support 
services
Client 
services
Revenue growth 5–10% 5–10%
GP margin 4.5% 10–100%
Expenses growth 5% 5%
Discount rate 14.65% 14.65%
PE ratio 7 7
The assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU within each business 
segment.
Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and 
its expectations of market development. The discount rates used are pre-tax and 
reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments and the cost of borrowings. f INANCIAL STATEMENTS

currently at 0.5%. The overdraft facility is due for renewal in December 2011.
c apital risk The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits 
to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost 
of capital.
m arket risk The market may not grow as rapidly as anticipated. The Group may lose customers 
to its competitors. The Group’s major competitors may have significantly greater 
financial resources than those available to the Company. There is no certainty that 
the Company will be able to achieve its projected levels of sales or profitability.
c re Dit risk The Group’s principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other 
receivables. The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counter parties are 
banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies. The 
Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade. The amounts presented in 
the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables. An allowance for 
impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous 
experiences, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows. The 
Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a 
large number of counter parties and customers.

22. RISK AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, capital risk and credit risk. The Group’s activities 
also expose it to non-financial risks: market risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management programme focuses on unpredictability and seeks to minimise the 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The Board, on a 
regular basis, reviews key risks and, where appropriate, actions are taken to mitigate 
the key risks identified.
i nterest rate an D forei Gn currency risk The Group does not have formal policies on interest rate risk or foreign currency 
risk. However, the Group’s exposure in these areas (as at the balance sheet date) 
was minimal.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings 
that are denominated in a currency other than Pound Sterling (£). The Group 
maintains a natural hedge that minimises the foreign exchange exposure by matching 
foreign currency income with foreign currency costs.
The Group does not consider it necessary to enter into foreign exchange contracts 
in managing its foreign exchange risk resulting from cash flows from transactions 
denominated in foreign currency, given the nature of the business for the time being.
The net unhedged financial assets and liabilities of the Group that are denominated in 
its functional currency are as follows: f INANCIAL STATEMENTS

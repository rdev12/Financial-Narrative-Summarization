The Group’s markets
Construction
The total construction market was forecast to be around £106bn  
in 2011. The market can be subdivided into three submarkets;  
public, regulated and private. Within each submarket are key  
sectors and the Group’s revenues in those sectors are as follows:
Market dynamics
     Overall market challenging due to 
macroeconomic backdrop of faltering  
growth for the economy and the resulting 
impact on conﬁdence
    Public sector spending will impact from 2012 
onwards, leading to reduced construction 
opportunities in the sector
    Investment in infrastructure is forecast to rise, 
driven by the Government’s £250bn National 
Infrastructure Plan
    Investment by water companies is peaking  
in the middle of the current investment cycle
    Private commercial sector is slowly 
recovering, led by improving conditions  
in London and the South East
    Housing margin improving, albeit market 
remains constrained by lack of mortgage 
availability for ﬁrst-time buyers.

Regeneration
Working in long-term partnerships with clients to use their land 
assets to achieve large-scale social and economic renewal.
The Group’s approach
    Regeneration is driven by the release of  
public sector land to enable economic  
and social renewal
    Schemes are usually complex and seek  
to transform sub-optimised land to  
improved uses
    The improved uses include commercial 
offices, residential, retail, leisure and  
light industrial
    Schemes, whether mixed-use or housing-led, 
are delivered over a long time frame, usually 
10–15 years
    Group invests and recycles working capital  
on a phase-by-phase basis
    Affordable Housing focuses on housing-
led regeneration, particularly mixed-tenure 
schemes
    Urban Regeneration and Investments  
focus on mixed-use regeneration in  
major urban areas. 
Factors driving regeneration
    Clients seek partners with a track record  
of successful delivery, ﬁnancial strength  
and the ability to source private ﬁnancing  
to fund regeneration

2011 has seen a resilient performance 
from the Group, delivering results in  
line with our expectations consistently 
over the past 12 months despite 
demanding market conditions.
The Group’s results are testament  
to our straightforward approach  
to construction and regeneration.  
This is underpinned by our relentless 
focus on quality through the rigorous 
application of our own Perfect Delivery 
programme and the creative and 
innovative approach we bring  
to projects.
Strategy for success
For a number of years the Group’s goal has been 
to create leading positions in our chosen sectors 
and we continue to make signiﬁcant progress 
towards that goal. We measure our performance 
by the quality of our margin, not necessarily by 
the size of a project and we achieve a premium 
margin by providing our clients with an 
exceptional service.
Achieving success in today’s market means 
staying focused on what we do best within the 
sectors we know well. We deﬁne success in a 
number of ways, from achieving quality margin 
and growing the business proﬁtably through to 
being nominated the partner of choice, selected 
as the preferred employer and considered a 
responsible and forward-thinking group. 
We have achieved success this year, through 
winning key construction opportunities in 
growth areas of the market, namely energy, 
transport and commercial as well as growing  
our regeneration pipeline of work by securing 
ﬁve major schemes together valued at £0.8bn.
“Our strategy to maintain 
our construction market 
position and grow our 
regeneration pipeline 
will allow us to capitalise 
on the signiﬁcant 
opportunities that 
undoubtedly exist in  
the UK. We enter the 
new ﬁnancial year in  
a strong position to 
deliver sustained  
long-term value for  
our shareholders  
and clients.”
Looking ahead, our strategic focus is to develop 
our market position across our construction 
activities and to use the cash generated from 
those operations to invest in, and grow, our 
regeneration-related businesses. We continue  
to broaden our capability and service to our 
clients through the Group’s ability to deliver 
large-scale complex projects and believe our 
chosen markets offer the best prospects for 
quality margin in our industry and the greatest 
potential for revenue growth.
Enabling growth
The breadth of our skills extends across a wide 
range of sectors where we have built leading 
reputations and this enables us to be ﬂexible in 
our approach and to target those sectors that 
offer the most growth potential.
Our extensive capability in Construction  
and Infrastructure, Fit Out, Affordable Housing 
and Urban Regeneration, underpinned by 
Investments’ ability to offer ﬁnancing solutions, 
allows us to reduce project complexities  
and optimise opportunities for our clients  
and partners.
Working in partnership to deliver regeneration
There is an acute need to promote economic 
improvement and social inclusion alongside 
regenerating the physical fabric of many of  
our towns and cities and the Group remains 
conﬁdent in the prospects offered by this 
market, driven by the release of land by the 
public sector. Regeneration is all about working 
in long-term partnerships with our clients, using 
their land assets to achieve large-scale social  
and economic renewal.
The public sector owns an estimated £17bn 
portfolio of surplus land and property assets.  
In a market with diminishing in-house expertise 
and an increasing reliance on private sector 
funding to progress critical regeneration

schemes, our ability to provide creative  
funding solutions, along with our development 
and construction expertise, positions us as an 
attractive regeneration partner and provides  
us with signiﬁcant investment opportunities in 
the medium and long term.
Our people
I spend much of my time visiting our offices  
and projects and I am always impressed with  
the calibre and integrity of our people across  
all levels. Their talent, commitment and positive 
approach are integral to the success of the 
Group. We remain committed to their well-being 
at all times and will continue to invest in their 
personal and professional development and to 
motivate and incentivise them appropriately.
The Board
I am also grateful to the members of the Board 
whose stewardship and guidance contribute 
greatly to the performance of the Group. Gill 
Barr, one of our independent non-executive 
directors, is standing down at the forthcoming 
AGM in 2012. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank Gill for her substantial contribution to 
the Group over the past seven years.
Dividend statement
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend  
of 30.0p payable on 18 May 2012, giving  
an unchanged total dividend for the fourth 
consecutive year of 42.0p for 2011.
Looking forward
We recognise that market challenges and risks 
remain and will continue to impact the year 
ahead and we believe that the medium-term 
outlook is more promising. We have positioned 
the Group to maximise opportunities in those 
sectors we believe will offer the most growth 
and reward. We continue to closely monitor our 
cost base, shape the divisions and tailor the way 
we work to respond to changes in the market. 
Our decentralised business model and lack  
of bureaucracy enable us to respond swiftly  
to shifts in economic and operating conditions, 
ensuring we remain alive to opportunities.
We entered the new year clear in our vision  
and our strategic direction. With a stable 
forward order book of £3.4bn and, importantly, 
a growing regeneration pipeline of £1.8bn, we 
are conﬁdent that we are in a strong position to 
capitalise on future opportunities and to deliver 
sustained long-term value for our shareholders 
and clients.

Chairman’s statement 10
The Group delivered in 2011 in the face 
of challenging economic conditions 
and ongoing constraints in public 
spending. We remain in a strong 
ﬁnancial position and have strategically 
positioned the Group to take advantage 
of the signiﬁcant opportunities that 
exist in the UK.
Revenue was up by 6% to £2,227m (2010: 
£2,102m) with proﬁt before tax, amortisation  
and non-recurring items of £45.3m (2010: 
£51.3m), reﬂecting the challenging market 
conditions. £1.4m (2010: £3.2m) of non-recurring 
items arose, as expected, relating to IT costs 
following the merger of the Construction and 
Infrastructure Services divisions in 2010. Proﬁt 
before tax was £40.0m (2010: £40.7m). An 
analysis of other prior year non-recurring items  
is included in note 2. Adjusted earnings per  
share before amortisation of intangible assets, 
non-recurring items and one-off tax beneﬁt 
were 82.5p (2010: 92.9p). The Group’s 
continuing investment in regeneration, increase 
in investment properties and use of shared 
equity to support open market house sales has 
been reﬂected in our average cash† for 2011 
being lower than in 2010 at £23m (2010: £63m).
Success across the board
Each division has achieved wide-ranging success 
throughout the year, demonstrating not only its 
specialist skills but also the strength and the 
value of the Group’s integrated capability. 2011 
saw higher levels of collaboration between the 
Group’s divisions than ever before. Projects that 
demonstrate the success and value of divisions 
working together include the completion, on 
time and on budget, of the Basildon Sporting 
Village. Working within a 25-year agreement 
with Basildon Borough Council, our Investments 
division provided a funding solution and 
development expertise, whilst design and 
construction services were provided by our 
Construction and Infrastructure division. Another 
example of our integrated approach is Urban 
Regeneration’s 56-acre, £300m Northshore 
development in Stockton-on-Tees which will 
“We have strategically 
positioned the Group to 
adapt to the challenging 
business environment. 
We are conﬁdent that 
our increased investment 
in regeneration and our 
focus on growth sectors 
of the market will lead to 
higher quality medium-
term returns.”
transform Stockton’s Riverside by delivering 
1.8m sq ft of offices, leisure and retail 
accommodation in addition to high quality 
housing. The ﬁrst phase is currently on site with 
our Affordable Housing division working with 
colleagues in Urban Regeneration to build 50 
energy-efficient affordable houses.
Construction and Infrastructure has performed 
in line with our expectations despite operating 
within a very competitive and challenging 
market place. With revenue slightly increased  
at £1,268m (2010: £1,250m) and operating 
proﬁt* of £21.1m (2010: £26.9m), it has further 
reinforced its market-leading positions in 
tunnelling and aviation and substantially 
strengthened its leading reputation in the  
rail, highways and energy markets. Notable 
achievements include securing major contracts 
in each of these growth infrastructure sectors as 
well as considerable success in being awarded 
new and renewed positions on some of the  
UK’s major construction frameworks. An 
example of which is the division’s appointment 
as preferred bidder, in joint venture, for an 
electricity transmission overhead line partnership 
worth up to £500m to deliver National Grid’s 
overhead line construction programme for the 
next ﬁve years. It entered the new ﬁnancial year 
with a healthy pipeline of opportunities in key 
sectors of the infrastructure market.
Fit Out has delivered another consistent 
performance for the Group. The division has 
grown market share in tough trading conditions 
with revenue increasing to £438m (2010: £415m), 
with work secured via frameworks doubling. 
Operating proﬁt* was £12.4m (2010: £14.8m).  
It has responded to market constraints by 
launching a new technology division to capitalise 
on existing skill sets and to respond to the needs 
of clients who are actively seeking an extended 
service to deliver infrastructure, data centre  
and technology-led projects. Growth markets 
identiﬁed for the new ﬁnancial year include retail 
banking, technology and the education sector 
where the division continues to work with 
universities under pressure to improve facilities 
to attract students.
Chief Executive’s review
Paul Smith
Chief Executive
Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Chief Executive’s review 11
Affordable Housing has swiftly capitalised on 
the wider business opportunities resulting from 
the successful integration of the Connaught 
business. It has exploited its full service capability 
with revenue increasing signiﬁcantly to £462m 
(2010: £387m) and secured growth in operating 
proﬁt* to £18.5m (2010: £16.1m). Its strengthened 
service offering has led to an agreement with 
Barnet Homes, worth approximately £103m over 
10 years, to deliver planned refurbishment and 
electrical work across the London Borough of 
Barnet’s 15,000-home portfolio. Its increased 
capability to provide nationwide reactive 
maintenance services, alongside its planned 
maintenance and design and build of mixed-
tenure affordable housing, has provided a strong 
platform for continuing success in 2012.
Urban Regeneration has increased its 
contribution to the Group this year with 
operating proﬁt* almost doubling to £3.9m 
(2010: £2.0m), underpinning our conﬁdence in 
the regeneration market. It has secured ﬁve 
major new schemes, substantially increased its 
regeneration pipeline to £1.6bn (2010: £1.4bn), 
with a further £0.6bn at preferred developer 
stage, and has increased its level of on site 
activity. The division is successfully positioning 
schemes to capitalise on opportunities as market 
conditions improve.
Investments has achieved notable success in 
2011 facilitating project development, primarily  
in the public sector by providing ﬂexible ﬁnancial 
solutions and development expertise. Despite 
limited opportunities the division has been 
successful in securing a £500m, 20-year 
development agreement with Bournemouth 
Borough Council and commenced the second 
tranche of schools within Hull City Council’s 
Building Schools for the Future programme. The

has increased signiﬁcantly to £49m (2010: £41m) 
providing sustained long-term value for the 
Group. We will recycle capital from maturing 
investments from time to time and recently sold 
our interest in the Dorset Fire & Rescue PFI for 
£3.8m, which was above our directors’ valuation.
An increased focus on regeneration
We are already leading a number of complex 
regeneration programmes across the country 
through our Investments, Urban Regeneration 
and Affordable Housing divisions. They are all 
working in long-term partnerships with the 
private and public sectors, unlocking land values 
for our clients and helping to regenerate 
deprived neighbourhoods across the country.
The ability of the Group to maximise 
regeneration opportunities today was 
strengthened by the acquisition of the Amec 
construction business and developments 
division in 2007. At the time we stated that the 
acquisition would open up signiﬁcant growth 
opportunities. Having strategically shaped the 
Group since then and with signiﬁcant growth 
achieved in our regeneration pipeline, currently 
standing at £1.8bn, we are now in a strong 
position to capitalise on future opportunities  
and secure organic growth in this market.
We intend to build on successes achieved to 
date and increase our focus on this market, 
allowing the Group to beneﬁt from the quality of 
returns available through medium- to long-term 
urban and residential regeneration programmes. 
The continuing reluctance of banks to lend has 
led to the forced withdrawal of many players 
from the marketplace, resulting in a less 
competitive environment. Barriers to entry are 
high and the skill sets required are a perfect ﬁt 
with the Group’s specialist expertise.
The decision to invest more signiﬁcantly in 
regeneration will create opportunities for all 
Group divisions. It will have an impact on our 
level of cash reserves but we are conﬁdent that 
our business model, which limits open market 
site acquisition and uses working capital more 
efficiently in phased developments, will ensure 
that the Group and its shareholders will beneﬁt 
from the opportunity to secure healthy, long-
term and sustainable proﬁt streams.

How we differentiate ourselves
Today’s challenging environment requires 
organisations to be insightful and agile.  
Two distinctive values of the Group are its 
decentralised structure and its culture of 
empowerment which permeates each division. 
This culture is a real strength. It stimulates 
innovation and creativity, minimises bureaucracy 
and provides each division with a signiﬁcant 
competitive advantage. It requires divisions to 
acquire a deep understanding of their markets, 
to develop specialist skills to provide an exact ﬁt 
with market requirements and allows swift 
decision making. This means our clients work 
with empowered local teams, who offer a 
richness of local knowledge, an awareness of 
client needs and are able to provide a highly 
responsive service using local supply chains.
We aim to deliver an exceptional and consistent 
quality service to our construction clients and 
regeneration partners. Throughout the Group 
we continue to differentiate our service offering 
through our relentless pursuit of Perfect Delivery 
across all construction activity and through the 
provision of market-leading client experiences. 
Clients have demonstrated the value of this 
investment in quality through long-term 
relationships and the award of new and  
renewed framework positions.
Clients are demanding a wider range of skills, 
increasingly aggregated into larger and more 
complex contracts, and a more sophisticated 
service. We have continued to broaden and 
deepen our range of services to meet these 
requirements to ensure that we are able to take 
on the most challenging schemes and reduce 
complexity for our clients.
Committed to providing a safe working 
environment
Providing a safe working environment for 
everyone remains our number one priority.  
This commitment stretches from the workplace, 
through to construction sites and beyond  
into the communities where we operate.  
We endeavour to ensure that through proper 
training and education our staff are fully 
engaged and involved in improving safety and 
that everyone understands the part they play  
in their own safety and that of their co-workers, 
our supply chains and the wider community. 
We are disappointed to report that the total 
number of incidents being reported under the 
Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous 
Occurrences Regulations (‘RIDDOR’) has risen 
to 96 from 82 in 2010. These are incidents over 
three days, which is measured by the time that  
an injury prevents a person performing their 
normal work duties. Ten of these incidents 
related to former Connaught employees.  
In the past we have experienced similar trends 
following an acquisition. We expect health and 
safety to improve as we have made a signiﬁcant 
investment in health and safety training for all 
staff that joined us from Connaught. We have 
introduced an additional health and safety  
Key Performance Indicator (‘KPI’) within our 
Roadmap for Sustainability, which is all incidents 
over one day. 2011 has been the ﬁrst year we 
have collected this data and there were 81 
one-to-three day incidents and we will use  
this ﬁgure as our baseline for future reporting  
of this KPI.
Deﬁning our business through sustainability 
As a leading construction and regeneration 
Group, we play a signiﬁcant role in creating and 
improving the built environment that we live in. 
With this role comes responsibility. For the 
people who work with us, the communities  
we operate within and the impact we have  
on the environment.
For many years our divisions have entrenched 
sustainability into their individual operations.  
2011 has been marked by the Group further 
reinforcing our pledge to provide positive and 
lasting economic, environmental and social  
gain through the launch of our Roadmap  
for Sustainability.
The Roadmap outlines key areas of strategic 
improvement where we believe we can make  
a real difference and, equally importantly, 
identiﬁes targets, milestones and long-term 
objectives together with key performance 
indicators. The Board and each of the  
Group’s ﬁve divisions are fully committed  
to the Roadmap.

The Roadmap has given us a clear sense of 
direction and will drive improvement across  
the Group. With the built environment 
responsible for over half of the UK’s carbon 
emissions, construction has a unique role to  
play in combating climate change. Our more 
strategic approach to sustainability will further 
strengthen our ability to contribute and innovate 
in today’s fast-changing environment.
Our ﬁrst dedicated Sustainability report can be 
viewed at www.morgansindall.com/sustainability 
and we look forward to sharing our progress 
over time.
Key risks to success 
The Group’s ability to successfully implement  
its strategy and achieve its goals can be  
affected by a number of key risks. Rigorous  
risk management processes are in place to 
continuously identify new risks, to understand 
their impacts and to implement effective 
mitigating actions. In particular, we are 
addressing the following:
An intelligent approach
The market sectors in which the Group  
operates are affected by general 
macroeconomic conditions and changes in 
Government spending policy. We are particularly 
focused on managing the impact on the Group 
of the current economic environment and are 
proactively investing in the long term to ensure 
the Group is in a position of strength today and 
for when market conditions improve. With 
increased competition in many sectors, it is vital 
in today’s market to be selective in the contracts 
we bid for and to be intelligent in our bidding 
process. Avoidance of competing on price alone 
and differentiating the Group’s offering on 
service and quality through our Perfect Delivery 
standard will help secure higher margins. 
A responsible attitude
The Group’s health, safety and environmental 
performance affects our staff, subcontractors 
and the public as well as our reputation and 
commercial performance. This area of our 
business continues to be a priority for the Group 
and stringent policy frameworks and systems 
are embedded within each division and are 
regularly reviewed to minimise risk.
A greater level of scrutiny
We are applying even higher levels of  
scrutiny to the management of working capital 
to implement our strategy of investing cash 
generated from construction activities into 
regeneration and to ensure the long-term 
success of the Group. Regular monitoring of 
cash levels, stress testing longer-term forecasts 
and closely monitoring overdue work in 
progress, debtors and retentions are all 
meticulously undertaken to ensure we  
continue to grow proﬁtably. 
Rigorous credit checks and due diligence are 
undertaken to assess the ﬁnancial health of 
clients to avoid ﬁnancial loss through bad debt 
and equal rigour is applied to subcontractors 
and suppliers. Our approach to supply chain 
management is based on working with suppliers 
and subcontractors to build long-term 
relationships so that together we provide our 
clients with a superior quality service.
Outlook
Our outlook is sound with a strong balance 
sheet, a steady forward order book of £3.4bn 
(2010: £3.6bn), and a signiﬁcant and growing 
regeneration pipeline of £1.8bn (2010: £1.4bn), 
with a further £0.6bn at preferred developer,  
all providing a level of resilience to economic 
ﬂuctuations. Whilst we acknowledge the 
challenges that lie ahead, we are conﬁdent that 
the investment in regeneration and focus on 
opportunities in growing sectors of the market 
will lead to higher quality and sustained  
medium-term returns.

Overview
The difficult macroeconomic environment  
has persisted throughout 2011 and looks set  
to continue through 2012. Nevertheless, the 
Group has delivered resilient results and has  
also delivered improved returns from 
regeneration activities. The Group continues  
to shape its businesses to address changing 
markets and, while there have been no material 
acquisitions in the year, the Connaught and 
Powerminster acquisitions in 2010 have been 
fully integrated and the merged Construction 
and Infrastructure businesses are now operating 
as one division. The Group continues to address 
its cost base, and further action will continue  
to be taken as necessary.
Revenue of £2,227m and operating proﬁt*  
of £46.1m
Revenue has risen by 6% to £2,227m (2010: 
£2,102m), with revenue rises across both 
construction and regeneration activities of  
£18m in Construction and Infrastructure,  
£75m in Affordable Housing, £23m in  
Fit Out and £11m in Urban Regeneration.
Operating proﬁt* has fallen by £6.3m to £46.1m 
(2010: £52.4m), with decreases in Construction 
and Infrastructure (£5.8m), and Fit Out (£2.4m) 
due to market pressure on margin, offset by 
increases in Affordable Housing (£2.4m) and 
Urban Regeneration (£1.9m). The Investments 
division incurred an operating loss of £3.9m 
(2010: £3.3m) and the cost of Group activities 
rose by £1.8m to £5.9m due to increased 
investment in IT and 2010 beneﬁting from the 
release of some historic cost accruals that were 
no longer required.
Margin across our construction activities fell, 
reﬂecting continuing strong competition for 
work and lower returns available in these 
markets. Margin fell to 1.7% (2010: 2.2%) in 
Construction and Infrastructure, to 4.0% (2010: 
4.2%) in Affordable Housing and to 2.8% (2010: 
3.6%) in Fit Out.
Net ﬁnance expense of £0.8m
The net ﬁnance expense of £0.8m (2010: £1.1m) 
has reduced due to the release of an unutilised 
provision for interest payable to HMRC following 
the resolution of discussions with HMRC over 
corporation tax matters arising following the 
Amec acquisition in 2007. This is offset by lower 
ﬁnance income due principally to lower average 
cash balances in the year of £23m (2010: £63m).
Overall, proﬁt before tax, amortisation and 
non-recurring items fell by £6.0m to £45.3m 
(2010: £51.3m). Amortisation of intangible assets 
in the year was £3.9m (2010: £5.5m) and 
non-recurring costs of IT integration following 
the 2010 merger of the Construction and 
Infrastructure Services divisions were £1.4m 
(2010: £5.1m).
Tax
The Group’s tax charge of £7.2m (2010: £10.9m) 
represents an effective tax rate of 18.0% (2010: 
26.8%), signiﬁcantly lower than the standard rate 
of corporation tax. The low effective tax rate 
arises primarily as a result of non-recurring prior 
year adjustments of £2.8m (7.0%) reﬂecting the 
resolution of discussions with HMRC over 
corporation tax matters following the Amec 
acquisition in 2007 as set out in note 6 to the 
accounts. Adjusting for this effect and other

one-off prior year adjustments gives an 
underlying effective tax rate of 26.3%  
(2010: 29.0%).
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share before 
amortisation and non-recurring items have fallen 
by 11% from 92.9p to 82.5p, reﬂecting the fall in 
adjusted proﬁt before tax offset by the decrease 
in the effective tax rate. Basic earnings per share 
have risen by 10% from 70.5p to 77.5p.
Group has substantial year end cash balances
The cash position of the Group at the year end 
was robust at £109m (2010: £149m). Average 
cash during 2010 decreased to £23m (2010: 
£63m) reﬂecting increased investment in our 
regeneration activities and increases in shared 
equity and investment property balances.
The net cash outﬂow from operating activities 
was £11.8m (2010: inﬂow of £90.6m). This is 
primarily the result of the working capital 
outﬂow of £51.6m (2010: inﬂow of £53.7m).  
This mainly reﬂects the particularly strong cash 
performance at the 2010 year end, which was 
expected to unwind in 2011. Additionally, the 
Group has £17.6m (2010: £13.9m) of shared 
equity receivables relating to open market sales 
in the Affordable Housing and Urban 
Regeneration divisions and £7.0m (2010: £2.5m) 
of investment properties, rented in order to 
maintain momentum on a small number of 
regeneration schemes. There were small net 
payments of £0.4m (2010: £35.2m) for 
acquisitions, capital expenditure was £5.4m 
(2010: £2.8m) and payments to increase 
interests in joint ventures were £6.0m (2010: 
£4.3m), all of which reﬂect ongoing investment 
in the business. Cash dividends of £0.3m  
(2010: £0.8m) were received from joint ventures. 
After tax payments, dividends and servicing  
of ﬁnance, the net decrease in cash and cash 
equivalents was £39.7m (2010: £30.9m increase).
It is anticipated that these cash resources will be 
available for the development of the Group’s 
businesses, either to fund acquisitions or invest 
in working capital as required.
Capital management
The Board intends to maintain a strong capital 
base so as to maintain investor, creditor and 
market conﬁdence and to sustain the future 
development of the Group. There were no 
changes in the Group’s approach to capital 
management during the year and the Group is 
not subject to any capital requirements imposed 
by regulatory authorities.

Finance review 16
The Group is ﬁnanced by equity, with committed 
banking facilities available to draw on to fund 
shorter-term movements in working capital. The 
Group is not particularly capital intensive, hence 
investment in ﬁxed assets is relatively low, and 
has reduced in the year, as have assets ﬁnanced 
by ﬁnance leases. The Group is seeking 
increasingly to invest cash generated by its 
construction activities in long-term regeneration 
projects that themselves can lead to construction 
opportunities for the Group. Some of these 
regeneration projects will be carried out in joint 
venture and will be funded in part by Group 
resources but will largely draw on non-recourse 
debt ﬁnance. The Group has a very small deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension plan (£1.3m deﬁcit on £9.4m of 
gross liabilities) that is closed to new members  
or further accruals.
Banking facilities committed until 2015
In the period, the Group reﬁnanced its banking 
facilities and now has £100m of committed 
banking facilities through to September 2015 
with a further £25m in place to June 2012.  
The banking facilities are subject to ﬁnancial 
covenants, all of which have been met 
throughout the year. These committed facilities 
supplement the cash balances in providing 
ﬁnancial security to the Group. 
Dividend
The Board recommends a ﬁnal dividend of 
30.0p payable on 18 May 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of business on 27 
April 2012. This will give a total dividend for the 
year maintained at 42.0p (2010: 42.0p). This is 
covered by adjusted earnings per share 2.0 
times (2010: 2.2 times). The Group’s long-term 
policy remains one of increasing the dividend 
broadly in line with the growth in earnings, 
aiming to cover the dividend by earnings 
between two-and-a-half and three times.
Although the cover has reduced to 2.0 times, the 
Board is comfortable with this as the dividend is 
covered by current proﬁts and can be met from 
existing ﬁnancial resources. The Group will seek 
to re-establish the longer-term level of cover as 
and when proﬁts increase.
Continuing balance sheet strength
T otal equity increased to £235.6m (2010: £221.7m). 
The number of shares in issue at 31 December 
2011 was 43.2m (2010: 43.2m). A small increase 
of 27,019 shares resulted from the exercise of 
options under employee share option schemes.
In the course of the year, fair values relating to 
the 2010 acquisition of the business, obligations 
and certain assets from the administrators of 
Connaught Partnerships Limited were ﬁnalised. 
This led to further adjustments of £1.1m, with 
goodwill recognised on acquisition increasing by 
an equivalent amount. Additionally, the Group 
acquired the investment of its partner in a joint 
venture for a consideration of £0.4m, leading to 
a decrease in goodwill of £0.2m and an increase 
to intangible assets of £0.2m. During the year 
the Group signed strategic supply agreements 
with its general plant and site accommodation 
suppliers that led to the transfer of existing plant 
and equipment to them as part of the agreement. 
This largely contributed to a fall in the overall 
ﬁxed assets deployed in the business of £6.8m.
Consistent approach to treasury risk 
management 
The Group has clear treasury policies which set 
out approved counterparties and determine the 
maximum period of borrowings and deposits. 
Deposits are restricted to periods of no longer 
than three months. The Group has very limited 
exposure to foreign exchange risk because its 
operations are based almost entirely in the UK, 
but committed foreign exchange exposures are 
hedged as and when they arise.

Some of the Group’s joint venture businesses  
use interest rate swaps to hedge ﬂoating interest 
rate exposures and Retail Prices Index swaps  
to hedge inﬂation exposure. In the course of  
the year a construction joint venture, in which 
the Group participates, entered into foreign 
exchange contracts in order to hedge foreign 
exchange exposures on the provision of 
construction services. The Group considers  
that its exposure to interest rate, foreign 
exchange and inﬂation movements is 
appropriately managed.
In the normal course of its business, the Group 
arranges for ﬁnancial institutions to provide 
customers guarantees (‘bonds’) to provide some 
ﬁnancial protection in the event a contractor fails 
to meet its commitments under the terms of a 
contract. The Group pays a fee and provides a 
counter-indemnity to the ﬁnancial institutions  
for issuing the bonds. As at 31 December 2011, 
contract bonds in issue under uncommitted 
facilities covered £204.1m (2010: £171.8m) of 
contract commitments of the Group.
Further information on the Group’s use of 
ﬁnancial instruments is explained in note 29  
to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with  
the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position, are set out in this 
business review. The ﬁnancial position of the 
Group, its capital management policy, its cash 
ﬂows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities 
are also described above.
In addition, note 29 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements includes the Group’s ﬁnancial risk 
management objectives; details of its ﬁnancial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had cash  
of £109m and committed banking facilities of 
£100m extending to September 2015 with a 
further £25m in place to June 2012.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group 
should be able to operate within the level  
of its available banking facilities.
The directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual ﬁnancial statements.

Risk review
The Group’s strategy is to develop  
the market position of its construction 
activities and to use the cash generated 
from those activities to invest in 
housing-led and mixed-use regeneration 
to generate higher levels of return.
The Group has put in place a risk 
management framework to identify 
risks to the business achieving its goals 
and to document controls to manage 
and mitigate these risks. Risk registers 
document these risks and controls at 
different levels within the organisation; 
Group, Division, Business Unit and 
Project. These risk registers are 
reviewed at least every six months to 
ensure that risks are properly evaluated 
and that controls remain appropriate. 
The Internal Audit function audits the 
control environment to ensure that the 
risks and controls identiﬁed are tested 
at least every two years, which cover a 
blend of project and corporate level risks.
It is the role of the Group’s audit committee to 
monitor and approve the work undertaken by 
the Internal Audit function and to ensure that  
the internal audit process remains efficient  
and effective. This monitoring process has  
been strengthened by audit committees being 
established separately for the Construction and 
Infrastructure and Affordable Housing divisions, 
which have larger and more complex operations 
than the other divisions.
The control environment is underpinned  
by a clear set of delegated authorities that  
deﬁne processes and procedures for approving 
key decisions, particularly with regard to  
project pre-qualiﬁcations, tender pricing and  
bid submission. This ensures that projects  
are approved at the appropriate level of 
management, with the largest and most 
complex projects being approved at  
Board level. 
The following key risks to the Group achieving its 
strategic goals have been identiﬁed by the Board.

Fall in construction activities may 
result in less cash being generated 
which will reduce the capital available 
to invest in regeneration.
Overcapacity in market
This leads to pricing competition and 
more onerous terms and conditions 
being sought by customers.
Increased price competition leads to 
downward pressure on margins and 
an increased risk proﬁle if onerous 
terms and conditions are accepted. 
Ultimately overheads may not be 
covered by gross margins if project 
losses are incurred. 
Mitigation
Sector spread and diversiﬁcation offer some 
protection against decline in individual sectors
Scale also gives some protection by enabling 
us to compete and work in areas with higher 
barriers to entry
Regular monitoring and reporting of ﬁnancial 
performance, work won, prospects and pipeline 
of opportunities.
Delegated authorities in place require approval 
of tenders by appropriate level of management, 
covering both price and terms and conditions
Seek to differentiate the Group through the 
quality of the service and consistency of delivery
Regular review of resource levels against 
anticipated workload.
Environmental or safety incident
An accident or incident causes harm 
to individuals or a community and 
leads to a major loss of corporate 
reputation.
Consequently the Group fails to 
pre-qualify for contracts due to poor 
HSE track record.
Business conduct
Failure by employees to observe the 
appropriate standards of integrity and 
conduct in dealing with customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders.
Could expose the Group to signiﬁcant 
potential liability and reputational 
damage that results in it failing to 
pre-qualify for contracts.
Key executives with speciﬁc responsibility for HSE 
are identiﬁed in each division and on the Board
HSE policy frameworks are communicated and 
senior managers appointed in each division
Established safety systems, site visits, monitoring 
and reporting (including near miss and potential 
hazard reporting) are in place across the Group
Investigation and root cause analysis of accidents 
or incidents and near misses
Regular HSE training and updates including 
behavioural training.
Independent raising concerns phone line available 
for all employees
Audit committee reviews incidents log from the 
raising concerns phone line which includes the 
outcome of investigations into such incidents 
and any follow up actions
Ethics policy communicated to all employees
Reviews and risk assessments undertaken by Group

Risk review Risk description
Contractual risks
The Group undertakes 
several hundred contracts 
each year and it is important 
that contractual terms 
reﬂect risks arising from 
the nature and complexity 
of the works and the 
duration of the contract.
Impacts
Misprice contract
When pricing a contract, the planned 
works are not costed correctly or risk 
is not properly evaluated leading to 
a contract being mispriced.
Leads to loss of proﬁtability on 
a contract and reduces overall 
gross margin.
Managing changes to contracts 
and contract disputes
As contracts progress there are 
inevitably changes to the works 
being delivered and a risk exists 
that the Group does not get properly 
reimbursed for the cost of the 
changes as a result of disagreement, 
poor commercial controls or disputes.
Leads to costs being incurred 
that are not recovered and loss of 
proﬁtability on a contract. Ultimately 
we may need to resort to legal 
action to resolve disputes which 
can prove costly, and the outcomes 
can be uncertain.
Poor project delivery
The quality of workmanship or poor 
commercial and operational delivery 
of a contract does not meet clients’ 
expectations.
Interim cash payments may be 
withheld impacting working capital 
and issues may also impact contract 
proﬁtability and corporate reputation.
Poor contract selection
Risk that the Group accepts a contract 
outside of its core competencies.
This may lead to poor understanding 
of project risks, poor project delivery 
and ultimately result in contract losses 
and reputational damage.
Mitigation
System of delegated authorities governs tenders 
and the acceptance of work
A contract tender is reviewed at three key stages: 
pre-qualiﬁcation, pre-tender and ﬁnal tender 
submission
Contract tender approved by appropriate level of 
management.
Work carried out under standard terms 
wherever possible
Well established systems of measuring and 
reporting project progress and estimated outturns
Contract terms reviewed at tender stage and 
any variations approved by the appropriate 
level of management
Decision to take legal action based on appropriate 
legal advice
Suitable provision made for legal costs.
Strategic trading arrangements in place with key 
suppliers and subcontractors to help ensure 
consistent quality
For very signiﬁcant purchases on large projects, 
forward orders can be placed on a longer timescale
Collation and review of client feedback
Lessons learned exercises carried out on projects
Sta incentivised on basis of contract performance
Cross-regional peer reviews. 
Business planning identiﬁes sectors and clients 
that the Group will target
System of delegated authorities governs tenders 
and the acceptance of work
Plans for speciﬁc types of work and contract size 
agreed by individual business unit.
Risk description
Counterparty and 
liquidity risk
The terms on which 
the Group trades with 
counterparties aect its 
liquidity. Without sucient 
liquidity, the Group’s ability 
to meet its liabilities as 
they fall due would be 
compromised, which could 
ultimately lead to its failure 
to continue as a going 
concern. Further disclosure 
on liquidity risks and 
liquidity risk management 
is contained in note 29 to 
the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements.
Acquisitions
The Group regularly 
identiﬁes and evaluates 
potential acquisitions 
and it is important that 
acquisitions deliver the 
planned beneﬁts.
Impacts
Insolvency of key client, 
subcontractor or supplier
Risk that insucient credit checks 
and due diligence is not undertaken 
and that a key client, subcontractor 
or supplier becomes insolvent.
Insolvency of a client may result in 
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial loss due to bad 
debt. Insolvency of a subcontractor 
or supplier may disrupt a contract’s 
programme of work and lead to 
increased costs in ﬁnding 
replacements for their services.
Management of working capital
Risk that poor management of 
working capital leads to inadequate 
liquidity and funding problems.
The lack of liquidity impacts the 
Group’s ability to continue to trade 
or restricts its ability to invest in 
regeneration schemes.
Mitigation
Work only carried out for ﬁnancially sound clients, 
established through credit checks
Speciﬁc commercial terms, including payment terms, 
with escrow accounts used as appropriate
Seek and obtain ﬁnancial security where appropriate
Work with approved suppliers wherever possible
Contracts with clients, subcontractors or suppliers 
only entered into after review at appropriate level of 
delegated authority.
Regular monitoring of cash levels and forecasting 
of cash balances
Regular stress testing of longer-term cash forecasts
Regular assessment of the level of banking facilities 
available to the Group
Overdue work in progress, debtors and retentions 
monitored and actioned as appropriate.
Integration of acquisition
Group fails to deliver beneﬁts sought 
at time of the acquisition, through 
issues with due diligence, strategic 
assessment, alignment of cultures or 
other reasons. Unknown liabilities are 
uncovered subsequent to completion.
The impact is potential loss of 
proﬁtability and reputation and that 
excessive resources are required to 
be directed towards the acquisition.
All acquisitions approved at Board level
Commercial and ﬁnancial due diligence led by 
senior teams, with clear roles and responsibilities
Post acquisition integration plans prepared

The Group’s Construction and 
Infrastructure division comprises 
principally Morgan Sindall and the 
design activities of Morgan Sindall 
Professional Services. The division 
employs around 4,000 people 
delivering public and private sector 
projects of all sizes. The division has 
been appointed on some of the UK’s 
most complex construction and 
engineering projects where it provides 
specialist tunnelling, utilities, building, 
civil engineering and mechanical and 
electrical services. The division is 
equally adept at smaller projects and 
repair and maintenance works. Its 
differentiating design business also 
operates within its own right, providing 
expertise in complex environments 
including the regulated pharmaceutical, 
nuclear and rail industries.
“We are conﬁdent that we 
enter 2012 in a position of 
strength. We believe the 
combination of our track 
record, strong local presence 
and relentless focus on 
exceptional customer 
experience will continue to 
create a compelling offer. The 
depth and breadth of our skills 
and our ability to offer a fully 
integrated service on complex 
projects will allow us to 
capitalise on our strong 
pipeline of opportunities 
throughout the year.”
The division’s breadth of expertise has been  
built up through operating across a broad range 
of sectors including commercial, defence, 
education, energy, healthcare, industrial, leisure, 
retail, transport, waste and water. Either working 
as sole contractor, or in joint venture, it has 
continued to make a signiﬁcant contribution to 
the Group’s strategy and ﬁnancial performance.
Division delivers in testing market
Revenue was slightly increased at £1,268m 
(2010: £1,250m) with reduced operating proﬁt* 
and margin of £21.1m and 1.7% respectively 
(2010: £26.9m, 2.2%), reﬂecting extremely 
challenging and competitive trading conditions. 
This performance was in line with our 
expectations. The division has delivered major 
projects, won awards of national signiﬁcance 
and secured and retained long-term framework 
agreements, enabling the division to enter 2012 
with a healthy forward order book. 2011 saw the 
division appointed to eight new frameworks, 
renewed four others, bringing its total number of 
frameworks to 57. Its recently integrated offering

Project: Paddington Station
Client: Network Rail
In September 2011 Morgan Sindall 
successfully completed, to an 
agreed time and budget, the  
£43m renewal of the Grade 1 
listed Paddington Station Span  
4 roof. The project included 
demolition, structural steel 
repairs, structural strengthening, 
cladding, glazing, platform tiling, 
painting and mechanical and 
electrical installation. The project 
was undertaken for customer 
Network Rail and key stakeholder 
English Heritage and was carried 
out above a live public area  
and railway line. 
“As a station development  
it’s an achievement that 
everyone in the Morgan 
Sindall team can celebrate 
and be immensely proud of. 
The Morgan Sindall team 
members that interfaced  
with the shift station manager 
team on a shift basis were 
brilliant. The very ﬁrst 
morning when the last 
section of crash deck and 
scaffolding had been 
removed, I emerged from  
the Bakerloo line exit near

the new roof-line and simply 
stopped walking as did a few 
other passengers.”

within the road, rail and airport sectors where 
major clients attach signiﬁcant value to the 
broader service. 
Operating within a testing market, it has focused 
on driving efficiencies across the business, 
protecting margins and setting new standards in 
customer service. Delivering in line with ﬁnancial 
expectations in the current economic climate is a 
notable achievement and the division has been 
especially successful in securing opportunities in 
the growing infrastructure sectors of roads, rail, 
aviation and energy distribution.
Growing reputation in infrastructure 
A year ago the division identiﬁed a number of 
growing sectors of the market and set out to 
secure key opportunities in each. It has been 
successful in achieving this goal through a mix  
of securing high proﬁle projects and major 
framework appointments and renewals.
Within the rail sector, Crossrail continues to be a 
valued client. The largest construction project in 
Europe, Crossrail will deliver a 118km rail line 
linking Maidenhead and Heathrow in the West 
with Shenﬁeld and Abbey Wood in the East. 
New awards in 2011, gained through the division 
working on its own or in joint venture, totalled 
over £415m and include construction of a new 
station at Pudding Mill Lane, the Whitechapel 
and Liverpool Street station tunnels and 
Whitechapel main station works. Also in the rail 
sector, the Colas Rail Morgan Sindall joint venture 
has been selected to carry out works over three 
years on the £750m Enhancements Multi Asset 
Framework Agreement, delivering a range of 
civils, track and signalling projects for Network 
Rail. 
In the energy sector, the division has been 
appointed preferred bidder, in joint venture,  
for an electricity transmission overhead line 
partnership worth up to £500m to deliver 
National Grid’s overhead line construction 
programme for the next ﬁve years. In addition,  
a Morgan Sindall consortium has been awarded 
a ﬁve-year contract extension by National Grid’s 
Electricity Alliance Central to deliver major 
enhancements to the UK’s electric transmission 
infrastructure.
Within aviation, the division has reinforced its 
market-leading position and is currently working 
at nine of the UK’s 15 major airports. Highlights 
include the delivery of Gatwick Airport’s £50m 
North Terminal extension for owners Global 
Infrastructure Partners; the award of a place on 
Gatwick’s construction framework for its £1.2bn 
programme of upgrades and improvements;  
the construction of the £10m Air Traffic  
Control Tower at Birmingham Airport and the 
securing of the £7m Air Traffic Control Tower 
construction project at Manchester Airport. The 
division’s full service offering is being utilised by 
BAA in the design and build of a new £30m 
energy centre at Heathrow Airport. 
On the UK’s highways, the division completed 
the £440m M74 project in Scotland working  
in joint venture and has also been awarded a 
£136m joint venture construction contract  
to upgrade the M62 as part of the Highways 
Agency’s four-year, up to £2bn, National Major 
Projects Framework.

Client: Crossrail
The C350 Pudding Mill project involves the 
construction of a tunnel portal and a new elevated 
Docklands (‘DLR’) station at Pudding Mill Lane as 
the Crossrail route runs through the existing station. 
Following the opening of the new station in 2013, 
the existing station will be demolished to enable  
the construction of a cut and cover tunnel and 
covered ramp to connect the planned Crossrail 
tunnel to the existing Network Rail infrastructure.  
A range of associated works will be required 
including the construction of bridges, a six span 
viaduct, new retaining walls and also mechanical 
and electrical ﬁt out.

Water remains an important sector with the 
division supporting some of the UK’s leading 
water authorities. Work continues on the 
four-mile Lee Tunnel, London’s deepest ever 
tunnel, helping to create a cleaner, healthier River 
Thames. Undertaken for Thames Water, the 
£417m project is set for completion in 2015. In 
joint venture, the division has been appointed to 
build a pioneering bio-gas plant with a contract 
value of £25m as part of Yorkshire Water’s AMP5 
Large Projects framework to which the joint 
venture was appointed in 2010.
Education continues to be a successful sector  
for the division, despite cuts in public spending. 
South Lanarkshire Council appointed the  
division to a four-year, £150m primary school 
modernisation programme – the latest phase  
of the council’s new build and refurbishment 
framework for its primary estate.
Integrated approach
Opportunities were also secured in conjunction 
with the Investments division. They include 
working on the 20-year Bournemouth Town 
Centre Vision, securing contracts to the value  
of £65m as part of Hull City Council’s Building 
Schools for the Future programme and 
continuing to deliver the design and build 
contract for the £95m Tayside Acute Adult 
Mental Health Developments project in Scotland. 
Joint appointment with the Affordable Housing 
division, Lovell, on the £3bn Constructing West 
Midlands framework demonstrates the value  
of divisions working together, as does working  
on a number of projects as part of the division’s 
reappointment on the £1bn Improvement and 
Efficiency South East (‘iESE’) framework with 
the Group’s specialist Fit Out business, Overbury. 
Focus on growth sectors
With an encouraging forward order book of 
£1.6bn (2010: £2.0bn), together with projects  
at preferred bidder stage valued at £0.3bn, the 
division’s strategy for 2012 focuses on building  
its market position and continuing to broaden its 
market offering. At the core of the strategy lies 
seeking opportunities where the division can 
add real value through working in open and 
transparent collaboration, identifying innovative 
solutions and delivering exceptional customer 
experience. The focus remains on growth 
sectors where superior expertise is demanded, 
where a track record is a requisite and where 
margins are less constrained. Sectors include 
road, rail, aviation and energy distribution, which 
are all areas where the division has an enviable 
reputation through its delivery record and 
trusted approach. The commercial sector in 
London is another market where the integrated 
offering of construction and ﬁt out being 
delivered together is considered of value.
The division will continue to respond to its 
challenging environment through selective 
bidding for opportunities that best suit its 
strengths. Identifying innovative best value 
solutions for clients remains a priority alongside 
the development and careful management of 
supply chains.

projects and we believe that the division has 
taken further market share, now standing at  
over 25%. 
Despite continuing tight margins and price 
sensitivity, clients have demonstrated that the 
division’s brand reputation, exceptional 
standards in delivery and market-leading 
customer experience are valued at a premium. 
Work secured via frameworks has doubled with 
a mix of new awards and renewals. The division’s 
considerable investment in quality has been 
rewarded with exceptional levels of loyalty from 
its framework clients including Royal Bank of 
Scotland, the BBC, Threadneedle and Liverpool 
Victoria amongst others. 
Its track record in successfully delivering 
complex projects within demanding time scales, 
whether buildings are vacant or occupied, has 
positioned the division as the partner of choice  
in the eyes of owners, occupiers and consultants.
Growth in new sectors
2011 saw the division deliver another consistent 
performance for the Group. A new technology 
division was launched in direct response to the 
needs of clients who seek an extended service  
to deliver infrastructure, data centre and 
technology-led projects. The formation of this 
new business has allowed the division to further 
develop existing relationships and it has secured 
opportunities with Northern Trust and has a 
healthy list of ongoing opportunities in this 
dynamic market. The division’s decentralised 
structure has allowed the creation of specialised 
teams with sector speciﬁc skills, operating on a 
wide range of projects from dedicated regional 
offices with a new office opening in Leeds.
The division has increased its share of retail 
banking frameworks and is a partner for three  
of the ﬁve major UK banks. It can now offer an 
integrated service to meet the banks’ office, 
retail and data centre needs. With appointment 
to the HSBC framework and a widened remit 
with the Royal Bank of Scotland, retail banking 
remains a priority growth sector.
Major project wins during the year include the 
appointment by the Industrial and Commercial 
Bank of China to ﬁt out its UK headquarters in 
London. This is the second of China’s prominent 
‘big four’ banks to appoint Fit Out, following the 
successful delivery of the large-scale ﬁt out for 
Bank of China’s London headquarters.
An exemplar project for the division has been 
the completion of the ﬁt out of prestigious new 
offices for Macquarie Bank in London under  
a pioneering best practice alliance contract, 
encouraging close collaboration between the 
client and the project team. 
At MediaCity UK in Salford Quays, Manchester, 
the division has completed two major projects. 
The £18m ﬁt out of the University of Salford’s 
new 100,000 sq ft facility, converting office 
space into a digital learning, teaching and 
research centre and the major ﬁt out of the

Stable outlook
The London office market is not expected to 
grow in the short term, constrained by lack of 
Grade A space, developers unable to access 
ﬁnance and subdued occupier sentiment. 
Current conditions will be mitigated in part by 
the division’s growth in technology and retail 
banking projects and its continuing successful 
focus on the resilient sub £1m market. However, 
the economic environment is resulting in 
increasing levels of mergers, demergers and 
acquisitions which inevitably lead to space 
rationalisation, generating opportunities for  
ﬁt out and refurbishment. The market is 
expected to improve from 2013 due to a 
substantial increase in lease expiries across  
the country and preparations are already 
underway to enable the division to capitalise 
from this expected wave of new opportunities.
The division’s order book currently stands at 
£216m (2010: £180m) which underpins a stable 
outlook for 2012. It will continue to focus on  
the growing technology and retail banking 
sectors and anticipates expanding its track 
record within the education sector, working  
with universities under pressure to improve their 
facilities to attract students. Another area of 
anticipated growth is through collaboration with 
Construction and Infrastructure to offer a fully 
integrated ﬁt out and construction service.

division operates under the Lovell 
brand name and functions through 
seven regional businesses across  
the UK and a national responsive 
repairs service. It is the UK’s complete 
affordable housing solutions specialist 
with market-leading expertise in 
designing and building new homes, 
refurbishing existing accommodation 
and providing a wide range of 
maintenance services. Lovell has  
the technical expertise to take on 
regeneration projects with a high 
degree of complexity and, having 
adopted the Group’s decentralised 
approach and spirit of empowerment,  
it allows its regional businesses to 
operate with signiﬁcant autonomy, 
offering clients a blend of crucial local 
understanding and national award-
winning expertise.
“Lovell is well placed to 
continue its successful 
performance in 2012 through 
our market-leading position, 
ﬂexible partnering approach 
and our ability to play a 
pivotal role to help clients 
overcome funding constraints 
and meet the national need 
for quality mixed-tenure 
affordable housing.” 
Since the Connaught acquisition in 2010, Lovell 
has continued throughout 2011 to consolidate  
its market-leading position. The increased scope 
and scale of its response maintenance activities 
now enables the division to provide local 
authorities and housing associations with a 
nationwide service offering, alongside planned 
maintenance and the design and build of 
affordable and open market housing.
Identifying and implementing creative solutions 
with local authority landowners and working in 
trusted collaboration with housing associations, 
Lovell helps clients meet their objectives through 
the provision of its expert skills. Whether 
injecting new vitality and pride into worn-down 
neighbourhoods or creating sustainable new 
communities, Lovell leaves a lasting legacy 
wherever it operates throughout the country. 
2011 growth reﬂects broader offering
Revenue was signiﬁcantly increased at £462m 
(2010: £387m) which reﬂects a full year of the 
enlarged business following the Connaught 
acquisition. Operating proﬁt* increased to 
£18.5m (2010: £16.1m) with the margin ﬁrm  
at 4.0% (2010: 4.2%).

Affordable Housing Project: Northshore, Stockton-on- T ees
Partner: Muse Developments
Work underway on Phase One of Northshore, a £300m 
housing and regeneration scheme in Stockton-on-Tees 
where Lovell is building 50 energy-efficient affordable 
houses. The 56-acre mixed-use regeneration scheme is 
set to transform Stockton’s riverside by delivering over 
1.8m sq ft of offices, leisure and retail accommodation in 
addition to high quality housing.

“In Lovell, we have a partner with the expertise and experience  
to deliver the contemporary, cutting-edge homes that are key  
to turning our vision for Northshore into reality. The company  
has a proven track record in creating stylish, energy-efficient 
homes that help form communities where people really want to 
live. Its commitment to the highest standards of customer service 
is fully borne out by our experience of working with the team  
on site at Northshore. Lovell has become a respected member  
of the community through its support for a wide range of local 
initiatives and we value its dedication to delivering a long-term 
legacy for the area.”

Affordable Housing 32
House sales are continuing to be constrained  
by the lack of mortgage availability and the 
division’s shared equity offering is continuing to 
support sales, in particular to ﬁrst-time buyers. 
On a small number of sites Lovell has retained 
some completed properties for rental in order  
to maintain momentum and contribute to the 
success of the overall regeneration project. With 
the public sector experiencing the impact of the 
Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review, 
Lovell has honed its business to adapt to market 
conditions and to respond to opportunities.
The division has achieved an improved result  
in 2011, further reinforcing its market-leading 
position. Working under development 
agreements with local authority landowners 
enables the division to access land, avoiding the 
risk associated with acquiring land on the open 
market and in the majority of cases allowing 
Lovell to draw down plots of land at optimum 
times. The division’s strategy of working in 
partnership with housing associations enables  
it to build affordable housing under contract 
alongside units for open market sale, providing 
the business with a stream of income and 
reducing its reliance on private sales. Lovell’s 
Service First ethos is providing clients with a 
quality product and a way of working which is 
setting new standards and achieving high levels 
of customer satisfaction.
The full year impact of the division’s enhanced 
capability to provide response maintenance 
services has resulted in signiﬁcant revenue 
growth. It has added an extra layer of resilience 
to the business and provided a substantial 
revenue stream less directly dependent on 
Government funding decisions and with 
considerable growth potential.
Major new projects secured
A real highlight for Lovell has been the successful 
integration of the acquired Connaught business. 
Investment has been made in a wide range of 
technical and health and safety training initiatives 
and installation of new business systems allowing 
the division to swiftly convert opportunities  
from its strengthened service offering. Such 
opportunities include an agreement with Barnet 
Homes, worth approximately £103m over ten 
years, to deliver planned refurbishment and 
electrical work across the London Borough  
of Barnet’s portfolio of 15,000 homes.
At Miles Platting, Manchester, Lovell is 
successfully completing the transformation of 
264 acres of an inner city housing estate into a 
sustainable mixed-tenure urban environment 
delivered through a Private Finance Initiative. 
Over 1,500 homes have been refurbished and 
over 1,000 new homes are to be built over the 
next ten years.

Lovell has built the ﬁrst council houses in 
Birmingham for 30 years. Working with newly 
created Birmingham Municipal Housing Trust,  
Lovell built 33 homes at Pershore Road, Balsall

a national regeneration award.

Compendium Living, the joint venture between 
Lovell and one of the UK’s largest Registered 
Providers, the Riverside Group, has recently 
entered into a £100m agreement with Derby 
City Council, to regenerate a 30-acre brownﬁeld 
site with 800 new homes, a new school and 
community facilities.
The division has been appointed by Birmingham 
City Council to the £3bn Constructing West 
Midlands framework working alongside the 
Construction and Infrastructure division, under 
the name Community Solutions West Midlands, 
demonstrating the synergy and value produced 
by the Group’s divisions working together. An 
additional framework win has been the selection 
of Lovell by Efficiency North on its £975m 
framework for 15 social housing providers to 
improve the homes and communities across 
Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Housing-led regeneration
The division is also working alongside its  
Urban Regeneration colleagues on the £300m 
Northshore project in Stockton-on-Tees, and in 
the ﬁrst phase of the project, Lovell is delivering 
50 energy-efficient affordable houses for open 
market sale.
In London, 63 high quality homes have been 
delivered by the division as part of a £17m 
mixed-use regeneration development in 
Clapham, working with Morgan Sindall for 
Cathedral Group and Notting Hill Housing 
Group. Lovell has also won repeat business with 
the London Borough of Hackney with the award 
of a £25m contract to build two new sustainable 
housing schemes through a groundbreaking 
land swap scheme. This award follows extensive 
work on the Borough’s housing modernisation 
programme over the past six years.
Public sector land driving mixed-tenure 
opportunities
Lovell’s forward order book is steady at £1.5bn 
(2010: £1.5bn). Despite the ongoing economic 
uncertainty, there is still strong market demand 
for the services that Lovell offers. The 
requirement for new mixed-tenure affordable 
housing, an extensive ageing local authority  
and housing association stock in need of 
refurbishment and a requirement for responsive 
and emergency maintenance of public sector-
owned homes all lie within the division’s proven 
areas of expertise. In addition the release of 
public sector land for housing will help drive 
mixed-tenure regeneration opportunities.
The tendering market is expected to remain 
competitive but it expects its full service offering 
will continue to give the business a distinct 
competitive advantage with the increasing 
number of packaged work tenders which  
require the full service capability.
The nationwide Lovell apprenticeship scheme sees 
an average of 60 craftsmen and women graduate 
each year with recognised trade qualiﬁcations and 
recently took on its 500th apprentice.

The Group’s Urban Regeneration 
division, Muse Developments, is one  
of the country’s most trusted names  
in commercial development and urban 
regeneration. Acquired in 2007, the 
division has been working in long- 
term collaborative partnerships  
to successfully deliver complex  
mixed-use regeneration schemes  
for over 25 years. 
Operating out of four regional offices across  
the country and with approximately 50 staff, 
Muse specialises in working with landowners  
and public sector partners to unlock value  
from under-developed assets to bring about 
sustainable regeneration and urban renewal.  
Its project portfolio currently comprising  
over 30 development projects at various stages 
of development, stretches across ﬁve major 
sectors: offices, residential, retail, leisure and 
industrial/distribution.
“Our objective for 2012 will be 
to further grow the business 
and become a greater 
contributor to the Group.  
Our innovative and successful 
approach to unlocking land 
values, and the Group’s 
commitment to regeneration, 
will place us in a strong 
position to further increase 
our regeneration pipeline and 
make a major contribution to 
urban renewal throughout  
the country.” 
Over the years the division has developed  
a resilient business model. It creates and 
implements innovative development 
agreements in partnership with landowners  
who require the division’s complete 
understanding of the regeneration process  
and its full service skill set to realise the potential 
of complex projects. This business model allows 
for clients to retain land which is drawn down  
in phases when construction commences.  
This reduces the amount of working capital 
required by the division.
In addition to scheme-speciﬁc partnerships, 
Muse is also an integral partner in two strategic 
partnerships: ISIS Waterside Regeneration,  
a partnership with British Waterways and  
Aviva, created to unlock the development 
potential of British Waterways non-operational 
waterside portfolio; and English Cities Fund,  
a Government-backed development vehicle  
with Legal and General and the Homes and 
Communities Agency, created to deliver 
sustainable regeneration in inner city locations.

“Since being appointed our development partner Muse has been 
very professional and has demonstrated how an innovative 
approach and determination can overcome barriers to success. 
The loss of regional funding for the Talbot Gateway scheme could 
have been a fatal blow but it did not discourage Muse, and its 
team has shown great tenacity in progressing the project, one  
of our major regeneration programmes. We are delighted that 
Sainsbury’s shares our conﬁdence in the scheme and we  
are now looking forward to a long-term and productive 
partnership with Muse.”

2011 proﬁt almost doubles
Despite tough market conditions, Muse had a 
successful year with a growing operating proﬁt* 
and marked increase in on site activity. New 
construction contracts with a value of £36m 
were let during 2011 and by the end of the year, 
construction contracts with a total value of £97m 
were on site. The division has contributed 
signiﬁcantly to the Group’s results delivering an 
increased operating proﬁt* of £3.9m (2010: 
£2.0m) on revenue of £57m (2010: £46m). It has 
also grown its regeneration pipeline substantially, 
with its share standing at £1.6bn with a further 
£0.6bn of opportunities currently at preferred 
developer status.
Muse’s proﬁt comes from a range of sources 
including active development, value-enhancing 
land trading and development management 
fees. Spread across the country, this mix avoids 
reliance on one particular source of income and 
provides a level of resilience to shifting market 
and economic conditions.
£0.8bn of major new schemes secured
Current market conditions have enabled Muse  
to work to its strengths. Namely its strong 
partnership record, proven expertise and its 
determination to identify solutions to overcome 
barriers to success. This reputation is further 
enhanced by the strong ﬁnancial backing of the 
Group and its commitment to regeneration. 
With many competitors less active in the market, 
the division has capitalised on opportunities 
throughout 2011. Signiﬁcant achievements 
include being appointed by Rolls Royce as its 
development partner for a mixed-use 
development worth up to £250m on 150 acres 
of surplus land adjacent to one of its production 
facilities in the Midlands. In Chester a new 
development agreement was concluded  
with Lloyds Banking Group and Muse achieved 
preferred developer status on three schemes  
in Warrington, Basingstoke and Stockport. 
Development agreements are expected to be 
reached on these schemes within the ﬁrst half  
of 2012. Other critical project milestones have 
been reached, including securing outline and 
detailed planning approvals on phases within 
eight major schemes throughout the country.
Warrington Borough Council selected Muse as 
preferred developer for the £130m Bridge Street 
Quarter regeneration scheme. One of the largest 
regeneration projects in the region, the scheme 
is the ﬁrst phase of the council’s 25-year 
strategic masterplan for the town centre and 
waterfront area and will provide retail, leisure  
and new offices for the council.
Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council has 
chosen the division as its preferred development 
partner for Grand Central, a £140m key gateway 
site. The project will deliver a high quality office 
quarter with quality public realm and easy 
access to the town centre, supported by a hotel 
and improved car parking.

quarter. The BREEAM-rated ‘Excellent’ building 
comprises 109,000 sq ft of high quality Grade A 
office space and is the focal point for Liverpool’s 
Central Business District. No 4 St Paul’s Square is 
already attracting prestigious occupiers.

Muse has also been named as Basingstoke and 
Deane Borough Council’s partner for a £200m 
regeneration project, working with the council  
to develop in excess of 700,000 sq ft on council-
owned sites. The scheme will include a mix  
of office space, a hotel and other supporting 
facilities. 
In Chester the division acquired a 3.5 acre site 
from Lloyds Banking Group in order to unlock 
the plans for a new Business Quarter scheme 
providing 500,000 sq ft of prime office space  
in the city centre.
Progressing existing schemes
Despite withdrawal of regional development 
agency funding, Muse is taking forward the 
£220m Talbot Gateway scheme in Blackpool. 
The scheme will create 1.1m sq ft of new retail, 
commercial, community and residential space  
as well as parking and a new transport 
interchange. A detailed planning application  
has been submitted for the ﬁrst phase and a 
pre-sale agreement has been exchanged with 
Sainsbury’s for a large format store.
In Doncaster work is progressing on the £300m 
Civil and Cultural Quarter, set to breathe new  
life into the town centre. Working within an 
innovative asset backed vehicle with Doncaster 
Council, the latest phase of construction has 
commenced to deliver a £20m theatre.
The English Cities Fund, a Muse joint venture, 
celebrated the completion of the ﬁnal phase of 
the St Paul’s Square scheme in Liverpool with 
the opening of No 4 St Paul’s Square. The £32m 
building provides a total of 109,000 sq ft of high 
quality Grade A office space over eight ﬂoors 
and is the focal point for Liverpool’s central 
business district.
In Scotland, at the 650-acre Eurocentral 
business park development, the division took 
advantage of positive investor demand to 
forward sell over 200,000 sq ft of speculative 
distribution units for £33m. 
Muse continues to provide opportunities for 
other Group divisions, working with Construction 
and Infrastructure in Doncaster and Wakeﬁeld. 
At its Northshore development in Stockton-on-
Tees, the ﬁrst phase of the £300m housing and 
regeneration scheme is underway with Lovell 
providing 50 energy-efficient affordable houses 
for open market sale. 
Further progress expected in 2012
Despite the regeneration market’s ongoing 
challenges, Muse’s signiﬁcant development 
pipeline and its successful track record allows 
the division to be conﬁdent that it has good 
visibility of where it will be able to extend its  
level of contribution to the Group’s  
ﬁnancial results.
Muse is conﬁdent that its business model  
will continue to allow it to capitalise on its 
regeneration expertise working within 
development agreements, partnering with 
landowners and its existing strategic vehicles 
and to maximise public sector, residential,  
retail and leisure opportunities. 
Project:  Doncaster Commercial and Cultural Quarter 
Partner:  Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council
Phase One of this long-term development 
partnership has created a new 190,000 sq ft 
BREEAM-rated ‘Excellent’ office for the council,  
a new performance venue and refurbished  
multi-storey car park fronting onto a major new 
public square. Muse is now master planning further 
phases of residential, leisure, retail and offices for 
future development.

operating as Morgan Sindall 
Investments, facilitates project 
development, primarily in the public 
sector, by providing ﬂexible ﬁnancing 
solutions and development expertise. 
Its scope of business covers a wide 
range of markets including urban 
regeneration, education, healthcare, 
housing, emergency services, defence 
and infrastructure. 
Its strategy is to unlock prime public sector 
construction opportunities that require the  
skill of other Group divisions. Successful 
implementation of this strategy creates revenue 
for the Group, provides a portfolio that delivers a 
sustainable return on capital investment, delivers 
proﬁts in the longer term when investments are 
realised, and contributes to the Group’s mission 
to build leading positions in all its markets. 
“Our track record in identifying 
barriers to success and 
responding with bespoke 
ﬁnancing solutions places  
us in a strong position  
to maximise market 
opportunities in 2012.” 
The division is involved in a wide range of joint 
ventures, working with private and public sector 
partners. It specialises in Private Finance 
Initiatives and property partnerships, particularly 
Local Asset Backed Vehicles (‘LABVs’) and its 
expertise includes complex land swap 
arrangements. An LABV is a long-term joint 
venture between the public and private sectors 
covering several sites within a geographic area. 
The public sector signs up to an exclusive 
arrangement with the private sector to develop  
a series of sites in line with their development 
vision, contributing the land as equity in the 
partnership against the private sector’s cash  
and expertise with proﬁts shared equally. 
Committed to optimising opportunities through 
partnerships, the Investments division shapes 
and regenerates communities through the 
delivery of affordable housing, schools, health 
and leisure facilities, emergency services and

2011 growth in portfolio value
The directors’ valuation of the investment 
portfolio has increased to £49m (2010: £41m). 
The valuation is derived from the Group’s latest 
detailed ﬁnancial models discounted using rates 
appropriate to the particular scheme’s nature 
and stage of development. These vary from 7% 
to 9% (post tax). The valuation of this portfolio is 
based on discounting expected future cash 
ﬂows but does not include potential reﬁnancing 
gains or projects at preferred bidder stage or 
proﬁt made by Investments from providing 
services or proﬁt made by other parts of the 
Group that perform the construction, 
maintenance or facilities management work.
Against the backdrop of a challenging economic 
environment, 2011 has seen Investments achieve 
considerable success. The operating result* was 
a net cost after joint venture income of £3.9m 
(2010: £3.3m) which reﬂects the costs 
associated with public sector procurement, 
managing the portfolio and also the creation of 
vehicles required for funding initiatives. This is 
mitigated by the division’s success in creating 
value for the Group through enabling other 
divisions to access a broad range of work and 
through its investment portfolio which increased 
in value signiﬁcantly during the year.
Major schemes progress
Highlights include reaching agreement on 
signiﬁcant urban regeneration schemes, 
securing ﬁnancial closure and delivering 
landmark community projects. Formal contracts 
have been signed on the Bournemouth Town 
Centre Vision LABV scheme, a 20-year project 
with a development value in excess of £500m. 
The scheme is a 50/50 joint venture public 
private partnership between Bournemouth 
Borough Council and Investments. The scheme 
is a prime example of public sector land being 
released to drive regeneration. It will deliver a 
range of residential and mixed-use development 
and the regeneration of under-utilised council 
assets will enable signiﬁcant investment in the 
public realm. The Group’s Construction and 
Infrastructure and Affordable Housing divisions 
will provide construction services once planning 
is secured and work commences on the ﬁrst site 
in early 2012.
Three additional contracts, totalling £65m, were 
awarded to Construction and Infrastructure as 
part of Hull City Council’s Building Schools for 
the Future (‘BSF’) programme. The contracts 
were awarded following ﬁnancial closure by an

The opening of the £38m Basildon Sporting 
Village demonstrates the Group’s integrated 
expertise in funding, designing and building 
community leisure facilities through public 
private partnerships. The largest sports project 
in the Thames Gateway was delivered on time 
and on budget through a 25-year agreement 
between Investments and Basildon Borough 
Council. The world class facilities will act as a 
community hub, a county and regional sporting 
venue and an international training venue for  
the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.
Wigan Life Centre, a £50m national award-
winning leisure, health, learning and information 
complex was completed and is fully operational, 
delivered via a 25-year public private agreement 
between Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council, 
Community Solutions for Leisure and Hochtief 
PPP Solutions (UK). Construction and 
Infrastructure provided a wide range of 
construction services.
Community Solutions, the health and social care 
joint venture with Barclays Infrastructure Funds, 
further strengthened its presence in the NHS 
Local Improvement Finance Trust (‘LIFT’) market 
this year through the acquisition of Primary  
Plus Limited. This acquisition, in addition to its 
investment activity, makes Community Solutions 
one of the largest management services 
providers in the LIFT market. It creates new 
partnerships with NHS and public sector 
organisations and will help secure new activity 
across the health and social care markets.
Partnership with the public sector
2012 will see Investments maintaining its strategy 
of identifying projects that offer the most 
potential to the Group and increase the value  
of its investment portfolio. With ongoing 
constraints on the public purse, local authorities 
will continue to seek viable public/private 
vehicles that facilitate development, secure 
efficiencies and boost economic growth. 
Investment options are also being explored 
around the infrastructure needs of the renewable 
energy industry where the Group’s integrated 
offering and experience can add signiﬁcant 
value. 
Subsequent to the year end the division sold  
its investment in Dorset Fire & Rescue PFI for 
£3.8m, which was above the directors’ valuation 
at 31 December 2011. This represents a discount 
rate on the directors’ valuation cashﬂows of 7%. 
This is consistent with the policy to realise 
investments from time to time in order to  
recycle capital into new opportunities.

The Roadmap for Sustainability that 
the Board and each of the Group’s ﬁve 
divisions committed to in 2011 includes 
a detailed action plan for 22 priority 
sustainability objectives. Six commitments, 
critical to drive sustainability into the 
Group’s culture, have been agreed and 
these commitments are based on the  
People: Planet: Proﬁt model. 
    Total commitment to  
a safe workplace
    Total commitment to developing 
talented employees
    Total commitment to reducing 
energy consumption and carbon 
emissions
    Total commitment to reducing waste
    Total commitment to improving 
sustainable procurement
    Total commitment to supporting 
local employment.
The Sustainability report
An important part of the Group’s renewed 
pledge to sustainability is the Morgan Sindall 
Group’s ﬁrst dedicated Sustainability report 
which will be released online at the same time as 
the Group’s annual report and accounts. It 
explains how the Roadmap for Sustainability is 
being implemented and provides a review of the 
Group’s performance over the past 12 months. 
Key Performance Indicators (‘KPIs’) are reported 
for each of the six Total Commitments. There are 
also reports on many of the other initiatives 
undertaken across all 22 priority objectives. 2011 
is the base year for reporting data within the 
Roadmap and therefore no prior data is included 
in the ﬁrst Sustainability report as new systems 
and processes have been installed during the 
year to capture key information. The Group’s 
commitment to sustainability can be seen in the 
projects, performance ﬁgures and case studies 
highlighted in the report and a dedicated 
sustainability website has also been created to 
ensure that all stakeholders, employees, 
suppliers and customers are kept up to date 
throughout the year.

Management of the Roadmap
Senior personnel play a vital part in delivering 
the Group’s Roadmap. A Group Sustainability 
Forum has been established and meets four 
times a year to review progress and agree future 
actions. The Forum includes representatives 
from the Board, the head of each division’s own 
sustainability forum and the chairperson from 
each of the following Group forums: Health and 
Safety, Environment, Human Resources and 
Procurement. Where appropriate, the Group also 
engages external advisors. These divisional and 
task-speciﬁc forums all meet regularly to 
manage relevant business issues and report 
progress to the Group Sustainability Forum.  
The Group Sustainability Forum is ultimately 
responsible for the implementation and delivery 
of the Roadmap.
The Total Commitments
1. Total commitment to a safe workplace
To ensure, through proper training and 
education, that staff are fully engaged and 
involved in improving safety in the workplace,  
at home and on their journeys to and from  
work. The Group will ensure that everyone 
understands the part they play in their own 
safety and that of their co-workers, as well as  
the wider community. Providing a safe working 
environment for employees, subcontractors and 
suppliers is vital to the continued success of the 
Group, and is a number one priority.
Objective: No lost time incidents
KPI   2011
 
RIDDOR incidents (No.) 96
The Construction and Infrastructure division 
launched its 100% Safe programme in April 
2011, a new approach to safe working that is 
centred on ﬁve pillars of Safe places, Safe by 
choice, Safe relationships, Safe by design and 
Safe lives. It has enabled the division to pull 
together the strongest elements of its historical 
behavioural programmes to ensure that a 
consistent message about 100% Safe is 
communicated to all its stakeholders.

2. Total commitment to developing  
talented employees
To help develop talent, the Group undertakes  
to provide all new staff with clear induction, 
appraisal and appropriate development 
programmes. 
Recruiting, empowering and training talented 
individuals are central to the Group’s business 
activities. Staff are encouraged to develop and 
use innovative means of delivering projects and 
be proactive in their dealings with clients, and 
the Group is committed to training and 
developing them to achieve this.
Objective: To attract and retain talented people
KPI   2011
Average number of training
days per employee 5.8
All professional staff in the Urban Regeneration 
division have undertaken and passed the 
College of Estate Management’s accredited 
programme on Introduction to Sustainability  
in the Built Environment. As part of its 
commitment to offering professional 
development opportunities to employees,  
this qualiﬁcation is considered to be of high 
value in the increasing number of European 
Union (OJEU) contract opportunities in  
which the division is now involved.
3. Total commitment to reducing energy 
consumption and carbon emissions
To play a part in reducing emissions, by 
achieving, as a minimum, a 5% year-on-year 
reduction in energy consumption. By building 
more efficiently, more resource and energy-
efficient workplaces, housing, schools and 
offices will be created, helping clients at the 
same time to reduce their own emissions. 
Climate change and the prospect of peak oil are 
potentially two of the biggest challenges facing 
society in the twenty ﬁrst century. The built 
environment accounts for over half of energy 
use and greenhouse gas emissions in the UK.  
As a leader in construction and regeneration,  
the Group recognises the important role it has  
to play in designing and delivering buildings and 
infrastructure that are more energy-efficient and 
incorporate new energy technologies. 
Objective: To demonstrate net reduction in 
carbon emissions across the Group
KPI   2011
Group carbon
emissions tonnes 70,800
This ﬁgure is a provisional result and may change subject  
to the Group’s CEMARS (Certiﬁed Emissions Management  
and Reduction Scheme) audit which will be undertaken in  
May 2012. The ﬁnal result will be published on the Group’s 
website following the completion of the audit.
During 2011, the Group achieved certiﬁcation 
under CEMARS. This internationally-recognised 
scheme recognises the actions of businesses 
and organisations that measure their 
greenhouse gas emissions, understand their 
liabilities and put in place strategies to reduce 
emissions in their organisation and more widely 
through their supply chain.
4. Total commitment to reducing waste
To improve resource efficiency, reduce the total 
amount of waste sent to landﬁll by 10% year-on-
year and undertake to commit to recognised 
waste reduction schemes, as well as 
encouraging individual initiatives. 
The UK construction industry is responsible for 
over 100m tonnes of construction, demolition 
and excavation waste every year, which 
accounts for around one third of all waste arising 
in the UK. With recognition that the UK is 
running out of landﬁll capacity, improved 
understanding of negative environmental 
impacts associated with land ﬁlled waste and 
increasing awareness of the need to use raw 
materials more efficiently, the Group believes 
that reducing the volume of construction waste 
is a priority. 44

Please note the data shown above does not include ﬁgures

business following its acquisition at the end of 2010. During 
2011, systems have been put in place to enable this data to be 
collected and reported in the 2012 report and accounts.
On a Fit Out contract in London, 100% of waste 
was reused, recycled or recovered diverting 
114.5 tonnes of waste from landﬁll. This required 
effective planning and communication with the 
client and supply chain to explore alternative 
management of waste material. Product 
recovery was a critical element in Fit Out 
achieving its targets. Working with the client, 
the division reused existing material wherever 
possible either on this or other projects. 
5. Total commitment to improving sustainable 
procurement
To ensure the Group’s supply chain plays its  
role in helping the Group meet its sustainability 
objectives. The divisions will actively support the 
Construction Industry Research and Information 
Association (‘CIRIA’) guidance on sustainable 
procurement in construction, and expect 
suppliers to source and provide sustainable 
materials. The performance of suppliers, origin  
of key materials and compliance with recognised 
certiﬁed schemes will be monitored and 
reported as part of the Group’s sustainable 
procurement policy. 
The Group requires a high level of quality, 
competitiveness and sustainability from its 
suppliers and subcontractors to ensure that  
it can continue to bid projects competitively  
and secure long-term revenue. 
Objective: To ensure that the Group supply  
chain conforms to its minimum standards  
for sustainability.
KPI   2011
Percentage of total spend that
is covered by Group-wide agreements 85
Currently over 94% by value of timber the 
Group purchases is certiﬁed or declared as 
from a sustainable source, compared to 88%  
in 2010, and directly purchased timber with  
full chain of custody stands at almost 50%  
by value. The Group has been measuring the 
average number of road miles travelled by 
bricks used in its projects for the past six years. 
By 2011 it was down to 80.5 miles per 1,000 
bricks, compared to 83.0 miles in 2010 and 
over 120 miles in 2005.
6. Total commitment to supporting  
local employment
To aim to provide sustainable employment 
opportunities based on local communities, 
schemes to recruit and train people locally  
will be monitored and measured.
Construction is a major contributor to the  
UK economy and historically a driver of GDP 
growth. Training and full-time jobs offered 
during Group projects have the potential to 
make a real difference to the local communities. 
The Group always endeavours to leave a positive 
legacy following completion of a project.
Objective: To be the employer of choice in the 
construction industry.
KPI

The Group’s Affordable Housing division is 
committed to apprenticeships as an important 
way of bringing a diverse range of talented 
people into the division and the construction 
industry as a whole. The division established its 
national apprenticeship programme in 2003, 
which sees an average of 60 men and women 
graduate each year, and has taken on its  
500th apprentice.

Corporate governance statement
48
Corporate governance statement
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a high 
standard of corporate governance in its management of the 
Group’s affairs and its dealings with all its stakeholders. At Morgan 
Sindall good governance involves establishing appropriate 
policies, procedures and guidelines to ensure that the Company’s 
core values and standards are embedded within the Group,  
whilst allowing each division to operate within a decentralised, 
empowering environment. The Board’s stewardship of these 
matters and its role in providing guidance is critical. The Group’s 
internal standards are established having regard to external 
governance codes, the applicable code being the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (‘the Code’).
Statement of compliance
The Code introduced by the Financial Reporting Council in 2010 
has applied to the Company since 1 January 2011. The Company  
is committed to managing its affairs in compliance with the 
principles and provisions of the Code, including those provisions 
only applicable to FTSE 350 companies, and is reporting here  
on this basis. A copy of the Code is available from the Financial 
Reporting Council’s website (www.frc.org.uk).
The Board has complied with the provisions of the Code 
throughout the year ended 31 December 2011 and up to the date 
of this report. A summary of how the Company has applied the 
main principles of the Code is set out below.
Strategy and risk management
During the continued challenging economic and market 
conditions in which the Group has been operating, the Board has 
reviewed and challenged its strategy to ensure that the Group is 
positioned to take advantage of opportunities in those sectors of 
the construction and regeneration markets offering the greatest 
potential for growth and reward. At the same time, the Board has 
devoted considerable time to assessing the nature and extent of 
the risks it is willing to take to achieve its strategy and to ensuring 
that an appropriate risk management structure is in place.
Despite the challenges facing the construction and regeneration 
markets, the Board remains committed to delivering strong 
performance and shareholder value.
John Morgan
Executive Chairman
Directors
Changes to the Board
The Board currently comprises an executive chairman, three 
further executive directors and ﬁve non-executive directors.  
Gill Barr has indicated her intention not to seek re-election when 
she retires at the forthcoming annual general meeting (‘AGM’)  
to be held on 3 May 2012, and this will leave four non-executive 
directors. All of the non-executive directors are considered by  
the Board to be independent and the Board’s structure, therefore, 
meets the requirements of the Code. 
Roles of the chairman, chief executive and senior independent 
director
The division of responsibility between the executive chairman  
and the chief executive is clearly deﬁned in a written schedule 
agreed by the Board. John Morgan, as executive chairman, takes 
responsibility for the overall strategy of the Group and for leading 
the Board and ensuring that it functions effectively. He sets the 
agenda for Board meetings and ensures that adequate time is 
devoted to discussion of all agenda items, facilitating the effective 
contribution of all directors. Paul Smith, as chief executive, is 
responsible for critically assessing the Group’s strategy and for  
the day to day management of the operational activities of the 
Group in accordance with the strategy and policies determined  
by the Board.
Adrian Martin, as the senior independent director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns which have not been resolved 
through the chairman or chief executive or for which contact 
through those channels is not appropriate. He also has speciﬁc 
responsibility for evaluating the performance of the executive 
chairman and meets with the other non-executive directors 
without the chairman being present at least once a year.
The Board considers that the composition of the Board and  
the balance between executive and non-executive directors is 
appropriate to the size of the Group and the need to maintain  
cost control; it also believes that the balance of relevant 
experience amongst its members, having regard in particular  
to the diverse backgrounds of the non-executive directors, 
enables it to exercise effective leadership and control of the 
Group. It also ensures that the decision making process cannot  
be dominated by any individual or small group of individuals.
Procedures for managing conﬂicts of interest operating 
satisfactorily
The directors are aware of their duties under the Companies  
Act 2006 provisions relating to the management of conﬂicts of 
interest. The Company’s articles of association (‘the Articles’) were 
amended in 2008 to give the Board a general power to authorise 
potential conﬂicts of interest. In addition to the directors’ duty to 
seek Board approval for any new potentially conﬂicting situations 
or changes to existing interests, the register of potential conﬂicts 
is circulated for review by the Board on an annual basis. This 
process was carried out satisfactorily during the year.
All directors to stand for election
The Articles require each director to submit himself or herself for 
election by shareholders at the ﬁrst annual general meeting after 
his or her appointment and for re-election at every third annual 
general meeting thereafter. The Board has agreed, however, that 
in accordance with the Code all of its continuing directors should 
submit themselves for re-election on an annual basis. Their 
biographies are set out on pages 46 and 47. The Board has  Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

considered the recommendation of the nominations committee 
on the composition of the Board. It has also considered the  
formal performance evaluation described below of the Board’s 
performance and that of individual directors. Following such 
performance evaluation, the Board believes in particular that the 
performance of all of the non-executive directors continues to be 
effective and that they continue to show commitment to their 
respective roles.
Description of Board activities
The role of the Board is to set the strategic direction of the Group, 
to review all signiﬁcant aspects of the Group’s activities, to 
supervise the executive management and to review the overall 
system of internal control and risk management. There is a formal 
schedule of matters that are speciﬁcally reserved to the Board, 
which includes the approval of the Group’s strategic plans, the 
annual budget, signiﬁcant capital expenditure and investment 
proposals, major projects, acquisitions and disposals, internal 
control arrangements and the annual and half year results. Other 
speciﬁc responsibilities are delegated to the Board committees 
described below and under the Group’s delegated authorities. 
A formal agenda for each scheduled meeting is agreed with the 
chairman and is circulated in advance of the meeting to allow time 
for proper consideration, together with relevant papers including 
key strategic, operational and ﬁnancial information.
Attendance of individual directors during 2011 at scheduled  
Board meetings and meetings of the remuneration, audit and 
nominations committees are set out below.

Non-attendance by directors at committee meetings was due  
to conﬂicting commitments. Where possible, papers were read  
in advance and comments passed to the chairman prior to  
the meeting. 
In addition to the formal meetings, the Board met on several 
occasions to consider and debate speciﬁc strategic issues 
affecting the Group and potential investment proposals, with 
input where relevant from senior management. The Board 
meeting at which the annual Group budget was approved  
was preceded by meetings with divisional management.
Training, development and advice is provided
Newly appointed directors receive a full induction, including a 
detailed information pack, visits to the Group’s operations and 
meetings with senior divisional management. Training on the role 
and responsibilities of directors is offered on appointment and 
subsequently as necessary. Other training needs for the directors 
are kept under review during the year, with brieﬁngs on new 
legislation affecting them, such as the Bribery Act 2010, being 
provided by the General Counsel and Company Secretary. 
The non-executive directors update their knowledge of and 
familiarity with the Group by regular visits to its operations.  
There are agreed procedures by which directors are able to take 
independent professional advice, at the expense of the Company, 
on matters relating to their duties. The directors also have access 
to the advice and services of the General Counsel and Company 
Secretary, who attends all Board and committee meetings.
Board evaluated its performance
The Board has noted the Code requirement for external 
facilitation of evaluations for FTSE 350 companies at least every 
three years. It decided this year, however, to continue to adopt  
an internal process to evaluate the Board’s performance and that 
of the committees and individual directors. During the year, this 
process took the form of an assessment form requiring each 
director to provide a rating against a series of statements 
designed to provoke consideration of the effectiveness of the 
Board in terms of its behaviours, both those of the Board as a 
whole and the individual contribution of directors, and the 
outcomes of its behaviours on the Group’s performance.
Following receipt of each director’s response to the assessment 
form, one to one meetings were held between the chairman  
and each director and, in the case of the chairman’s evaluation, 
between himself and the senior independent director. The 
responses to the assessment form were collated by the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary and presented at a subsequent 
Board meeting for discussion, leading to a number of agreed 
actions for the forthcoming year. 
Board committees
The Board has established three committees: the audit, 
remuneration and nominations committees. Each committee

their independence or objectivity
  to review the Company’s procedures for detecting fraud and 
the adequacy of its systems and controls for the prevention  
of bribery
  to review the Company’s procedures for raising concerns.
Activities 
The committee held three scheduled meetings during the  
year. The ﬁrst took place prior to the announcement of the 
Company’s results for 2010 and approval of the annual report,  
the second prior to the announcement of its half year results  
and the third before commencement of the audit for 2011. Senior 
representatives from the external auditors, the ﬁnance director 
and the Group head of audit and assurance were invited to attend 
each of these meetings. The committee also met privately with  
the external auditors and the Group head of audit and assurance. 
The main purpose of the meetings was to review the scope and 
results of the audit and the effectiveness of the external audit 
process, to monitor the integrity of the annual and half year 
ﬁnancial statements and to discuss with the external auditors their 
overall work plan for the forthcoming audit. At each meeting the 
committee reviewed reports from the Group head of audit and 
assurance on the results of reviews carried out by the internal 
audit team. Further details of the internal audit function are set  
out under internal controls below.
In addition, during the year the committee considered the impact 
of the Bribery Act 2010 and monitored the risk assessments 
carried out by the Group and the adequacy of procedures in  
place to ensure compliance.
At each meeting, the committee also reviewed a summary of  
calls received by the external call line introduced in 2010 for raising 
concerns, together with the results of investigations into such calls 
and any follow up actions. Any signiﬁcant matter arising from a 
call would be brought to the attention of the committee without 
delay, however, no signiﬁcant matters arose during the year. 
The chairman of the audit committee reports to the full Board on 
matters of signiﬁcance arising at meetings of the committee. 
External auditors
Monitoring the independence and objectivity of the  
external auditors
To fulﬁl its obligations, the committee reviewed the external 
auditors’ presentation of their policies and safeguards to ensure 
their continued independence within the meaning of all regulatory 
and professional requirements and to ensure that the objectivity 
of the audit engagement partner and audit staff had not been 
impaired. This included details of changes in external audit 
partners in the audit plan in accordance with the external auditors’ 
policy on rotating audit executives, in particular the appointment 
of a new lead audit engagement partner to take effect in 2012. 
Those policies and safeguards, together with the Company’s own 
policy on engaging the external auditors for non-audit work, 
enabled the committee to conﬁrm that it was satisﬁed with 
Deloitte LLP’s continued independence and objectivity. 
Assessing the effectiveness of the external auditors
As part of its responsibility for assessing the effectiveness of the 
external audit, the committee discussed the external audit plan at 
the audit committee meeting held in November. At the meeting 
prior to the announcement of the preliminary results, it reviewed 
the external auditors’ fulﬁlment of the agreed audit plan and any 
major issues highlighted as part of the external audit.
Reviewing the use of the external auditors for non-audit work
The Company’s policy on the engagement of the external auditors 
for non-audit related services provides that, where the fees for 
such services would exceed either an absolute limit or a speciﬁed 
proportion of the audit fee, they should be referred to the 
committee for approval. Where fees fall below the threshold,  
they have to be approved by the ﬁnance director. No non-audit 
services to the Company provided by Deloitte LLP in 2011 required 
the approval of the committee. The fees for non-audit services 
during the year are set out in note 2 to the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on page 83. These represented approximately 14%  
of the audit fee and comprised advice to one of the divisions  
on its ﬁnance and reporting function. The committee has 
reviewed the nature of the work and level of fees for these 
services and concluded that this has not affected Deloitte  
LLP’s objectivity or independence.
Reappointment of external auditors
The committee considers the reappointment of the external 
auditors each year and makes a recommendation to the Board. 
The committee has satisﬁed itself that Deloitte LLP, the external 
auditors, remains independent and effective. The committee has 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be reappointed. 
There are no contractual obligations which restrict the 
committee’s choice of external auditors. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Simon Gulliford
Responsibilities 
  to review the structure, size and composition of the Board
  to make recommendations to the Board for any changes 
considered necessary
  to approve the description of the role and capabilities required 
for a particular appointment
  to ensure suitable candidates are identiﬁed, having due regard 
for the beneﬁts of diversity on the Board, including gender, and 
recommended for appointment to the Board. 
Activities
The nominations committee met formally during the year to 
review the structure, size and composition of the Board, having 
regard to Gill Barr’s decision to step down from the Board at the 
2012 AGM. Its recommendation to the Board was that no further 
changes were required at this time, however, the matter would be 
kept under review.
Company welcomes regular dialogue with all its shareholders 
The executive directors undertake a programme of regular 
communication with institutional shareholders and with analysts 
covering the Company’s activities. In particular, presentations are 
made to institutional investors and analysts following the 
announcements of the preliminary and half year results. Written 
feedback from these meetings and presentations is distributed  
to all members of the Board. The senior independent director 
meets from time to time with major shareholders and the other 
non-executive directors are also available to meet with them to 
listen to their views.
The Company encourages all shareholders to use the AGM as an 
opportunity for effective communication with the Company. All of 
the directors attended the AGM held in 2011. Details of proxy votes 
submitted for each resolution at general meetings, including proxy 
directions to withhold votes, are published on the Company’s 
website. 
Internal controls 
The Board acknowledges that it has overall responsibility for  
the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The internal control system is designed to  
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve  
certain business objectives due to circumstances which may 
reasonably be foreseen. It can only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
system of internal control, which includes ﬁnancial, operational 
and compliance controls, is based on a process of identifying, 
evaluating and managing risks. It accords with the guidance  
in the Turnbull Report and was in place for the year under  
review and up to the date of approval of this report.
The key features of the Group’s system of internal control  
are as follows:
Group structure
The Group’s operating structure comprises ﬁve operating 
divisions, each with its own management board which is given 
authority and responsibility for managing its division within a 
framework of overarching Group policies, reporting lines and 
detailed delegated authorities, which ensure that decisions and 
approvals are made at the appropriate level. Whilst responsibility 
for managing each division is delegated to the individual divisional 
management board as far as practicable, responsibility for certain 
of the Group’s key functions, including treasury, internal audit, 
pensions and insurance, is retained at the Company level. 
Robust ﬁnancial reporting system
The Board recognises that an essential part of the responsibility 
for running a business is the effective safeguarding of assets,  
the proper recognition of liabilities and the accurate reporting  
of proﬁts. The Company has in place internal control and risk 
management systems in relation to the Company’s ﬁnancial 
reporting process and the Group’s process for preparation of 
consolidated accounts. The Group has a comprehensive 
budgeting and forecasting system which is regularly reviewed  
and updated, together with a management reporting system 
established in each division for monthly reporting to the Board.  
In addition, the internal audit plan for the year includes speciﬁc 
ﬁnancial reviews to validate the integrity of the divisions’ 
management accounts. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Corporate governance statement
continued
Scrutiny of investment and capital expenditure 
There are detailed procedures and deﬁned levels of authority in 
relation to corporate transactions, investment, capital expenditure, 
signiﬁcant cost commitments and asset disposals with approvals 
required from the Board, the executive directors or divisional 
boards, depending on the value and/or nature of the investment 
or contract. 
Detailed review of tenders and project selection
Individual tenders or projects are subject to detailed review with 
approvals required at relevant levels and at various stages from 
commencement of the bidding process through to contract 
award. As part of this process, the ﬁnancial standing of both 
clients and key subcontractors is assessed.
Robust contract controls
Robust procedures exist to manage the ongoing risks associated 
with contracts with monthly reviews at an appropriate level of 
each contract’s performance covering both ﬁnancial and 
operational issues.
Continual monitoring of working capital 
The Group continually monitors current and forecast cash and 
working capital balances through a regime of daily and monthly 
reporting.
Health, safety and environmental issues
The Group has well established safety systems including site  
visits and regular training and updates. Monthly monitoring and 
reporting to the Board includes a report from the commercial 
director on the Group’s performance in relation to health and 
safety matters and environmental compliance. Further details  
are included in the chief executive’s review on page 10 and in  
the sustainability review on pages 42 to 44.
Risk management
The Board has reserved for itself speciﬁc responsibility for  
the formulation of the risk management strategy of the Group.  
A formal process is in place through which the Group identiﬁes 
the signiﬁcant risks attached to its strategy and objectives, 
conﬁrms the control strategy for each risk, identiﬁes the root 
cause and appropriate treatment for each, including the relevant 
internal controls and actions required. This process includes the 
identiﬁcation and assessment of the key sustainability risks facing 
the business, which include environmental, social and governance 
risks. Internal control and risk management systems are 
embedded in the operations of the divisions. A consolidated 
report of each of the divisional risk reviews, together with risks 
identiﬁed at Group level, is compiled in a Group risk register, which 
is updated and reviewed by the Board twice yearly. This process 
ensures that adequate information in relation to risk management 
matters, including environmental, social and governance matters, 
is available to the Board and the Board is fully aware of the 
signiﬁcance of these matters to the business of the Group. The 
principal risks identiﬁed as facing the Group are highlighted in the 
business review on pages 18 to 21. In addition to the standing risk 
register review process, the Board devotes time during some of 
the scheduled Board meetings to considering the commercial 
issues which at the time represent the greatest risks to the 
achievement of the Group’s objectives and the mitigating actions 
in place to address these risks. 
Internal audit 
The Group head of audit and assurance is responsible for 
managing the internal audit function, overseeing the divisional 
heads of internal audit and assisting with risk management 
practices. Internal audit and assurance work carried out during the 
year included operational, project and ﬁnancial reviews across the 
Group. The results of these reviews were recorded in audit reports 
and presented to the audit committee. The status of agreed 
management actions to address identiﬁed operational 
weaknesses is actively tracked until implementation. 
The Group head of audit and assurance reports to the Board 
monthly on a range of performance metrics including the current 
status of agreed audit actions and progress against the annual 
audit plan. He also meets separately with the chair of the audit 
committee at least once a year.
The internal audit process is supplemented by a rolling 
programme of peer group reviews within the divisions, which 
assist in the professional development of the individual staff 
concerned whilst, at the same time, providing a mechanism for  
the cross-fertilisation of ideas and best practice throughout each 
division. These reviews are overseen by the divisional heads of 
internal audit and tracking of agreed management actions is 
included within the overall internal audit process. 
Board review of effectiveness of internal controls
The Board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls for the year ended 31 December 2011 
and for the period to the date of this report. The process included 
a formal review conducted by the Board of the Group risk register, 
referred to under Risk management above, as well as a review of 
the results of internal audit work and the overall effectiveness of 
the process. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Remuneration report
Executive pay is an area of continual development, reﬂecting the 
challenges of the current economic climate. The remuneration 
committee stays fully abreast of the latest developments and 
issues and takes an increasingly broad perspective when looking 
at how we pay our most senior executives. We remain committed 
to ensuring that we have highly talented senior management to 
maximise shareholder value and that we do not pay more than  
is necessary to attract and retain those executives to lead  
the Company. We believe it is critical that good performance 
delivered with a view to long-term sustainable growth is  
rewarded fairly and that there is no scope to reward failure.
2011 was a year of continued challenges for the UK construction 
market in the face of difficult economic conditions and ongoing 
constraints in public spending. Against this background, the 
Group has delivered a very resilient ﬁnancial performance for  
the year ended 31 December 2011. Revenue increased in 2011 and, 
although proﬁt before tax, amortisation and non-recurring items 
was lower than in 2010, this was anticipated given the competitive 
market environment in which the Group has been operating and 
in fact exceeded the Board’s and market consensus expectations 
and this is reﬂected in the annual bonus outturn for the executive 
directors being 85.15% of maximum. However, the adjusted 
earnings per share targets under the long term incentive awards 
made in 2009, measuring performance in 2011, were not met  
and no awards will vest this year. 
Turning to our policy for 2012, with the challenging market 
conditions expected to continue, we remain committed to 
restraining our ﬁxed costs. To achieve this we have frozen the 
salary rate for the chairman and chief executive (for the third  
time in four years) and, for the ﬁnance director and commercial 
director, determined that any increases should be no higher than 
the broad average of the workforce generally. The annual bonus 
will operate on similar terms to 2011, based on stretching proﬁt 
performance targets for the 2012 ﬁnancial year.
The main focus of the committee’s attention during 2011 has been 
a review of our future policy for long-term incentives. This has 
changed as follows:
  we have simpliﬁed the policy by removing the choice given to 
the executive to receive their award in the form of share options 
or performance shares, so that the award structure will be 
performance shares only
  subject to achieving shareholders’ approval to an amendment 
to the individual limit in the Executive Remuneration Plan, the 
normal annual grant level will be increased from 75% to 100%  
of salary, which is in line, but no higher than, mid-market levels
  instead of an award being determined solely by adjusted EPS 
performance, a total shareholder return performance condition 
has been added for one half of the award, comparing our 
long-term stock market returns to other UK construction 
businesses 
  the remaining one half of the award is based on a stretching 
range of EPS performance conditions, which have been made 
more challenging at the top end of the range, reﬂecting the 
higher award potential.
To improve the risk proﬁle of the policy further we have made  
two further amendments. 
  an incentive recovery provision has been added both to the 
annual bonus and Executive Remuneration Plan. This provides 
the Company with the power to recover erroneous payments 
of annual bonus or long-term incentive awards 
  a shareholding guideline policy has been introduced,  
which requires all executive directors to build and maintain  
a shareholding worth no less than 100% of their base salary.  
This policy has the additional beneﬁt of improving alignment  
of interest between executives and shareholders.
We have consulted with our major institutional shareholders on 
the revised policy and made certain changes in response.
Finally, having completed seven years service as a non-executive 
director, I have announced my intention to retire from the Board  
at this year’s AGM. Between now and the AGM there will be an 
orderly hand-over to Patrick De Smedt, who has served on this 
Committee for two years and has experience of chairing 
remuneration committees at other UK listed companies.

This report has been prepared by the remuneration committee 
(‘the committee’) on behalf of the Board in accordance with 
Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. This report 
also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority and the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (‘the Code’). A resolution to approve the report will be 
proposed at the AGM to be held on 3 May 2012.
The Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) requires the auditors to 
report to the Company’s members on certain parts of the 
remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those 
parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Act. The report has, therefore, been divided into separate 
sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information
Members and activities of the committee
The members of the committee during 2011 were Gill Barr (chair), 
Geraldine Gallacher, Adrian Martin and Patrick De Smedt. All 
members during the year were independent non-executive 
directors. Patrick De Smedt will chair the committee after  
Gill Barr retires from the Board at the forthcoming AGM. 
The committee met on two occasions during the year and 
attendance at meetings is disclosed in the corporate governance 
statement on page 49. Additional consultation between 
committee members and between the chair of the committee and 
the chief executive were held as necessary to reﬁne the changes 
to the long-term incentive arrangements discussed below. 
Responsibilities of the committee
The committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with 
the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the executive 
directors, including the executive chairman, and it sets their 
salaries and remuneration packages. In addition, the committee 
monitors the structure and level of remuneration for other senior 
executives in the Group and is aware of pay and conditions in the 
workforce generally.
External advice received
During the year, the committee received advice from New Bridge 
Street (‘NBS’) in relation to its consideration of the structure of the 
executive directors’ remuneration for 2012. The committee also 
consulted the chief executive and the ﬁnance director but, in each 
case, not in relation to their own remuneration. NBS provided 
advice to the Company on accounting for share awards but 
provided no other material services to the Company or the Group. 
The committee’s approach to executive directors’ remuneration
The general principles underlying the committee’s approach to 
developing remuneration packages for the executive directors are:
  to attract, retain and motivate the best possible person for  
each position, without paying more than is necessary
  that the remuneration packages should be perceived as simple 
and fair and, therefore, should be valued by participants
  to ensure that the ﬁxed element of remuneration (salary, 
pension and other beneﬁts) is determined in line with market 
rates, taking account of individual performance and experience, 
and that a signiﬁcant proportion of the total remuneration 
package is determined by the Company’s performance
  to recognise the importance of rewarding over performance 
(but not under performance) in both the short and long-term
  to balance performance pay between the achievement of 
ﬁnancial performance objectives and delivering sustainable 
stock market out-performance, with ﬁnancial performance 
creating a clear line of sight for individuals between 
performance and reward and providing a focus on sustained 
improvements in proﬁtability, whilst total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) compared with that of our competitors provides a  
more direct alignment between the interests of executives  
and shareholders
  to calibrate carefully all ﬁnancial and total shareholder return 
performance metrics and associated sliding scale ranges 
carefully to ensure that performance is incrementally rewarded 
and that executives are not inadvertently incentivised to take 
inappropriate business risks (including environmental, social 
and governance risks)
  to provide a signiﬁcant proportion of performance linked pay  
in share-based form, providing an opportunity for executives  
to build signiﬁcant shareholdings in the business, subject  
to performance
  to align the interests of executives with those of the Company’s 
shareholders.
The committee considers pay and employment conditions of 
employees elsewhere in the Group when determining executive 
directors’ remuneration
The committee takes account of remuneration levels offered to 
other senior executives within the Group as well as pay awards 
affecting Group employees when determining policy in relation  
to executive directors. At the meeting to determine the executive 
directors’ remuneration structure and levels for 2012, the 
committee reviewed a detailed breakdown of the compensation 
received by senior executives below Board level and at divisional 
board and business unit level, to ensure that there is a coherent 
approach at all senior management levels. It also reviewed general 
employee pay awards for 2012 operating throughout the Group. 
Fixed versus performance related remuneration
A signiﬁcant proportion of the package is subject to performance 
related elements and this proportion will increase if the changes  
to the long-term incentive arrangements described below are 
approved by shareholders. 
The chart following shows that, assuming the changes are 
approved by shareholders, just under half of the value of the 
package at a broadly target level of performance will comprise 
performance related elements, whilst at a maximum level of 
reward (assuming a maximum bonus and full vesting of the Plan 
awards) more than 60% of the total remuneration will comprise 
performance related elements.  Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Addition of incentive recovery provision
To improve the risk proﬁle of the remuneration policy further,  
the committee has added an incentive recovery provision to the 
policy. This provides the Company with the power to reclaim 
overpayments to executive directors under future annual bonus or 
long-term incentive awards in the event of ﬁnancial misstatement 
or error in the calculation of an annual bonus or long-term 
incentive performance condition. 
Continued restraint in setting base salary levels 
The base salary of individual executive directors is determined  
by the committee prior to the beginning of each year and, if 
appropriate, in the event of a change in an individual’s position  
or responsibilities. A formal benchmarking exercise of executive 
directors’ remuneration is carried out periodically on behalf of  
the committee to ensure that it remains aware of relevant market 
data. The committee is aware, however, of the risk of an upward 
ratchet in remuneration levels through the use of comparative  
pay surveys.
At its meeting in November 2011, the committee considered the 
budgeted level of increases in base salary for senior executives 
below Board level and the workforce generally. Whilst the average 
budgeted increase across the Group was c.3%, not all divisional 
management has received an increase in base salary for 2012. 
Having regard to the above and to the challenging market 
conditions expected to continue in 2012, the committee 
determined that David Mulligan and Paul Whitmore should each 
receive an increase in their base salaries of c.3.6% but that the 
salaries of John Morgan and Paul Smith should not be increased. 
Accordingly base salaries for the executive directors for 2012 will 
be as follows:
 From 1.01.2012 From 1.01.2011 Increase
John Morgan £438,000 £438,000 +0%  
Paul Smith £515,000 £515,000 +0% 
David Mulligan £315,000 £304,000 +3.62% 
Paul Whitmore £311,000 £300,000 +3.67%
Pension arrangements
The Company makes contributions equivalent to 10% of base 
salary, in the case of David Mulligan, to The Morgan Sindall 
Retirement Beneﬁts Plan (‘the Plan’) and, in the case of  
John Morgan and Paul Whitmore, to their individual personal 
pension plans. 
The Company ceased contributing to the Plan in respect of  
Paul Smith with effect from 31 March 2011 and, as disclosed in  
last year’s report, since 1 April 2011 it has paid Paul Smith a cash 
allowance equal to 10% of his base salary in lieu of any pension 
contribution less half of the consequent additional National 
Insurance Contribution (‘NIC’) cost to the Company. 
The Company operates a salary exchange process that allows all 
employees who are members of the Plan ﬂexibility in setting the 
proportion in which salary and bonus is distributed between cash 
payments and additional pension contributions. Where additional 
pension contributions are made through the salary exchange 
process, the Company enhances the contributions by half of the 
saved employer’s NIC. 
Other beneﬁts 
The executive directors receive certain other beneﬁts, principally  
a car allowance, private medical insurance, permanent health 
insurance and life assurance.
Challenging targets for annual bonus
For the 2012 annual bonus plan, the committee has retained  
a performance condition based on a proﬁt before tax and 
amortisation (‘PBTA’) target range, set relative to the Group’s 
budget. This has the beneﬁt of transparency and simplicity and 
encourages the executive directors to focus on the overall 
ﬁnancial performance of the Group. Other performance measures 
have been considered by the committee but, as most of the 
Company’s annual ﬁnancial performance is reﬂected in its PBTA, 
the use of other ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial measures was 
considered inappropriate due to the additional complexity and,  
in the case of the latter, the potential lack of objectivity around 
target measurement. 
The committee has sought to structure the bonus with an 
appropriate sliding scale range around a challenging target for 
executives recognising, however, that the target has to be realistic 
in order to serve as a proper incentive and needs to take into 
account the difficult economic environment in which the 
Company continues to operate.
The maximum potential annual cash bonus for executive directors 
for 2012 is unchanged from 2011 at 100% of base salary. 
Long-term incentives
The Group’s current long-term incentive arrangement for senior 
executives is the Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 
2005 (‘the Plan’). The Plan was approved by shareholders in April 
2005. During the year the committee reviewed the policy under 
the Plan and has made a number of changes. These are 
highlighted in the description of our policy overleaf. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Structure of Plan awards reviewed and simpliﬁed
For a number of years, executives have been given the choice at 
the time of grant of receiving their awards either in the form of 
performance shares or by electing to receive market price share 
options to replace some or all of their performance shares at a 
rate of four share options for every one performance share. To 
simplify the policy the committee has determined that the choice 
of taking the award in share options should be removed. 
Accordingly awards will take the form of performance shares only, 
i.e. a conditional award of shares vesting after three years subject 
to continued employment and the achievement of challenging 
performance conditions.
Award levels reviewed and increased for 2012
Since 2005 when the Plan was introduced, executive directors 
have been given the choice of receiving awards up to a maximum 
limit of 75% of salary for performance shares or 300% of salary for 
market price share options. The committee has now determined 
that the normal award level for performance shares should be 
increased to 100% of base salary.
This increase is subject to shareholder approval at the 
forthcoming AGM. A resolution will be proposed to increase the 
maximum limit to 150% of base salary. For the foreseeable future 
at executive director level the committee plans to make awards at 
a 100% of base salary level, but this higher limit has been included 
for future ﬂexibility in exceptional circumstances, such as 
recruitment or acute retention.
This increase is considered appropriate so as to ensure that the 
overall package remains competitive with our peers and to ensure 
that there is an appropriate focus on the achievement of long-
term performance metrics, upon which long-term incentive 
awards are based.
Performance conditions for 2012 awards reviewed and a new 
approach proposed 
The committee continues to believe that long-term incentives 
should provide a focus on maximising sustainable long-term 
proﬁtability by the use of a performance condition based on 
earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and 
non-recurring items (‘adjusted EPS’). The Company’s adjusted 
EPS performance for each annual award is measured over a single 
three year period.
The committee has, however, determined that a more rounded 
assessment of long-term performance would be provided if, in 
addition to adjusted EPS, there is a performance condition based 
directly on the level of shareholder value created. Accordingly, for 
the 2012 awards, 50% of an award will be based on an adjusted 
EPS performance condition and the remaining 50% will be based 
on a condition measuring the Company’s total shareholder return 
compared with eight of our UK listed peers, over a three year 
period. Total shareholder return measures the level of return made 
by an investor in Morgan Sindall Group plc shares, based on share 
price and dividend. Accordingly this provides a direct measure of 
our stock market performance.
EPS performance condition
Performance will be assessed by reference to the adjusted EPS 
performance in 2014 and all points in the target range have been 
increased in comparison to last year’s award. In addition, the entire 
adjusted EPS range represents growth from the 31 December 2011 
year end ﬁgure, at a time when little or no growth is forecast in the 
UK construction industry. In what remain highly challenging and 
uncertain market conditions, these targets are considered an 
appropriate incentive to preserve and maximise long-term 
proﬁtability within an appropriate risk framework, thereby 
providing a good link with the strategy of the business. In setting 
this range, the committee also recognises that zero vesting at the 
EPS performance threshold is tougher than market norms and 
that there is a signiﬁcant upside stretch.
The EPS performance targets will be as follows:
Adjusted EPS performance Vesting percentage 
for the year ending 31 December 2014  for 50% of the award
Less than 80p 0%
At 91.9p  50%
Between 80p and 91.9p  Pro rata on a straight-line basis
106p or more 100%
Between 91.9p and 106p Pro rata on a straight-line basis
This vesting range is shown graphically below:

The committee will continue to set targets for future awards 
appropriate to the economic outlook prevailing at the time, 
ensuring that such targets remain challenging in the 
circumstances, whilst remaining realistic enough to motivate  
and incentivise management. The committee will also bear  
in mind the need to avoid incentive arrangements which 
encourage management to take undue business risks (including 
environmental, social and governance risks). Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

condition will be as follows:

plc, Costain Group plc, Galliford Try plc, Interior Services Group 
plc, Interserve Plc, Keller Group plc and Kier Group plc
This vesting range is shown graphically below:

In addition to the vesting being determined by the sliding scale  
of TSR performance shown above, there will be two additional 
conditions governing the level of vesting. Speciﬁcally, the result 
indicated by the TSR performance condition may be scaled back 
(potentially to zero) in the event that the committee considers 
that:
  ﬁnancial performance has been unsatisfactory and/or 
  the outcome has been distorted due to the TSR for Morgan 
Sindall or any comparator company being considered 
abnormal.
Introduction of formal shareholding guidelines
Through participation in performance linked share-based plans, 
there is strong encouragement for senior executives to build and 
maintain a signiﬁcant shareholding in the business.
However, the committee considers that the policy could be 
improved further if this policy is operated on a more formalised 
basis. Accordingly, the committee has adopted a formal policy 
requiring all executive directors to build and maintain a 
shareholding in the Company equivalent to 100% of base salary. 
Until such time as this threshold is achieved there is a requirement 
for executives to retain no less than 50% of the net of tax value of 
vested Plan awards.
Other share plans
The Company currently operates two other share plans for  
its employees:
  The Morgan Sindall Sharesave Plan, in which executive  
directors are permitted to participate on the same terms  
as other employees
  The Morgan Sindall Employee Share Option Plan 2007  
(‘the 2007 Scheme’), under which executive directors  
do not receive awards.
Dilution and share usage under employee share plans
Shares required for the 2007 Scheme are satisﬁed by shares 
purchased in the market via the Company’s employee beneﬁt 
trust and shares for the 2005 Plan may be satisﬁed using either 
new issue shares or market purchased shares. The Company’s 
present intention is to use market purchase shares to satisfy 
awards under the Plan. However, it retains the ability to use new 
issue shares instead and may decide to do so up to the dilution 
limits recommended by the Association of British Insurers (10%  
of issued ordinary share capital for all employee share plans over  
a 10 year period and, within this limit, no more than 5% of issued 
ordinary share capital for executive or discretionary share plans). 
The outstanding level of dilution against these limits equates to 
6.8% of the current issued ordinary share capital under all 
employee share plans, of which 1.9% relates to discretionary  
share plans. 
Separately, the employee beneﬁt trust currently holds 766,714 
shares which may be used to satisfy awards. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Service contracts
John Morgan, Paul Smith and David Mulligan have all entered  
into new service agreements, updated to bring them into line  
with current best practice and to reﬂect more closely the terms  
in place for Paul Whitmore. All executive directors’ service 
agreements are terminable on 12 months’ notice. In circumstances 
of termination on notice (except in cases of removal for cause) the 
approach taken by the committee will be to determine, having 
regard to the particular circumstances of the case, an equitable 
compensation package which takes into account the departing 
director’s obligations to mitigate his loss and avoids rewarding 
poor performance. The committee has discretion to require notice 
to be worked or to make payment in lieu of notice or to place the 
director on garden leave for the notice period.
In case of payment in lieu or garden leave, base salary, employer 
pension contributions and employee beneﬁts other than bonus 
will be paid for the period of notice served on garden leave or  
paid in lieu. Bonus will be paid in accordance with the rules of the 
scheme for the period of the bonus scheme year actually worked 
by the director; there is no provision for an amount in lieu of  
bonus to be payable for any part of the notice period not worked. 
Entitlement to shares or share options under the long-term 
incentive schemes will be determined in accordance with the rules 
of the scheme (which comply with ABI guidelines). There is no 
speciﬁc provision for compensation on early termination or loss  
of office due to a takeover bid.
The dates of the executive directors’ contracts are:
John Morgan 20 February 2012 
Paul Smith 20 February 2012 
David Mulligan 20 February 2012 
Paul Whitmore 21 March 2000
At the discretion of the Board, executive directors are allowed to 
act as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any 
fees relating to those posts. None of the executive directors is 
currently receiving fees for non-executive positions with other 
companies.
Non-executive directors’ terms of engagement
The dates of the terms of engagement of the non-executive 
directors are:
Gill Barr 11 August 2004 
Patrick De Smedt  26 November 2009 
Geraldine Gallacher 16 August 2007 
Adrian Martin 28 November 2008 
Simon Gulliford 24 February 2010
All non-executive directors have speciﬁc terms of engagement 
being an initial period of three years which thereafter may be 
extended by mutual consent, subject always to the requirements 
for re-election and the Act. Their remuneration is determined by 
the Board within the limits set by the Articles and is based on 
surveys, together with external advice as appropriate. Having 
been increased last year, the fees for non-executive directors  
for 2012 will remain unchanged. The basic fee will therefore be 
£41,200 per annum whilst the chair of the audit committee will 
receive an additional £7,500 per annum and the chair of the 
remuneration committee an additional £6,000 per annum. 
Non-executive directors receive no other beneﬁts and do not 
participate in short-term or long-term reward schemes. 59

Notes
No options were exercised during the year.
 The maximum performance condition for the options granted in 2005 and 2006 was satisﬁed and the options are, therefore, fully 
exercisable.
The threshold performance condition for the options granted on 9 April 2008 was not met and the options lapsed. 
The performance condition for options granted on 30 March 2009 was tested after the year end and, as the threshold was not met, the 
options have lapsed.
The awards of performance shares and share options made in 2010 are subject to an absolute adjusted EPS performance target with full 
vesting of awards for achieving adjusted EPS of 101.2p or more for the year ending 31 December 2012, reducing on a sliding scale to 50% 
vesting for achieving 81.0p and reducing on a sliding scale to 0% vesting for achieving 68.9p (performance shares) or 77.0p (share 
options). The awards of performance shares and share options made in 2011 are subject to an absolute adjusted EPS performance 
target with full vesting of awards for achieving adjusted EPS of 102.2p or more for the year ending 31 December 2013, reducing on a 
sliding scale to 50% vesting for achieving 81.7p and reducing on a sliding scale to 0% vesting for achieving 69.5p (performance shares) 
or 77.6p (share options).
The outstanding options detailed above will, if not lapsed or exercised earlier, lapse ten years from the date of grant.
The mid-market price of a share on 31 December 2011 was £5.94 and the range during the year was £5.10 to £7.30.

Enhanced business review
The Companies Act 2006 (‘the Act’) requires the Company to  
set out in the directors’ report a fair review of the business of the 
Group during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2011 and the 
position of the Group at the end of the year, including but not 
limited to a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing it and analysis using key performance indicators. The 
information required to fulﬁl these requirements of the Act can  
be found in this governance section of the directors’ report on 
pages 45 to 66 and in the business review section of the directors’ 
report on pages 2 to 44, each of which is incorporated by 
reference into (and is deemed to form part of) the directors’ 
report. The liabilities of the directors in connection with this  
report shall be limited as provided by applicable English law.
Principal activities
Morgan Sindall is a construction and regeneration group  
with ﬁve divisions: Construction and Infrastructure, Affordable 
Housing, Fit Out, Urban Regeneration and Investments.  
The principal subsidiary companies and joint ventures operating  
within this divisional structure are listed in note 14 of the  
Company ﬁnancial statements on page 122.
Results and dividends
The Group’s proﬁt before tax for the year amounted to £40.0m 
(2010: £40.7m). 
An interim dividend of 12.0p (2010: 12.0p) per share amounting to 
£5.1m (2010: £5.1m) was paid on 16 September 2011. The directors 
recommend a ﬁnal dividend for the year of 30.0p (2010: second 
interim dividend 30.0p) per share amounting to £12.8m (2010: 
£12.8m) payable on 18 May 2012 to shareholders on the register  
at close of business on 27 April 2012. Together with the interim 
dividend, this makes a total dividend of 42.0p for the year (2010: 
42.0p). 
Capital structure
Details of the Company’s issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year are shown in note 8 of the Company ﬁnancial 
statements. The Company’s issued share capital comprises a 
single class of ordinary shares of 5p each (‘shares’). 
At each AGM the Board seeks authorisation from its shareholders 
to allot shares. The directors were granted authority at the AGM 
on 5 May 2011 to allot relevant securities up to a nominal amount 
of £107,981. That authority will apply until the conclusion of this 
year’s AGM and a resolution to renew the authority will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM, as explained further in the 
circular to shareholders accompanying this report.
A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the directors’ 
power to make non-pre-emptive issues for cash, as explained in 
the circular accompanying this report.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
Subject to applicable statutes, shares may be issued with such 
rights and restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution 
decide or (if there is no such resolution or so far as it does not 
make speciﬁc provision) as the Board as deﬁned in the Company’s 
articles of association (the ‘Articles’) may decide. Subject to the 
Articles, the Act and other shareholders’ rights, unissued shares 
are at the disposal of the Board.
Subject to the Act, rights attached to any class of shares may  
be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than 
three-fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class 
(calculated excluding any shares held as treasury shares), or with 
the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general 
meeting of the holders of those shares. 
The rights conferred upon the holders of any shares shall not, 
unless otherwise expressly provided in the rights attaching to 
those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue  
of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Voting
Subject to any other provisions of the Articles, every member 
present in person or by proxy at a general meeting has, upon a 
show of hands, one vote and, upon a poll, one vote for every share 
held by him or her. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote 
of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, 
shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by the 
order in which the names stand in the register in respect of the 
joint holding.
No member shall be entitled to vote at any general meeting  
in respect of any share held by him or her if any call or other  
sum then payable by him or her in respect of that share remains 
unpaid or if a member has been served with a restriction notice 
(as deﬁned in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares required  
to be provided under the Act.
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital and the directors are not aware of any agreements 
between holders of shares which may result in restrictions on 
voting rights.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the 
Company, except:
  that certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed  
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading laws)
  pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority 
whereby certain employees of the Company require its 
approval to deal in the Company’s shares. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

transfer of securities.
Purchase of own shares
At the AGM on 5 May 2011, a resolution was passed giving the 
directors authority to make market purchases of its shares up to 
4,319,247 shares at a maximum price based on the market price  
of a share at the relevant time, as set out in the resolution. No 
purchases of shares were made during the year pursuant to this 
authority. The authority expires on 5 August 2012 and a resolution 
to renew the authority will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM, 
as explained further in the circular to shareholders accompanying 
this report.
Dividends and distributions
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by 
the Board. Subject to the Act, the Board may pay interim 
dividends, and also any ﬁxed rate dividend, whenever the ﬁnancial 
position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, justiﬁes its 
payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any 
dividends or other monies payable in respect of the Company’s 
shares from a person with a 0.25% interest (as deﬁned in the 
Articles) if such a person has been served with a restriction notice 
(as deﬁned in the Articles) after failure to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares required to 
be provided under the Act.
Rights under employee share schemes
The Legis Trust Limited as trustee of The Morgan Sindall 
Employee Beneﬁt Trust (‘the Trust’), held 1.8% of the issued share 
capital of the Company as at 31 December 2011 on trust for the 
beneﬁt of the employees and former employees of the Group  
and their dependents. The voting rights in relation to these shares 
are exercised by the Trustee and there are no restrictions on the 
exercise of the voting of, or the acceptance of any offer relating  
to, the shares. Further details of the shares held by the Trust may 
be found in note 24 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements  
on page 98.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors shall be not less than two and not more than twelve 
in number. The Company may by ordinary resolution vary the 
minimum and/or maximum number of directors. Directors may  
be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the 
Board. A director appointed by the Board holds office only until 
the next AGM of the Company and is then eligible for 
reappointment. 
At every AGM of the Company, any director who has been 
appointed by the Board since the last AGM, or who held office  
at the time of the two preceding AGMs and who did not retire  
at either of them, shall retire from office and may offer himself for 
reappointment by the members. The Company may, by special 
resolution, remove any director before the expiration of his period 
of office. The office of a director shall be vacated if: (i) he resigns 
or offers to resign and the Board resolves to accept such offer; (ii) 
his resignation is requested by all of the other directors and all of 
the other directors are not less than three in number; (iii) he is or 
has been suffering from mental ill health and the Board resolves 
that his office be vacated; (iv) he is absent without the permission 
of the Board from meetings of the Board (whether or not an 
alternate director appointed by him attends) for six consecutive 
months and the Board resolves that his office is vacated; (v) he 
becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors generally; (vi) 
he is prohibited by law from being a director; (vii) he ceases to be 
a director by virtue of the Act; or (viii) he is removed from office 
pursuant to the Articles. 
However, at the forthcoming AGM of the Company to be held on 
3 May 2012, notwithstanding the provisions of the Articles, each of 
the directors (except Gill Barr who has indicated her intention not 
to seek re-election) will offer themselves for re-election in 
accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Act and any directions given by the 
Company by special resolution, the business of the Company will

Company, whether relating to the management of the business or 
not. In particular, the Board may exercise all the powers of the 
Company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge any of its 
undertaking, property, assets (present and future) and uncalled

security for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of 
any third party.

Research and development
The Group undertakes research and development activity in 
creating innovative construction techniques and designs integral 
to the delivery of its projects. The direct spending incurred is 
generally not separately identiﬁable as the investment is usually 
contained within project work performed for customers.
Change of control
The Group’s banking facilities which are described in the ﬁnance 
review on page 14 require repayment in the event of a change in 
control. The Group’s facilities for surety bonding require provision 
of cash collateral for outstanding bonds upon a change of control 
of the Company. In addition, the Company’s employee share 
incentive schemes contain provisions whereby, upon a change of 
control of the Company, outstanding options and awards would 
vest and become exercisable, subject to the rules of the relevant 
schemes.
There are no agreements between the Company and its directors 
or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or 
employment occurring because of a takeover bid. 
Sustainability
The Group is publishing its ﬁrst separate 2011 Sustainability Report 
this year to coincide with the publication of this report which is 
displayed on the Company’s website www.morgansindall.com/
sustainability. Details of the Group’s Sustainability Roadmap which 
was launched in 2011 and its six Total Commitments to drive 
improvement are set out on page 12 of the chief executive’s review 
and in the sustainability review on pages 42 to 44. The 2011 
Sustainability Report will provide further details of the Group’s 
approach and its performance against the Total Commitments.
The Group has a robust series of sustainability, compliance and 
business ethics policies together with a range of mechanisms that 
help deliver the Group’s sustainability programme including health 
and safety, environmental impact, employees, customers and 
supply chain and community engagement.
The average number of employees in the Group during the year  
is given in note 3 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements on  
page 83.
The Group has a policy of equal opportunities, which applies in 
relation to recruitment of all new employees and to the 
management of existing personnel. The Group gives full 
consideration to applications for employment from disabled 
persons where the requirements of the job can be adequately 
fulﬁlled by such persons. In the event of employees becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate training is 
arranged. Investment and resources continue to be provided  
to support, train and motivate all employees. 
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and ensures that all signiﬁcant events, economic 
factors and ﬁnancial updates and the impact of these on the 
performance of the Group are communicated to employees 
through email alerts and regular newsletters. In addition, the 
divisions use a variety of methods to encourage employee 
involvement in the Group’s performance and communicate key 
business goals and issues to employees. The divisions also consult 
and involve their employees through local publications, brieﬁng 
groups, consultative meetings, training programmes, employee 
surveys and working groups to assist the process of continuous 
improvement in the way the business is conducted. 
Details of the Company’s Savings Related Share Option Scheme 
(the ‘SAYE Scheme’), which is open to all employees, is set out

Supplier payment policy 
The Company’s policy, which is also adopted by the Group, is to 
agree clearly and set down terms of payment with suppliers and 
subcontractors when agreeing the terms for each transaction and 
to make payments in accordance with its obligations, save in cases 
of genuine dispute.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group’s number of creditor days 
outstanding was equivalent to 28 days’ purchases (2010: 25 days), 
based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during 
the year.
Political and charitable contributions
During the year, the Group made charitable donations of £47,134 
(2010: £60,314), principally to local charities serving the 
communities in which it operates. More details of the Group’s 
involvement in the community can be found in the separate 2011 
Sustainability Report at www.morgansindall.com/sustainability.
No contributions were made to any political parties during the 
current or preceding year. 
Fixed assets
There is no material difference between the book value and 
current market value of the Group’s interest in land and buildings. 
Post balance sheet events 
On 15 February 2012 the Group disposed of its 33% interest in the 
Dorset Fire & Rescue PFI for cash consideration of £3.8m. Further 
details may be found in note 30 of the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements.
Disclosure of information to the external auditors
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this 
directors’ report conﬁrm that, so far as they are each aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware and each director has taken all the steps that he or she 
ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. This 
conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of section 418 of the Act.
External auditor 
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office as 
external auditor and a resolution to reappoint it will be proposed

Directors’ responsibilities statement
66
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and 
the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law, the directors 
are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of  
the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Parent 
Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law, 
the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs  
of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company  
for that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the 
directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently
  make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent
  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the ﬁnancial statements
  prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
  properly select and apply accounting policies
  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁc requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial 
performance 
  make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the 
preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may  
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
Each of the directors, whose names are set out on pages 46  
and 47, conﬁrms that to the best of his or her knowledge:
  the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt  
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in  
the consolidation taken as a whole
  the management report, which is incorporated into the 
directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Independent auditor’s report
to the members of Morgan Sindall Group plc
We have audited the Group ﬁnancial statements of Morgan Sindall 
Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise 
the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance sheet, the 
Consolidated cash ﬂow statement, the Consolidated statement of 
changes in equity, Signiﬁcant accounting policies and the related 
notes 1 to 30. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the 
European Union.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Group 
ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true 
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion 
on the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. In addition, we read all 
the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the annual report  
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications  
for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion, the Group ﬁnancial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 
31 December 2011 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, the information given in the directors’ report for the 
ﬁnancial year for which the Group ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the Group ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you 
if, in our opinion:
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law 
are not made; or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules, we are required to review:
  the directors’ statement, contained within the ﬁnancial review, 
in relation to going concern; and
  the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review;
  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company ﬁnancial 
statements of Morgan Sindall Group plc for the year ended  
31 December 2011 and on the information in the directors’ 
remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

Share premium account
The share premium account represents the difference between the fair value of consideration received and the nominal value of the 
shares issued.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve was created on the redemption of preference shares in 2003.
Reserve for own shares held
The shares are held as ‘treasury shares’ and represent the cost to Morgan Sindall Group plc of shares purchased in the market and held 
by the Morgan Sindall Employee Beneﬁt Trust (the ‘Trust’) to satisfy options under the Group’s share incentive schemes.
The number of shares held by the Trust at 31 December 2011 was 776,714 (2010: 781,444).
Hedging reserve
Under cash ﬂow hedge accounting, movements on the effective portion of hedges are recognised through the hedging reserve, whilst 
any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Reporting entity
Morgan Sindall Group plc (the ‘Company’) is domiciled and 
incorporated in the UK. The report and accounts includes the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the ‘Group’) and the 
Group’s interests in joint ventures and separate ﬁnancial 
statements for the Company. The nature of the Group’s 
operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1 and  
in the directors’ report: business review on pages 2 to 44.
Basis of preparation
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared  
on a going concern basis as discussed in the ﬁnance review on 
page 14 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) adopted by the European Union and, therefore, 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
(b) Basis of accounting
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention, except where otherwise indicated.
(c) Functional and presentation currency
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements are presented in pounds 
sterling which is the Group’s functional currency. All ﬁnancial 
information, unless otherwise stated, has been rounded to the 
nearest £0.1m.
(d) Restatement of comparative balances
As was stated in note 25 on pages 104 to 105 of the 2010 annual 
report and accounts, the fair value of adjustments arising on  
the acquisition of the business, obligations and certain assets  
from the administrators of Connaught Partnerships Limited were 
provisional and subject to ﬁnalisation in accordance with IFRS 3 
‘Business Combinations’.
The fair value exercise has now been completed and the ﬁnal 
acquisition balance sheet and related fair value adjustments  
are disclosed in note 25. In accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ the affected ﬁnancial statements balances have 
been restated. None of the restatements have had an impact on 
gross proﬁt, proﬁt from operations or net assets. There was no 
impact on recognised income or expense as previously stated.
(e) Changes in accounting policy and disclosures
(i) New and revised accounting standards adopted by the Group
During the year, the Group has adopted the following standards, 
amendments and interpretations. They have either had no 
material impact on the Group’s consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
or are not currently relevant to the Group (but may affect future 
transactions and events):
  IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments’. The Interpretation provides guidance on the 
accounting for ‘debt for equity swaps’ from the perspective of 
the borrower
  Amendment to IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’. IFRS 3 has 
been amended such that only those non-controlling interests 
which are current ownership interests and which entitle their 
holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation 
can be measured at fair value or the proportionate share of  
net identiﬁable assets. Other non-controlling interests are 
measured at fair value, unless another measurement basis  
is required by IFRSs
  IAS 24 (2009) ‘Related Party Disclosures’. The revised  
Standard has a new, clearer deﬁnition of a related party,  
with inconsistencies under the previous deﬁnition having  
been removed
  Amendment to IAS 32 ‘Classiﬁcation of Rights Issues’. Under 
the amendment, rights issues of instruments issued to acquire  
a ﬁxed number of an entity’s own non-derivative equity 
instruments for a ﬁxed amount in any currency and which 
otherwise meet the deﬁnition of equity are classiﬁed as equity
  Amendments to IFRIC 14 ‘Prepayments of a Minimum Funding 
Requirement’. The amendments now enable recognition of an 
asset in the form of prepaid minimum funding contributions
  ‘Improvements to IFRSs 2010’. The amendments made to 
standards under the 2010 improvements to IFRSs have had  
no impact on the Group.
(ii) Accounting standards, amendments and interpretations to 
existing standards not yet effective, endorsed by the EU and not 
adopted early by the Group
The following have been published and, when approved by the 
EU, will be mandatory for periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2012 and have not been adopted early by the Group:
  IFRS 1 (amended) ‘Severe Hyperinﬂation and Removal of  
Fixed Dates for First-time Adopters’
  IFRS 7 (amended) ‘Transfers of Financial Assets’
  IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’
  IFRS 11 ‘ Joint Arrangements’
  IFRS 12’ Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities’
  IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’
  IAS 1 (amended) ‘Presentation of Items of Other 
Comprehensive Income’
  IAS 12 (amended) ‘Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying 
Assets’
  IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee Beneﬁts’
  IAS 27 (revised) ‘Separate Financial Statements’
  IAS 28 (revised) ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’.
The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards 
listed above will have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements 
of the Group in future periods, except as follows:
  IFRS 11 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of 
joint arrangements
  IFRS 12 will impact the disclosure of the interests the Group has 
in other entities
  IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain 
assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures

Signiﬁcant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2011
  IAS 12 (amended) will impact the measurement of deferred  
tax on the Group’s investment properties, by introducing  
the rebuttable presumption that the carrying value will be 
recovered entirely through sale
  IAS 19 (revised) will impact the measurement of the various 
components representing movements in the deﬁned beneﬁt 
pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the 
Group’s total obligation.
(f) Critical accounting judgments, key assumptions and sources 
of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements under IFRS requires 
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
Assumptions and estimates are reviewed on an ongoing basis and 
any revisions to them are recognised in the period in which they 
are revised.
(i) Critical accounting judgments
The following are critical judgments, apart from those involving 
estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the 
directors have made in the process of applying the Group’s 
accounting policies and that have the most signiﬁcant effect on 
the amounts recognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
  Determination of cash-generating units for goodwill 
impairment testing 
For the purposes of performing the Group’s annual impairment 
testing, in allocating goodwill to the cash-generating unit or 
groups of cash-generating units, judgement is required to 
establish the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for 
management purposes and which are expected to beneﬁt 
from the business combination giving rise to the goodwill.
  Disclosure of non-recurring items 
The Group has presented certain items of a one-off and 
material nature as non-recurring items in the income statement 
and notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. These items 
have been disclosed because the directors view their 
presentation as relevant to the understanding of the Group’s 
underlying ﬁnancial performance. Inclusion within this category 
is restrictive and is applied consistently to one-off costs and 
one-off gains.
  Disclosure of sensitivities 
Judgment is required in establishing whether it is necessary  
to disclose the sensitivity of the results of impairment testing  
to changes in estimates in arriving at value-in-use of the 
cash-generating units. Additionally, judgement is required in 
establishing which, if any, sensitivities in the fair value of shared 
equity loans arise from changes to inputs used in determining 
fair value.
  Fair value adjustments in business combinations 
The Group has made certain ﬁnal fair value adjustments in 
respect of the acquisition of the business, obligations and 
certain assets from the administrators of Connaught 
Partnerships Limited and fair value adjustments in respect of 
acquiring full control of North Shore Development Partnership 
Limited, in which the Group previously had a 50% shareholding.
(ii) Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation at the balance sheet date, that have a signiﬁcant risk 
of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets 
and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are discussed below.
   Accounting for construction and service contracts 
Recognition of revenue and margin is based on judgments 
made in respect of the ultimate proﬁtability of a contract.  
Such judgments are arrived at through the use of estimates in 
relation to the costs and value of work performed to date and 
to be performed in bringing contracts to completion, including 
satisfaction of maintenance responsibilities. These estimates 
are made by reference to recovery of pre-contract costs, 
surveys of progress against the construction programme, 
changes in work scope, the contractual terms under which the 
work is being performed, including the recoverability of any 
unagreed income from variations and the likely outcome of 
discussions on claims, costs incurred and external certiﬁcation 
of the work performed. The Group has appropriate control 
procedures to ensure all estimates are determined on a 
consistent basis and subject to appropriate review and 
authorisation.
  Tax 
Judgments are required in establishing the Group’s liability  
to pay taxes where tax positions are uncertain.
  Recognition and measurement of intangible assets 
The Group recognises certain intangible assets in respect  
of secured customer contracts, other contracts and related 
relationships, software, non-compete agreements and 
goodwill. Recognition and subsequent measurement requires 
management to make certain assumptions and estimates, 
particularly in respect of the future potential beneﬁts to be 
derived and the estimated useful lives over which the future 
economic beneﬁts are expected to ﬂow to the Group.
  Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
Goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an 
impairment test on an annual basis or earlier where any event 
or change in circumstance is identiﬁed that indicates that the 
carrying value may not be recoverable. Testing for impairment 
requires a comparison of the carrying amount of goodwill and 
other intangible assets against the recoverable amount, which 
is the value-in-use of the cash-generating unit to which the 
goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated.
Value-in-use requires estimation of the future cash ﬂows expected 
from the cash-generating unit as well as an appropriate growth 
factor and a pre-tax discount rate reﬂecting current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to 
the asset to calculate the present value of the cash ﬂows. Details 
of the estimates used are set out in note 9.
   Investment properties 
In assessing the fair value of investment properties, estimates 
are made of the value of properties with reference to market 
evidence of transaction proceeds for similar properties.
  Recognition and measurement of the fair value of shared 
equity loans 
The Group’s balance sheet includes loans that arise on the sale 
of properties under shared equity home ownership schemes 
which are recognised and measured at fair value through proﬁt 
or loss (as discussed in the Group’s accounting policies below).  Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
75
Because it is impracticable to obtain regular market valuations 
on a property-by-property basis, except as required at 
repayment, the Group makes estimates of fair value of the 
loans on a portfolio basis. Key assumptions used by 
management in making these estimates include market value 
growth, the discount rate, the anticipated loan duration and the 
expected rate of debtor default. Assumptions made in relation 
to these inputs are set out in note 13 and have a material impact 
on the carrying value of the loan portfolio recognised on the 
balance sheet and the fair value movement recognised in the 
income statement.
  Impairment of work in progress 
In assessing whether work in progress is impaired, estimates 
are made of future sales revenue, timing and build costs. The 
Group has controls in place to ensure that estimates of sales 
revenue are consistent, and external valuations are used where 
appropriate.
  Accounting for the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt plan 
The directors engage an independent and qualiﬁed actuary to 
calculate the Group’s liability in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
plan. In order to arrive at this valuation, certain assumptions in 
respect of discount rates, salary escalations, expected return 
on the plan’s assets and future pension increases have been 
made. Estimates and judgments regarding future mortality are 
derived using published statistics and mortality tables. As the 
actual rates of increase and mortality may differ from those 
assumed, the actual pension liability may differ from that 
recognised in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Details 
of the assumptions made are set out in note 19.
  Provisions 
In valuing the provision for the Group’s retained insurance  
risks, assumptions are made on the rate of occurrence and 
severity of events for which the Group will bear liability and 
external valuations are used where appropriate. When valuing 
provisions for known legal claims, assessment of the likely 
success and value of any claim is based on internal and  
external advice.
The accounting policies as set out below have been applied 
consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements incorporate the ﬁnancial 
statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries), together with the Group’s share of  
the results of joint ventures made up to 31 December each year.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition 
method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a 
subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities 
incurred and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Consideration transferred also includes 
the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are 
expensed in administrative expenses as incurred. All identiﬁable 
assets and liabilities acquired and contingent liabilities assumed 
are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date.  
As permitted, on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, a non-
controlling interest in the acquiree is recognised at fair value  
or at the acquiree’s share of the acquiree’s net assets.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of any 
previously held equity interest in the acquiree as compared with 
the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets are recognised  
as goodwill. Where the Group’s share of identiﬁable net assets 
acquired exceeds the total consideration transferred, a gain from 
a bargain purchase is recognised immediately in the income 
statement after the fair values initially determined have been 
reassessed.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated 
subsidiaries are identiﬁed separately from the Group’s equity 
therein. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests 
consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original 
business combination (see below) and the non-controlling 
interest’s share of the changes in equity since the date of the 
combination.
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities that are controlled by the Group. Control 
is exerted where the Group has the power to govern, directly or 
indirectly, the ﬁnancial and operating policies of the entity so as  
to obtain economic beneﬁts from its activities. Typically, a 
shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights is indicative  
of control. However, the impact of potential voting rights currently 
exercisable is taken into consideration.
The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group from the date that 
control is obtained to the date that control ceases. The accounting 
policies of new subsidiaries are changed where necessary to align 
them with those of the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of the acquiree are 
initially measured at the non-controlling interests’ share of the  
net fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised or at fair  
value, as determined on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.
(b) Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or  
more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to 
joint control, which requires unanimous consent for strategic 
ﬁnancial and operating decisions.
(i) Jointly controlled entities
A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture that involves the 
establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity in 
which each venturer has an interest. The results, assets and 
liabilities of jointly controlled entities are incorporated in the 
ﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Goodwill relating to a joint venture which is acquired directly is 
included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not 
amortised. After application of the equity method, the Group’s 
investments in joint ventures are reviewed to determine whether 
any additional impairment loss in relation to the net investment in 
the joint venture is required. When there is a change recognised 
directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Group recognises its 
share of any change and discloses this, where applicable, in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Where the Group’s share of losses exceeds its equity accounted 
investment in a joint venture, the carrying amount of the equity 
interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is 
discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred 
legal or constructive obligations. Appropriate adjustment is made 
to the results of joint ventures where material differences exist 
between a joint venture’s accounting policies and those of  
the Group.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the 
shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established.
(ii) Jointly controlled operations
Construction contracts carried out in joint venture without the 
establishment of a legal entity are jointly controlled operations. 
The Group’s share of the results and net assets of these jointly 
controlled operations are included under each relevant heading  
in the income statement and the balance sheet.
(c) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income 
and expense arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated 
in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Unrealised 
gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investments 
are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in that 
investment. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way  
as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
Revenue and margin recognition
Revenue and margin are recognised as follows:
(a) Construction contracts
Revenue comprises the fair value of construction carried out in 
the year, based on an internal assessment of work carried out. 
Once the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated 
reliably, margin is recognised in the income statement on a stage 
of contract completion basis by reference to costs incurred to 
date and total forecast costs on the contract as a whole. Losses 
expected in bringing a contract to completion are recognised 
immediately in the income statement as soon as they are forecast. 
Where the outcome of variations is uncertain, the Group only 
recognises revenue and associated margin where it is probable 
that the client will approve the variation. Where the outcome of 
claims is uncertain, the Group only recognises revenue when 
negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is 
probable that the customer will accept the claim.
Where houses for open market sale are included in a construction 
contract as part of a mixed-tenure development, revenue on  
open market sales is recognised at fair value on sale completion 
and margin is recognised using the same principle as for the 
construction contract element of the development.
(b) Service contracts
Revenue comprises the fair value of work performed in the year 
based on an internal assessment of work carried out.
(c) Sale of development properties
Revenue from the sale of development properties is measured at 
the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue 
is recognised when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership 
have been transferred to the buyer, there is no continuing 
management involvement with the properties and the amount  
of revenue can be estimated reliably.
The transfer of risks and rewards vary depending on the individual 
terms of the contract of sale. For properties, transfer usually 
occurs when the ownership has been legally transferred to the 
purchaser. Revenue from the sale of properties taken in part 
exchange is not included in revenue.
(d) Sale of properties under the shared equity scheme
Revenue resulting from the sale of properties under the shared 
equity scheme is recognised at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable.
(e) Pre-contract costs
Costs incurred prior to the award of a contract are expensed  
until the point where it becomes probable that the contract will  
be obtained. Only after it is probable that the contract is forecast 
to be proﬁtable, costs that were directly related to obtaining  
the contract and which are separately identiﬁable and can be 
measured reliably are recognised as contract assets. Pre-contract 
costs are expensed in the income statement over the period of 
the contract.
In the case of PPP/PFI contracts, all costs incurred before the 
appointment as preferred bidder are expensed.
Where pre-contract costs are reimbursable, the amount received 
is applied against amounts expensed with any surplus over this 
amount being applied to costs which have been recognised as 
contract assets.
(f) Mobilisation costs
Mobilisation costs are those costs speciﬁcally incurred to enable 
performance of obligations in a contract after its award and form 
an integral part of the overall costs of a contract. Such costs are 
amortised over the period of the contract except where the 
contract becomes loss making, in which case the balance is 
immediately expensed.
(g) Government grants
Funding received in respect of developer grants, where funding  
is awarded to encourage the building and renovation of affordable 
housing, is recognised as revenue on a stage of completion basis 
over the life of the project to which the funding relates.
Funding received to support the construction of housing where 
current market prices would otherwise make a scheme ﬁnancially 
unviable is recognised as revenue on a legal completion basis 
when the properties to which it relates are sold. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
77
Government grants are initially recognised as deferred income  
at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the Group 
will comply with the conditions attached and the grants will  
be received.
Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and 
other interest earned. Interest income is recognised as it accrues 
in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance expense comprises interest on bank overdrafts, the 
unwinding of discounts on provisions, impairment losses 
recognised on ﬁnancial assets, amortisation of prepaid bank 
facility arrangement fees, commitment fees charged by lenders 
on the undrawn portion of available bank facilities and losses on 
hedging instruments recognised through the income statement. 
The ﬁnance charge component of minimum lease payments 
made under ﬁnance leases is also recognised as a ﬁnance expense 
using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement on  
an effective interest rate method in the period in which they  
are incurred except where such costs relate to qualifying assets 
for which the commencement date for capitalisation was on or 
after 1 January 2009. Borrowing costs directly attributable to  
the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset 
are included as part of the cost of that asset.
Income tax
The income tax expense represents the current and deferred tax 
charges. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the Group’s expected tax liability on taxable proﬁt 
for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at 
the reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable in respect 
of previous years.
Taxable proﬁt differs from that reported in the income statement 
because it is adjusted for items of income or expense that are 
assessable or deductible in other years and is adjusted for items 
that are never assessable or deductible.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting purposes and the 
corresponding tax bases used in tax computations. Deferred tax  
is not recognised for the initial recognition of assets or liabilities  
in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt, or differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that  
it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences which result 
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at the tax rates expected  
to apply when they reverse, based on the laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more 
likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are not discounted and are only offset where there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
(i) Initial recognition
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates,  
joint ventures and other business assets and liabilities.  
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition  
over the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets of the 
acquiree at the acquisition date. Where that excess is negative,  
it is immediately recognised in the income statement as a gain  
from a bargain purchase.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to 
IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject 
to being tested for impairment at that date. Goodwill written off  
to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated 
and is not included in determining any subsequent proﬁt or loss 
on disposal.
(ii) Subsequent measurement
Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
In respect of equity accounted investments, goodwill acquired 
directly is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
(iii) Impairment
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose  
of impairment testing. The cash-generating units to which the 
goodwill has been allocated is the smallest identiﬁable group of 
assets that generates cash inﬂows that are largely independent of 
the cash inﬂows from other assets or group of assets. The largest 
group to which goodwill is allocated for impairment testing 
purposes is the operating segment level.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is lower 
than the carrying amount of the unit, then the impairment loss is 
ﬁrst applied to the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis, based 
on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any such 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
(b) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets, such as those identiﬁed on acquisition by 
the Group that have ﬁnite useful lives, are recognised at fair value 
and measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses.
The Group has the following signiﬁcant classes of ﬁnite life 
intangible assets:
(i) Secured customer contracts
On acquisition, value is attributable to customer contracts to the 
extent that future economic beneﬁts are expected to ﬂow from 
the contracts. The fair value of customer contracts recognised in 
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements has been determined with 
the assistance of an independent expert. Secured customer 
contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives at a rate 
to match the expected future economic beneﬁts.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2011
(ii) Other contracts and related relationships
On acquisition, value is attributed to non-contractual relationships 
and other contracts with long-standing or valued clients to the 
extent that future economic beneﬁts are expected to ﬂow from 
the relationships. The fair value of other contracts and related 
relationships recognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
has been determined with the assistance of an independent 
expert. Other contracts and related relationships are amortised 
over their expected useful lives at a rate to match the expected 
future economic beneﬁts.
(iii) Software
Software acquired on acquisition is valued on a replacement cost 
basis and is amortised over its expected useful life on a straight-
line basis.
(iv) Non-compete agreements
Value is attributable to contractual non-compete agreements 
acquired through acquisition to the extent that they ensure that 
the value paid for a business is not diminished by the previous 
owner or its employees taking away revenue through competition. 
Non-compete agreements are amortised over their useful lives on 
a straight-line basis and removed when expired.
The estimated useful lives for the Group’s ﬁnite life intangible 
assets are:
Secured customer contracts 1–3 years
Other contracts and  
related relationships 1–12 years
Software 1–3 years
Non-compete agreements 3 years.
Property, plant and equipment
Freehold and leasehold property, plant, machinery and 
equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation is charged so as to 
write off the cost of the assets, other than land, over their 
estimated useful lives using the straight-line method on the 
following basis:
Plant, machinery  
and equipment Between 8.3% and 33% per annum
Freehold property 2% per annum
Leasehold property over the period of the lease.
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where 
shorter, over the term of the relevant lease. Residual values of 
property, plant and equipment are reviewed and updated 
annually. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they 
become available for productive use.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal against the carrying amount and are 
recognised in the income statement.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or 
capital appreciation is stated at its fair value at the balance sheet 
date. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
investment property are included in the income statement for the 
period in which they arise.
Shared equity scheme receivables
The Group offers shared equity home ownership schemes under 
which qualifying home buyers can defer payment of part of the 
agreed sales price up to a maximum of 25% until the earlier of 10 
years, remortgage or resale of the property. On occurrence of one 
of these events, the Group will receive a repayment based on its 
contributed equity percentage and the applicable market value of 
the property as determined by a member of the Royal Institute of 
Chartered Surveyors. Early or part repayment is allowable under 
the scheme and amounts are secured by way of a second charge 
over the property. The loans are non-interest bearing.
The shared equity loans receivable are a hybrid ﬁnancial 
instrument consisting of an initial principal component and an 
embedded derivative. Fair value movements are recognised in 
proﬁt from operations and the resulting ﬁnancial asset is 
presented as a non-current receivable.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
The cost of work in progress comprises raw materials, direct 
labour, other direct costs and related overheads. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price less applicable costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method with an appropriate allowance for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts recognised in the income statement when 
there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand 
deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to 
an insigniﬁcant risk of change in value.
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest rate method.
Leased assets
(a) Finance leases
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases. 
Finance lease assets are recognised as assets of the Group at an 
amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception 
of the lease. Subsequent to recognition, ﬁnance lease assets are 
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment 
losses. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
79
The lease liability is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance 
lease liability. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance 
charges and the reduction of lease liabilities so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. 
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
(b) Operating leases
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant 
lease.
Retirement beneﬁt schemes
(a) Deﬁned contribution plan
A deﬁned contribution plan is a post-retirement beneﬁt plan 
under which the Group pays ﬁxed contributions to a separate 
entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. The Group recognises payments to deﬁned contribution 
pension plans as staff costs in the income statement as and when 
they fall due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or reduction on future payments is 
available.
(b) Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a post-retirement plan other than a 
deﬁned contribution plan. The Group’s net liability is recognised in 
the balance sheet and is calculated by estimating the amount of 
future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior periods and discounting this to its 
present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair 
value of the plan’s assets are deducted.
The calculation of the net liability is performed by a qualiﬁed 
actuary on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method. 
The cost of the plan is charged to the income statement based  
on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the ﬁnancial year. 
Where the calculation results in a beneﬁt to the Group, the asset 
recognised is limited to the net of the total unrecognised past 
service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the 
plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the beneﬁts of the plan are improved, the portion of 
increased beneﬁt relating to past service by employees is 
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over 
the average period until the beneﬁts become vested. Where the 
beneﬁts vest immediately, the expense is recognised in the 
income statement immediately.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement 
of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.  
Net pension obligations are included in the balance sheet at  
the present value of the plan liabilities, less the fair value of the 
plan assets.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated 
reliably.
Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets, other than shared equity assets, are assessed for 
indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial 
assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a 
result of one or more events that occurred after the initial 
recognition of the ﬁnancial asset, the estimated future cash ﬂows 
of the investment have been reduced. For loans and receivables, 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the 
asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash ﬂows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of ﬁnancial assets is reduced by the 
impairment loss directly for all ﬁnancial assets with the exception 
of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced 
through the use of a provision for impairment losses. When a 
trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the 
provision. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written 
off are credited against the provision. Changes in the carrying 
amount of the allowance are recognised in the income statement.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss 
previously recognised decreases and this decrease can be 
objectively related to an event that occurred after the impairment 
was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is 
reversed through the income statement.
Government grants
Revenue arising from Government grants is recognised on either a 
stage of completion or legal completion basis.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments (share awards or share options) to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant and are recognised as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period from the 
date of grant to the date on which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards or options.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value  
at each balance sheet date and recognised as an expense, with  
a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period from the 
date of grant to the date on which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the payment. Any changes in the fair 
value of the liability are recognised as an employee expense in the 
income statement. Fair value is measured by use of a modiﬁed 
Black-Scholes model. None of these awards when granted was 
subject to a share price related performance condition.
Related National Insurance Contributions are accrued on the basis 
of the intrinsic value of outstanding share-based payments and 
are remeasured at each reporting date.
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based 
Payments’ (‘IFRS 2’). In accordance with the transitional 
provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity 
instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as  
of 1 January 2005.

for the year ended 31 December 2011
Financial receivables
Certain joint ventures’ ﬁnancial receivables are measured at fair 
value at the balance sheet date. The fair value is determined by 
discounting the future cash ﬂows directly associated with the 
ﬁnancial receivables at a risk-adjusted discount rate. The change 
in fair value is recognised in equity to the extent of the Group’s 
equity accounted investment.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used in joint ventures to 
hedge long-term ﬂoating interest rate and Retail Prices Index 
(‘RPI’) exposures and in Group companies to manage their 
exposure to foreign exchange rate risk.
Under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’ (‘IAS 39’), interest rate, RPI swaps and foreign 
exchange forward contracts are stated in the balance sheet at  
fair value. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity 
documents the relationship between the hedging instrument  
and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives 
and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. 
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing 
basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments 
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂows of hedged items.
Where ﬁnancial instruments are designated as cash ﬂow  
hedges and are deemed to be effective, gains and losses on 
remeasurement relating to the effective portion are recognised  
in equity and gains and losses on the ineffective portion are 
recognised in the income statement, both to the extent of the 
Group’s equity accounted investment.
Embedded derivatives are separated from the underlying  
host contract where the economic characteristics and risks  
of the host contract and the embedded derivative are not  
closely related except, as is the case with the Group’s shared 
equity loan receivables, an election has been made to designate  
the ﬁnancial asset which contains an embedded derivative  
as fair value through proﬁt or loss as permitted by IAS 39.  
This designation can only be made at initial recognition  
and is irrevocable but can be made on a transaction-by-
transaction basis.
Dividends
Dividends to the Company’s shareholders are recognised  
as a liability in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in the  
period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s 
shareholders.

6 Income tax expense continued
During the year the Group resolved its discussions with HMRC concerning corporation tax matters arising following the acquisition  
of certain businesses and assets from Amec in 2007. This agreement with HMRC resulted in a signiﬁcant deferral of the Group’s tax 
liabilities. This agreement is shown in the ﬁgures above through a reduction in current tax liabilities of £21.9m, shown as prior year 
adjustments, offset by an increase in deferred tax liabilities of £19.1m (calculated at 25% tax rate), mainly shown as prior year 
adjustments. The net effect, a £2.8m reduction in the tax charge, is due to reductions in UK corporation tax rates since 2007, as the 
release of provisions for current taxation is calculated using higher tax rates than the 25% tax rate used for calculation of the closing  
2011 deferred tax balances.

In the course of the year, fair values on the acquisition of the business, obligations and certain assets from the administrators of 
Connaught Partnerships Limited in 2010 were ﬁnalised, leading to a restatement of the 2010 comparative balance sheet. Details are 
included in note 25.
Other contracts and related relationships arise from valuing the relationship with a number of clients where there is a secured pipeline  
of work or historic experience of a relationship and the real prospective opportunity of repeat work. Following a review of estimated 
useful lives, other contracts and related relationships will be fully amortised by 2019.
Secured customer contracts were fully amortised by 31 December 2010.
The Group acquired a non-compete agreement with a cost of £0.8m as a result of the acquisition of Powerminster Gleeson Services 
Limited on 30 June 2010 (note 25). This is of three years duration and is being amortised on a straight-line basis.
Goodwill represents the value of people, track record and expertise acquired within acquisitions that are not capable of being 
individually identiﬁed and separately recognised.
Included within goodwill is goodwill not deductible for tax purposes of £25.9m (2010: £26.8m).
Segmentation of goodwill and other intangible assets is disclosed in note 1.
Note 25 provides further details in respect of the fair value of intangible assets identiﬁed on acquisition and for the determination of 
goodwill arising on acquisition. Amortisation charges in respect of intangible assets with a ﬁnite life are recorded within administrative 
expenses in the income statement. The amortisation rates are given in the signiﬁcant accounting policies.
In testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets in each 
cash-generating unit has been compared against value in use. Value in use has been determined by using forecast pre-tax cash ﬂows 
from Board approved budgets for the next three years and extrapolating future growth and applying risk-adjusted discount rates that 
are speciﬁc to the cash-generating unit in question.
Cash ﬂows beyond three years have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2.30% (2010: 2.50%) which is equal to the  
HM Treasury’s November 2011 medium-term forecast for the UK economy. The risk-adjusted nominal discount rates used are 12%  
(2010: 12%) for Construction and Infrastructure, 13% (2010: 13%) for Affordable Housing and 15% (2010: 15%) for Urban Regeneration. 
The directors have reviewed the rates used and believe they are still appropriate.
The key assumptions in forecasting pre-tax cash ﬂows relate to future budgeted revenue, margin likely to be achieved and likely rates  
of long-term growth by market sector. Budgeted revenue and margin are based on views on past performance, secured workload and 
workload likely to be achievable in the short to medium-term, given trends in the relevant market sector as well as macroeconomic 
factors. In carrying out this exercise, no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been identiﬁed.

irrevocable election and results in all movements in the fair value of the loans being recognised in proﬁt or loss.
All of the shared equity loan receivables are secured by way of a second charge over the property. During the year, there were no 
defaults on any of the shared equity loans (2010: £nil) and there were repayments of shared equity loan receivables in the year of £0.3m 
(2010: £nil). All repayments were at values at or above the values held in the accounts. The Group’s maximum credit exposure is limited 
to the carrying value of the shared equity loan receivables granted.
Basis of valuation and assumptions made
Because there is no directly observable fair value for individual loans arising from the sale of speciﬁc properties under the scheme,  
the Group has developed a model for determining the fair value of the portfolio of loans based on national property prices, expected 
property price increases, expected loan defaults and a discount factor which reﬂects the interest rate expected on an instrument  
of similar risk and duration in the market. Details of the key assumptions made in this valuation are as follows:
     2011  2010 
Assumption 
Period over which shared equity loan receivables are discounted     7 years 7 years 
Weighted average annual property price increase assumed     2.5% 3.8% 
Nominal discount rate applied to initial shared equity receivable     5.8% 6.6% 
Rate of delinquency assumed in valuation of shared equity loan portfolio     0.0% 0.0%
At 31 December 2011, a total of 618 (2010: 462) properties had been sold under the shared equity scheme for which a loan was 
outstanding at the year end.
At 31 December 2011, the weighted average shared equity loan contribution (being the Group’s weighted average loan as a proportion 
of the selling price of a property) was 24% (2010: 25%). The maximum loan contribution by the Group under the shared equity scheme 
is 25% (2010: 25%).
The fair value measurement for shared equity loan receivables is classiﬁed as Level 3 as deﬁned by IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures’.
Sensitivity analysis
At 31 December 2011, if the nominal interest rate had been 1.2% higher at 7.0% and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s 
house price linked ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, which are solely shared equity loan receivables, would decrease in value, excluding the 
effects of tax, by £0.9m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
At 31 December 2011, if the period over which the shared equity loan receivables are discounted had been 10 years and all other 
variables were held constant, the Group’s house price linked ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, which are solely shared equity loan 
receivables, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by £1.5m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for  
the year and equity.

Other receivables     9.2  6.2 
     186.5  229.2 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
The average credit period on revenue is 15 days (2010: 23 days). No interest is charged on the trade receivables outstanding balance. 
Trade receivables overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £47.0m (2010: £50.0m) which are past due at 
the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a signiﬁcant change in credit quality and the Group 
considers that the amounts are still recoverable. The average age of these receivables is 161 days (2010: 120 days).
The Group’s exposure to credit risks and impairment losses related to trade and other receivables are disclosed in note 29, Financial 
Instruments.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from 
the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being 
large and spread across the Group’s operating segments. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision 
required in excess of the provision for impairment losses. No collateral is held by the Group as security.
Within the provision for impairment losses, there are no speciﬁc trade receivables (2010: £nil) from debtors which have been placed into 
liquidation or administration.
At the reporting date, there were no trade and other receivables which have had renegotiated terms that would otherwise have been 
past due.

Contract costs incurred plus recognised proﬁts less recognised losses to date and progress billings include contract activity which the 
Group has not recognised in the income statement as it occurred prior to historic acquisitions.
Amounts recoverable on construction contracts are stated at cost plus the proﬁt attributable to that contract, less any impairment 
losses. Progress payments for construction contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable. Amounts due to construction contract 
customers represent amounts received in excess of revenue recognised on construction contracts.
At 31 December 2011, retentions held by customers for contract work amounted to £58.4m (2010: £57.1m). Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

method.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value. The average credit period taken for 
trade purchases is 28 days (2010: 25 days). No interest was incurred on outstanding balances. The Group has ﬁnancial risk management 
policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid when due except in cases of genuine dispute.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain of its property, plant and equipment under ﬁnance leases. The average lease term is six years 
(2010: six years). For the year ended 31 December 2011, the average effective borrowing rate was 5% (2010: 5%). Interest rates are ﬁxed 
at the contract date. All leases are on a ﬁxed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental 
payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in sterling. The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations approximates to their carrying amount. 
The Group’s obligations under ﬁnance leases are secured on the assets to which the leases relate.
19 Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Deﬁned contribution plans
(i) The Morgan Sindall Retirement Beneﬁts Plan
The Morgan Sindall Retirement Beneﬁts Plan (‘the Plan’) was established on 31 May 1995 and currently operates on deﬁned contribution 
principles for employees of the Group. The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of 
the Trustees of the Plan. The total cost charged to the income statement of £9.2m (2010: £9.2m) represents contributions payable to 
the deﬁned contribution section of the Plan by the Group.
As at 31 December 2011, contributions of £0.9m (2010: £1.0m) were due in respect of December’s contribution not paid over to the Plan. 
The Company, with the consent of the Trustees, can decide how to use monies held in a deﬁned contribution general account.
(ii) Local Government Pension Schemes
The Group makes contributions on deﬁned contribution principles to a number of Local Government Pension Schemes (‘LGPS’) for 
employees who have transferred to the Group from other employers. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the 
Group under the control of the Trustees of the LGPS. The total cost charged to the income statement of £0.3m (2010: £0.1m) represents 
contributions payable to these LGPS by the Group.

Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Plan includes a deﬁned beneﬁt section comprising liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued beneﬁt rights of active 
and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group. These include salary related 
beneﬁts for members in respect of beneﬁts accrued before 31 May 1995 (and beneﬁts transferred in from The Snape Group Limited 
Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme include accruals up to 1 August 1997). No further deﬁned beneﬁt membership rights can accrue after 
those dates.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities was prepared at 31 December 2011. 
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.

Life expectancy
For the disclosures as at 31 December 2011, the S1NXA series of tables (31 December 2010, the S1NXA series of tables) from the 
Continuous Mortality Investigation were adopted appropriate to members’ actual years of birth and with a 95% scaling factor for males 
and 100% for females. Medium cohort projections with a minimum underpin of 1.5% were adopted for future improvements in life 
expectancy.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows:
     2011  2010 
Male     87.1  87.1

At 31 December 2011, the Group had unused tax losses of £0.6m (2010: £0.6m) available for offset against future proﬁts. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses due to the unpredictability of future proﬁt streams against which these losses 
may be utilised. Losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
The UK corporation tax rate is set to reduce to 25% in April 2012, affecting the closing deferred tax balances as shown above. Further 
reductions in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% are expected but not yet legislated. The closing net deferred tax liability would reduce 
by £1.6m to £18.2m if these further expected changes were taken into account. Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

Own shares
Own shares at cost represent 766,714 (2010: 781,444) shares in the Company held in the Morgan Sindall Employee Beneﬁt Trust  
(‘the Trust’) in connection with the ESOP 2007 and the 2005 Plan. The trustees of the Trust purchase the Company’s shares in the  
open market with ﬁnancing provided by the Company on the basis of regular reviews of the share liabilities of the relevant schemes.  
All of the shares held by the Trust were unallocated at the year end and dividends on these shares have been waived. The cost of  
shares expected to be awarded by the Trust is charged over the three year period to which the award relates. Based on the Company’s 
share price at 31 December 2011 of £5.94 (2010: £7.05), the market value of the shares was £4,554,281 (2010: £5,509,180). Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

25 Acquisition of subsidiaries
Final valuation of the business, obligations and certain assets acquired from the administrators of Connaught Partnerships Limited
On 9 September 2010, the Group acquired the business, obligations and certain assets from the administrators of Connaught 
Partnerships Limited (‘Connaught’). On pages 104 and 105 of the Group’s 2010 annual report and accounts, the provisional fair  
values of the net assets and goodwill acquired were reported. The Group has since completed the fair value exercise. This led to  
further adjustments of £1.1m. The goodwill arising and fair values are as follows:
      £m
Total purchase consideration: cash      28.0  
Net assets acquired      4.5 
Goodwill      23.5 
Goodwill arising on this acquisition represents the value of people, track record, expertise and opportunity to access new markets 
acquired within acquisitions that are not capable of being individually identiﬁed and separately recognised.

Acquisition of investment from partner in a joint venture
During the year the Group, through its subsidiary Muse Developments Limited, acquired from Urban Splash Yorkshire Limited its 50% 
interest in the jointly owned North Shore Development Partnership Limited. As a result of the transaction, Muse Developments Limited 
now owns the entire issued share capital of North Shore Development Partnership Limited. The total amount payable to Urban Splash 
Yorkshire Limited for the purchase was £0.4m, which was paid in cash. This transaction has been accounted for as a step acquisition 
under IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’.
The fair value of the Group’s existing 50% interest in North Shore Development Partnership Limited was £1.5m, comprising equity 
£0.9m, goodwill of £0.2m and an intangible asset of £0.4m. The directors determined that the fair value of the pre-existing interest in 
the joint venture was different from its carrying value of £2.2m. The total consideration due to Urban Splash Yorkshire Limited for the 
remaining 50% interest was £0.4m and the fair values of the identiﬁable net assets of the whole of North Shore Development 
Partnership Limited were as follows:

bank and other short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less. 27 Share-based payments
A description of the Group’s employee share option schemes is set out in note 24.
The Company’s 2005 Plan and the ESOP 2007 provide for a grant price equal to the average of the middle market price of the 
Company’s shares at close of business on the ﬁve dealing days preceding the date of grant. Details of the ESOP 2007 option vesting 
periods are given in note 24 (no performance criteria are applied to options granted under this scheme). The vesting periods and 
performance conditions for options and share awards granted under the 2005 Plan are given in the directors’ remuneration report  
on pages 53 to 61.
Under the SAYE scheme, employees are granted an option to purchase shares at a discount of up to 20% of the market price at  
grant, exercisable after three years from date of grant for a six month period from the proceeds of a monthly savings contract over  
the relevant period. The scheme is open to all employees with six months’ continuous service at the invitation date. No performance 
criteria are applied to the exercise of SAYE options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £7.08 (2010: £6.47).  
The options outstanding at 31 December 2011 had a weighted average exercise price of £6.09 (2010: £7.12) and, a weighted average 
remaining contractual life of 2.1 years (2010: 1.2 years). In 2011, options under the ESOP 2007 were granted on 2 March, 30 March,  
21 April and 16 May, and the estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates was £0.3m (2010: £0.1m). Options and share 
awards under the 2005 Plan were granted on 30 March and 16 May. The estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates was 
£0.8m (2010: £0.6m) and the estimated fair value of the share awards granted on those dates was £1.5m (2010: £1.0m). 1,607,119 options 
were granted under the SAYE scheme in 2011 (2010: nil). The estimated fair value of options granted under the SAYE scheme on  
27 September 2011 was £1.0m (2010: £nil).
A modiﬁed Black-Scholes model has been used to value the options and awards set out below. None of the options or awards granted 
was subject to a share price related performance condition.

are subject to performance conditions.
(e)
  At the end of the vesting period, award holders may receive the value of any dividends paid during the vesting period in respect of 
their vested shares. Consequently, the fair value is not discounted for value lost in respect of dividends.

The Group grants to certain employees share appreciation rights (‘phantoms’) that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the 
phantoms to the employee at the date of exercise. As cash-settled share-based payment awards, the phantoms are revalued at the end 
of each reporting year. There were no phantoms granted during the year (2010: nil). Phantoms are exercisable between three and eight 
years from the date of grant of the phantom. The total intrinsic value at 31 December 2011 was £nil (2010: £nil). The Group had recorded 
no liabilities at 31 December 2011 in respect of phantoms (2010: £0.1m).

29 Financial instruments
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. The carrying amount of these assets 
approximates to their fair value.
Included within cash and cash equivalents is £35.4m (2010: £26.7m) which is the Group’s share of cash held within jointly controlled 
operations.
General risk management principles
The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. A formal risk 
assessment and management framework for assessing, monitoring and managing the strategic operational and ﬁnancial risks of the 
Group is in place to ensure appropriate risk management of its operations. Internal control and risk management systems are 
embedded in the operations of the divisions.
The key business risks identiﬁed are discussed in detail in the risk review on pages 18 to 21 and the corporate governance statement  
on pages 48 to 52.
Financial risks and management
The Group has exposure to a variety of ﬁnancial risks through the conduct of its operations. Risk management is governed by the 
Group’s operational policies, which are subject to periodic review by the Group’s internal audit team and twice yearly review by 
management. The policies include written principles for the Group’s risk management as well as speciﬁc policies, guidelines and 
authorisation procedures in respect of speciﬁc risk mitigation techniques such as the use of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.  
The Group does not enter into derivative ﬁnancial instruments for speculative purposes.
The following represent the key ﬁnancial risks resulting from the Group’s use of ﬁnancial instruments:
  credit risk
  liquidity risk
  market risk.
(a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations and results primarily from the Group’s trade receivables and amounts due from construction contract customers.
Amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivables
The Group’s primary exposure to credit risk arises from the potential for non-payment or default from construction contract debtors 
and trade receivables. The degree to which the Group is exposed to this credit risk depends on the individual characteristics of the 
contract counterparty and the nature of the project. The Group’s credit risk is also inﬂuenced by general macroeconomic conditions. 
The Group primarily operates in one geographical segment, being the UK. The Group does not have any signiﬁcant concentration  
risk in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or trade receivable balances at the reporting date with receivables 
spread across a wide range of customers. Due to the nature of the Group’s operations, it is normal practice for customers to hold 
retentions in respect of contracts completed. Retentions held by customers at 31 December 2011 were £58.4m (2010: £57.1m).
The Group manages its exposure to credit risk through the application of its credit risk management policies which specify the minimum 
requirements in respect of the creditworthiness of potential customers, assessed through reports from credit agencies, and the timing 
and extent of progress payments in respect of contracts.
The risk management policies of the Group also specify procedures in respect of obtaining parent company guarantees or, in certain 
circumstances, use of escrow accounts which, in the event of default, mean that the Group may have a secure claim. The Group does 
not require collateral in respect of amounts due from construction contract customers or trade receivables.
The Group manages the collection of retentions through its post-completion project monitoring procedures and ongoing contact  
with customers to ensure that potential issues that could lead to the non-payment of retentions are identiﬁed and addressed promptly. 
The Group assesses amounts due from construction contract customers and trade receivable balances for impairment and establishes 
a provision for impairment losses that represents its estimate of incurred losses.

Decrease in provision recognised in the income statement     (0.3) (0.6)
Balance at 31 December     0.9  2.0 
(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁnancial obligations as and when they fall due. The ultimate 
responsibility for liquidity risk rests with the Board.
The Group aims to manage liquidity by ensuring that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under  
both normal and stress conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.
The Group actively manages its liquidity proﬁle whilst ensuring that the return achieved on cash and investments is maximised.  
The Group had no drawn down debt facilities as at 31 December 2011 (2010: £nil).
As discussed below under capital management, the Group does not have any derivative or non-derivative ﬁnancial liabilities with  
the exception of ﬁnance lease liabilities, trade and other payables, current tax liabilities and retirement beneﬁt obligations. Current tax 
liabilities and trade and other payables are generally non-interest bearing and, therefore, have no weighted average effective interest 
rates. Retirement beneﬁt obligations are measured at the net of the present value of retirement beneﬁt obligations and the fair value  
of the Plan assets. Finance lease liabilities are carried at the present value of the minimum lease payments. An analysis of the maturity 
proﬁle for ﬁnance lease liabilities is contained in note 18.
The Group reports cash balances daily and invests surplus cash to maximise income whilst preserving credit quality. The Group 
prepares weekly short-term and monthly long-term cash forecasts, which are used to assess the Group’s expected cash performance 
and compare with the facilities available to the Group and the Group’s covenants.
In addition to its cash balances, the Group has £100m of committed loan facilities available until September 2015.
Key risks to liquidity and cash balances are a downturn in contracting volumes, a decrease in the value of open market sales, 
deterioration in credit terms obtainable in the market from suppliers and subcontractors, a downturn in the proﬁtability of work,  
delayed receipt of cash from customers and the risk that major clients or suppliers suffer ﬁnancial distress leading to non-payment  
of debts or costly and time consuming reallocation and rescheduling of work. Certain measures and KPIs are continually monitored 
throughout the Group and used to quickly identify issues as they arise, enabling the Group to address them promptly. 108
Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011
Consolidated ﬁnancial statements
Notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements
continued
29 Financial instruments continued
Key amongst these are continual monitoring of the forward order book, including the status of orders and likely timescales for 
realisation so that contracting volumes are well understood; monitoring of overhead levels to ensure they remain appropriate to 
contracting volumes, weekly monitoring of open market house sales volumes and prices; continual monitoring of working capital 
exceptions (overdue debts and conversion of work performed into certiﬁcates and invoices); continual review of levels of current  
and forecast proﬁtability on contracts; review of client and supplier credit references; and approval of credit terms with clients and 
suppliers to ensure they are appropriate.

     2011  2010  
     £m £m
Not past due     162.1  123.9

Past due greater than one year     0.3  – 
     182.6  149.9 
(c) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates or equity prices, will affect the Group’s 
income or the carrying amount of its holdings of ﬁnancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to achieve a level of 
market risk that is within acceptable parameters as set out in the Group risk management framework.
Interest rate risk
The Group is not exposed to signiﬁcant interest rate risk as it does not have signiﬁcant interest bearing liabilities and its only interest 
bearing asset is cash invested on a short-term basis.
Certain of the Group’s equity accounted joint ventures enter into interest rate swaps to manage their exposure to interest rate risk 
arising on ﬂoating rate bank borrowings.
The Group’s share of joint ventures’ interest rate and Retail Prices Index swap contracts with nominal values of £154.4m (2010: £129.0m) 
have ﬁxed interest payments at an average rate of 4.55% (2010: 4.83%) for periods up until 2041.
The Group’s share of the fair value of swaps entered into at 31 December 2011 by joint ventures is estimated at a £4.0m liability (2010: 
£3.1m liability). These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date. All interest rate swaps 
are designated as hedging instruments and are effective as cash ﬂow hedges. The fair value thereof has been taken to the hedging 
reserve.
Currency risk
The majority of the Group’s operations are carried out in the UK and the Group has an insigniﬁcant level of exposure to currency risk  
on sales and purchases. Given the insigniﬁcant exposure to foreign currency movements, the Group’s policy is not to hedge foreign 
currency transactions unless they are material, at which point derivative ﬁnancial instruments are entered into so as to hedge forecast  
or actual foreign currency exposures.
During the year a UK construction project joint venture in which the Group participates entered into forward foreign exchange 
contracts, in order to hedge UK project costs incurred in Euros. The Group’s share of the fair value of these forward foreign exchange 
contracts as at the year end is immaterial, accordingly no value for these contracts is shown upon the balance sheet. The Group’s share 
of the value of project costs which have been hedged is £5.3m.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have been treated as cash ﬂow hedges. All of the hedges have been treated as fully effective.  
It is expected that the project costs will be incurred in the same periods as the hedges will mature, at which time any amount deferred in 
equity will be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss. The fair values of the contracts have been calculated using level 2 – inputs that are observable 
for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices).
A 5% reduction in the value of the Euro against sterling would result in a £0.3m reduction in the fair value of the contracts, which would 
be shown in cash ﬂow hedging reserve. 109

Capital management
The Board aims to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market conﬁdence and to sustain the future 
development of the business, and its approach to capital management is explained fully in the ﬁnance review on page 14.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, 
comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 24 and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
The cash and cash equivalents are supplemented by the £100m of bank facilities which are committed until September 2015.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any capital 
requirements imposed by regulatory authorities.
30 Subsequent events
On 15 February 2012 the Group disposed of its 33% interest in the Dorset Fire & Rescue PFI for cash consideration of £3.8m.  
This represents a discount on the directors’ valuation cash ﬂows of 7%.

The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, 
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state 
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and  
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement, 
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the Parent 
Company ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply 
with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This 
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements:
  give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs  
as at 31 December 2011 and of its loss for the year then ended;
  have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements  
of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the  
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
  the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial 
year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:
  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us or
  the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the 
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns or
  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law 
are not made or
  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group ﬁnancial statements  
of Morgan Sindall Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Basis of accounting
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the Company are presented 
as required by the Companies Act 2006. These ﬁnancial 
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as 
discussed in the ﬁnance review on page 14, under the historic cost 
convention in accordance with the applicable United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards. The ﬁnancial statements are presented in 
pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional currency, and 
unless otherwise stated have been rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
Under Financial Reporting Standard (‘FRS’) 1 (revised 1996) ‘Cash 
Flow Statements’, the Company is exempt from the requirement 
to prepare a cash ﬂow statement on the basis that its consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements, which include the Company and present a 
consolidated cash ﬂow statement, are publicly available.
Under FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, the Company is exempt 
from the requirement to disclose related party transactions with 
entities within the Group where the Company’s interest is 100%.
The Company’s accounting policies have been applied on a 
consistent basis throughout the year.
Signiﬁcant estimates and judgments
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management  
to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of 
assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ 
from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis  
and any revision to estimates or assumptions are recognised  
in the period in which revised and in any future periods affected.
The estimates and judgments concerning the future at 31 
December 2011 and that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a 
material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
within the next ﬁnancial year are as follows:
(a) Taxation
Judgments are required in establishing the Company’s liability to 
pay taxes where tax positions are uncertain. Details of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are set out in note 6.
(b) Accounting for the Company’s deﬁned beneﬁt plan
The directors engage an independent and qualiﬁed actuary to 
calculate the Company’s liability in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
plan. In order to arrive at this valuation, certain assumptions in 
respect of discount rates, salary escalations, expected return on 
the plan’s assets and future pension increases have been made. 
Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on published 
statistics and mortality tables. As the actual rates of increase and 
mortality may differ from those assumed, the actual pension 
liability may differ from that recognised in these ﬁnancial 
statements. Assumptions used and full details of the Company’s 
liability are set out in full in note 7.
Accounting policies
Fixed asset investments
Investments held as ﬁxed assets are stated at cost less provision 
for any impairment in value. Investments are reviewed for 
impairment at the earlier of the Company’s reporting date or 
where an indicator of impairment is identiﬁed.
Tangible ﬁxed assets and depreciation
No depreciation is provided on freehold land. On other assets, 
depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost  
of ﬁxed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Freehold property 2% per annum
Plant, machinery  
and equipment Between 10% and 33% per annum
Taxation
The tax expense represents the current tax and deferred tax 
charges. Tax is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account except  
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in 
shareholders’ funds.
  Current tax
Current tax is the Company’s expected tax liability on taxable 
proﬁt for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the reporting date and any adjustments to tax payable 
in respect of previous years. Taxable proﬁt differs from that 
reported in the proﬁt and loss account because it is adjusted for 
items of income or expense that are assessable or deductible in 
other years and is adjusted for items that are never assessable  
or deductible.

Company ﬁnancial statements

  Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result 
in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a 
right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply 
when they crystallise based on tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and 
expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in 
which they are included in the ﬁnancial statements. Deferred tax is 
not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of 
ﬁxed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on 
unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is 
no commitment to remit these earnings. Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not 
that there will be future taxable proﬁts against which to recover 
carried forward future tax losses and from which the reversal of 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Retirement beneﬁt schemes
The Company has two retirement beneﬁt plans:
(a) Deﬁned contribution plan
A deﬁned contribution plan is a post-retirement beneﬁt plan 
under which the Company pays ﬁxed contributions to a separate 
entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
amounts. The Company recognises payments to deﬁned 
contribution pension plans as an employee expense in the proﬁt 
and loss account as and when they are due.
(b) Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a post-retirement plan other than a 
deﬁned contribution plan. The Company’s net liability is 
recognised in the balance sheet and is calculated by estimating 
the amount of future beneﬁt that employees have earned in return 
for their service in the current and prior periods and discounting 
this to its present value. Any unrecognised past service costs and 
the fair value of the plan’s assets are deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualiﬁed actuary on an annual 
basis using the projected unit credit method. The cost of the plan 
is charged to the proﬁt and loss account based on actuarial 
assumptions at the beginning of the ﬁnancial year. Where the 
calculation results in a beneﬁt to the Company, the asset 
recognised is limited to the net of the total unrecognised past 
service costs and the present value of any future refunds from  
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the beneﬁts of the plan are improved, the portion of 
increased beneﬁt relating to past service by employees is 
recognised in the proﬁt and loss account on a straight-line basis 
over the average period until the beneﬁts are vested. Where the 
beneﬁts vest immediately, the expense is recognised in the proﬁt 
and loss account immediately.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the combined 
statement of movements in reserves and shareholders’ funds in 
the period in which they occur. Net pension obligations are 
included in the balance sheet at the present value of the plan 
liabilities, less the fair value of the plan assets and any related 
deferred tax asset.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal 
or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outﬂow of resources will be required to settle the 
obligation, and the amount of the obligation can be estimated 
reliably.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 ‘Share-
Based Payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, 
FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after  
7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company grants equity-settled and cash-settled share-based 
payments (share awards or share options) to certain employees. 
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant and are recognised as an employee expense, 
with a corresponding increase in shareholders’ funds, over the 
period from date of grant to the date on which the employees 
become unconditionally entitled to the awards or options.
Cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value  
at each balance sheet date and recognised as an expense, with  
a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period from  
date of grant to the date on which the employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the payment. Any changes in the fair 
value of the liability are recognised as an employee expense or 
income in the proﬁt and loss account. Fair value is measured by 
use of a modiﬁed Black-Scholes model.
None of these awards when granted was subject to a share price 
related performance condition.
Related National Insurance Contributions are accrued on the basis 
of the intrinsic value of outstanding share-based payments and 
are remeasured at each reporting date.
Leased assets
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the proﬁt 
and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
relevant lease.
Finance income and expense
Finance income comprises bank and other interest. Interest 
income is recognised in the proﬁt and loss account using the 
effective interest rate method. Finance expense comprises 
interest on bank overdrafts, amortisation of prepaid bank facility 
arrangement fees and commitment fees charged by lenders on 
the undrawn portion of available bank facilities.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the proﬁt and loss account  
on an effective interest method in the period in which they  
are incurred.
Financial guarantees
The Company provides certain guarantees in respect of the 
indebtedness of its subsidiary undertakings and in respect of 
bonds and claims under contracting and other arrangements 
which include joint arrangements and joint ventures entered  
into in the ordinary course of business.
The Company considers such agreements to be indemnity 
arrangements and, as such, accounts for them as contingent 
liabilities unless it becomes probable that the Company will be 
required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Dividends
The Company has adopted FRS 21 ‘Events after the Balance Sheet 
Date’ and accordingly only recognises a liability once there is an 
obligation to pay. As a result, a dividend will only be recognised 
once the shareholders approve it.

ﬁnancial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax within retirement beneﬁt obligation     0.3  0.5 
     1.4  2.2 
At 31 December 2011, the Company had unused tax losses of £0.6m (2010: £0.6m) available for offset against future proﬁts. No deferred 
tax asset has been recognised in respect of such losses due to the unpredictability of future proﬁt streams against which these losses 
may be utilised. Losses may be carried forward indeﬁnitely.
The UK Corporation tax rate is set to reduce to 25% in April 2012, affecting the closing deferred tax balance as shown above. Further 
reductions in the corporation tax rate to 23% are expected but not yet legislated. The closing deferred tax asset would reduce by a 
further £0.1m to £1.2m if these changes were taken into account. Notes to the Company ﬁnancial statements

7 Retirement beneﬁt schemes
Deﬁned contribution plan
The Morgan Sindall Retirement Beneﬁts Plan (‘the Plan’) was established on 31 May 1995 and operates on deﬁned contribution (‘DC’) 
principles for employees of the Group. The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of 
the Trustees. The total cost charged to the proﬁt and loss account of £0.4m (2010: £0.4m) represents contributions payable to the DC 
section of the Plan by the Company at rates speciﬁed in the Plan rules.
As at 31 December 2011, contributions of £0.1m (2010: £0.1m) were due in respect of December’s contribution not paid over to the Plan. 
The Company, with the consent of the Trustee directors, can decide how to use monies held in a “DC General Account”.
Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
The Plan includes some deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued beneﬁt rights of former active and 
deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group. These include salary related 
beneﬁts for members in respect of beneﬁts accrued before 31 May 1995 (and beneﬁts transferred in from The Snape Group Limited 
Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme include accruals up to 1 August 1997). No further deﬁned beneﬁt membership rights can accrue after  
that date.
Under the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement beneﬁts at a retirement age of 65. No other retirement beneﬁts are provided.  
The Plan is currently being funded by the Company.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2010 and was prepared using assumptions of a rate of investment 
return of 4.8% per annum in the period before retirement and 4.9% in the period after retirement, a rate of earnings escalation of 5.3% 
per annum and a rate of inﬂation of 3.8% per annum. The ongoing liabilities of the Plan were assessed using the projected unit credit 
method and the assets were taken at realisable market value. The actuarial valuation also showed that the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities were 
partly funded and the value of the assets of £5.9m represented 64% of the value of these liabilities on an ongoing funding basis. The 
next triennial valuation will be carried out as at 5 April 2013 when the funding position will be reappraised.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities was prepared as at 31 December 2011. 
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the 
projected unit credit method.

 Depending on their date of joining, members receive ﬁxed pension increases of 3.0% or 3.5%.
Life expectancy
For the disclosures as at 31 December 2011, the S1NXA series of tables from the Continuous Mortality Investigation were adopted 
appropriate to members’ actual years of birth and with a 95% scaling factor for males and 100% for females. Medium cohort projections 
with a minimum underpin of 1.5% were adopted for future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is as follows:
     2011  2010 
Male     87.1  87.1  
Female     89.6  89.6 
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date is as follows:
     2011  2010 
Male     90.0  90.0  
Female     92.5  92.5 
An increase of one year to the average life expectancy at 65 would increase the present value of the Plan liabilities by around 3.0% 
(2010: 3.0%). Morgan Sindall Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011

The expected return on Plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current 
investment policy. Expected yields on ﬁxed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
The Plan does not hold any ﬁnancial instruments issued by the Company and does not hold any property or other assets used by  
the Group.

Shareholder alerts
Unsolicited mail, investment advice and fraud
The Company is obliged by law to make its share register publicly 
available and, as a consequence, some shareholders may receive 
unsolicited mail. In addition, many companies have become aware 
that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or 
correspondence, typically from overseas ‘brokers’, concerning 
investment matters. 
These callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive  
and their activities have resulted in considerable losses for some 
investors. It is not just the novice investor that has been deceived 
in this way; many of the victims have been successfully investing 
for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any 
unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of 
free company reports.

There are several factors that could 
cause actual results to differ materially

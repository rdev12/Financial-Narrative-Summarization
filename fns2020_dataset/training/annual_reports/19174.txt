Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am delighted to announce that Norcros 
has recorded another year of revenue and 
underlying operating profit growth, a feat 
that the Group has now achieved for six 
consecutive years. Group revenue from 
continuing operations grew by 1.5% on 
a reported basis and 5.0% on a constant 
currency basis to £222.1m. Underlying 
operating profit at £17.0m, was 5.8% higher 
than prior year driven by a strong performance 
from our South African businesses, the highlight 
of which was the significant improvement 
in performance of Johnson Tiles South Africa. 
Also pleasing was the strong cash management 
demonstrated across the Group with 
underlying operating cash flow increasing 
to £22.9m (2014: £20.3m). 
Significant progress has been made during 
the year with the resolution of a number of 
our legacy issues. The disposal of Johnson 
Tiles Australia completed in May 2014 for 
£3.8m allowed the Group to focus on its 
strategic geographies of UK, South Africa 
and the Middle East. In the second half 
of the year we bought out our lease 
commitments on the surplus property 
at Orgreave Drive, Sheffield, and acquired 
the freehold for £3.4m, subsequently 
disposing of this freehold along with our 
remaining surplus freehold properties for 
£6.5m. These actions together with the 
recent resolution of our contractual dispute 
with Morrisons and the expiry of another 
onerous lease, means that the Group’s 
legacy property issues are now resolved 
in all material respects.
As a result of the strong operating cash 
generation, and the proceeds from the 
disposals of the surplus property and 
Johnson Tiles Australia, net debt reduced 
to £14.2m (2014: £26.9m), representing 
leverage of just 0.6 x EBITDA 
(2014: 1.2 x EBITDA).
In July 2014 we took advantage of 
favourable market conditions and agreed 
a new unsecured £70m banking facility 
with Lloyds Bank plc, Barclays Bank plc 
and HSBC Bank plc. The agreement also 
includes a £30m accordion facility which 
gives us further scope to fund growth 
through acquisition.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for the year of 0.375p (2014: 0.34p) per share. 
When added to the interim dividend of 0.185p 
(2014: 0.17p) per share which was paid 
on 7 January 2015, this will make a total 
dividend for the year of 0.56p (2014: 0.51p) 
per share, a 9.8% increase on the 
previous year.
SUMMARY
 — Sixth consecutive year of growth
 — Strong cash generation – 
underlying operating cash flow 
12.8% higher at £22.9m
 — Significant improvement 
in South African performance
 — Good progress on legacy issues
 — Net debt reduced to £14.2m 
from £26.9m
 — Underlying ROCE at 16.3% – 
ahead of strategic target 
 — Full year dividend increased 
by 9.8%

NORCROS HAS RECORDED ANOTHER YEAR OF 
REVENUE AND UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 
GROWTH, A FEAT THAT THE GROUP HAS NOW 
ACHIEVED FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE YEARS.” Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Overview

Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the Group 
operates to the highest standards in all aspects 
of governance and risk management. Our 
aim within Norcros is to manage a growing 
business effectively, while ensuring that 
proper operating procedures and internal 
controls are maintained at all times. 
Transparency is central to this objective 
and you will find more detail about our 
approach and progress over the last year 
in the Corporate Governance section 
of this report.
People
The people who work for the Group are 
undoubtedly our key asset and I am certain 
that the existing opportunities for long-term 
growth will ensure that our employees find 
Norcros a place where they will continue to 
enjoy rewarding careers. On behalf of the 
Board I congratulate them all for delivering 
another year of strong progress.
Summary
Notwithstanding the challenges in our 
markets, Norcros has continued to deliver 
a creditable year on year improvement in 
its trading performance in line with market 
expectations. At the same time excellent 
progress has been made on the legacy 
issues combined with strong cash 
generation resulting in a strengthening 
in the Group’s financial position.
As well as continuing to drive organic 
revenue growth we have committed 
additional resource to progress suitable 
acquisitions in support of our strategy of 
doubling revenue to £420m by 2018. Whilst 
no further transactions have been concluded 
at the date of this report, I remain confident 
that we are making good progress towards 
this particular strategic target and that we 
will be able to respond swiftly to realise 
opportunities as they arise.
I am especially pleased that we have 
achieved an underlying ROCE of 16.3% in 
the year, ahead of our strategic target of 
12–15%, reflecting continued improvements 
in our operational performance, and the 
benefit of disposing of our non-core assets.
I believe the Group is very well placed to 
build on the excellent progress achieved 
this year, and underpinned by our strong 
brands and leading market positions, I look 
forward to the future with optimism.

Group Chief Executive’s statement
Overview
Group revenue for the year increased 
by 1.5% to £222.1m (2014: £218.7m) and 
by 5.0% on a constant currency basis.
The UK market has remained challenging, 
with continued growth in the trade sector 
driven by continued improvements in new 
house build and housing transactions, but 
with only limited improvements in the retail 
sector impacted by sluggish consumer 
confidence particularly at the lower and 
middle income groups. UK revenue for the 
year at £149.1m (2014: £148.0m) was 0.7% 
ahead of the prior year, with higher revenue 
at Triton, Vado and Norcros Adhesives 
offsetting lower revenue at Johnson Tiles. 
UK underlying operating profit for the year 
was marginally lower at £13.8m (2014: £14.2m) 
with operating margins also slightly lower at 
9.2% (2014: 9.6%). Vado and Norcros Adhesives 
showed good profit progression in the year, 
and Triton maintained its strong profitability 
despite increasing revenue investment 
in order to develop new export markets. 
Johnson Tiles performance was impacted 
by lower revenue as well as production 
inefficiencies during part of the year which 
are now resolved.
I am particularly pleased to report 
a significantly improved performance in our 
South African business where revenue was 
15.1% higher on a constant currency basis 
and 3.2% higher on a reported basis. 
Underlying operating profit for the year in 
South Africa increased by 68.7% to £3.2m 
(2014: £1.9m) despite a weaker Rand, and 
operating margins improved from 2.7% to 
4.4%. All three businesses contributed to 
the improvement, with the benefits of the 
self–help initiatives and new investment 
beginning to be realised. In Johnson Tiles 
South Africa, exciting new product ranges 
have gained good market acceptance 
following the successful installation of 
our second inkjet printer, and together 
with continued manufacturing efficiency 
improvements, enabled the business to break 
even in the year, a significant improvement 
on last year. In TAL, strong revenue growth 
and the benefits of investment in new 
mixing and packaging equipment helped 
drive an improved performance, and in Tile 
Africa, although we are still in the initial 
phase of our roll-out programme, our 
exciting new CX store format is driving a 
much improved retail performance.
Group underlying operating profit at £17.0m 
(2014: £16.1m) was 5.8% higher than prior 
year, with Group underlying operating 
margins also ahead at 7.6% (2014: 7.3%).
Strong cash conversion in our businesses 
combined with the proceeds from the 
disposal of surplus property and Johnson 
Tiles Australia resulted in closing net debt 
at £14.2m (2014: £26.9 m), and leverage 
of 0.6 times EBITDA (2014: 1.2 times). 
With a new banking facility agreed in the 
year the Group is well placed to capitalise 
on opportunities as they arise.
Strategy
As reported in March 2013, the Board set 
itself three strategic targets. These are to 
double Group revenue to £420m by 2018, 
to maintain revenue derived outside of the 
UK at approximately 50% of Group revenue, 
and to sustain a pre-tax return on capital 
employed of 12% to 15% over the economic 
cycle. We remain committed to these 
targets and have made further progress 
towards achieving them.
The Group has continued to explore 
potential acquisitions and to further support 
this activity we have hired an experienced 
senior executive to solely focus on this key 
strategic initiative. Concurrently, continued 
investment in new product development 
programmes in our businesses is both 
generating organic revenue growth and 
driving Group synergies. For example, the 
first Vado branded electric shower range 
was recently launched into the specialist 
bathroom boutique channel and a new 
brassware range sourced directly from one 
of Vado’s Chinese suppliers was recently

Group Chief Executive
I AM PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO REPORT A SIGNIFICANTLY 
IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN OUR SOUTH AFRICAN BUSINESS 
WHERE REVENUE WAS 15.1% HIGHER ON A CONSTANT 
CURRENCY BASIS AND 3.2% HIGHER ON A REPORTED BASIS. 
UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT FOR THE YEAR IN 
SOUTH AFRICA INCREASED BY 68.7% TO £3.2M (2014: £1.9M).”
launched in our Tile Africa business 
in South Africa.
As announced last year, we completed 
the sale of our Australian tiles business to 
Kim Hin Industries Berhad on 30 May 2014 
which resulted in a net cash inflow of £3.8m. 
We also completed the lease exit and 
freehold acquisition of the property in 
Sheffield for £3.4m, subsequently selling 
it and other surplus property to Clowes 
Developments (UK) Ltd on 2 March 2015, 
which resulted in proceeds after costs 
of £6.1m. The disposal of these non-core 
assets is an excellent outcome for shareholders, 
reducing leverage and allowing executive 
management to fully focus on its target 
geographies of the UK, Africa and the 
Middle East. 
Summary and outlook
Increasing UK commercial and domestic 
construction activity has driven growth in 
the UK trade and specification markets and 
we continue to grow strongly in this sector. 
The UK retail sector has been very mixed but 
improving trends in consumer confidence 
and forecast growth in RMI expenditure are 
both encouraging. Notwithstanding the 
short term challenges, the medium-term 
outlook in South Africa remains positive 
and the strong revenue and self–help 
momentum in our South African businesses 
should ensure we will make further progress 
in this year. With our strong brands, leading 
market positions, continued new product 
investment and self-help initiatives focused 
on market share gain, the Board remains 
confident that the Group should continue 
to make further progress for the year 
to 31 March 2016.

CASE STUDY
STANTON MANOR  
CARE HOME
The Challenge
Stanton Manor Care Home in Derbyshire needed to find 
an all inclusive showering solution for their new downstairs 
bathroom that would suit the majority of their residents 
and yet allow Stanton Manor to future proof their 
personal care facilities. 
Stanton Manor is a beautiful 20th century building 
so it was also important to the owners that the new 
extension was also stylish and homely.
The Solution
When Stanton Manor contacted Triton with their 
requirements for their new downstairs bathroom, it was 
clear the Safeguard+ was the perfect fit for them. Mindful 
of the ever-changing needs of care home residents who 
need every possible safety assurance without compromising 
the appearance of their bathroom, the inclusive design 
of the Safeguard+ was ideal. For additional assurance 
and functionality, we also recommend that we fitted the 
Safeguard+ with the Grab Riser Kit which provides a grab 
bar in the showering area tested up to 150kg if accidently 
or intentionally grabbed.
The Result
Priya Soni, director at Stanton Manor Care Home, 
commented: “Since installing the new shower, we’ve been 
able to offer all our residents safer showering than before, 
which is thanks to the variety of features offered by the 
product. We have a responsibility to ensure the products 
we use comply with quality and safety standards while 
being easy to use for residents and staff and the 
Safeguard+ certainly ticks all the boxes.”
Features such as the Grab Riser kit and automatic setting 
of the duration of shower have already increased the 
independence of the residents, which in turn is better 
for their own personal well-being. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

01 02 03
OUR STRATEGIC TARGETS:
About our strategy
The Board believes the implementation of this strategy will enhance shareholder value.
Organic growth will continue to be driven by capitalising on our leading market positions in the UK and South Africa. Our strategic 
initiatives will ensure we maintain the provision of innovative new product programmes, excellent customer service and investment 
in our brand portfolio. We will also reinforce our “designed and built in Britain” credentials as well as capture the growth opportunities 
in South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, where medium-term growth rates are likely to be higher than the more developed 
markets. We will continue to drive faster revenue growth in our existing export markets and develop new emerging export opportunities.
Acquisitions will be targeted at complementary market and industry segments exhibiting attractive returns on capital which are likely 
to be bathroom and kitchen products with exposure to commercial and specification segments. The acquisition of Vado in 2013 
represented a first step in this approach.

Business review
Continued good progress in Triton Showers and Vado 
and a particularly strong performance in Norcros Adhesives 
were partly offset by lower revenue in Johnson Tiles.
In the UK, revenue increased in the year by 
0.7% to £149.1m (2014: £148.0m). Continued 
good progress in Triton Showers and Vado 
and a particularly strong performance in 
Norcros Adhesives were partly offset by 
lower revenue in Johnson Tiles. Underlying 
operating profit was lower at £13.8m 
(2014: £14.2m) with margins also slightly 
lower at 9.2% (2014: 9.6%). This performance 
reflects the mixed market conditions which 
have prevailed, with gains in trade and 
specification markets offset by more 
challenging retail and export environments.
Triton Showers
Triton Showers, our market leading UK 
domestic shower business, grew revenue 
by 0.4% to £52.1m (2014: £51.9m). The 
UK shower market remained challenging 
during the last year, although Triton’s 
main export market, Ireland, showed 
good growth. 
UK revenue was 2.1% lower than the prior 
year. Despite some good progress in 
specification sales, trade sector revenue 
was 4.7% lower than prior year, driven by 
specific destocking in a small number of 
key accounts. Retail sector revenue was 
in line with last year, which given the 
contraction in the retail market in the year 
was testament to Triton’s leading position, 
the strength of its consumer franchise 
and its reputation for quality, service 
and innovation.
Triton’s new Safeguard+ range of thermostatic 
electric showers, which have been designed 
principally for the care market, have been 
very well received during the year and are 
the subject of case study on page 6.
Export revenue, which represents 
approximately 15% of overall revenue, 
was 17.3% higher compared to prior year. 
Triton’s primary export market is Ireland 
and our strong performance here reflects 
the recovery in the Irish economy which 
is beginning to drive increased activity in both 
the domestic and commercial construction 
sectors. Increased revenue investment in 
the year has been focused on developing 
a range of electric showers that operate in 
a low pressure, high ambient temperature 
environment. Testing is progressing well, 
and when completed, the products will 
allow us to realise opportunities in new 
export markets in the coming year.
Triton has again delivered a strong 
underlying operating profit performance 
as well as excellent cash conversion.
After 23 years in the business, Lorna Fellowes 
will step down from her role as Managing 
Director of Triton on 30 June 2015. Lorna 
will take up a Group role with particular focus 
on business development and acquisitions. 
David Tutton, Business Development Director 
at Triton for the last twelve months, will 
become Managing Director, and his 
experience in this role will ensure that the 
success of Triton achieved during Lorna’s 
tenure will continue.
Vado
Vado, our leading manufacturer of taps, 
mixer showers, bathroom accessories and 
valves recorded revenue of £30.5m for the 
period (2014: £29.1m), 4.7% higher than 
prior year. During the year Vado continued 
its successful penetration of the UK market 
although challenging conditions in its major 
export markets resulted in revenue lower 
than the prior year.
UK revenue was 19.8% higher than the prior 
year with strong performances in both the 
retail and trade sectors. UK retail revenue 
was 20.9% higher, as a result of the continuing 
success of the Vado Partnership Programme 
and growth with national buying groups. 
During the year Vado has not only increased 
revenue through established relationships 
with existing customers, but also achieved 
preferred supplier status with new buying 
groups. UK trade sales also grew 
considerably by 18.5% against the prior 
year, similarly through growth via its 
existing customer base and also winning 
new accounts, such as Avant Homes 
and Lovell.
Performance in our export markets was 
disappointing with a 15.8% reduction in 
revenues against the previous year. This 
predominantly reflected key customer 
destocking in the early part of the year 
together with a number of construction 
projects being delayed in the Middle East. 
However, additional sales resource has 
been deployed in this area and new 
channels have been opened in India, 
South America and the Far East which we 
expect to benefit from in the coming year.
During the year, a new ERP system was 
successfully implemented in order to provide 
the business with a strong platform to support 
its continued growth. The new system is 
already yielding operational improvements 
and enhanced business information.
In addition, we continue to make solid 
progress with a number of Group wide 
synergy initiatives. These include the launch 
of the first range of Vado electric showers 
into the specialist bathroom boutique 
channel which has already has gained good 
momentum and a joint project with Tile 
Africa, our leading specialist retailer in 
South Africa, where we have recently 
introduced a new own label range of 
brassware sourced from Vado’s specialist 
supply base. In the coming year, we plan to 
launch a range of high end Vado branded 
brassware to complement our existing offer.
Underlying operating profit was in line 
with expectations and ahead of last year 
with good cash generation.  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Business review continued
During the year, the business was very proud to be involved in the 
supply of ceramic poppies for the “Blood Swept Lands and Seas 
of Red” art and charity fund raising installation at the Tower 
of London to commemorate the beginning of World War I.
Johnson Tiles
Johnson Tiles, the UK market leading ceramic 
tile manufacturer and a market leader in 
the supply of both own manufactured and 
imported tiles, saw revenue decrease by 
3.2% to £59.7m (2014: £61.7m). 
UK revenue was 2.8% lower overall, 
although there were marked differences in 
sector performance with a 9.6% increase in 
trade revenue offset by an 11.9% reduction 
in retail revenue. 
The trade sector has grown in the year as a 
result of increased construction activity and 
additional specification business, the latter 
aided by a reconfiguration of our product 
range in the year and the introduction of 
new “on trend” colours. During the year, 
the business was very proud to be involved 
in the supply of ceramic poppies for the 
“Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red” art 
and charity fund-raising installation at the 
Tower of London to commemorate the 
beginning of World War I. A bespoke hand 
crafted manufacturing cell was created for 
this project in the space of three weeks, 
and the success of this project is testament to 
the skills and commitment of our workforce. 
The disappointing retail performance 
mainly reflects range reviews at a number 
of our key customers which resulted in the 
number of stocked lines being reduced. 
We have however made good progress 
at other accounts such as Topps Tiles, 
introducing the Minton Hollins range during 
the year which has been well received.
Export revenue, which represents 
approximately 13% of overall revenue, 
returned to growth in the second half 
of the year albeit was 5.5% lower for the 
full year overall. The year’s performance 
reflected both lower revenue in the 
Middle East and the fact that the prior year 
included the benefit of a number of large 
commercial specifications such as the 
Waikiki Beach Hilton Hotel mural. The 
second half performance also benefited 
from the restructuring of our Middle East 
sales operation and the closure of our 
US warehouse.
Manufacturing process improvements 
which reduced wastage over the past two 
years eventually necessitated a change 
to our body recipe to reduce the amount 
of recycled waste ceramic material used. 
This change in recipe was implemented in 
July, but despite significant off line testing, 
it resulted in significant disruption and a 
reduction in production output in the year. 
Manufacturing performance improved and 
returned to normal levels of efficiency 
in the last two months of the year which 
has been maintained in this financial year. 
This, coupled with the challenging retail 
conditions, resulted in a small operating 
loss being recorded in the year.
Norcros Adhesives
Norcros Adhesives, our UK manufacturer 
and supplier of tile and stone adhesives and 
ancillary products, achieved another year 
of very strong momentum gaining market 
share as revenue increased by 28.4% 
to £6.8m (2014: £5.3m). 
The increase in share reflects further 
penetration into the DIY multiples channel 
and increased sales resource targeted at 
the specification sector. Tailored sales, 
marketing and promotional initiatives 
targeted at each segment and our multi 
brand strategy supported by our technical 
advice and excellent customer service have 
proved highly successful. 
Investment in new product development 
remains central to the business and has 
continued with the launch of a range of 
new adhesives and colour matched silicone 
which has received a good initial response 
from the market. These products will further 
support our position in the specification 
market. The reinforced polymer technology 
used in these products is new to the market 
and provides a degree of differentiation.
To support the growth of the business 
we have also invested in both new plant 
and human resources with improvements 
in our operational efficiency.
Another year of strong revenue growth 
and improved operational efficiencies has 
resulted in underlying operating profits 
higher than last year. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

CASE STUDY
POPPIES BLOOM AT 
TOWER OF LONDON 
Strategic report
The Challenge
The Tunstall-based company Johnson Tiles was 
approached by project artist Paul Cummins to help meet 
the target of creating 888,246 poppies to fill the moat 
at the Tower of London, with each ceramic flower representing 
a person who died in the war.
The Solution
Johnson Tiles recruited a team of specialist ceramic artists, 
who worked at the factory over the spring/summer, 
individually making and decorating every poppy by hand. 
Around 8,000 poppies a day were made by the team at the 
factory in Tunstall, Stoke-on-Trent, for Cummins’ Blood 
Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation, in a labour intensive 
process involving a very traditional, skilled method of making. 
The manufacture of each poppy began with processing clay 
to produce slabs. Flower templates were then cut from the 
slabs, with the two layers formed into the poppy shape. 
Each poppy was dried for a minimum of six hours in a cabinet 
dryer, which reduced the moisture content enough to fire 
them in the kiln. The poppies were “biscuit fired” and then 
hand-dipped and re-fired to high temperature before being 
dispatched to Cummins’ studio in Derby, where they were 
hand-finished and sent to the Tower of London. The moat 
installation, which was officially unveiled by the Duke and 
Duchess of Cambridge in the summer, was filled up as the 
flowers were made, with volunteers planting each one. 
The final poppy was “planted” on Armistice Day to mark 
the end of the conflict.
The Result
After receiving an estimated five million visitors since the 
Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation was officially 
unveiled, more than 11,000 volunteers then embarked on the 
task of dismantling the 888,246 poppies, which are thought 
to have raised in excess of £1.2m for each of the six service 
charities involved. Harry Foster, Specialist Products Manager 
at Johnson Tiles, said: “Standing in the moat on the morning 
of the 11th whilst the last roll of honour was being read out, 
the magnitude of what had been achieved began to set in, 
along with the emotion and a realisation of the sheer scale 
of the loss, it had admittedly become impossible to hold back 
the tears. The nod of acknowledgement from a similarly tearful 
Paul Cummins confirmed that it was mission accomplished, 
and that we could now rest easy in the knowledge that we 
had succeeded in our efforts to deliver a fitting tribute 
to the sacrifice made during the conflict.” Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Our South African business recorded 
another year of double digit growth with 
revenue 15.1% higher on a constant currency 
basis. The average exchange rate for Sterling to 
Rand for the year was 11.6% weaker at ZAR17.82 
(2014: ZAR15.97), resulting in full year reported 
revenue of £73.0m (2014: £70.7m), which 
was 3.2% higher than prior year. Underlying 
operating profit for the year improved 
substantially to £3.2m (2014: £1.9m) despite 
the weaker Rand adversely impacting Sterling 
reported profits by approximately £0.3m.
Johnson Tiles South Africa
Johnson Tiles South Africa continued 
to build on the excellent progress of 
the last few years and achieved a break 
even operating result in line with our 
expectations notwithstanding the disruption 
from the legal strike action earlier in the 
year and the recent national electricity 
load-shedding programme. As a result of 
the ongoing likelihood of further electricity 
stoppages we have invested in a standby 
diesel generator which will be installed 
in quarter two of this year.
Independent sector revenue grew 9.5% 
in the year on a constant currency basis 
albeit on a reported basis was 2.5% lower 
at £10.3m (2014: £10.6m). The improvement 
in performance reflects the second phase 
of our turnaround plan which is focused 
on enhancing our product offer. After the 
successful installation of our second inkjet 
printer our new product programme has 
delivered a number of exciting new ranges 
of inkjet printed product that have been 
well received in the market. 
Given the significant improvements made 
in our manufacturing operations over the 
last few years and more recently from the 
market reaction to our improving product 
offer we remain confident of making 
further progress in this financial year. 
TAL
TAL, our market leading adhesives business 
in South Africa, delivered another strong 
performance with constant currency 
revenue growth of 11.7% compared to prior 
year or 0.3% growth on a reported basis to 
£17.2m (2014: £17.1m). This strong revenue 
growth reflected both market share gain 
in the domestic market as well as strong 
growth in exports to sub-Saharan Africa 
with export revenue 19.1% higher than 
prior year.
Significant investment in plant and equipment, 
particularly new mixers and packing heads 
at our main Olifantsfontein plant was 
instrumental in driving improvements in 
plant efficiency during the year. This was 
supplemented by investment in a new 
grout packaging line which delivered both 
manufacturing and revenue benefits.
Underlying operating profit for the year 
was ahead of last year driving good cash 
conversion in the business. 
Tile Africa
Tile Africa, our leading retailer of wall and 
floor tiles, adhesives, showers, sanitaryware 
and bathroom fittings, grew revenue by 17.8% 
on a constant currency basis and 5.7% on a 
reported basis to £45.5m (2014: £43.0m). 
In particular, store-based retail revenue grew 
by 26.9% on a like-for-like basis as a result of 
an improved in-stock position and our store 
upgrade programme.
This year we have focused our efforts 
on improving performance in our existing 
store portfolio. We launched our new CX 
store format which has been developed 
to step up our overall retail customer 
experience as well as to include our first 
bathroom store-within-a-store concept. 
Our Garsfontein and Alberton stores have 
been upgraded to this format with the initial 
results exceeding our expectations and 
more detail can be found in the case study 
on page 5. 
During the second half of the year, we acquired 
our strategically located franchise store in 
Port Elizabeth for a total consideration of 
£0.3m, and two unprofitable stores were 
closed. Due to delays in planning permission, 
no new stores were opened in the year, but 
we expect to open new stores in Boksburg 
and Southgate within the next twelve months. 
Tile Africa currently has 29 owned stores 
and four franchises.
Underlying profit showed good progress 
and was ahead of last year.
Business review continued
Underlying operating profit for the year improved substantially to

Revenue
Group revenue at £222.1m (2014: £218.7m) 
increased by 1.5% on a reported basis 
and 5.0% on a constant currency basis.
Underlying operating profit
Underlying operating profit increased by 5.8% 
to £17.0m (2014: £16.1m). Our UK businesses 
delivered underlying operating profit of 
£13.8m (2014: £14.2m), and our South African 
businesses generated an underlying operating 
profit of £3.2m (2014: £1.9m). On a constant 
currency basis the improvement in underlying 
operating profit in South African businesses 
was £1.6m. Group underlying operating 
profit margins improved to 7.6% (2014: 7.3%).
IAS 19R administrative costs
These costs represent the costs incurred by 
the Trustee of administering the UK pension 
schemes and are reflected in the income 
statement following the implementation 
of IAS 19R in the previous year. Costs have 
risen to £1.7m (2014: £1.4m) largely as a 
result of an increase in the levy charged 
by the Pension Protection Fund.
Acquisition related costs
As described more fully in the Audit 
Committee report on page 37 and in 
note 29 to the Group accounts, we have 
reclassified certain costs related to business 
combination activities in line with emerging 
market practice. Costs of £2.2m (2014: £0.7m) 
have been recognised in the year and have 
increased principally due to a £0.8m higher 
deferred remuneration charge related to 
Vado and £0.8m (2014: £nil) incremental 
staff costs and external advisory fees. A full 
breakdown is provided in note 5 to the 
Group accounts. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Strategic report
Exceptional operating items
A net exceptional operating charge of £2.5m (2014: £1.2m) was recorded as shown in the

facility completed in July 2014. Also as 
a result of entering a new banking facility, 
the remaining unamortised costs of raising 
debt finance related to the old facility 
were written off which led to an exceptional 
charge of £0.4m being recognised.
The Group has recognised a £1.1m interest 
cost in respect of the pension scheme 
liability (2014: £1.3m) which decreased 
by £0.2m principally due to the lower 
opening liability.
Taxation
The tax charge for the year was £2.9m 
(2014: credit of £4.3m). In the previous 
year the remaining unrecognised deferred 
tax assets in relation to both the UK and 
South African businesses of £4.4m were 
recognised in respect of tax losses and 
capital allowances, and consequently 
the current years charge represents 
a more normalised tax charge.
The effective tax rate for the year was 
26.6% which was broadly in line with 
expectations, and is higher than the 
standard rate of tax in the UK because of 
the geographic mix of profits and because 
certain expenses, such as amortisation, are 
generally not allowable for tax purposes. 
The standard rate of UK corporation tax 
reduced to 21% from 1 April 2014 has 
reduced further to 20% from 1 April 2015. 
In South Africa the standard rate of tax 
is 28%, unchanged from 2014.
A small parcel of land in Braintree was sold 
in the year generating a profit of £0.4m. 
In the previous year a surplus facility in 
South Africa was sold at a profit of £0.5m.
The Group acquired the freehold and exited 
its onerous lease in connection with a 
property at Orgreave Drive, Sheffield in 
November 2014, leading to a charge of £2.5m. 
This property, together with other surplus 
properties in Tunstall and Boston, were sold 
to Clowes Developments (UK) Ltd for cash 
consideration of £6.5m in March 2015 
which led to a loss on disposal of £1.5m.
Legal costs of £0.3m (2014: £0.2m) related 
to the contractual dispute with Morrisons 
regarding the disposal of part of the surplus 
land in Tunstall. This dispute has subsequently 
been settled in May 2015.
During the year we successfully implemented 
a number of liability management initiatives 
in connection with the Group’s UK defined 
benefit pension scheme. These exercises 
led to a settlement gain of £1.7m which 
is more fully described in note 23 to the 
Group accounts.
Restructuring costs relate principally 
to redundancies and asset write-downs 
at the Group’s businesses and was much 
higher in 2014 due to the actions taken by 
management to restructure the Johnson 
Tiles business early in that year.
Operating profit for the year was £10.6m 
(2014: £12.8m).
Net finance income/(costs) 
and exceptional finance costs
Net finance income/(costs) decreased by 
£7.8m to income of £0.8m (2014: £7.0m 
cost), although £7.0m of this increase 
related to the movement on fair value of 
foreign exchange contracts. Bank interest 
payable of £1.2m (2014: £1.5m) was lower 
than last year and reflects the decrease in 
average net debt and the lower interest 
margins agreed as part of the new banking  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Underlying diluted earnings per share 
amounted to 2.1p (2014: 2.8p). Excluding 
the effect of deferred tax assets recognised 
in 2014, underlying diluted earnings per share 
for that year would have been 2.1p. Basic 
earnings per share were 1.4p (2014: 1.5p). 
Dividends
As previously announced it is the Board’s 
intention to continue a progressive yet 
prudent dividend policy subject to the Group’s 
earnings, cash flow and balance sheet 
position. As such the Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 0.375p (2014: 0.34p) per 
share, which, if approved, together with the 
interim dividend of 0.185p (2014: 0.17p), 
makes a total dividend of 0.56p (2014: 0.51p) 
in respect of the year ended 31 March 2015.
This final dividend, if approved at the 
Annual General Meeting, will be payable on 
29 July 2015 to shareholders on the register 
on 26 June 2015. The shares will be quoted 
ex-dividend on 25 June 2015.
The Group reported profit before tax 
of £11.0m (2014: £5.8m).
Profit/(loss) from discontinued operations
On 30 May 2014, the Company completed 
a transaction to dispose of 100% of the 
issued share capital of Norcros Industry 
(Pty) Limited (NIPL), which owned its 
Australian tiles business, to Kim Hin 
Industries Berhad (KHIB).
A loss of £1.6m relating to this sale was 
recognised in the year to 31 March 2014, 
which, together with the results of the year 
for NIPL of £0.2m, was disclosed within 
profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued 
operations. Following the completion of 
the transaction, the actual loss on disposal 
was £1.5m meaning that a small profit of 
£0.1m has been recognised in the year to 
31 March 2015. Further details are provided 
in note 28 to the financial statements.
Restatement of prior year results
As described more fully in the Audit 
Committee report on page 37 and in 
note 29 to the Group accounts, we have 
reclassified certain costs related to business 
combination activities in line with emerging 
market practice. In order to effect fair 
comparison, the results for the year ended 
31 March 2014 have been restated to 
conform to this style of presentation. The 
restatement has no impact on operating 
profit or cash flows. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Balance sheet
The Group’s balance sheet is summarised below.
2015 2014
£m £m
Property, plant, equipment and investment properties 37.6 41.3
Goodwill and intangible assets 26.9 27.1
Deferred tax 13.8 11.6
Net current assets excluding cash, borrowings 
and assets held-for-sale 37.6 36.7
Pension scheme liability (44.3) (21.8)
Other non-current assets and liabilities (4.7) (6.3)
Cash and borrowings (14.2) (27.4)
Net assets before assets held-for-sale 52.7 61.2
Assets held-for-sale — 4.3
Net assets 52.7 65.5
The Group’s contributions to its defined 
contribution pension schemes were £2.6m 
(2014: £2.2m). The main reason for the 
increase is due to the implementation 
of salary exchange scheme for all UK 
employees with effect from 1 April 2014. 
This scheme has had no overall impact 
on UK employment costs as the scheme 
operates by employees electing to 
exchange a proportion of their salary 
for an employer pension contribution.
Cash flow and net debt
Net debt decreased by £12.7m in the year 
to £14.2m (2014: £26.9m). A summary of the 
movement in net debt is shown overleaf.
Underlying operating cash flow was £2.6m 
higher than in the previous year at £22.9m, 
as a result of higher operating profits and 
strong management of working capital. This 
represents excellent cash conversion, being 
99.6% of underlying EBITDA (2014: 92.3%). 
The Group’s working capital outflow was 
£1.5m (2014: £2.6m), principally reflecting 
investment in inventory to improve 
the in-stock position of products 
in Tile Africa stores.
Net cash generated from operating activities 
was £4.1m higher than the previous year at 
£14.4m, largely due to improved underlying 
operating cash flow, lower tax and interest 
payments and lower outflows in respect 
of exceptional items.
The £0.9m purchase of investment property 
relates to the freehold purchase of the 
property at Orgreave Drive, Sheffield. This 
was subsequently sold together with the 
remaining surplus investment properties in 
Tunstall and Boston resulting in net proceeds 
of £6.1m. A small parcel of land in Braintree 
was also sold in the first half of the year 
for £0.4m.
Property, plant, equipment and investment 
properties fell by £3.7m, which was chiefly 
due to the sale of the surplus investment 
property portfolio. Additions in the year 
were £6.9m (2014: £4.3m).
Deferred tax increased principally as a result 
of the full recognition of the increase in the 
pension scheme liability.
Pension schemes
The Group contributed £2.1m (2014: £2.1m) 
into its UK defined benefit pension scheme 
during the year. This included deficit recovery 
contributions of £2.1m (2014: £2.0m) as part 
of the 2012 deficit recovery plan.
The gross defined benefit pension scheme 
valuation on the UK scheme showed a 
deficit of £44.3m compared to a deficit of 
£21.8m last year. The increase in the deficit 
reflects an increase in the present value of 
scheme liabilities due to a lower discount 
rate of 3.30% (2014: 4.30%) net of a higher 
than expected return on scheme assets 
driven by rising equity markets.
The Plan has undertaken a number of 
liability management exercises during the 
year which have resulted in a number of 
benefits being settled and some changes 
to pension increases in payment. The net 
impact of these exercises was to reduce 
the net deficit by £1.7m which has been 
reflected in the Consolidated Income 
Statement as an exceptional operating 
item as follows:

Group Finance Director’s report continued
The new banking facility has been secured to July 2019, 
and at current levels of net debt and leverage, is expected 
to reduce interest costs by approximately £0.2m per annum.
Acquisitions and disposals principally 
comprises a £3.8m inflow resulting from 
the sale of the Australian tiles business in 
May, net of £0.3m deferred consideration 
paid to the former shareholders of Vado 
and the £0.2m cost of acquiring the Port 
Elizabeth franchise store in South Africa.
Capital expenditure at £7.0m (2014: £4.2m) 
included a second inkjet printer at Johnson 
Tiles South Africa, Tile Africa store upgrades 
and improvements to mixers and packing 
heads at TAL. In the UK, there was a new 
selection line at Johnson Tiles, a new 
filling machine at Norcros Adhesives, 
a replacement ERP system at Vado and 
continued investment in tooling for new 
product in Triton Showers.
Bank funding
In July 2014 the Group agreed a new 
unsecured £70m revolving credit facility plus 
a £30m accordion facility with Lloyds Bank 
plc, Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. 
The new banking facility has been secured 
to July 2019, and at current levels of net 
debt and leverage is expected to reduce 
interest costs by approximately £0.2m 
per annum. As a consequence, non-cash 
financing costs of £0.4m relating to the 
old facility were expensed to the income 
statement as exceptional finance costs. 
A cash outflow of £0.7m was incurred 
in the period in relation to the costs 
of the new facility.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Norcros has a system of risk management 
which seeks to mitigate risks as far as possible.
There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties which could have 
a material impact on the Group’s performance. The key risks to which the 
Group is exposed, together with the potential effects and mitigating actions 
taken pertaining to them, are noted below. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Strategic report
RISK AND DESCRIPTION POTENTIAL EFFECTS MITIGATING ACTIONS CHANGE
Key commercial relationships 
Whilst the Group has a diverse range 
of customers there are nevertheless 
certain key customers who account 
for high levels of revenue. 
Many of the contractual arrangements 
with customers are short term in 
nature (as is common in our markets) 
and there exists some risk that the 
current performance of a business 
may not be maintained if such 
contracts were not renewed or 
extended, or were maintained at 
lower volumes due to a decline 
in economic activity.
The importance of relationships with key customers 
is recognised and managed by senior personnel within 
the Group who have direct and regular access to their 
counterparts at the highest levels of management.
Rebate schemes and incentive programmes help maintain 
these key relationships in a competitive market situation.
The Group stresses key selling points such as continuity of 
supply, financial strength of the Group and level of customer 
service to help maintain relationships. As well as an excellent 
product offering, the Group is also able to take care of 
customers’ sourcing, storage and logistics requirements.
The existence of a flexible cost base helps alleviate 
this potential risk in certain of the Group’s businesses.
None
Accounting for customer 
rebates and other trade 
promotional spend
The Group operates rebate and 
incentive agreements for a number 
of selected customers.
Incorrectly accounting for 
rebate and incentive arrangements 
could result in the Group’s turnover 
and operating profits being 
materially misstated. 
The Group’s businesses prepared detailed management 
information and forecasts on a monthly basis, including 
revenue and margins by customer and analyses of rebate 
provisions. These are monitored by divisional and Group 
management with any variances investigated.
All significant rebate and incentive agreements are approved 
by Group management prior to agreements with customers 
being entered into.
New in 
year
Competition
The Group operates within a highly 
competitive environment in all 
its markets.
The Group accepts there is a 
risk to its results and financial 
condition caused by the actions 
of its competitors, including 
competitors’ marketing strategies 
and product development. 
To help identify such risks the competitive environment, 
specific marketplace and the actions of particular competitors 
are discussed at both Group and operating divisional board 
meetings. In addition each market is carefully monitored 
to identify any significant shift in policy by any competitor.
None
Reliance on 
production facilities
The Group has a small number 
of automated manufacturing 
facilities for the manufacture 
of tiles and adhesives. 
If any of these facilities (including 
technology used to operate them) 
were to fail, the effect on the Group 
could be significant. 
The Group has a well established ongoing preventative 
maintenance programme as well as a comprehensive “annual 
shutdown” programme throughout its manufacturing operations. 
Furthermore the Group has developed an experienced globally 
co-ordinated product sourcing function which could mitigate 
the risk of failure. 
Finished inventory holdings across the operations acts 
as a limited buffer in the event of operational failure. 
A business interruption insurance policy is maintained 
to mitigate losses caused by a serious event affecting 
manufacturing capability.

RISK AND DESCRIPTION POTENTIAL EFFECTS MITIGATING ACTIONS CHANGE
Staff retention and recruitment
The Group employs around 1,750 
people worldwide. 
The Group’s ability to grow and 
increase its market share depends 
significantly on its continuing ability 
to recruit and retain highly skilled 
employees in each area of its activities. 
Future growth plans may be restricted 
or delayed by difficulties experienced 
in recruiting and retaining 
appropriate staff.
Group policy is to remunerate its personnel in line with market 
rates and practice. In addition to competitive salaries there are 
annual bonus schemes, share options and other benefits offered.
Executives and key management are incentivised via an 
Approved Performance Share Plan (APSP) which was approved 
at the 2011 AGM. A grant of options under the APSP has taken 
place annually since 2011. 
Succession planning is an agenda item at Group Board level.
The Group is able to offer employees appropriate training and 
opportunities for advancement and has a demonstrable track 
record of internal promotion.
None
Foreign currency exchange risk
A significant amount of the Group’s 
business is conducted in currencies 
other than Sterling (primarily South 
African Rand, US Dollar and Euro). 
The continued economic uncertainty 
in Europe has raised the possibility 
of a breakup of the Euro.
The Group’s financial performance is 
subject to the effects of fluctuations 
in foreign exchange rates.
The Group typically seeks to hedge its foreign exchange 
transactional flows for up to twelve months forward. 
The Group may, where it is considered appropriate, 
denominate some of its borrowings in other currencies to 
hedge translational profit and asset risk although this is not 
considered necessary at present given the level of earnings 
made by its overseas businesses at present compared 
to the Group as a whole.
Increased
Interest rate risk
The Group pays interest and other 
facility fees based on local base rates 
and LIBOR rates.
A significant increase in interest rates 
would affect the Group’s profitability 
and cash flow.
Given the current low interest rates negotiated as part of 
the refinancing of bank debts in 2014, it is not considered 
advantageous to enter into hedging arrangements for the 
time being. The Group’s interest rate risk is reviewed regularly 
by Executive Management and at least annually as part 
of the Group budget process. 
None
Pension scheme management
The UK companies in the Group 
participate in a defined benefit 
pension scheme. Corporate bond 
and gilt yields have reduced 
significantly over the past year.
The Group’s financial results show 
an aggregate deficit in this scheme, 
as at 31 March 2015 of £44.3m 
(2014: £21.8m) assessed in 
accordance with IAS 19 (revised). 
There are various risks that could 
adversely affect the funding of the 
defined benefits under the scheme 
and consequently the Group’s 
funding obligations. 
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual 
with effect from 1 April 2013 and replaced by an auto-enrolment 
compliant defined contribution scheme. Risks from rising 
costs of providing a final salary pension scheme have therefore 
been materially reduced.
Executive Management regularly monitors the funding position 
of the scheme and is represented on both the Trustee’s board 
and its investment sub-committee to monitor and assess 
investment performance and other risks to the Group.
The Group considers each actuarial valuation (annual IAS 19R 
valuation and each triennial valuation) to re-assess its position 
with regard to its pension commitments in conjunction with 
external actuarial advice.
A number of liability management exercises were undertaken 
in the year resulting in a net £1.7m reduction in the deficit.
Increased
Energy price risk
Energy costs are a significant 
proportion of the Group’s 
manufacturing costs, especially 
in its tile manufacturing businesses.
Sustained increases in energy 
costs could significantly affect 
the Group’s profitability.
Prices are monitored on a regular basis and, where believed 
to be appropriate, a proportion of energy costs are hedged.
Energy costs tend to increase worldwide at similar rates; 
therefore competitors will generally face the same pressures 
of any sustained increase.

RISK AND DESCRIPTION POTENTIAL EFFECTS MITIGATING ACTIONS CHANGE
Additional capital requirements 
to fund ongoing operations
The Group must ensure it has 
adequate funding to meet capital 
demands within its current 
available facilities.
The Group’s current and forecast performance against its banking 
facilities in monitored regularly by the Executive Directors. This has 
historically shown there are ample facilities available to meet the 
current and future needs of the existing Group. 
The Group refinanced its facilities in 2014 on improved terms and 
agreed an accordion option of £30m in addition to the committed 
facility of £70m. This facility remains in place until July 2019. 
Reduced
Performance against 
banking covenants
The Group is subject to key banking 
covenants including interest cover 
and debt cover.
Failure to meet these covenants could 
result in the Group being in default 
of its banking facilities.
Performance against banking covenants is regularly and 
closely monitored and is a key element of the forecasting 
and budgeting process.
None
Many of the products the Group 
sells are subject to changing 
consumer preferences 
The Group’s revenues and profits 
can be sensitive to these changing 
preferences. Failure to anticipate, 
identify or react swiftly to changes 
in consumer preferences could result 
in lower sales, higher mark-downs 
to reduce excess inventories and 
lower profits. Conversely, failure 
to anticipate increased consumer 
demand for its products may lead 
to inventory shortages, negatively 
impacting customer goodwill, brand 
image and profitability.
The Group invests significantly in sales and marketing 
including design, new product development and market 
research. All these are discussed at each operating divisional 
board meeting and are regular agenda items. Each divisional 
board has appropriate sales and marketing representation. 
This ensures the Group is aware of changes in the marketplace 
and can adapt resources accordingly.
None
South African operations 
Approximately one third of the 
Group’s activities are conducted 
in South Africa.
The Group may be exposed to 
risks outside of its control including 
political, social and economic instability, 
industrial action, reliability of energy 
supply, unexpected changes in the 
regulatory environment, exposure to 
different legal standards or employment 
relations and potentially adverse 
tax consequences. 
In addition, the geographical spread 
of the Group’s operations means 
management co-ordination of effort 
and communications with employees 
are subject to certain challenges.
The Group Executives and Head Office finance staff are 
in regular contact with their South African counterparts via 
electronic communication. In addition Group Executives make 
regular visits to the Group’s SA operations and specific internal 
audit visits are made annually.
In response to the recent electricity load-shedding programme 
in South Africa, the Group has invested in a standby diesel 
generator which will be installed in quarter two of this year.
None
Acquisition risk
Part of the Group’s strategy is to grow 
through selective acquisitions.
Performance of acquired businesses 
may not reach expectations impacting 
Group profitability and cash flows. 
The Group employs senior managers who have considerable 
experience of identifying and appraising suitable opportunities.
The recent acquisition of Vado provides demonstrable 
evidence of the Group’s ability to integrate a new business 
and provides a template for future acquisitions.

The environment
The Board recognises the Group’s activities 
do have an impact on the environment. 
Norcros is committed to minimising 
this impact by continually improving 
its efficiency in terms of energy, water 
and material consumption. 
For example, the Group is particularly 
proud of the fact that Triton Showers has 
recently achieved “Zero to Landfill” status.
The Group aims to minimise its carbon 
footprint. Its greenhouse gas emissions 
are reported on in detail on page 58. 
In addition, we are cognisant of our 
obligations in the UK as regards the Energy 
Savings Opportunity Scheme initiative, and 
we will be compliant with this in the current 
financial year.
For further information on Norcros’ 
commitment to the environment and 
sustainability please visit the “Corporate 
Responsibility” section of www.norcros.com. 
Ethics
The Group aims to act with integrity 
towards all stakeholders in its businesses 
and respects the laws, regulations and 
customs in all the countries within which 
it operates. The Group makes every effort 
to ensure its employees are aware of, 
and comply with, the relevant business’ 
ethical code.
The Group has implemented an anti-bribery 
policy to comply with the Bribery Act 2010. 
Appropriate procedures are in place at each 
location to mitigate the risk of any employee 
committing an offence under this Act.
In order to ensure an open culture of 
legal and ethical compliance, all of the 
businesses in the Group have in place 
“whistleblowing” procedures, so that 
any concerns can be raised.
Social
Companies in the Group are encouraged 
to become involved in and support local 
initiatives where possible. 
Many examples of this commitment can be 
seen in Norcros South Africa, where in the 
2015 financial year the business continued 
its commitment to both initiate and support 
programmes which empower people by 
equipping them with vital skills. Starting 
with in-house training Norcros looked at 
empowering staff at all levels from basic 
literacy and numeracy to nationally accredited 
vocational skills to management and life 
skills. Moving out towards the community, 
the Norcros Tiling Academy took in 
unemployed people and taught them 
how to tile as well as the skills needed 
to set up a small business.
In addition, Norcros South Africa donated 
both money and product to a wide variety 
of charities focussing on empowerment, 
particularly in the fields of education and 
healthcare. One such charity is the South 
African Medical and Education Forum, 
which presented Norcros South Africa 
with a recognition award at their 2015 
Gala Awards Evening.
Another exciting initiative supported by 
Norcros South Africa was the Nedbank 
Sani2C mountain biking event. As a sponsor 
of this three day race through impoverished 
rural areas, Tile Africa donated tiles for the 
ablutions of the rest camps, and arranged 
training for local people to learn to tile 
during the installation of the tiles. These 
facilities will be available for use by the 
local communities between the annual 
race events. 
In the UK, of particular note this year has 
been Triton Showers’ new partnership with 
the “Dare2Dream” charity, which extends 
the business’s existing outreach into the 
community through its longstanding 
support of Warwickshire Young Carers.
Employees
The necessity for, and importance of, good 
relations with all employees is well recognised 
and accepted throughout the Group. However, 
because the Group’s activities are organised 
on a de-centralised basis, with each operating 
business having autonomy over its operations, 
there is no uniform set of arrangements for 
employee involvement imposed throughout 
the Group. Nevertheless, all businesses in 
Corporate responsibility and sustainability
The Board takes regular account of the significance of 
environmental, ethical and social factors affecting the Group 
and recognises that management of these matters is key 
to ensuring the long-term sustainability of its businesses. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Strategic report
the Group are strongly encouraged to devise 
and adopt whatever means of employee 
consultation best suits their circumstances.
Norcros also recognises the need to train 
its staff in order to give them the necessary 
skills to perform their duties to the high 
standards required. The Group’s businesses 
invest in a range of development activities; for 
example Vado’s Advanced Level Management 
Training Programme provides practical and 
business-focussed management training 
for a cross-section of the staff, to ensure 
the sustainable growth of the business. 
The Group is fully committed to keeping its 
employees informed about their work unit 
and the wider business.
The Group recognises its responsibilities 
towards disabled persons and therefore all 
applications from such persons are fully 
and fairly considered bearing in mind the 
respective aptitudes and abilities of the 
applicant. In the event of existing employees 
becoming disabled, every effort is made 
to ensure that their employment with the 
Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged. It is the policy of the 
Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, 
as far as possible, be identical to that of an 
able-bodied person.

Our people are key to our success as 
a business and we value the individuality 
and diversity that each employee brings.
At senior leadership levels 20% of employees 
are female.
Prior to any senior appointment the 
Nominations Committee ensures the 
best person for the role is appointed 
and in doing so gives due consideration 
to gender and diversity.
Human rights
The Directors do not consider human rights 
to be a material risk for the Group, principally 
due to the existing regulatory frameworks 
in place in the UK and South Africa, being 
the primary geographical locations 
in which we operate.
Whilst the Group does not have any 
policies which specifically address human 
rights at the present time, our values focus 
on respect, integrity and fairness, and 
consequently we welcome the debate 
on the role of business in promoting 
human rights. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Breakdown of Executive  
and Non-executive Directors
The Board is committed to ensuring that high standards of 
corporate governance are maintained by Norcros plc and is 
accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good corporate 
governance. Its policy is to manage the affairs of the Company in 
accordance with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code referred to in the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority. 
For the year under review, the Company has complied with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012 (the “Code”) in all 
respects. The following sections of this statement describe the 
Board’s approach to corporate governance and how the 
principles of the Code are applied.
Board balance and independence
The Board currently comprises a Non-executive Chairman, two 
Non-executive Directors and two Executive Directors, who are 
equally responsible for the proper stewardship and leadership of 
the Company. The Directors holding office at the date of this report 
and their biographical details are given on pages 30 and 31.
Taking into account the provisions of the Code, the Chairman and 
the two Non-executive Directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent of the Company’s Executive Management and 
free from any business or other relationship that could materially 
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment. 
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Chairman and 
the Non-executive Directors are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the Company. The letters of appointment 
set out the expected time commitment. Other significant 
commitments of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors are 
disclosed to the Board on a regular basis throughout the year. 
The Board is satisfied that the Chairman’s other significant 
commitments do not prevent him from devoting sufficient time 
to the Company.
David McKeith is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director. 
He is available to shareholders if they have reasons for concern 
which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Group 
Chief Executive or Group Finance Director have failed to resolve.
All Directors are supplied, in a timely manner, with all relevant 
documentation and financial information to assist them in 
the discharge of their duties by the making of well informed 
decisions that are in the best interests of the Company as a 
whole. The Board regularly reviews the management and 
financial performance of the Company, as well as long-term 
strategic planning and risk assessment. Regular reports are 
given to the Board on matters such as pensions, health 
and safety, and litigation.
Any concerns that a Director may have about how the Group 
is being run or about a course of action being proposed by 
the Board will, if they cannot be resolved once those concerns 
have been brought to the attention of the other Directors and 
the Chairman, be recorded in the Board minutes. In the event 
of the resignation of a Non-executive Director, that Director is 
encouraged to send a written statement setting out the reasons 
for the resignation to the Chairman who will then circulate it to 
the other members of the Board and the Company Secretary.

Corporate governance
Chairman and Group Chief Executive
The positions of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are held 
by separate individuals and the Board has clearly defined their 
responsibilities. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the 
effective working of the Board, ensuring that each Director, 
particularly the Non-executive Directors, is able to make an 
effective contribution. The Group Chief Executive has responsibility 
for running the Group’s businesses and for the implementation 
of the Board’s strategy, policies and decisions.
Board, Committee and Director evaluation
The performance of the Board is appraised by the Chairman. 
The Executive and Non-executive Directors are evaluated 
individually by the Chairman. The Board, led by the Senior 
Independent Non-executive Director, appraises the Chairman, 
and the Board evaluates the performance of its three Committees. 
Evaluation processes are conducted periodically and they are 
organised to fit in with Board priorities and succession planning 
activity. A formal evaluation took place in the year under review 
in accordance with the requirements of the Code. The Chairman 
is responsible for the review of each Director’s development 
and ongoing training requirements to ensure that the performance 
of each Director continues to be effective.
Advice for Directors
Procedures have been adopted for the Directors to obtain access 
through the Company Secretary to independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense, where that Director judges it 
necessary in order to discharge their responsibilities as a Director 
of the Company.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for ensuring 
that Board policies and procedures are complied with. Both the 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter 
reserved for decision by the Board.
Board procedures
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved 
to it for decision which it reviews periodically. This ensures the 
Board takes all major strategy, policy and investment decisions 
affecting the Company. In addition, it is responsible for business 
planning and risk management policies and the development 
of policies for areas such as safety, health and environmental 
policies, Directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration and 
ethical issues. The Board provides direction to the management 
of the Company, and it is ultimately accountable for the 
performance of the Group.
The Board operates in such a way as to ensure that all decisions 
are made by the most appropriate people in a timely manner that 
will not unnecessarily delay progress. The Board has formally 
delegated specific responsibilities to Board Committees, namely 
the Nominations Committee, Audit Committee and Remuneration 
Committee. The terms of reference of those Committees are 
published on the Company’s website at www.norcros.com. 
The report of the Nominations Committee is on page 40, 
the report of the Audit Committee is on page 36 and the 
report of the Remuneration Committee is on page 41.
The Board will also appoint committees to approve specific 
processes as deemed necessary.
The Directors and management teams of each Group company 
are responsible for those business entities. They are tasked with 
the delivery of targets approved by the Board on budgets, 
strategy and policy.
Directors’ roles
The Executive Directors work solely for the Group and none has 
taken on any non-executive directorship. However, in appropriate 
circumstances, Executive Directors will be encouraged to take 
on one non-executive directorship in another non-competing 
company or organisation.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the Non-executive 
Directors are available upon written request from the Company. 
All the Non-executive Directors confirm that they have sufficient 
time to meet the requirements of their role. They also confirm 
to disclose to the Company their other commitments and to give 
an indication of the time involved in each such commitment. 
The annual evaluation process includes an assessment of 
whether the Non-executive Director is spending enough time 
to fulfil his duties. If a Non-executive Director is offered an 
appointment elsewhere, the Chairman is informed before 
any such offer is accepted and the Chairman will subsequently 
inform the Board.
The Board has suitable procedures in place for ensuring that its 
powers to authorise conflict situations are operated effectively. 
Such powers are operated in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association by means of each Director having 
a responsibility to notify the Board of any conflict situation 
and for the Board to deal with that situation as appropriate.
The Board ensures that all new Directors (including Non-executive 
Directors) will receive a full, formal and tailored induction on 
joining the Company. As part of that induction procedure, the 
Chairman will offer to major shareholders the opportunity 
to meet a new Non-executive Director. The Chairman also 
periodically assesses the training and development needs of all 
Directors and ensures that any suitable training and updates 
are provided to Directors.
Retirement by rotation
Each of the Directors is subject to election by shareholders at the 
first Annual General Meeting after their appointment. Thereafter, 
in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, all of 
the Directors are subject to retirement by rotation such that one 
third of the Directors retire from the Board each year and each 
Director must seek re-election at intervals of no more than three 
years. However, the Board has decided that every Director should, 
where appropriate, offer themselves for re-election at each 
Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, each continuing Director 
will seek re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. Biographical 
details of all of the Directors are set out on pages 30 and 31 where 
there is also a statement on the Directors’ suitability for re-election. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Corporate governance continued
Financial reporting
When releasing the annual and interim financial statements the 
Directors aim to present a fair, balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group’s results and prospects. The Directors 
have a collective responsibility for the preparation of the Annual 
Report and Accounts which is more fully explained in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 60.

Relations with shareholders
The Company recognises the importance of maintaining good 
communications with shareholders. The Company takes a 
number of steps to ensure that the Board, and in particular, the 
Non-executive Directors, develops an understanding of the views 
of major shareholders about the Company. The Directors have 
regular meetings with the Company’s major shareholders and 
have regular feedback on the views of those shareholders 
through the Company’s brokers. Reports of these meetings, and 
any shareholder communications during the year, are given to 
the Board. In addition, the Company publishes any significant 
events affecting the Group and updates on current trading. 
The Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are also offered 
the opportunity to attend meetings with major shareholders 
and the Non-executive Directors, and in particular the Senior 
Independent Director, would attend such meetings if requested 
to do so by any major shareholder.
The Board regularly receives copies of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings.
The Annual and Interim Reports, together with all announcements 
issued to the London Stock Exchange, are published on the 
Company’s website at www.norcros.com.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the meeting. It is the Company’s 
practice to propose separate resolutions on each substantially 
separate issue.
For each resolution, proxy appointment forms should provide 
shareholders with the option to direct their proxy to vote either 
for or against the resolution or to withhold their vote. The 
Company ensures that all valid proxy appointments received for 
general meetings are properly recorded and counted. For each 
resolution the Company ensures that the following information is 
given at the meeting and made available as soon as reasonably 
practicable on a website which is maintained by or on behalf 
of the Company:
 — the date of the meeting;
 — the text of the resolution;
 — the number of votes validly cast;
 — the proportion of the Company’s issued share capital 
represented by those votes;
 — the number of votes cast in favour of the resolution; 
 — the number of votes against the resolution; and
 — the number of shares in respect of which the vote was withheld.
The Chairman seeks to arrange for the Chairmen of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nominations Committees (or deputies if any 
of them are unavoidably absent) to be available at the Annual 
General Meeting to answer those questions relating to the work 
of these Committees.
Accountability and audit 
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and auditor in 
connection with the financial statements are explained in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities on page 60 and the 
auditor’s report on page 65. The Directors ensure the independence 
of the auditor by requesting annual confirmation of independence 
which includes the disclosure of all non-audit fees.
Risk management and internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness (covering all material 
controls including financial, operational, risk management and 
compliance). This is undertaken via an annual programme to 
review the internal control environment at each business unit. 
Each review is carried out by senior finance staff independent of 
that business unit. The results of these reviews are communicated 
to the Audit Committee.
The Board has identified and evaluated what it considers to be 
the significant risks faced by the Group and has also assessed the 
adequacy of the actions taken to manage these risks. This has 
been disclosed on pages 24 to 27. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
35
Corporate governance
Risk management and internal control continued
The Group’s insurance continues to be managed and co-ordinated 
centrally with the assistance of insurance brokers. This gives the 
Group full visibility of both claims history and the insurance 
industry’s perception of the Group’s overall risk via the respective 
insurance premiums. The Company examines the size and trend 
of these premiums and the extent to which it can mitigate the risk 
and reduce the overall risk burden in the business by considering 
the appropriate level of insurance deductible and the potential 
benefit of self-insurance in some areas.
Operational structure, review and compliance
In addition to the Group Finance Director, the Group has Senior 
Financial Managers at its Head Office. The Board has considered 
whether the Company should have an internal audit department 
and has deemed that given both its risk management and internal 
control programme noted previously, together with the size and 
complexity of the Group, it is not necessary to employ such 
a department at the present time. The Board will, however, 
continue to keep this matter under review.
The key elements of the controls framework within which 
the Group operates are:
 — an organisational structure with clearly defined lines of 
responsibility, delegation of authority and reporting requirements;
 — an embedded culture of openness of communication between 
operational management and the Company’s Executive 
Management on matters relating to risk and control;
 — defined expenditure authorisation levels; and 
 — a comprehensive system of financial reporting. An annual 
budget for each business unit is prepared in detail and approved 
by the Group Executive Management. The Board approves the 
overall Group’s budget and plans. Monthly actual results are 
reported against budget and the prior year and the forecast for 
the year is revised where necessary. Any significant changes and 
adverse variances are questioned by the Board and remedial 
action is taken where appropriate. There is weekly cash and 
treasury reporting to the Group Finance Director and periodic 
reporting to the Board on the Group’s tax and treasury position.
The system of internal control is designed to manage rather than 
eliminate the risk of failing to achieve business objectives and can 
only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The control framework as outlined above gives reasonable 
assurance that the structure of controls in operation is appropriate 
to the Group’s situation and that risk is kept to acceptable levels 
throughout the Group.
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced 
by the Group and that this has been in place for the period 
under review and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts.
Takeover directive
Share capital structures are included in the Directors’ Report 
on page 59.
Going concern
The Directors consider, after making appropriate enquiries at the 
time of approving the financial statements, that the Company and 
the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and accordingly, that it is 
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in the preparation 
of the financial statements.

David McKeith
Audit Committee 
Chairman
Members
The Committee consists of all the Non-executive Directors 
including the Chairman. Biographies of the members of the 
Committee appear on page 30 and 31.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee, David McKeith, is considered 
to have recent and relevant financial experience as he is a fellow 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales 
and a former senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
He also acts as Chairman of the Audit Committee for Sportech plc 
where he is a non-executive director.
The Board is satisfied that the Committee has the appropriate 
level of expertise to fulfil its Terms of Reference. Additionally, 
an appraisal of the Committee was undertaken as part of an 
evaluation of the entire Board in the year to 31 March 2015 
which concluded that the Committee is operating effectively.
Responsibilities
The Committee is a sub-committee of the Board whose main 
responsibilities include:
 — reviewing the Company’s Annual and Interim Reports and other 
results announcements, including considering and challenging 
significant financial reporting issues and judgments;
 — monitoring the Company’s risk management and internal 
control procedures; and
 — overseeing the appointment and work of the external auditor.
The Committee also advises the Board on whether it considers 
the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s strategy, 
business model and performance.
Terms of Reference
The Committee’s Terms of Reference, which are in compliance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code, were reviewed 
on 5 March 2015 and deemed fit for purpose. A copy can be 
obtained from the Company’s website, www.norcros.com.
Meetings of the Committee
The Committee met formally three times during the year 
ended 31 March 2015. The Group Chief Executive, Group Finance 
Director, Company Secretary and Group Financial Controller also 
attended each of these meetings together with the engagement 
partner and other members of the audit team from the 
external auditor. 
ROLE OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The main responsibilities of the Audit Committee are:
 — reviewing the Company’s financial reporting;
 — monitoring the Company’s risk management 
and internal control procedures; and
 — overseeing the appointment and work 
of the external auditor. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Corporate governance
Meetings of the Committee continued
The Committee may invite other individuals either from within 
the Company or external technical advisers to attend meetings 
to provide information or advice as it sees fit.
At each meeting the Committee had the opportunity to discuss 
matters with the external auditor without management being 
present. The Chairman of the Committee also has regular 
discussions with the external audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process.
The Committee receives regular papers on incidences of fraud 
and whistleblowing and reviews any financial communications 
issued to the market at each meeting.
Financial reporting
The principal role of the Committee in connection with financial 
reporting is to advise the Board on whether it considers the 
Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s strategy, 
business model and performance. In order to make this 
assessment the Committee considers:
 — the suitability of accounting policies and practices;
 — the clarity of disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting and governance requirements; and
 — material areas of judgment, particularly where the matter has 
been considered an area of focus by the external auditor.
Significant financial reporting matters in the 2015 Annual Report
Following discussions with management and the external auditor, 
the Committee determined that there were three significant 
financial reporting matters impacting the 2015 Annual Report. 
These risks, together with the actions taken by the Committee 
in respect of each, are described below.
Accounting for customer rebates and other trade 
promotional spend
As part of its trading activities and in accordance with industry 
norms, a number of the Group’s customers are offered rebates 
and promotional incentives in order to encourage trade and 
cement strong relationships. Rebates and promotional spend 
are recognised as a deduction from revenue over the period 
of the agreement with the customer. Accounting for such 
arrangements involves judgment as agreement periods typically 
run for a number of months or years, and may involve assumptions 
around volumes of product purchased or sold into the future. 
The Committee considered the approach taken by management 
and the detailed testing undertaken by the external auditor and 
concluded that the commercial substance of the arrangements 
was appropriately reflected in the financial statements 
in accordance with accounting standards.
Defined benefit pension plan liabilities
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme is significant both 
in terms of its context in the overall balance sheet and the results 
of the Group, particularly given that the net deficit has increased 
from £21.8m in 2014 to £44.3m in 2015. The valuation of the 
present value of scheme liabilities involves significant judgment 
and expertise particularly in respect of the assumptions used.
In order to value the liabilities, management had engaged an 
independent firm of qualified actuaries. The Committee reviewed 
the outputs from this work and benchmarked the assumptions, 
particularly the net discount rate, with those applied by other 
companies with defined benefit pension schemes with similar 
characteristics and having the same measurement date. The 
Committee concurred with the assumptions put forward by 
management to value the liability.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment in South Africa
The Group holds property, plant and equipment relating to the 
manufacturing facilities of Johnson Tiles South Africa with a carrying 
value of £5.8m at 31 March 2015. Historically, this division has been 
loss making, and whilst improvements have been made in recent 
years culminating in the division achieving break even in the year 
to 31 March 2015, there remained the possibility that these 
improvements would not be sustained. Against this backdrop, 
judgment had to be applied to determine whether there had 
been a trigger for an impairment review of these assets.
The Committee reviewed management’s paper which considered 
whether a trigger for an impairment review was in evidence. Having 
reflected on the paper and consulted with the external auditor, the 
Committee was satisfied that no impairment trigger was present 
and consequently an impairment review was not required.
Other areas of judgment considered by the Committee
Presentation of acquisition related costs
The Committee were asked to consider management’s proposal 
regarding the classification of acquisition related costs and their 
presentation as a separate line item in the income statement in 
accordance with emerging market practice. After consulting with 
the external auditor, the Committee agreed to the change in 
accounting policy and presentation, noting that the comparative 
financial information, where required, should be restated 
to reflect this revision. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Internal controls and internal audit
The Committee undertakes a review, at least annually, of the 
effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls 
and the Board will take into account the Committee’s report, 
conclusions and recommendations in this regard.
The significant risks facing the Company, together with the 
actions taken to mitigate them, are highlighted on pages 24 to 27 
of the Strategic Report. Lower-level risks are discussed at monthly 
divisional management meetings and highlighted to the Board 
as appropriate.
The Company operates a robust monthly financial reporting 
and forecasting process and an annual budgeting cycle. This 
incorporates several levels of management review to provide 
assurance that the data is reconciled to the underlying records, 
and each month’s performance and the annual budget is 
ultimately approved by the Board.
Transaction-level financial reporting risks are identified and 
managed by each business within the Group completing an 
annual self-assessment questionnaire, the responses to which 
are considered during the internal controls reviews. To bolster 
this, a management representation process is in place requiring 
each division to confirm that all known material facts have been 
appropriately communicated to the Executive Directors.
Although there is no dedicated Group-wide internal audit 
resource, internal control work is performed by members of 
the Group Finance function who are appropriately qualified to 
undertake this type of work. Additionally, due to the particular 
risks faced by the Group’s retail and satellite manufacturing 
operations in South Africa, the Group employs a dedicated 
internal auditor focused on those risks. The work undertaken 
principally involves performing a cycle of Tile Africa store audits 
to ensure standard operating procedures are being followed and 
conducting internal controls reviews of other satellite facilities 
in southern Africa operated by the Group.
At its meeting in March the Committee considered whether 
there was a need to have a dedicated Group-wide internal audit 
function and concluded that due to the size and nature of the 
Company there is no requirement at the present time. 
The strategy for reviewing internal controls is discussed with the 
external auditor and agreed with the Committee. Findings from 
the internal control reviews together with any recommendations 
from the external auditor are considered by the Committee with 
improvements and weaknesses highlighted being followed up as 
appropriate. During the year there has been a focus on controls 
concerning accounts receivable, inventory management and 
valuation and the timeliness of recording transactions.
External auditor
The Committee has primary responsibility for making 
recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment 
and removal of the external auditor. The Committee keeps under 
review the scope and results of the audit and its effectiveness, 
as well as the independence and objectivity of the auditor.
The external auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, was re-appointed 
in November 2011 following a competitive tender process. The 
Committee is mindful of the consultation documents issued by 
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and the 
Financial Reporting Council (FRC) on how to adopt the EU Regulations 
on mandatory firm rotation in the UK. The timing of a competitive 
tender will continue to be assessed on an annual basis, considering 
both the results of the annual effectiveness review and changes 
to UK legislation. The Committee has, however, committed 
to conducting a tender process for the role of external auditor 
at least every ten years.
The Committee is aware of the need to safeguard the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence and the issue is discussed by the 
Committee and periodically with the audit engagement partner 
from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. As required by Auditing 
Practices Board requirements, external auditor independence is 
maintained by the rotation of the engagement partner every five 
years. The current engagement partner, Mr. M. Heath, has been 
in place for four years. In addition to this, policies on the award 
of non-audit work to the external auditor and the employment 
of ex-employees of the external auditor are in place which 
are reviewed annually.
The external audit starts with the design of a work plan that 
tackles the key risks of the audit which were determined at the 
November 2014 meeting of the Committee and revised in March 
2015. At each meeting the Committee had the opportunity to 
discuss matters with the external auditor without management 
being present. The Chairman of the Committee also has regular 
discussions with the external audit partner outside the formal 
Committee process.
For the year ended 31 March 2015, the Committee was satisfied 
with the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of the 
relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as external 
auditor. In the light of this the Committee has recommended to 
the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be re-appointed for 
the forthcoming year and a resolution proposing this will be put 
to the 2015 Annual General Meeting.

ROLE OF THE 
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE 
The main responsibilities of the Nominations 
Committee are:
 — evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, 
diversity and experience of the Board; 
 — succession planning for the Board; and
 — determining the scope of the role of a new Director, 
the skills and time commitment required and makes 
recommendations to the Board about filling Board 
vacancies and appointing additional Directors.
The Nominations Committee and the Board seek to maintain 
an appropriate balance between the Executive and Non-executive 
Directors. The Nominations Committee is chaired by the 
Chairman and consists of all the Non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman will not chair the Committee when it deals 
with the appointment of a successor to the Chairmanship.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available for 
inspection upon written request to the Company and on its 
website at www.norcros.com.
The Nominations Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge, diversity and experience of the Board. In light of this 
evaluation and, if deemed necessary, it determines the scope 
of the role of a new Director, the skills and time commitment 
required and makes recommendations to the Board about filling 
Board vacancies and appointing additional Directors. The Committee 
utilises external search and selection consultants as appropriate. 
The search for Board candidates will continue to be conducted 
and appointments made on the basis of merit and the most 
appropriate experience against objective criteria in the best 
interests of shareholders. In selecting candidates due regard 
will be given to the balance of the Board, and to the benefits 
of different backgrounds and experience, and to diversity 
on the Board including gender.
If a new Director is selected, the Nominations Committee 
will use the appropriate selection process. 
In the year under review the Committee reviewed the Company’s 
succession plan for the Board and senior executives. It is satisfied 
that succession issues are being adequately managed, and 
it will keep this under review in the light of the Group’s 
strategic evolution.

ROLE OF THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration 
Committee are:
 — determine and agree with shareholders the 
remuneration policy and keep it under review; 
 — implement the approved remuneration policy as 
regards Executive Director remuneration, benefits 
and incentives, including the design of, and targets for, 
all incentive arrangements; and
 — as necessary determine the remuneration packages 
for new senior executives and the terms of any 
cessation of office.
Dear shareholders, 
I am pleased to present the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
for the year to 31 March 2015. 
The Group’s remuneration policy was presented to the AGM in 
2014 and was approved with 99.9% of votes cast in support of the 
policy. No changes to the policy are proposed for 2015. However, 
for your convenience, the policy is included in full on pages 43 to 48.
Remuneration strategy
The Committee’s overall approach to executive remuneration 
remains unchanged. We are focused on ensuring the Group’s 
remuneration policy is closely aligned with shareholders’ interests 
whilst also enabling us to attract, retain and motivate our executive 
leadership, but without paying more than is necessary for this purpose. 
We do this with a simple remuneration structure comprising base 
salary and benefits, an annual bonus and a single performance-based 
long-term incentive. Targets for the annual bonus and long-term 
incentive are set at levels that are stretching and provide a clear 
link between pay and our strategic objectives. 
This produces a package with an anticipated on-target reward 
mix for the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
comprising 61% Fixed Pay (51% base salary, 8% pension and 2% 
benefits), 26% annual bonus and 13% long-term incentive. Under 
a scenario where all performance conditions are met in full, the 
balance of the Executive Directors’ package is 38% Fixed Pay, 
31% annual bonus and 31% long-term incentive.
To further ensure remuneration is aligned with shareholder 
interests, half of any bonus paid is deferred for three years, shares 
vesting from APSP awards made in 2015 onwards need to be held 
for a further two years (i.e. until the fifth anniversary of grant), and 
the Executive Directors are additionally required to build and 
maintain a shareholding of at least 100% of salary. Finally, in the 
event of material mis-statement in accounting records or gross 
misconduct, deferred bonus and APSP awards may be subject 
to malus or clawback.
Year in review
As highlighted in the Chairman’s statement and Group Chief 
Executive’s statement on pages 2 and 4, Norcros continues to 
perform strongly with a sixth consecutive year of growth in both 
revenue and underlying operating profit. Highlights for the year 
to 31 March 2015 include:
 — Revenue growth of 1.5% (5.0% on a constant currency basis) 
to £222.1m
 — Underlying operating profit up 5.8% to £17.0m
 — Continued progress with the South African business (underlying 
profit up 68.7%)
 — Disposal of the Australian business in line with Group strategy
 — Legacy property issues largely resolved
 — Underlying ROCE at 16.3%, ahead of the Group strategic target 
of 12–15%
This strong performance delivered underlying profit above the target 
set by the Committee for the year, resulting in an annual bonus of 
c.69% of base salary being awarded to Executive Directors for the year 
ended 31 March 2015. This will be delivered half in cash and half in the 
form of nil cost options under the 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Remuneration Committee annual statement 
continued
Year in review continued
The Group has also exceeded its targets for aggregate underlying 
earnings per share (EPS) over the period from 1 April 2012 to 
31 March 2015. As a result, c.99% of the APSP awards granted in 2011 
will vest on 28 July 2015. The Committee considers this outcome 
to appropriately reflect the Group’s very strong performance over 
the period.
2015 Remuneration
In accordance with our Remuneration Policy, the Executive 
Director base salaries were increased by 2.0% in line with the 
wider UK-based workforce. There are no other changes to 
Executive Director remuneration for the year to 31 March 2016.
The Committee believes that our remuneration strategy and its 
implementation remain appropriate. I hope you will support this 
view with your advisory vote on the Annual Report on 
Remuneration at the 2015 AGM.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank shareholders 
for their continued support.

REMUNERATION DISCLOSURE
This Directors’ Remuneration Report has been 
prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The Report 
meets the requirements of the UK Listing Authority’s 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules. 
In this Report we describe how the principles of good 
governance relating to Directors’ remuneration, as set 
out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code), 
are applied in practice. The Remuneration Committee 
confirms that throughout the financial year the Group 
has complied with these governance rules and best 
practice provisions.
“ THE COMMITTEE IS FOCUSED ON 
ENSURING THE GROUP’S REMUNERATION 
POLICY IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH 
SHAREHOLDERS’ INTERESTS WHILE ALSO 
ENABLING US TO ATTRACT, RETAIN AND 
MOTIVATE OUR EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP.” Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

COMPONENT AND OBJECTIVE OPERATION OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Base salary
To enable the Group to attract, 
motivate and retain the people 
it needs to maximise the value 
of the business
Generally reviewed each year, 
with increases effective 1 April with 
reference to salary levels at other 
FTSE companies of broadly similar 
size or sector to Norcros.
The Committee also considers 
the salary increases applying across 
the rest of the UK business when 
determining increases for 
Executive Directors.
Base salary increases are applied 
in line with the outcome of the 
annual review.
Salaries in respect of the year under 
review (and for the following year) 
are disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
Salary increases for Executive Directors 
will normally not exceed those of the 
wider workforce over the period this 
policy will apply. Where increases are 
awarded in excess of the wider employee 
population, for example if there is a 
material change in the responsibility, 
size or complexity of the role, the 
Committee will provide the rationale 
in the relevant year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
n/a
Pension
To provide a level of retirement 
benefit that is competitive in the 
relevant market 
Executive Directors receive pension 
contributions (either as a direct 
payment or a cash allowance).
Base salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable.
Maximum of 15% of base salary. n/a
Benefits
Provision of benefits in line 
with the market
Executive Directors are provided with 
a company car (or a cash allowance 
in lieu thereof) and medical insurance. 
Other benefits may be introduced 
from time to time to ensure the 
benefits package is appropriately 
competitive and reflects the needs 
and circumstances of the Group 
and individual Executive Director.
Benefits may vary by role, and the 
level is determined each year to 
be appropriate for the role and 
circumstances of each individual 
Executive Director.
It is not anticipated that the current 
cost of benefits (as set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration) 
would increase materially over the 
period for which this policy will apply.
The Committee retains the discretion 
to approve a higher cost in exceptional 
circumstances (e.g. relocation expenses 
or an expatriation allowance on 
recruitment, etc.) or in circumstances 
where factors outside the Company’s 
control have changed materially (e.g. 
market increases in insurance costs).
n/a
Annual bonus and 
Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)
To focus Executive Directors 
on achieving demanding 
annual targets relating to 
Group performance and 
encourage retention
Performance targets are set at the 
start of the year and aligned with the 
annual budget agreed by the Board. 
At the end of the year, the Committee 
determines the extent to which these 
targets have been achieved. 
50% of the total bonus payment is 
paid in cash, and 50% is converted 
into nil-cost options over Norcros 
shares under the 2011 Deferred 
Bonus Plan (DBP). These options are 
exercisable after three years, subject 
to continued employment and malus 
(in whole or in part) during the deferral 
period in the event of a material 
mis-statement in accounting records 
or gross misconduct.
A payment equivalent to the dividends 
that would have accrued on deferred 
bonus awards that vest will be made 
to participants on vesting.
Maximum opportunity:
100% of base salary
Target opportunity:
50% of base salary
For threshold performance, the 
bonus payout is 25% of maximum.
The bonus will be based primarily on the 
achievement of financial performance 
targets and may, from time to time as 
considered appropriate by the Committee, 
include non-financial performance 
measures (the weighting of which, if any, 
will be capped at 20% of the total 
opportunity).
The primary measure is Group underlying 
operating profit, although the Committee 
may, in its discretion and from time to 
time, supplement operating profit with 
additional financial measures that reflect 
the strategic priorities for Norcros for the 
financial year. 
The Committee has discretion to adjust 
the formulaic bonus outcomes (including 
down to zero) within the limits of the 
scheme to ensure alignment of pay 
with performance.
Further details including targets attached 
to the bonus for the year under review 
are given on page 51 of the Annual 
Report on Remuneration.
Directors’ remuneration policy report
Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section of the report sets out the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors, which came into effect 
on 23 July 2014, immediately after it was approved by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM. It remains unchanged for 2015, other than 
the following minor updates:
 — Pay scenario charts have been updated to reflect the 2016 financial year packages for Executive Directors
 — Page references have been updated.

COMPONENT AND OBJECTIVE OPERATION OPPORTUNITY PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Approved Performance 
Share Plan (APSP)
To incentivise Executive Directors 
to deliver long-term performance 
by aligning their performance 
with shareholders’ interests
APSP awards comprise annual 
conditional awards of nil-cost 
options following the announcement 
of the Group’s final results.
Awards normally vest after three 
years, subject to the achievement 
of a performance condition and 
continued employment with the 
Group until the vesting date.
To the extent an award vests, 
Executive Directors will be required 
to hold net vested shares for an 
additional holding period of one year 
(for 2014 APSP awards) and two years 
for future awards. 
A payment equivalent to the 
dividends that would have accrued 
on APSP awards that vest will be 
made to participants on vesting.
APSP awards are also subject to malus 
over the vesting period and clawback 
over the holding period (in both cases 
in whole or in part) in the event of a 
material mis-statement in accounting 
records or gross misconduct.
Maximum opportunity:
100% of base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such 
as to facilitate the recruitment of an 
external hire, the Committee may, 
in its absolute discretion, exceed 
this maximum annual opportunity, 
up to 150% of salary.
Threshold performance results 
in 25% vesting.
Details of actual APSP awards in 
respect of each year will be disclosed 
in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Vesting of APSP awards is dependent 
upon the Group’s earnings per share (EPS) 
performance over a three-year period.
At the start of each cycle, the Committee 
will determine the targets that will apply 
to an award.
If the performance targets are not met at 
end of the performance period, awards 
will lapse.
The Committee has discretion to 
adjust the formulaic APSP outcomes 
within the limits of the scheme if certain 
relevant events take place (e.g. a capital 
restructuring, a material acquisition/
divestment etc.) with any such adjustment 
to result in the revised targets being no 
more or less challenging to achieve. 
The Committee will consult major 
shareholders on changes to the APSP, 
although retains discretion to make 
non-significant changes to the 
performance measure without 
reverting to a full shareholder vote.
Further details, including the targets 
attached to the APSP in respect of each 
year, are disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
SAYE
To encourage the ownership 
of Norcros plc shares
An HMRC approved scheme where 
employees (including Executive 
Directors) may save up to the individual 
monthly limit set by HMRC from time 
to time over three years. Options 
granted at a discount of up to 20%.
Savings capped at the individual 
monthly limit set by HMRC from 
time to time.

Shareholding requirements
To align Executive Director 
and shareholder interests 
and reinforce long-term 
decision-making
Executive Directors are required 
to retain at least 50% of any DBP 
or APSP awards that vest (net of tax) 
until they have built up a personal 
holding of Norcros plc shares 
worth 100% of salary.
Only shares that are held beneficially 
count in the assessment of whether 
an Executive Director has met the 
required ownership level.

Notes to the policy table
Payments from previous awards
The Group will honour any commitment entered into, and Executive Directors will be eligible to receive payment from any award made, 
prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report, i.e. before 23 July 2014. Details of these 
awards are, and will be, disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measure selection and approach to target setting
The use of Group underlying operating profit in the annual bonus directly reinforces our medium-term growth-oriented strategy 
(see page 7 of the Annual Report for further details). For the APSP, the Committee considers that EPS is a transparent, objective 
and effective measure of performance which is in the long-term interests of all of our shareholders.
Targets applying to the bonus and APSP are reviewed annually, based on a number of internal and external reference points. Bonus targets 
are aligned with the annual budget agreed by the Board. Annual bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive but will be 
disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration (see page 51 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). APSP targets 
reflect industry context, expectations of what will constitute appropriately challenging performance levels, and factors specific to the Group. 
The Committee will determine the APSP targets at the time awards are made and these targets (along with other relevant details of the 
grant) will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration (see page 52 of the Annual Report on Remuneration). Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Performance scenario charts
The graphs above provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunity for Executive Directors, and the potential mix between the 
different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: “Minimum”, “On-target” and “Maximum”. This information 
is for the current financial year, as explained below.
Potential opportunities illustrated above are based on the policy applied to the base salary at 1 April 2015. For the annual bonus, the amounts 
illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for the year to 31 March 2016. It should be noted that any bonus deferred 
into the DBP and APSP awards do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant. This illustration is intended to illustrate the 
relationship between executive pay and performance. The values of the DBP and APSP assume no increase in the underlying value of the 
shares, and actual pay delivered will further be influenced by changes in factors such as the Group’s share price and the value of dividends paid.
Valuation assumptions
The “Minimum” scenario reflects base salary, pension and benefits (i.e. fixed remuneration), being the only elements of the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration package not linked to performance.
The “On-target” scenario reflects fixed remuneration as above, plus target bonus payout (50% of salary) and APSP threshold vesting 
at 25% of the maximum award level.
The “Maximum” scenario reflects fixed remuneration, plus full payout under all incentives (100% of salary under each of the annual bonus 
and APSP).
Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration
External appointment
In cases of hiring or appointing a new Executive Director from outside the Group, the Remuneration Committee may make use of all 
existing components of remuneration, as follows:
COMPONENT POLICY
Base salary The base salaries of new appointees will be determined by reference to relevant market data, experience and skills 
of the individual, internal relativities and the current salary of the incumbent in the role.
Where a new appointee has an initial base salary set below market, the Committee may make phased increases over 
a period of three years, subject to the individual’s development and performance in the role.
Benefits As set out in the Policy table, benefits may include (but are not limited to) the provision of a company car 
or car allowance, medical insurance, and any necessary expatriation allowances or expenses relating 
to an executive’s relocation.
Pension New appointees will receive pension contributions into a defined contribution pension arrangement or an equivalent 
cash supplement, or a combination of both. The maximum employer contribution will be 15% of salary on the same 
terms as other Executive Directors.
SAYE New appointees will be eligible to participate on identical terms to all other employees.
Notes to the policy table continued
Differences from remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for other employees is based on broadly consistent principles as described above. Annual salary reviews across the 
Group take into account Group performance, local pay and market conditions, and salary levels for similar roles in comparable companies.
Executives and senior managers are eligible to participate in annual bonus schemes. Opportunities and performance measures vary by 
organisational level, geographical region and an individual’s role. Other members of the Group senior leadership team participate in the APSP 
on similar terms as the Executive Directors, although award sizes may vary by organisational level. All UK employees are eligible to participate 
in the Group’s SAYE scheme on identical terms.

Approach to Executive Director recruitment remuneration continued
External appointment continued
COMPONENT POLICY
Annual bonus The bonus structure described in the policy table will apply to new appointees. The maximum opportunity will 
be 100% of salary, pro-rated in the year of joining to reflect the proportion of that year employed. Performance 
measures may include strategic and operational objectives tailored to the individual in the financial year of joining.
50% of any bonus earned will be deferred into the DBP on the same terms as other Executive Directors.
APSP New appointees will be granted annual awards under the APSP on the same terms as other Executive Directors, 
as described in the policy table.
In determining the appropriate remuneration structure and level for the appointee, the Remuneration Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors to ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of our shareholders. It is not the intention of the 
Committee that a cash payment such as a ‘golden hello’ would be offered. However, the Committee may make an award in respect of a 
new appointment to ‘buy out’ incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer, over and above the approach and award 
limits outlined in the table above. Any such award will be made under existing incentive structures, where appropriate, and will be subject 
to the normal performance conditions of those incentives. The Committee may also consider it appropriate to make “buy out” awards 
under a different structure, using the relevant Listing Rule, where necessary to replicate the structure of forfeited awards. Any “buy out” 
award (however this is delivered) would have a fair value no higher than that of the awards forfeited, taking into account relevant factors 
including performance conditions, the likelihood of those conditions being met and the proportion of the vesting period remaining. 
Details of any such award will be disclosed in the first Annual Report on Remuneration following its grant.
Internal promotion to the Board
In cases of appointing a new Executive Director by way of internal promotion, the policy will be consistent with that for external 
appointees detailed above. Where an individual has contractual commitments made prior to their promotion to the Board, and it is 
agreed that a commitment is to continue, the Group will continue to honour these arrangements even if there are instances where they 
would not otherwise be consistent with the prevailing Executive Director remuneration policy at the time of promotion.
Service contracts and policy for payment for loss of office
Executive Directors have signed rolling contracts, terminable on 12 months’ notice by either the Group or the Director. The Group 
entered into a contract with Nick Kelsall on 1 April 2011, and with Martin Payne on 18 March 2011. Copies of these contracts are available 
to view at the Group’s registered office.
The Committee’s policy for Directors’ termination payments is to provide only what would normally be due to Directors had they 
remained in employment in respect of the relevant notice period, and not to go beyond their normal contractual entitlements. Any 
incentive arrangements will be dealt with subject to the relevant rules, with any discretion exercised by the Committee on a case by 
case basis taking into account the circumstances of the termination. Termination payments will also take into account any statutory 
entitlement at the appropriate level, to be considered by the Committee on the same basis. The Committee will monitor and where 
appropriate enforce the Directors’ duty to mitigate loss. When the Committee believes that it is essential to protect the Group’s interests, 
additional arrangements may be entered into (for example post-termination protections above and beyond those in the contract 
of employment) on appropriate terms. 
Under the current service contract for each of Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, the Company has the discretion to terminate the 
employment lawfully without any notice by paying to the Director a sum equal to, but no more than, the salary and other contractual 
benefits of the Director. The payment would be in respect of that part of the period of notice which the Director has not worked, less any 
appropriate tax and other statutory deductions. The Director would be entitled to any holiday pay which may otherwise have accrued in 
what would have been the notice period. The Company may pay any sums due under these pay in lieu of notice provisions as one lump 
sum or in instalments of what would have been the notice period. If the Company elects to pay in instalments, the Director is under an 
express contractual duty to mitigate his losses and to disclose any third-party income he has received or is due to receive. The Company 
reserves the right to reduce the amount of the instalments by the amount of such income. The Committee would expect to include 
similar pay in lieu of notice provisions in any future executive director’s service contract. These pay in lieu of notice provisions can also be 
activated by the Director if they exercise their contractual right to terminate their employment upon a change of control of the Company 
or a transfer of their employment to an acquirer of the Company’s business. The Committee would not envisage including a similar right 
to terminate in any future executive director’s service contract.
Also under their service contracts, if the Director’s employment is terminated for whatever reason, he agrees that he is not entitled to 
any damages or compensation to recompense him for the loss or diminution in value of any actual or prospective rights, benefits or 
expectations under or in relation to the APSP, DBP, SAYE plan or the annual discretionary bonus scheme. This is without prejudice to any 
of the rights, benefits or entitlements which may have accrued to the Director under such arrangements at the termination of employment.  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Directors’ remuneration policy report continued
External appointments 
Executive Directors are permitted to take up non-executive positions on the boards of other companies, subject to the prior approval 
of the Board. The Executive Director may retain any fees payable in relation to such appointment. Details of external appointments 
and the associated fees received are included in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Consideration of employment conditions elsewhere in the Group
The Group seeks to promote and maintain good relations with employees and (where relevant) their representative bodies as part 
of its broader employee engagement strategy. The Committee is mindful of salary increases applying across the rest of the business 
in relevant markets when considering salaries for Executive Directors, but does not currently consult with employees specifically 
on executive remuneration policy and framework.
Consideration of shareholder views 
The Committee considers shareholder views received during the year and at the Annual General Meeting each year, as well as guidance 
from shareholder representative bodies more broadly, in shaping remuneration policy. The vast majority of shareholders continue to express 
support of remuneration arrangements at Norcros. The Committee keeps the remuneration policy under regular review, to ensure it 
continues to reinforce the Group’s long-term strategy, and aligns Executive Directors with shareholders’ interests. We will consult 
shareholders before making any significant changes to our remuneration policy.
Non-executive Director remuneration policy
Non-executive Directors (including the Chairman) have letters of appointment which specify an initial term of at least three years, 
although these contracts may be terminated at one month’s notice by either the Company or Director. In line with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code guidelines, all Directors are subject to re-election annually at the AGM.
Details of terms and notice periods for Non-executive Directors are summarised below:
Non-executive Director Date of appointment Notice period
Martin Towers 28 July 2011 1 month
Jo Hallas 27 September 2012 1 month
David McKeith 24 July 2013 1 month
It is the policy of the Board of Directors that Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s bonus, long-term 
incentive or pension schemes. Details of the policy on fees paid to our Non-executive Directors are set out in the table below:
COMPONENT AND OBJECTIVE OPERATION OPPORTUNITY
PERFORMANCE 
MEASURES
Fees
To attract and retain Non-executive 
Directors of the highest calibre with 
broad commercial experience 
relevant to the Group
The fee paid to the Chairman is determined by 
the Committee excluding the Chairman. The 
fees paid to the other Non-executive Directors 
are determined by the Chairman and the 
Executive Directors.
Fee levels are reviewed periodically, with any 
adjustments effective 1 April. Fees are reviewed 
by taking into account external advice on best 
practice and fee levels at other FTSE companies 
of broadly similar size and sector to Norcros. 
Time commitment and responsibility are also 
taken into account when reviewing fees.
Additional fees are payable for acting as Chairman 
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Aggregate fees are limited to 
£350,000 p.a. by the Group’s 
Articles of Association.
Fee increases will be applied 
taking into account the outcome 
of the review.
The fees paid to Non-executive 
Directors in respect of the year under 
review (and for the following year) 
are disclosed in the Annual Report 
on Remuneration.

Approach to Non-executive Director recruitment remuneration
In recruiting a new Non-executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will use the policy as set out in the table above. A base fee 
in line with the prevailing fee schedule would be payable for serving as a Director of the Board, with additional fees payable for acting 
as Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committees. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Annual report on remuneration
The following section provides details of how our policy was implemented during the year to 31 March 2015.
Remuneration Committee membership in the year to 31 March 2015
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the 
members of the Group’s senior management and for setting the remuneration packages for the Board Chairman and each Executive 
Director. The Committee’s responsibilities are set out in its Terms of Reference which can be found on the Company’s website at 
www.norcros.com.
During the year under review, the following Directors were members of the Remuneration Committee:
 — Jo Hallas (Chair);
 — David McKeith; and
 — Martin Towers.
All members of the Committee are independent. They serve on the Committee for a minimum three-year term and a maximum of six 
years. As part of an effectiveness review for the entire Board, an evaluation of the Remuneration Committee was undertaken in the year 
to 31 March 2015. We are pleased to report this review concluded that the Committee has operated effectively.
In addition, the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director were invited to attend Committee meetings to advise on specific 
questions raised by the Committee and on matters relating to the performance and remuneration of senior managers, other than in 
relation to their own remuneration. The Group Counsel and Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee. No individual was 
present while decisions were made regarding their own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year. Attendance by individual members at meetings is detailed on page 34.
Main activities of the Committee during the year to 31 March 2015
The main activities carried out by the Committee during the year under review were:
 — reviewing and setting salary levels for Executive Directors and senior management;
 — determining the annual bonus outcome for the year ended 31 March 2014;
 — setting operating profit targets for the annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2015;
 — calibrating EPS targets for, and granting of, 2014 APSP awards;
 — reviewing and setting the fees payable to the Non-executive Chairman; and
 — aligning, where appropriate, the benefits provided to senior management.
Advisers
In February 2014, following a competitive tendering process, the Company appointed Kepler Associates as the independent remuneration 
advisers to the Remuneration Committee. Kepler Associates is a founding member and signatory of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration 
Consultants, details of which can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com. In the year to 31 March 2015, Kepler Associates

2.  Annual bonus comprises both the cash annual bonus for performance during the year and the face value of the deferred bonus element on the date of deferral. The deferred 
share element (50% of the figures shown in the table above) is deferred for three years. See ‘Annual Bonus in respect of 2015 performance’ below for further details.
3.  For 2015, the APSP value reflects the estimated value of APSP awards granted in October 2012, of which 99.25% will vest on 28 July 2015. The value of awards is estimated using 
the three-month average share price to 31 March 2015 of 16.79p, and will be trued-up to reflect the vest-date value of awards in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. 
See the relevant sections on page 52 for further details. For 2015 the figures also include £9,519 and £6,447 of dividend accrual for N. P. Kelsall and M. K. Payne respectively 
(2014: nil). For 2014, the APSP value has been trued up from that disclosed in last year’s Remuneration Report to reflect the Group’s share price of 17.625p on the date of vesting 
(1 September 2014) of awards granted in September 2011.
4.  The pension benefit provided to Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne in 2015 comprises cash in lieu (N. P. Kelsall – £50,250, M. K. Payne – £33,750) and amounts related to the defined 
benefit scheme (N. P. Kelsall – £28,229, M. K. Payne – £599). In 2014, pension benefits comprised cash in lieu (N. P. Kelsall – £72,363, M. K. Payne – £41,748), and amounts related

Annual bonus in respect of performance in the year to 31 March 2015
The 2015 annual bonus plan was based 100% on Group underlying operating profit performance for the year to 31 March 2015. Based on 
the Company’s performance in 2015, against targets set at the start of the year, the Committee decided to make an annual bonus award 
of 69.23% of base salary to each of the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. Further details, including the profit targets set 
and actual performance, are provided below:

50% of the annual bonus award of 69.23% of base salary for each Executive Director, i.e. 34.615% of salary, will be deferred into shares under 
the DBP. This DBP award will vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.

Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) 
The grant of options under the DBP in respect of the year to 31 March 2015 has not yet been made. As a result of this, the precise 
number of options to be granted in respect of the year to 31 March 2015 cannot yet be calculated, though the proposed monetary value 
of the bonus earned is known. Accordingly, Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne will receive a number of nil cost options calculated by dividing 
the proposed value of £115,960 and £77,884 respectively by the share price at the date of grant.
2012 APSP awards vesting
Effective July 2012, APSP awards of 2,507,056 and 1,735,654 shares were granted to Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, respectively. Vesting of 
these awards was based on Norcros’ aggregate diluted underlying EPS over the three financial years to 31 March 2015. Based on performance 
over this period, the Committee determined that 99.25% of this award will vest on 28 July 2015, being the end of the relevant three-year 
vesting period according to the APSP rules. Performance targets, and actual performance against these, are summarised in the table below:

Total pension entitlements (audited information)
As part of their remuneration arrangements Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne are entitled to receive pension contributions from the Company. 
Under these arrangements, they can elect for those contributions to be paid in the form of taxable pension allowance, or direct payments 
into a personal pension plan or the Group’s UK defined contribution scheme. For the year under review and for future years (but unlike the 
practice in the previous year), if a payment is made in the form of taxable pension allowance, the amount payable is not reduced to allow 
for employment taxes.
During the year Nick Kelsall elected to take taxable pension allowance of £50,250 (2014: £72,363) with no amounts paid directly into a 
pension scheme (2014: £nil). Martin Payne elected to take taxable pension allowance of £33,750 (2014: £41,748) with no amount paid into 
a personal pension plan (2014: £nil). In line with the Regulations, the single figure table reflects the total of these amounts, as well as the 
capitalised increase in accrued pension (net of inflation) under the UK defined benefit scheme, of which neither Nick Kelsall nor Martin 
Payne are active members. Martin Payne’s entitlement relates to his former employment at H&R Johnson Tiles Limited between 1993 
and 2001. Details of Executive Directors’ retirement benefits under the Group’s UK defined benefit scheme and taxable pension allowances 
are summarised in the following table.

No exit payments to Directors were made during the year under review.

Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change in the CEO’s salary, benefits (excluding pension) and annual bonus between the 2014 and 
2015 financial years compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for all staff employed in 
continuing operations. The comparison uses a per capita figure and accordingly this reflects an average across the Group’s businesses. 
No account is therefore taken of the impact of a substantially weaker South African Rand and operational factors such as new joiners 
and leavers and the mix of employees.

1.  The percentage changes for the CEO’s Salary and Benefits reflect the rebalancing of the CEO’s fixed pay mix (effective 1 April 2014) by increasing base salary but offsetting 
this increase by decreasing employer cash pension contributions and car allowances to bring each component more into line with FTSE market norms. The percentage change 
in the CEO’s overall fixed pay between 2014 and 2015 was 6.4%.

Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2016
The Remuneration Committee conducted its normal review of Executive Directors’ remuneration, effective 1 April 2015. 
The results of this review are as follows:
Base salary
Base salaries are reviewed taking into account individual performance and competitive practice for similar roles in the Company’s 
remuneration peer group, and remuneration awards within the Group. The Committee decided to increase Executive Director salaries 
in line with the rest of the Group by 2%. For the year to 31 March 2016, Nick Kelsall’s salary will be £341,700, and Martin Payne’s salary 
will be £229,500.

Implementation of Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2016 continued
Pension
Executive Directors’ pension contributions were reduced to 15% of salary (from 30% of salary for Nick Kelsall and 25% of salary for Martin 
Payne) with effect from 1 April 2014. Contributions will be made either directly into a pension or as a cash allowance, at the choice of 
each Executive Director. There is no change in the contribution percentage for either Executive Director for the year to 31 March 2016.
Car allowance
The annual car allowance was reduced from £29,000 to £15,000 for Nick Kelsall and from £20,000 to £12,000 for Martin Payne 
with effect from 1 April 2014. There is no change in the car allowance for either Executive Director for the year to 31 March 2016.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors will remain unchanged for the 2016 financial year with a maximum bonus 
entitlement of 100% of salary. The bonus outcome for Executive Directors will continue to be based entirely on Group underlying 
operating profit. Of any bonus earned 50% will be deferred into nil cost options for a further three years under the Deferred Bonus Plan. 
Annual bonus targets are considered to be commercially sensitive but will be disclosed retrospectively in next year’s Annual Report 
on Remuneration.
APSP
The structure of APSP awards to be made in the 2016 financial year will be unchanged from 2015 except that, to the extent an award 
vests, vested shares will be subject to a further two year holding period (compared to one year for 2015 awards). Awards with face values 
of 100% of salary will be granted to Nick Kelsall and Martin Payne, with vesting subject to the achievement of three year aggregate diluted 
underlying EPS targets. The Committee will determine these targets at the time awards are made and these targets (along with other 
relevant details of this grant) will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
SAYE
Executive Directors will be able to participate in any SAYE contract offered to all employees, on identical terms.
Implementation of Non-Executive Director remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2016
The Committee has reviewed the Board Chairman’s fee and concluded that an increase to £97,000 p.a. was appropriate. The Board Chairman 
and the Executive Directors reviewed Non-executive Director fees at the same time, and concluded that a similar small percentage increase 
would be appropriate. Accordingly, for the 2016 financial year, Non-executive Director fees will be as follows:
Fee at Fee from Percentage
Executive Director 1 April 2014 1 April 2015 increase
Board Chairman £95,000 £97,000 2.1%
Non-executive Director £35,000 £35,875 2.5%

Shareholder dilution
The Group’s share incentive plans operate in line with the ABI principles, which require that commitments under all share schemes 
satisfied by newly issued shares must not exceed 10% of the issued share capital in any rolling ten-year period, of which up to 5% may 
be used to satisfy options under executive share schemes. The Group’s position against the dilution limits at 31 March 2015 was 5.7% 
for the all share schemes limit and 4.0% for executive schemes.

Directors’ report
The Directors present their Annual Report and the audited 
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2015.
Principal activities 
The Company acts as a holding company for the Norcros Group. 
The Company’s registered number is 3691883 and the Company 
is registered and domiciled in England.
The Group’s principal activities are the development, 
manufacture and marketing of home consumer products 
in the UK and South Africa. 
Results and dividends
The information that fulfils the requirements of the Business Review, 
which is incorporated in the Directors’ Report by reference, including 
the review of the Group’s business and future prospects, is included 
in the Chairman’s Statement, Group Chief Executive’s statement 
and the Strategic Report on page 2 to page 29. Key performance 
indicators are shown on page 23.
The Directors recommend a final dividend for the year ended 
31 March 2015 of 0.375p (2014: 0.340p). This follows the decision 
to pay an interim dividend earlier in the year of 0.185p (2014: 0.170p).
Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and indemnities
The Company purchases liability insurance cover for Directors 
and officers of the Company which gives appropriate cover 
for any legal action brought against them. The Company also 
provides an indemnity for its Directors (to the extent permitted 
by the law) in respect of liabilities which could occur as a result 
of their office. This indemnity does not provide cover should 
a Director be proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.
Purchase of own shares
In 2007 the Company formed the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust 
(the “Trust”). The purpose of the Trust is to meet part of the Company’s 
liabilities under the Company’s share schemes. The Trust purchased 
no ordinary shares during the year (2014: nil). At the Company’s 
2014 Annual General Meeting, the shareholders authorised 
the Company to make market purchases of up to 58,788,549 
ordinary shares. At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, 
shareholders will be asked to renew the authority to purchase 
its own shares for another year. Details are contained in the 
Notice of Meeting.
Employees
The necessity for, and importance of, good relations with all 
employees is well recognised and accepted throughout the 
Group. However, because the Group’s activities are organised 
on a de-centralised basis, with each operating business having 
autonomy over its operations, there is no uniform set of 
arrangements for employee involvement imposed throughout 
the Group. Nevertheless, all Group companies are strongly 
encouraged to devise and adopt whatever means of employee 
consultation best suit their circumstances.
The Group is fully committed to keeping its employees informed 
about their work unit and the wider business.
The Group recognises its responsibilities towards disabled persons 
and therefore all applications from such persons are fully and fairly 
considered bearing in mind the respective aptitudes and abilities 
of the applicant. In the event of existing employees becoming 
disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. 
It is the policy of the Group that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, 
be identical to that of an able-bodied person.

Corporate governance
Greenhouse gas emissions continued
We have reported on all of the emission sources, being Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions. These are emissions from activities for 
which the Group is responsible, plus emissions resulting from 
the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling by a business in 
the Group for its own use. These sources use the same reporting 
boundary as for our consolidated financial statements. We do not 
have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included 
in our consolidated financial statements.
We have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition), data gathered to fulfil our 
requirements under the CRC Energy Efficiency scheme, and 
emission factors from the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014. Where no more suitable 
data sources are available, we have used, where practicable, 
estimates based on the appropriate information that is available 
to the Group.
Political donations
There were no political donations (2014: £nil).
Research and development
The Group’s expenditure on research and development is 
disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements and is focused 
on the development of new products.
Corporate governance
Details of the Group’s corporate governance are contained on 
pages 32 to 35. This Corporate Governance Report forms part of 
the Directors’ Report and is incorporated into it by cross reference.
Financial risk management 
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks 
that include the effect of changes in interest rate risk, credit risk, 
liquidity risk, exchange rate risk and energy price risk. The Group 
actively seeks to limit the adverse effects of these risks on the 
financial performance of the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group has the ability to secure a substantial proportion of its 
bank loans at fixed rates via interest rate swaps. However, due to 
the current low level of debt and historically low UK LIBOR rates, 
the Group has decided not to take out any such swaps at the 
present time. This position is regularly reassessed.
Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative 
financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial 
institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers. The Group 
maintains a credit insurance policy for all its operations which 
covers a substantial portion of the Group’s trade debtors. For 
banks and financial institutions only independently rated parties 
with a strong rating are accepted.
Liquidity risk
The Group’s banking facilities are designed to ensure there are 
sufficient funds available for the current operations and the 
Group’s further development plans.
Exchange rate risk
Through its centralised treasury function the Group seeks 
to hedge its UK-based transactional foreign exchange risk 
on a rolling annual basis through the use of forward exchange 
contracts and similar hedging instruments. The Group’s principal 
UK-based foreign currency exposures are largely hedged until at 
least March 2016 based on current forecasts. In the overseas 
businesses the policy is to hedge the local transactional risk 
to the extent this is permitted and not cost prohibitive.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations 
whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translational risk. 
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure through borrowings 
denominated in the relevant foreign currencies to the extent 
that this is considered to be commercially beneficial.
Energy price risk
The Group seeks to secure a proportion of its key energy 
requirements using forward purchase contracts where 
it is believed to be necessary. 
Takeover Directive
The Company has only one class of shares, being ordinary 
shares, which have equal voting rights. The holdings of individual 
Directors are disclosed on page 57.
There are no significant agreements to which the Company 
is a party which take effect, alter or terminate in the event of 
a change of control of the Company, except for the banking 
facilities dated 21 July 2014 in respect of the £70.0m unsecured 
revolving credit facility and the £30.0m accordion facility which 
contain mandatory prepayment provisions on a change 
of control.
There are no provisions within Directors’ employment contracts 
which allow for specific termination payments upon a change 
of control.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditor
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors, 
the following applies:
(a)  so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
(b)  they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s 
auditor is aware of that information.
Independent auditor
A resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
as auditor to the Company will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Company will take place 
at 11.00am on 22 July 2015 at Mottram Hall, Wilmslow Road, 
Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire SK10 4QT. The notice convening 
that meeting, together with the resolutions to be proposed, 
appears on pages 105 to 108 of this document. The Directors 
recommend that all shareholders vote in favour of all of the 
resolutions to be proposed, as the Directors intend to do so 
in respect of their own shares, and consider that they are in the 
best interests of the Company and the shareholders as a whole.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
In respect of the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union, and the Parent Company financial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under Company law the Directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 — select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
 — make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 — state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the Group and Parent Company financial statements 
respectively; and
 — prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, 
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, 
taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and 
provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in 
Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 — the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
 — the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Report on the Group financial statements
Our opinion
In our opinion, Norcros plc’s Group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
Norcros plc’s financial statements comprise:
 — the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2015;
 — the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
 — the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
 — the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
 — the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than 
in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union.
Our audit approach
Overview
Overall Group materiality: £765,000 which represents approximately 5% of underlying profit before tax.
The Group consists of seven operating divisions, alongside its head office functions. Our audit focused on the most significant of these in terms 
of materiality to the Group financial statements. The components within the scope of our work accounted for 100% of Group revenue and 98% 
of Group underlying profit before tax.
1. Accounting for customer rebates and other trade promotional spend.
2. Defined benefit pension plan liabilities.
3. Carrying value of property, plant and equipment in South Africa.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, 
we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide 
an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this 
context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Accounting for customer rebates and other 
trade promotional spend
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies) and page 73 
(Critical accounting estimates and judgements).
As is normal industry practice, the Group has a number 
of trading agreements in place with its largest customers 
to encourage them to purchase and promote the Group’s 
products. These consist of various types of rebates and 
other trade spend commitments, which may then be subject 
to variation from time to time.
Rebates on sales are recognised as a deduction from revenue 
and are earned over the period of the contractual agreements 
with individual customers. The total amount recognised in a 
year is therefore based on the expected amount payable up 
to the balance sheet date under each customer agreement.
Promotional spend is a further deduction from revenue. 
The funding paid is recognised in the period to which it 
relates in accordance with the agreement with the customer. 
We focused on such arrangements because of the significance 
of the amounts to the Group’s gross profit, the significant 
number of transactions and agreements in place, and the 
industrywide focus on this area of accounting.
The amount to be recognised in the income statement for 
such arrangements requires the directors to apply judgement 
based on the agreements in place with each of the Group’s 
customers, together with estimates of amounts the Group 
owes where transactions span the financial year end.
The relative level of judgement in each of the categories 
of arrangements noted above is considered below:
Volume based rebates
Volume based rebates are driven by customers achieving sales 
volume targets agreed with the Group for specific products 
over a pre-determined period. There is, therefore, judgement 
involved in estimating the volume of sales, particularly where 
rebate agreements span a financial year end, which is the 
case in a large number of instances. In such instances the key 
judgement that we focused on was the estimate of the rebate 
expense accrued at year end.
Other trade promotional spend
This expense varied with regards to the nature and timing of 
the activity to which it relates, and is recognised in accordance 
with the terms agreed with customers.
It derives from a number of varying agreements and its recognition 
requires the Group to determine the extent to which the promotional 
activity has taken place and, hence, the amount payable by the 
Group. Our focus was therefore on assessing whether evidence 
of the promotional spend existed, whether the relevant promotion 
had taken place, and whether the expense recognised was 
recorded in the appropriate period.
 
Our audit work in respect of accounting for customer rebates 
and other trade promotional spend comprised a combination 
of substantive testing, controls testing, and an assessment of 
the Group’s disclosures in this area. Each element of our work 
was considered in more detail below. 
Substantive testing
We tested a sample of the underlying agreements to provide the 
core evidence to support the amount and timing of recognition 
of both customer rebates and other trade promotional spend. 
This work involved evaluating whether the amount and timing 
of recognition was consistent with the contractual arrangements.
Where such agreements spanned the year end, or where the 
agreements were on a calendar year basis and the 2015 calendar 
year agreements had not yet been agreed, we critically assessed 
the judgements taken by the directors in estimating year end 
accruals for amounts owing to customers. This work included 
the use of look back tests to assess the accuracy of the accruals 
in previous years, alongside the use of “reasonableness checks” 
around the key assumptions of rebate terms and, in the case of 
volume rebates, the level of sales likely to occur in the rebate 
period, with reference to historic events. This testing did not 
identify any evidence of bias in the directors’ judgements. 
We also analysed rebate expense and promotional expense 
recognised each month and compared them to gross sales to 
identify whether there were any unusual trends in the amounts 
or timing of rebate expense and promotional expense recognised 
in each period. Alongside this we held discussions with members 
of management within the sales teams to further understand the 
substance of these agreements and trends in the year. No unusual 
trends were identified.
Controls testing
Our controls work encompassed understanding, evaluating and 
testing key controls in respect of the recognition of customer 
rebates and other trade promotional spend. These key controls 
primarily related to the approval of rebate and recording of 
promotional agreements. We determined that we were able 
to obtain evidence from the operation of these controls for the 
purpose of our audit of whether customer rebates and other 
trade promotional spend had been recorded appropriately and 
in the correct period.
Disclosures
We read the disclosures within the financial statements in respect 
of customer rebates and other trade promotional spend and, 
based on our work, determined that they are consistent with 
accounting standards and the recent guidance on the reporting 
of complex supplier arrangements issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Defined benefit pension plan liabilities 
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies), page 73 (Critical accounting 
estimates and judgements) and note 23.
The Group has a defined benefit pension plan net liability of 
£44.3m (2014: £21.8m), which is significant in the context of both 
the overall balance sheet and the results of the Group, particularly 
given the significant movement in the valuation of the net liability in 
the current year. A major constituent of this net liability is the value 
attributed to the gross liabilities of the pension scheme.
The valuation of these gross liabilities requires significant judgement 
and expertise primarily in respect of the key assumptions which 
are used. These assumptions include both financial assumptions 
e.g. the discount rate and inflation, but also key demographic 
assumptions e.g. mortality rates. Modest changes in a number 
of these key assumptions can have a material impact on the 
calculation of the liability. We therefore focused our work 
on this area.
Pension liabilities
We obtained the external actuary’s report used in valuing the 
scheme’s liabilities and determined, using our experience of the 
valuation of similar schemes, and our pension expertise, that the 
methodologies adopted by the actuary in forming the valuation 
were consistent with industry practice and our expectations. 
We also agreed the key financial assumptions used within the 
valuation of the scheme’s liabilities, including the discount 
and inflation rates, to our internally developed benchmarks. 
We compared the assumptions around salaries increase and 
mortality to national and industry averages. The assumptions 
used within the valuation of the scheme’s liabilities were in line 
with our benchmarks and the external data.
Disclosures
We read the disclosures within the financial statements in 
respect of the defined benefit scheme and, based on our work, 
determined that they are consistent with accounting standards.
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment 
in South Africa
Refer to note 1 (Accounting policies) and page 73 
(Critical accounting estimates and judgements).
The Group holds property, plant and equipment relating to the 
manufacturing facilities held by Johnson Tiles South Africa with 
a carrying value of £5.6m as at 31 March 2015.
These manufacturing facilities have historically been loss making 
and, whilst operational improvements were achieved in prior 
years, there remained a possibility that these improvements 
would not be sustained. Given these factors, the consideration 
as to whether there had been a trigger for an impairment review 
of these assets required judgement during the year. We focused 
our work on this consideration by the directors at the balance 
sheet date.
 
We critically assessed the directors’ conclusion that no trigger 
for an impairment review existed. 
This assessment included comparing the division’s performance 
for the year against budget and the prior year. In this comparison, 
we focused on the division’s overall result, production volumes 
and other operational key performance indicators. 
We also considered whether there were external factors which may 
indicate a requirement for an impairment review and budgets for 
the year ending 31 March 2016. 
We found that the actual performance of the division during the 
year, together with the budget for 2016, supported the directors’ 
conclusion that no trigger for impairment existed. 
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
the Group operates. 
The Group is managed divisionally, with the seven operating divisions across the UK and South African operating segments, with the head 
office function incurring certain central costs on behalf of the Group. The Group’s accounting process is structured around a local finance 
function in each of these divisions. These functions maintain their own localised accounting records and controls, distinct from those 
at the head office level.
Consistent with the Group’s operations, we scoped our audit at a divisional level. The work at the operating divisions in the UK was 
performed by the UK engagement team. The work at the South African operating divisions was performed by a team based in South Africa. 
The UK team instructed the South African team to perform a full scope audit of the South African operations, and to focus their work 
on customer rebates/other trade promotional spend and the carrying value of property, plant and equipment in South Africa. A senior 
member of the UK team visited South Africa to discuss the results of the work with the South African team and to attend meetings with 
local management at which the financial results were discussed. Furthermore, the UK engagement team performed procedures over 
the Group’s consolidation of these divisions and significant consolidation entries.

Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, and consistent with last year, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £765,000 (2014: £730,000).
How we determined it Approximately 5% of underlying profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark applied We believe that profit before tax, adjusted for those items set out in note 8 to the Group 
financial statements (“underlying profit before tax”), provides us with a consistent year on year 
basis for determining materiality based on the underlying trading performance of the Group, 
but eliminating non-recurring and non-cash items.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £40,000 (2014: £25,000) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 35, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the going 
concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that 
the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we have 
concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 60, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a 
reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures 
or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Norcros plc for the year ended 31 March 2015 and on the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Consolidated statement of changes in equity
Year ended 31 March 2015 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
1. Group accounting policies
General information
Norcros plc (the Company), which is the ultimate Parent Company of the Norcros Group, is incorporated in England as a public company 
limited by shares. The shares of the Company are listed on the London Stock Exchange market of listed securities. The consolidated 
financial statements of the Group were approved by the Board on 18 June 2015.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments 
which are stated at their fair value. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by 
the European Union issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), with the interpretations issued by the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) of the IASB that are effective as of the Balance Sheet date and with those parts 
of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also 
requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree 
of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are detailed 
in the risk management section. Although these estimates are based on management‘s best knowledge of amounts, events or actions, 
actual results may differ from expectations.
Going concern
In July 2014 the Group agreed a new unsecured £70m revolving credit facility plus a £30m accordion facility with Lloyds Bank plc, 
Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. The new banking facility has been secured to July 2019. Forecasts have been prepared for the 
period to 30 September 2016 which show that the Group will be able to operate within with the terms of this facility over this period 
and will remain in compliance with banking covenants. 
At the time of approving the consolidated financial statements, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and Group 
have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, and consequently they consider that it is appropriate 
to adopt the going concern basis of preparation.
Accounting policies
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to the information presented, unless otherwise stated.
The Group has reclassified certain costs related to business combination activities in line with emerging market practice such that they are 
now presented as a separate line entitled “Acquisition related costs” in the Consolidated Income Statement. In order to effect fair comparison, 
the results for the year ended 31 March 2014 have been restated to conform to this style of presentation. The impact of the restatement 
is shown in note 29.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2015
The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 
1 April 2014.

Summary of significant accounting policies
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out as follows. These policies have been 
consistently applied to all periods presented. 
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights or otherwise has the power 
to govern the financial and operating policies. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or presently 
convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which 
the Group has the ability to exercise control, and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring them into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition, 
and where necessary, the accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are adjusted to bring them in line with those of the Group. 
Any excess of the consideration (excluding payments contingent on future employment) over the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (discount on acquisition) is credited to the Income Statement in the period of acquisition. Payments that are contingent 
on future employment are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. 
Critical estimates
The Group’s accounting policies have been set by management and approved by the Audit Committee. The application of these 
accounting policies to specific scenarios requires estimates and assumptions to be made concerning the future. These are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be 
reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Under IFRS, estimates or judgments are considered critical where they involve a significant risk or cause a material adjustment to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities from period to period. This may be because the estimate or judgment involves matters which 
are highly uncertain, or because different estimation methods or assumptions could reasonably have been used. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
1. Group accounting policies continued
Summary of significant accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation continued
Critical estimates continued
Critical judgments have been made in the following areas:
 — impairment of property, plant and equipment – the Group considers whether any triggers for impairment of property, plant and equipment 
are evident periodically, and tests for impairment of such assets should indicators of potential impairment arise. Consideration has been 
given during the year to property, plant and equipment in connection with Johnson Tiles South Africa, and it was concluded that 
no impairment triggers were present;
 — retirement benefit obligations – the present value of pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined 
on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net expense for pensions principally 
include the discount rate and rate of inflation. Any changes in these assumptions can impact the carrying amount of retirement 
benefit obligations (see note 23); 
 — deferred tax – deferred tax assets are recognised on losses and capital allowances carried forward only to the extent that it is probable they will 
be available for use against future profits and that there will be sufficient future taxable profit available against which the temporary difference 
can be utilised. In arriving at a judgment in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets, management considers the regulations applicable 
to taxation and whether there are likely to be sufficient future taxable profits. Future taxable profits may be higher or lower than estimates 
made when determining whether it is appropriate to record a tax asset and the amount to be recorded. Furthermore changes to the legislative 
framework or application of tax law may result in a management reassessment of the level of recognition of deferred tax assets; and
 — customer rebate, incentive and promotional support accruals – a number of the Group’s customers are offered rebates, incentives 
and promotional support in order to encourage trade and cement strong relationships. Accounting for such arrangements involves 
judgment as agreement periods typically run for a number of months or years, and may involve assumptions around volumes of 
product purchased or sold into the future. However, where applicable, accrual calculations are underpinned by signed contracts 
and there has historically been a strong correlation between the amounts accrued in respect of a particular period and the 
amounts subsequently paid.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services provided alongside the supply of goods 
in the ordinary course of the Group’s activities and is shown net of value added and other sales-based taxes, customer rebates, incentives, 
discounts and promotional support.
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer, which is usually 
on despatch or upon sale to a customer in the case of the Group’s retail operations.
Revenue received in respect of extended warranties is recognised over the period of the warranty.
Customer rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support
Accrual is made at each balance sheet date to reflect management’s best estimate of amounts to be paid in respect of arrangements 
in place with customers regarding rebates, incentives, discounts and promotional support. The cost of rebates, incentives, discounts 
and promotional support which have been paid or are accrued at the Balance Sheet date is shown as a deduction from revenue.
Segmental reporting
The Group operates in two main geographical areas: the UK and South Africa. All inter-segment transactions are made on an arm’s length 
basis. The chief operating decision maker (being the Board) assesses performance and allocates resources based on geography and 
accordingly segments have been determined on this basis. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on the basis of external turnover.
Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indicator of impairment. Goodwill 
is carried at cost less amortisation charged prior to the Group’s transition to IFRS on 1 April 2004 less accumulated impairment losses. 
Any impairment is recognised in the period in which it is identified. 
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible fixed assets comprise the Vado trade name recognised as a separately identifiable asset on acquisition and are valued at 
cost less accumulated amortisation. The estimated useful life of the asset is 15 years, with amortisation being charged on a straight-line basis.

Impairment of long-life assets
Property, plant and equipment, investment properties and other non-current assets are reviewed on an annual basis to determine whether 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated as either the higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use; the resultant impairment 
(the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount) is recognised as a charge in the Consolidated 
Income Statement.
The value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets and their 
eventual disposal proceeds. In order to calculate the present value of estimated future cash flows the Group uses an appropriate discount 
rate adjusted for any associated risk. Estimated future cash flows used in the impairment calculation represent management’s best view 
of likely future market conditions and current decisions on the use of each asset or asset group.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost. Cost comprises the purchase price (after deducting trade discounts and rebates) 
and any directly attributable costs. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for 
impairment in value. Impairment charges are recognised in the income statement when the carrying amount of an asset is greater than the 
estimated recoverable amount, calculated with reference to future discounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate when 
considered as part of an income-generating unit. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is provided on a straight-line basis 
to write down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition by the Group. 
The estimated useful lives of Group assets are as follows:
Buildings 25–50 years
Plant and equipment 3–15 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each Balance Sheet date.
Investment property
Investment property comprises mainly land and relates to property which is either sub-let to a third party or is not being utilised in the 
Group’s core operations. Investment property is held at cost less depreciation on buildings (land is not depreciated). Investment property 
is depreciated over 50 years.
Assets held-for-sale
Assets and disposal groups classified as held-for-sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to dispose of.
Assets and disposal groups are only classified as held-for-sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction as opposed 
to continuing use, and only when such a sale transaction is deemed highly probable. Such a sale transaction should be expected to complete 
within one year and accordingly assets and disposal groups held-for-sale are included within current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, 
with the associated liabilities included within current liabilities.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, and, where applicable, labour and overheads 
that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price 
in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses. Provisions are made for slow-moving and obsolete items.
Taxation
Current tax, which comprises UK and overseas corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Balance 
Sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits and is accounted for using the Balance Sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised and 
is charged in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income, when the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Operating leases
Annual rentals are charged/credited directly to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Provisions
Warranty provisions – provision is made for the estimated liability on products under warranty. Liability is recognised upon the sale of a product 
and is estimated using historical data.
Restructuring provisions – provision is made for costs of restructuring activities to carried out by the Group when the Group is demonstrably 
committed to incurring the cost in a future period and the cost can be reliably measured.
Property provisions – where the Group has vacated a property but is committed to a leasing arrangement, an onerous lease provision is recorded. 
This is calculated as the cost that management expects to incur over the period of the lease, which is net of any expected future sub-lease income.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount to be spent and discounted where material. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
1. Group accounting policies continued
Employee benefits
The Group operates various post-employment schemes, including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
and post-employment medical plans.
(a) Pension obligations
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating 
to employee service in the current and prior periods. A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan.
Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent 
on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined 
benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated every three 
years by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, and is subject to interim reviews in intervening years. The present 
value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality 
corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating 
to the terms of the related pension obligation.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise, net of the related deferred tax.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, 
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions 
are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash 
refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional 
on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these 
benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. 
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
(c) Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the following dates: 
(a) when the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and (b) when the entity recognises costs for a restructuring that is 
within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination benefits. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, 
the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 
twelve months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to their present value.
(d) Profit sharing and bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit 
attributable to the Company’s shareholders after certain adjustments. The Group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or 
where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are disclosed separately in accordance with the requirements of IAS 1, ‘Presentation of financial statements’. 
They include profits and losses on disposal of non-current assets outside the normal course of business, restructuring costs and large 
or significant one-off items which in management’s judgment need to be disclosed to enable the user to obtain a proper understanding 
of the Group’s financial performance.
IAS 19R administrative expenses
As a result of the implementation of IAS 19R, the administrative expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with managing the Group’s 
pension schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Acquisition related costs
Acquisition related costs includes deferred remuneration, amortisation of acquired intangibles, the costs of maintaining an internal 
acquisitions department and professional advisory fees connected with business combination activity.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Group measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received. 
Transaction costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the 
calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Income Statement over the duration of the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.

1. Group accounting policies continued
Financial assets and liabilities continued
Treasury derivatives – where deemed necessary, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is managed through the use of forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. 
Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognised immediately within finance cost/income in the Income Statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents – cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and bank overdrafts. 
Cash and cash equivalents are offset against overdrafts and borrowings when there is a legally enforceable right to do so.
Trade receivables – trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently reviewed for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of receivables. Evidence including significant financial difficulties of a debtor, probability that the debtor will 
enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation and default or delinquency in payment are considered indicators that the trade receivables are 
impaired. The amount of provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and 
the amount of loss is recognised in the income statement within administration costs. When a trade receivable is uncollectable, it is written 
off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against 
administration costs in the Income Statement.
Trade payables – trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the Balance Sheet date. 
The Group determines the fair value of its remaining financial instruments through the use of estimated discounted cash flows. 
The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swaps is calculated as the net present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their 
short-term nature. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows 
at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is charged against profits for the year in which it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised once the technical 
feasibility of a project has been established and a business plan, which demonstrates how the project will generate future economic benefits, 
has been approved.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders, or when paid if earlier.
Foreign currency transactions
Functional currency
Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency that best reflects the economic 
substance of the underlying events and circumstances relevant to that entity (the functional currency). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the parent entity.
Transactions and balances
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than functional currency are translated at rates applicable at the year end and 
trading results of overseas subsidiaries at average rates for the year. Exchange gains and losses of a trading nature are dealt with in arriving 
at operating profit. 
Translation of overseas net assets
Exchange gains and losses arising on the retranslation of overseas net assets and results are taken directly to reserves.
Share capital
Issued share capital is recorded in the Balance Sheet at nominal value with any premium at that date of issue being credited to the share 
premium account.
Treasury shares
The cost of the purchase of own shares is taken directly to reserves and is included in the treasury reserve.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined 
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting 
conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, 
if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates in two main geographical areas: the UK and South Africa. All inter-segment transactions are made on an arm’s length 
basis. The chief operating decision maker (being the Board) assesses performance and allocates resources based on geography and 
accordingly segments have been determined on this basis. Corporate costs are allocated to segments on the basis of external turnover.

Basic and diluted earnings per share
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during 
the year, excluding those held in the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares. 
At 31 March 2015 the potential dilutive ordinary shares amounted to 23,032,985 (2014: 24,374,489) as calculated in accordance with IAS 33.

Details of the terms of the APSP and SAYE scheme are disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report. A total of 27,054 shares exercised 
in respect of the SAYE schemes were issued from the holding of the Norcros Employee Benefit Trust. The remaining shares exercised were 
fulfilled by the issue of new shares (see note 24).
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and 
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. A charge of £1.3m 
was recognised in respect of share options in the period (2014: £0.9m). The Group uses a Black-Scholes pricing model to determine 
the annual charge for its share-based payments. The assumptions used in this model for each share-based payment are as follows:

During the year the Group’s Tile Africa business acquired a store in Port Elizabeth which had previously operated as a franchise for consideration 
of £0.3m, of which £0.2m was paid during the year. Net assets of £0.1m were acquired and consequently goodwill of £0.2m was recognised 
in connection with the transaction.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units (CGUs). A summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below:

£m £m
Triton Showers 19.1 19.1
Tile Africa Group 3.1 3.0
22.2 22.1
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined by a value-in-use calculation. These calculations use cash flow projections derived from 
data and metrics used on an ongoing basis, with the key assumptions being those regarding discount rates, growth rates, future gross 
margin improvements and cash flows. 
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are:
 — Cash flows before income taxes are based on approved budgets and detailed forecasts for the first five years.
 — Pre-tax discount rates of 9.0% (2014: 9.0%) in the UK and 16.25% (2014: 16.25%) in South Africa based upon the risk free rate 
for Government bonds adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities and investing in the Group’s 
specific sectors and regions.
Having applied sensitivities to the anticipated future cash flows, management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes 
in key assumptions which would result in an impairment of goodwill.

14. Investment properties continued
Investment properties were held at cost and depreciated over 50 years with the exception of land which was not depreciated. 
Rental income receivable in the year was £0.5m (2014: £0.5m).
During the year the Company completed the exit of its legacy lease and acquired the freehold interest in a property in Orgreave Drive, 
Sheffield. This property was vacated by the Company in 2008 as it was surplus to requirements and consequently was treated as an onerous 
lease. The total consideration relating to the transaction was £3.4m, of which £2.5m was in relation to the lease surrender (see note 5) 
and the balance of £0.9m relating to the property. 
In December 2014 the Company reached an agreement with Clowes Developments (UK) Ltd to dispose of its entire investment property 
portfolio for consideration of £6.5m cash. Completion occurred on 2 March 2015 resulting in a loss on disposal of £1.5m which has been 
recognised as an exceptional operating item (see note 5). As part of the agreement, the Company sold a small parcel of land with a value 
of £0.1m which had previously been included within property, plant and equipment. The Company had also incurred planning and 
development costs of £2.6m which had been reported within other receivables. Accordingly, both of these items were reclassified 
as investment property prior to the disposal taking place.

Taking into account the Group’s credit insurance, management believes that no further material provision is required for impairment of 
receivables. T rade receivable credit exposure is controlled by credit limits that are set and reviewed by operational management on a regular basis.

Amounts charged to this provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
16. Trade and other receivables continued
As of 31 March 2015, trade receivables of £0.3m (2014: £0.3m) were impaired and provided for. The individually impaired receivables

At 31 March 2015 trade receivables of £6.6m (2014: £4.2m) were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent 
customers for whom there is no recent history of default. The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows:

As noted above, the Group maintains a credit insurance policy which significantly limits its exposure to credit risk. The Group does not hold 
any collateral as security.

Capital risk management
In July 2014 the Group agreed a new unsecured £70m revolving credit facility with a £30m accordion facility with Lloyds Bank plc, 
Barclays Bank plc and HSBC Bank plc. The facility has a five year tenure and consequently expires in July 2019.
The facility provides the Group with a sound financial structure for the medium term with £44.1m of headroom being available 
at 31 March 2015 (2014: £34.1m), after taking into account net debt and ancillary facilities in use of £5.5m (2014: £4.2m). The Group has been 
in compliance with all banking covenants during the year.

20. Financial instruments
During the year the Group held financial instruments for two purposes:
 — financial instruments relating to the operations, financing and risks of the Group’s operations; and
 — financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Group’s bank debt.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and exchange rate risk. An explanation 
of these risks and how the Group manages them is set out in the Directors’ Report on page 59.
The Group’s financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash, trade receivables and payables and forward exchange contracts. Based 
on the hierarchy defined in IFRS 7, the Group’s financial instruments are classified as level 2 instruments. Consequently, fair value 
measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, 
either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 March 2015 were €19.1m and US$32.4m 
(2014: €13.2m and US$53.1m).
The hedged forecast transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various dates during the next twelve months. 
Gains and losses recognised on forward exchange contracts to date have been taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Sensitivity analysis
IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that details the effects on the Group’s profit and loss and equity of reasonably possible 
fluctuations in market rates. To demonstrate these, hypothetical variations of 1% increase or decrease in market interest rates and 5% 
strengthening or weakening in major currencies have been chosen.
(A) 1% increase or decrease on market interest rates for most of the coming year
As the Group has net debt of £14.8m (excluding amortised finance costs) the effect of a 1% change in market interest rates would 
be a change in the net finance costs of approximately £0.1m per annum.
(B) 5% strengthening or weakening in major currencies
A number of the Group’s assets are held overseas and as such variations in foreign currencies will affect the carrying value of these assets. 
A 5% strengthening of Sterling across all currencies would lead to a £1.5m devaluation in net assets. Likewise a 5% weakening in Sterling 
would lead to a £1.6m increase in net assets.
The Group’s profits and losses are exposed to both translational and transactional risk of fluctuations in foreign currency risk. The Group 
seeks to hedge the majority of its transactional risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. After taking these hedges into account the 
effect of a 5% strengthening in both Sterling and South African Rand against all other currencies would be an increase in profits of £0.5m. 
Likewise a 5% weakening in both these currencies would lead to a £0.5m reduction in profits.
21. Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014. In the 2013 Annual Budget Statement it 
was announced that the rate would reduce to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. This rate reduction was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 
and the deferred tax asset at 31 March 2015 reflects this.

23. Retirement benefit obligations
(a) Pension costs
Norcros Security Plan
The Norcros Security Plan (the “Plan”), the principal UK pension scheme of Norcros plc subsidiaries, is funded by a separate trust fund which 
operates under UK trust law and is a separate legal entity from the Company. The Plan is governed by a Trustee board which is required by 
law to act in the best interests of the Plan members and is responsible for setting policies together with the Company. The Plan exposes 
the Company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, market (investment) risk and currency risk. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015
23. Retirement benefit obligations continued
(a) Pension costs continued
Norcros Security Plan continued
It is predominantly a defined benefit scheme, with a modest element of defined contribution benefits. Norcros plc itself has no employees 
and so has no liabilities in respect of these pension schemes. The scheme closed to new members and future accrual with effect from 
1 April 2013, though active members retain a salary link. As a result of the closure a new defined contribution pension scheme was 
implemented to replace the Plan from the same date.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is approximately 16 years and can be attributed to the scheme members 
as follows:
2015
Employee members 10%
Deferred members 29%
Pensioner members 61%
Total 100%
The Plan assets do not include any investments in the Company or any property or other assets utilised by the Company. The Trustee holds 
insurance policies with various insurance companies that secure the pensions payable to specified beneficiaries. These policies remain 
assets of the Trustee but are not valued in the Plan assets or liabilities.
The Plan is funded by the Company with funding based on a separate actuarial valuation for funding purposes for which the assumptions 
may differ from the assumptions above. Funding requirements are formally set out in the Statement of Funding Principles, Schedule 
of Contributions and Recovery Plan agreed between the Trustee and the Company. Employer deficit recovery contributions in the year 
to 31 March 2016 are expected to be £2.1m.
The Plan has undertaken a number of liability management exercises during the year which have resulted in a number of benefits being 
settled and some changes to pension increases in payment. The net impact of these exercises was to reduce the net deficit by £1.7m 
which has been reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement as an exceptional operating item as follows:

Liabilities extinguished on settlements 6.8
Assets distributed on settlements (4.4)

South Africa defined benefit schemes
The Group previously operated two separate defined benefit schemes for the benefit of the Group’s South African employees. These were 
the TAL Pension Fund and the Johnson Tiles Pension Fund. Both schemes were closed during the financial year ended 31 March 2008 
and replaced by defined contribution schemes.
Defined contribution pension schemes
Contributions made to these schemes amounted to £2.6m (2014: £2.2m), which includes £0.4m (2014: £0.3m) for the provision of life 
insurance cover.
(b) IAS 19R, ‘Employee benefits’
Norcros Security Plan
The valuation used for IAS 19R disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2012 and updated by KPMG, 
a firm of qualified actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19R in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2015. 
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 March 2015.
(i) The principal assumptions used to calculate the scheme liabilities of the Norcros Security Plan under IAS 19R are:
2015 2014
Projected Projected
unit unit
Discount rate 3.30% 4.30%
Inflation rate (RPI) 2.90% 3.20%
Inflation rate (CPI) 1.90% 2.20%
Increase to deferred benefits during deferment (non-GMP liabilities) 2.83% 3.05%
Increases to pensions in payment (other than pre-1988 GMP liabilities) 2.83% 3.05%
Salary increases 2.15% 3.45%
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements. The assumptions are that 
a member who retires in 2015 at age 65 will on average live for a further 21.4 years (2014: 21.3 years) after retirement if they are male and 
23.7 years (2014: 23.6 years) if they are female. Members are assumed to take a 25% (2014: 25%) cash commutation sum on retirement.

The above sensitivities are applied to adjust the defined benefit obligation at the end of the year. Whilst the analysis does not take account of 
the full distribution of cash flows expected under the scheme, it does provide an approximation as to the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.
No changes have been made to the method and assumptions used in this analysis from those used in the previous year.

28. Discontinued operations and assets held-for-sale
On 25 March 2014, the Company entered into a conditional agreement to dispose of 100% of the issued share capital of Norcros Industry 
(Pty) Limited (NIPL), which owned its Australian tiles business, to Kim Hin Industries Berhad (KHIB). As KHIB is listed on the Malaysian Bursa, 
it required shareholder approval to allow the transaction to take place, and this was duly received allowing the disposal to be completed 
on 30 May 2014. Consequently, NIPL was classified as held-for-sale in the consolidated balance sheet at 31 March 2014 and an analysis 
of the assets held-for-sale and liabilities associated with assets held-for-sale is given in the table below.

Liabilities associated with assets held-for-sale (1.9)
Net assets held-for-sale 4.3
In accordance with IFRS 5, an impairment loss of £1.5m to remeasure the carrying value of the assets to fair value less costs to sell was 
recognised following the reclassification of the net assets of NIPL as held-for-sale in the year ended 31 March 2014. Including an estimated 
tax charge arising from the transaction of £0.1m, a total loss on disposal of £1.6m was anticipated. Following the completion of the transaction 
the Company made an actual loss on disposal of £1.5m. Taking into account the loss of £1.6m reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement 
in the year ended 31 March 2014, this means that a profit of £0.1m has been recognised in the current year. The actual loss on disposal 
is calculated as follows:

are now presented as a separate line entitled “Acquisition related costs” in the Consolidated Income Statement. In order to effect fair 
comparison, the results for the year ended 31 March 2014 have been restated to conform to this style of presentation.

Purchases of goods:
– Prism Cement Limited — 0.6
Goods are purchased from related parties on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Prism Cement Limited was classed as a related party due to the fact that one of its directors, Vijay Aggarwal, was also a Director of the 
Company, and one of its subsidiaries, Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited, owned 29.6% of the Company’s issued share capital as of 1 April 2013. 
On 11 April 2013, Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited sold 27,000,000 ordinary shares to reduce its holding in the Company to 24.97%, and 
on 18 September 2013, sold the remainder of its holding in the Company and consequently ceased to be a related party from that date. 
Additionally, Mr Aggarwal ceased to be a Director of the Company from 20 September 2013.
Prior to the divestment, dividends of £0.4m were paid to Lifestyle Investments PVT Limited.
Key management and Directors’ compensation is disclosed in note 4.
31. Post balance sheet events
On 15 May 2015 the Group announced that the contractual dispute with Optimisation Developments Limited, a subsidiary of Wm Morrison 
Supermarkets plc, regarding the conditional sale of part of its surplus land holding at Highgate, Tunstall, had been settled. The terms of the 
settlement are confidential for legal reasons, but the amount (net of costs) will be reflected in the accounts for the year to 31 March 2016 
as an exceptional operating item.
The site at Highgate, Tunstall, which had been the subject of this dispute, has subsequently been disposed of, forming part of the portfolio 
freehold property sale described in note 14.

In our opinion, Norcros plc’s parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”):
 — give a true and fair view of the state of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015;
 — have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 — have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
What we have audited
Norcros plc’s financial statements comprise:
 — the parent company balance sheet as at 31 March 2015; and
 — the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report and accounts (the “Annual Report”), rather than 
in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information
Companies Act 2006 opinion
In our opinion, the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
ISAs (UK & Ireland) reporting
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”) we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the Annual Report is:
 — materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 — apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the company acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or
 — otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 — we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 — adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 — the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 60, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for 
any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed 
by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
 — whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
 — the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and 
 — the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Norcros plc for the year ended 31 March 2015.

is set out below. 
Accounting reference date
The Company’s year end is stated as 31 March. 
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment. The Directors believe the carrying value of investments 
is supported by their underlying assets and cash flow projections derived from detailed budgets and forecasts. Dividends received from 
investments are included within turnover and recognised on receipt of the dividend.
Foreign currency transactions
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates applicable at the year end. Exchange gains 
and losses are dealt with in arriving at operating profit.
Taxation
Deferred taxation has been recognised as a liability or asset if transactions have occurred at the Balance Sheet date that give rise to an 
obligation to pay more taxation in the future or a right to pay less taxation in the future. An asset is recognised only when the transfer 
of economic benefits is more likely than not to occur. 
Profit and loss account
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company has not been presented as permitted by Section 408 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Cash flow statement
As the Group prepares consolidated financial statements, the Company is exempt from publishing a Cash Flow Statement under FRS 1 
(revised 1996).
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or when paid if earlier.
Financial assets and liabilities
Borrowings – the Company measures all borrowings initially at fair value. This is taken to be the fair value of the consideration received. 
Transaction costs (any such costs that are incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument) are included in the 
calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the Profit and Loss Account over the duration of the borrowing.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the Balance Sheet date.
Share-based payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received in 
exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by 
reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions 
are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to vest. At each Balance Sheet date, the Company revises 
its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, 
in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Related parties
Related party disclosures are made in the Group accounts under note 30.
In accordance with FRS 8, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption not to disclose transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries.
2. Other information
Other than the Directors, who receive no emoluments from the Parent Company, the Company has no employees. Details of the Directors’ 
emoluments can be found in note 4 of the Group accounts.

taps, tiles and adhesives.
The Directors believe that the carrying value of investments is supported by their underlying net assets.
Details of the principal operating subsidiaries indirectly owned by the Company are shown in note 32 of the Group accounts.

1. To receive the audited accounts and the auditor’s and Directors’ reports for the year ended 31 March 2015.

10. To authorise the Directors to determine the auditor’s remuneration.
11.   That, subject to and conditional upon admission of the New Ordinary Shares (as defined in this resolution) to the Official List of the 
United Kingdom Listing Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market for listed securities becoming effective, 
every ten ordinary shares of £0.01 each in the capital of the Company (each an Existing Ordinary Share) be consolidated into one ordinary 
share of £0.10 each (each a New Ordinary Share), at such time and date (if any) as the Board of Directors of the Company (Board) may, 
in its absolute discretion, determine (such time and date being no later than the first anniversary of the date on which this resolution 11 
is passed), with such New Ordinary Shares having the same rights as the Existing Ordinary Shares, provided that if, as a result of such 
consolidation of shares, fractions of shares become attributable to members, the Board may on behalf of those members deal with 
the fractions as it thinks fit, including (without limitation) in either (or both) of the ways prescribed in the Articles of Association 
of the Company (Articles) as set out below:
 (a)  the Board may sell shares representing the fractions, through a member of the London Stock Exchange or other appropriate 
intermediary acting (in any case) on a “best execution” (or equivalent) basis or in such other manner (whether or not through an 
intermediary) that provides a price which the Board considers to be reasonable in the circumstances, to any person (including, 
subject to the statutes (as defined in the Articles) and, without limitation, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale 
(after deducting the expenses of sale) in due proportion amongst the persons to whom such fractions are attributable (except 
that if the amount due to a person is less than £1.00, or such other sum as the Board may decide, the Company may retain 
such sum for its own benefit). To give effect to such sale the Board may:
  (i)  in the case of certificated shares, authorise a person to execute an instrument of transfer of shares to the purchaser 
or as the purchaser may direct, or
  (ii)  in the case of uncertificated shares, exercise any power conferred on it by article 15.9 of the Articles to effect a transfer 
of the shares;
   The purchaser will not be bound to see to the application of the purchase monies in respect of any such sale. The title of the 
transferee to the shares will not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings connected with the sale or 
transfer. Any instrument or exercise referred to in this resolution 11 shall be effective as if it had been executed or exercised 
by the holder of the shares to which it relates; and/or
 (b)  in relation to the fractions the Board may issue, subject to the statutes (as defined in the Articles), to a member credited as fully 
paid by way of capitalisation the minimum number of shares required to round up his holding of shares to a number which, following 
the consolidation, leaves a whole number of shares (such issue being deemed to have been effected immediately before the 
consolidation). The amount required to pay up those shares may be capitalised as the Board thinks fit out of amounts standing 
to the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company (including any share premium account, capital redemption reserve and profit 
and loss account), whether or not available for distribution, and applied in paying up in full the appropriate number of shares.
12.  That the Directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised pursuant to Section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 
to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security 
into such shares (Allotment Rights), but so that:
 (a)  the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted or made the subject of Allotment Rights under this authority are shares 
with an aggregate nominal value of £3,981,159 of which:
  (i) one half may be allotted or made the subject of Allotment Rights in any circumstances; and
  (ii)  the other half may be allotted or made the subject of Allotment Rights pursuant to any rights issue (as referred to in the 
Financial Conduct Authority’s listing rules) or pursuant to any arrangements made for the placing or underwriting or other 
allocation of any shares or other securities included in, but not taken up under, such rights issue;

Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
 (b)  this authority shall expire 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, on the conclusion of the Company’s 
next Annual General Meeting;
 (c)  the Company may make any offer or agreement before such expiry which would or might require shares to be allotted 
or Allotment Rights to be granted after such expiry; and
 (d)  all authorities vested in the Directors on the date of the notice of this Annual General Meeting to allot shares or to grant Allotment 
Rights that remain unexercised at the commencement of this meeting are revoked.
13.  That the Directors be and are hereby empowered pursuant to Section 570 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot equity securities, as 
defined in Section 560 of that Act, pursuant to the authority conferred on them by resolution 12 in the notice of this Annual General 
Meeting or by way of a sale of treasury shares as if Section 561 of that Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this power 
is limited to:
 (a)  the allotment of equity securities in connection with any rights issue or open offer (each as referred to in the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s listing rules) or any other pre-emptive offer that is open for acceptance for a period determined by the Directors 
to the holders of ordinary shares on the register on any fixed record date in proportion to their holdings of ordinary shares 
(and, if applicable, to the holders of any other class of equity security in accordance with the rights attached to such class), subject 
in each case to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or appropriate in relation to fractions 
of such securities, the use of more than one currency for making payments in respect of such offer, any such shares or other 
securities being represented by depositary receipts, treasury shares, any legal or practical problems in relation to any territory 
or the requirements of any regulatory body or any stock exchange; and
 (b) the allotment of equity securities (other than pursuant to paragraph (a) above) with an aggregate nominal value of £597,174, 
  and shall expire when the authority conferred on the Directors by resolution 12 in the notice of this Annual General Meeting expires, 
save that, before the expiry of this power, the Company may make any offer or agreement which would or might require equity 
securities to be allotted after such expiry. 
14.  The Company is generally and unconditionally authorised pursuant to Section 701 of the Companies Act 2006 to make market 
purchases (as defined in Section 693 of that Act) of (i) ordinary shares of £0.10 in its capital where resolution 11 is passed and 
the consolidation of shares authorised thereby occurs; or otherwise (ii) ordinary shares of £0.01 each in its capital provided that:
 (a)  the maximum aggregate number of such shares that may be acquired under this authority is 5,971,740 £0.10 shares where 
resolution 11 is passed and the consolidation of shares authorised thereby occurs; or otherwise 59,717,400 £0.01 shares;
 (b) the minimum price (exclusive of expenses) that may be paid for such a share is its nominal value;
 (c)  the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) that may be paid for such a share is the maximum price permitted under the Financial 
Conduct Authority’s listing rules or, in the case of a tender offer (as referred to in those rules), five per cent above the average of 
the middle market quotations for an ordinary share (as derived from the Daily Official List of London Stock Exchange plc) for the 
five business days immediately preceding the date on which the terms of the tender offer are announced;
 (d)  this authority shall expire 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, on the conclusion of the Company’s next 
Annual General Meeting; and
 (e)  before such expiry, the Company may enter into a contract to purchase shares that would or might require a purchase 
to be completed after such expiry.
15.  That any general meeting of the Company that is not an Annual General Meeting may be convened by not less than 14 clear 
days’ notice.

is required to change its accounting framework for its Parent Company financial statements, which is currently UK GAAP, for its financial 
year commencing 1 April 2015. The Company intends to adopt Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced disclosure framework’ for

Notes
1.  A member who is entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is entitled to appoint another person, or two or more persons in respect 
of different shares held by him, as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote at the meeting.
2.  The right of a member of the Company to vote at the meeting will be determined by reference to the register of members. 
A member must be registered on that register as the holder of ordinary shares of 1p each (“ordinary shares”) by 6.00pm on 20 July 2015 
in order to be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting as a member in respect of those shares. 
3.  A member wishing to attend and vote at the meeting in person should arrive prior to the time fixed for its commencement. 
A member that is a corporation can only attend and vote at the meeting in person through one or more representatives appointed in 
accordance with Section 323 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended. Any such representative should bring to the meeting written 
evidence of his appointment, such as a certified copy of a board resolution of, or a letter from, the corporation concerned confirming 
the appointment. Any member wishing to vote at the meeting without attending in person or (in the case of a corporation) through its 
duly appointed representative must appoint a proxy to do so. Forms for the appointment of a proxy that can be used for this purpose 
have been provided to members with this Notice of Annual General Meeting. To be valid, a proxy appointment form must be completed 
in accordance with the instructions that accompany it and then be delivered (together with any power of attorney or other authority 
under which it is signed, or a certified copy of such item) to Capita Asset Services (“Capita”), PXS at The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, 
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU so as to be received by 11.00am on 20 July 2015. Alternatively, a member may appoint a proxy online by 
following the instructions for the electronic appointment of a proxy at www.capitashareportal.com. If you have not previously registered to 
use this facility you will require your investor code which can be located on the enclosed proxy form. In order to be a valid proxy 
appointment, the member’s electronic message confirming the details of the appointment completed in accordance with those 
instructions must be transmitted so as to be received by the same time. Members who hold their shares in uncertificated form may 
also use the CREST voting service to appoint a proxy electronically, as explained below. Appointing a proxy will not prevent a member 
from attending and voting in person at the meeting should he so wish.
4.  Any person to whom this notice is sent who is currently nominated by a member of the Company to enjoy information rights under 
Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, (a “nominated person”) may have a right under an agreement between him and 
that member to be appointed, or to have someone else appointed, as a proxy for the meeting. If a nominated person has no such right 
or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member concerned as to the 
exercise of voting rights. The statement in note 1 above of the rights of a member in relation to the appointment of proxies does not 
apply to a nominated person. Such rights can only be exercised by the member concerned. 
5.  Voting on all resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll, rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting 
as members’ votes are counted according to the number of ordinary shares held. As soon as practicable following the meeting, the 
results of the voting at the meeting and the numbers of proxy votes cast for and against, together with the number of votes actively 
withheld in respect of, each of the resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and will also be placed on the 
Company’s website: www.norcros.com. 
6.  As at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document), (i) the Company’s issued share capital 
consisted of 597,173,935 ordinary shares carrying one vote each and (ii) the total voting rights in the Company were 597,173,935. 
7.  Each member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting which, 
in accordance with Section 319A of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, and subject to some exceptions, the Company must cause 
to be answered. Information relating to the meeting which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006, as amended, to 
publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at www.norcros.com. A member may not use any electronic address 
provided by the Company in this document or with any proxy appointment form or in any website for communicating with the 
Company for any purpose in relation to the meeting other than as expressly stated in it.
8.  It is possible that, pursuant to members’ requests made in accordance with Section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, as amended, 
the Company will be required to publish on a website a statement in accordance with Section 528 of that Act setting out any matter 
that the members concerned propose to raise at the meeting relating to the audit of the Company’s latest audited accounts. 
The Company cannot require the members concerned to pay its expenses in complying with those sections. The Company must 
forward any such statement to its auditor by the time it makes the statement available on the website. The business that may 
be dealt with at the meeting includes any such statement.

Notes continued
9.  CREST members who wish to appoint one or more proxies through the CREST system may do so by using the procedures described 
in the CREST voting service section of the CREST manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those 
CREST members who have appointed one or more voting service providers, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or a proxy instruction 
made using the CREST voting service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a “CREST proxy appointment instruction”) must 
be properly authenticated in accordance with the specifications of CREST’s operator, Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“Euroclear”) and 
must contain all the relevant information required by the CREST manual. To be valid, the message (regardless of whether it constitutes 
the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must be transmitted so as 
to be received by Capita (ID: RA10), as the Company’s “issuer’s agent”, by 11.00am on 20 July 2015. After this time, any change of instruction 
to a proxy appointed through the CREST system should be communicated to the appointee through other means. The time of the 
message’s receipt will be taken to be when (as determined by the timestamp applied by the CREST Applications Host) Capita is first 
able to retrieve it by enquiry through the CREST system in the prescribed manner. Euroclear does not make available special procedures 
in the CREST system for transmitting any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations apply in relation to the input of 
CREST proxy appointment instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is 
a CREST personal member or a CREST sponsored member or has appointed any voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST 
sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as is necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the 
CREST system by any particular time. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) 
should take into account the provisions of the CREST manual concerning timings as well as its section on “Practical limitations 
of the system”. In certain circumstances, the Company may, in accordance with the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 
or the CREST manual, treat a CREST proxy appointment instruction as invalid. 
10.  The Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication which it sends 
but does not accept responsibility for any loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachment sent by the Company. 
The Company recommends that members subject all emails and attachments to virus checking procedures prior to opening or use. 
Any electronic communication received by the Company or Capita (including the lodgement of an electronic proxy form) which 
is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.
11.  Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of appointment will be available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company during normal business hours each business day and at the place of the Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes 
prior to and during the meeting.
12.  Information regarding this meeting, including information required by Section 311A of the Companies Act 2006, is available 
at www.norcros.com.

Resolution 9
Re-appointment of auditor
The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting before which accounts are laid, to hold office until the end of the next 
such meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has indicated that it is willing to continue as the Company’s auditor for another year. You are 
therefore asked to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Directors recommend the re-appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Resolution 10
Remuneration of auditor
The resolution follows best practice in giving authority to the Directors to determine the remuneration of the Company’s auditor.
Resolution 11
Share consolidation
Background 
The Company has a large number of ordinary shares in issue. The share consolidation is based on every ten existing ordinary shares of 
£0.01 each (Existing Ordinary Shares) being consolidated into an ordinary share of £0.10 (a New Ordinary Share) with the intention that, 
following the share consolidation, the number of shares in issue will be more appropriate for a company of Norcros’s size in the UK market. 
The share consolidation may also help to make the Company’s shares more attractive to investors and may result in a narrowing 
of the bid/offer spread, thereby improving liquidity.
Effect of the Share Consolidation
Following the share consolidation, shareholders will still hold the same proportion of the Company’s ordinary share capital as before the 
share consolidation (save in respect of fractional entitlements). Other than a change in nominal value, the New Ordinary Shares will carry 
equivalent rights under the Articles of Association of the Company to the Existing Ordinary Shares.
Application will be made to the UK Listing Authority for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to the Official List and to trading 
on London Stock Exchange plc’s main market.
If an individual shareholding is not exactly divisible by 10, the share consolidation will generate an entitlement to a fraction of a New Ordinary 
Share. Fractions of New Ordinary Shares will be aggregated and sold for the best price reasonably obtainable on behalf of the shareholders 
entitled to the fractions. The net proceeds of the sale, after the deduction of the expenses of the sale, will be distributed in due proportion 
among the relevant shareholders, except that any individual entitlement of £1.00 or less may be retained by the Company for its benefit. 
Only shareholders with a holding of Existing Ordinary Shares that are not exactly divisible by 10 will be left with an entitlement to a fraction 
of a New Ordinary Share.
Shareholders who hold fewer than 10 Existing Ordinary Shares will still have their shareholding consolidated and their shareholding 
will be dealt with in accordance with the procedure for fractional entitlements to New Ordinary Shares.
For purely illustrative purposes, examples of the likely effect of the share consolidation are set out below:
Number of Existing Ordinary Shares Number of New Ordinary Shares
6 0
10 1
15 1
20 2
28 2
30 3
79 7
100 10
Following the share consolidation and assuming no further shares are issued between the date of this document and the share consolidation 
becoming effective, the Company’s issued ordinary share capital will comprise of 59,717,393 New Ordinary Shares. No change in the total 
nominal value of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital will occur; it will still be approximately £5,971,739.
If the share consolidation is approved, it is proposed that it will become effective on such future date (if any) as the Directors may in their 
sole discretion, determine. It is expected that if the Directors exercise this power in the future, dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will 
commence at 8.00am on the first business day after that exercise and that new share certificates, replacing those relating to Existing 
Ordinary Shares, will be dispatched to Shareholders who hold their Existing Ordinary Shares in certificated form shortly thereafter. The new 
share certificates would be sent by pre-paid first class post, at the risk of the relevant holder of ordinary shares, to the registered address 
of that holder or, in the case of joint holders, to the one whose name appears first in the register of members.
Share certificates for Existing Ordinary Shares would no longer be valid and would need to be destroyed once the new documentation 
is received. Until a holder of certificated ordinary shares receives a new share certificate, transfers of certificated ordinary shares will be 
certified against the register of members. Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2015

Resolution 11 continued
Share consolidation continued
Effect of the Share Consolidation continued
Shareholders who hold their entitlement to New Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form through CREST would have their New Ordinary Shares 
arising as a result of the share consolidation credited to their CREST accounts in respect of Existing Ordinary Shares held in uncertificated form.
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY THEIR SHARE CERTIFICATES FOR THEIR EXISTING ORDINARY SHARES UNTIL THEY HAVE 
RECEIVED NEW SHARE CERTIFICATES FOR THE NEW ORDINARY SHARES.
Share schemes
As a result of the share consolidation, existing awards granted under the Norcros plc 2011 Deferred Bonus Plan, the Norcros plc 2011 
Performance Share Plan and the Norcros plc SAYE Scheme will need to be adjusted to account for the change to the share capital. 
These adjustments will not have an adverse impact on the participants in any of these plans and it is anticipated that the adjustments 
will be made by the Company shortly after the share consolidation takes effect.
Taxation
The following summary is intended as a general guide only and is based on current UK tax law and HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 
practice as at the date of this document. It relates only to certain limited aspects of the UK taxation treatment of the share consolidation 
for shareholders who are individual residents in the UK for tax purposes, who are the absolute beneficial owners of their ordinary shares 
and who hold them as investments. Shareholders who are in any doubt about their tax position, or who are subject to tax in any 
jurisdictions other than the UK, should take appropriate independent advice without delay.
It is expected that for the purposes of UK taxation on chargeable gains the share consolidation will be treated as follows:
(a)  The New Ordinary Shares arising from the share consolidation will result from a reorganisation of the share capital of the Company. 
Accordingly, to the extent that a shareholder receives New Ordinary Shares, the shareholder will not generally be treated as making a 
disposal of all or part of his or her holding of Existing Ordinary Shares by reason of the share consolidation being implemented, and the 
New Ordinary Shares which replace a shareholder’s Existing Ordinary Shares as a result of the share consolidation (the new holding) 
will be treated as the same asset acquired at the same time as the shareholder’s holding of Existing Ordinary Shares was acquired;
(b)  To the extent that a shareholder receives cash by virtue of a sale on his or her behalf of any New Ordinary Shares to which he or she has 
a fractional entitlement, the shareholder will not, in practice, normally be treated as making a part disposal of his or her holding of Existing 
Ordinary Shares, the proceeds instead being deducted from the base cost of the shareholder’s new holding. This treatment applies where 
the cash received is ‘small’ as compared with the value of the shares in respect of which it is made. For this purpose HMRC regard 
‘small’ as meaning 5% or less and additionally regard an amount of £3,000 or less as ‘small’, regardless of whether or not it would 
pass the 5% test. In addition, if those proceeds exceed that base cost, however, the shareholder will be treated as disposing of part 
or all of his or her holding of Existing Ordinary Shares and will be subject to tax in respect of any chargeable gains thereby realised; and
(c)  On a subsequent disposal of the whole or part of the New Ordinary Shares comprised in the holding, a shareholder may, depending 
on his or her circumstances, have a tax liability on the amount of chargeable gain realised.
Resolution 12
Power to allot shares
Most listed companies renew their directors’ authority to issue shares at each Annual General Meeting. Such an authority was granted at last 
year’s Annual General Meeting and is due to expire on 23 January 2016 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting 
of the Company. In accordance with best practice, this resolution seeks to renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares.
Resolution 12, if passed, will renew the Directors’ authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum aggregate nominal 
value of £3,981,159 (representing 39,811,590 ordinary shares of £0.10 if resolution 11 is passed and put into effect or 398,115,900 ordinary shares 
if £0.01 if it is not). This represents the Association of British Insurers’ guideline limit of approximately two thirds of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document). Of this amount, 
ordinary shares to an aggregate nominal value of £1,990,579.50 (representing 19,905,795 ordinary shares of £0.10 if resolution 11 is passed 
and put into effect or 199,057,950 ordinary shares of £0.01 if it is not) which is approximately one third of the Company’s issued ordinary share 
capital as at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)), can only be allotted pursuant 
to a rights issue.
As at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares in the 
Company in treasury. The renewed authority will remain in force until 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting in 2016.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority. The purpose of giving the Directors this authority is to maintain 
the Company’s flexibility to take advantage of any appropriate opportunities that may arise.

Resolution 13
Disapplication of pre-emption rights
The Directors are currently authorised, subject to certain limitations, to issue securities of the Company for cash without first offering them 
to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. That authority will expire on 23 January 2016 or, if earlier, at the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and, in accordance with best practice, this resolution (which will be proposed as a special 
resolution) seeks to renew the Directors’ authority to disapply pre-emption rights. 
Other than in connection with a rights or other similar issue or where, for example, difficulties arise in offering shares to certain overseas 
shareholders and in relation to fractional entitlements, the authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value 
of £597,174. This aggregate nominal amount equates to approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 17 June 2015 
(being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice of Annual General Meeting). This resolution follows guidance from the 
Pre-Emption Group’s revised Statement of Principles, published on 12 March 2015. Such principles provide the Company with greater flexibility 
to undertake non pre-emptive issuances in connection with acquisitions and specified investments. In line with the revised Statement of Principles, 
the Company is seeking authority to issue up to 10% of its issued ordinary share capital for cash without pre-emption rights applying. The Company 
confirms that it will only allot shares with a nominal value in excess of £298,587 (representing 5% of issued ordinary share capital) pursuant to 
this resolution where that allotment is in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment (within the meaning given in the 
Statement of Principles) which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month 
period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment. The renewed authority will remain in force until 18 months after the passing 
of this resolution or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2016.
In accordance with the Statement of Principles on disapplying pre-emption rights issued by the Pre-Emption Group (which is supported by 
the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds Limited and The Investment Association), the Board confirms its 
intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital will be issued for cash on a non pre-emptive basis during any rolling three year period.
Resolution 14
Authority to purchase own shares
This resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, is a resolution which the Company proposes to seek on an annual basis, 
in line with other listed companies in the UK, to give the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted 
by the Companies Act 2006. The authority limits the number of shares that could be purchased to an aggregate maximum of 5,971,740 
ordinary shares of £0.10 if resolution 11 is passed and implemented or 59,717,400 ordinary shares of £0.01 if it is not, which, in each case, 
have an aggregate nominal value of £597,174 (representing approximately 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)) and sets minimum 
and maximum prices. The renewed authority will remain in force until 18 months after the passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the 
conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting in 2016.
The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares, but will keep the matter 
under review, taking into account other investment opportunities. The authority will be exercised only if the Directors believe that to do 
so would result in an increase in earnings per share and would promote the success of the Company and be in the best interests of its 
shareholders generally. To the extent that any shares so purchased are held in treasury (see below), earnings per share will be enhanced 
until such time, if any, as such shares are resold or transferred out of treasury.
Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases through the London Stock Exchange. If any shares are 
purchased, they will be either cancelled or held in treasury. Any such decision will be made by the Directors at the time of purchase 
on the basis of the shareholders’ best interests. Shares held in treasury can be cancelled, sold for cash or, in appropriate circumstances, 
used to meet obligations under employee share schemes. Any shares held in treasury would not be eligible to vote nor would any dividend 
be paid on any such shares. If any ordinary shares purchased pursuant to this authority are not held by the Company as treasury shares, 
then such shares would be immediately cancelled, in which event the number of ordinary shares in issue would be reduced.
The Directors believe that it is desirable for the Company to have this choice. Holding the repurchased shares as treasury shares gives the 
Company the ability to re-issue them quickly and cost effectively and provides the Company with additional flexibility in the management 
of its capital base. 
As at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document), there were warrants and options over 
33,585,444 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, which represent, in aggregate, approximately 5.62% of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares was exercised in full, these options and warrants would 
represent approximately 6.25% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. As at 17 June 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to the publication of this document), the Company did not hold any shares in treasury.
Resolution 15
Notice of general meeting
This special resolution is required in order to preserve the ability of the Company to convene general meetings (other than Annual General 
Meetings) of the Company on not less than 14 clear days’ notice, rather than on not less than the 21 days’ notice which would otherwise 
be required. In order to preserve this ability, the Company’s shareholders must have approved the calling of such meetings on not less than 
14 clear days’ notice. Resolution 15 seeks such approval. 
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for general meetings, but only where the flexibility is merited 
by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of the shareholders as a whole.
The approval will be effective until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution 
will be proposed. The Company will also need to meet the requirements for electronic proxy submission under the Companies 
(Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009 before it can call a general meeting on such notice.

Wolseley has begun to emerge from the extremely 
difﬁcult market environment of the last three years. 
Through tough actions and a new strategic approach, 
the business is well positioned to exploit the 
opportunities that lie ahead.

  Trading proﬁt, a term used throughout the Annual Report, 
is deﬁned as operating proﬁt before exceptional items 
and the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets. 
See note 12 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 
a reconciliation from operating proﬁt to trading proﬁt.
Highlights of the year
Markets stabilising
In 2010 revenue was down 9 per cent 
to £13,203 million. There was a gradual 
stabilisation of our markets, with RMI 
segments generally holding up better than 
the more volatile new residential segments. 
This led to a strong second half and like- 
for-like revenue growth in the fourth quarter.
Lower cost base
Since the start of the recession we have 
taken action to lower the cost base, 
as revenues decreased. Operating costs 
in the year to 31 July 2010, were reduced 
by a further £353 million or 10 per cent.
Resource allocation completed 
In March 2010 we announced our intention 
to focus future growth on those Wolseley 
businesses where we have built substantial 
scale, leading market positions and 
excellent customer franchises. We have 
completed our plans for this year.
Improved trading proﬁt
1
Despite a decrease in revenue of 9 per cent, 
actions to protect gross margins and the 
beneﬁt of a lower cost base enabled 
the Group to increase trading proﬁt to 
£450 million (2009: £447 million).
Exited underperforming 
businesses
During the year the Group has exited 
from several businesses. This included  
our businesses in Ireland, the French 
Public Works business and our  
plumbing and heating activities in  
the Czech Republic,  
Belgium and Slovakia.
Net debt reduced
The Group continues to place a high 
degree of emphasis on cash generation. 
Continued working capital discipline and 
management actions to conserve cash 
and capital expenditure meant that our 
net debt at 31 July 2010, was reduced 
by £613 million to £346 million (2009: 
£959 million).

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In my last year as Chairman I am delighted 
to report that as we begin to emerge from 
the extremely difﬁcult market environment of 
the last three years, your Company is well 
positioned to exploit the opportunities that lie 
ahead. The organisation looks to the future 
with increasing conﬁdence and an enthusiasm 
to develop our strong local market positions 
working from the foundation of a low cost base 
and strong, focused leadership. Last year was 
again difﬁcult, starting with a weak declining 
market which has only begun to show signs 
of stability, and in some cases recovery, in the 
last few months.
Group results
This is clearly reﬂected in the results for the year 
with Group revenue for the 12 months to 31 July 
2010, down 9 per cent to £13.2 billion, and 
earnings per share before exceptional items 
and amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles down 22 per cent to 74.1 pence. 
We have continued to manage the cost base 
actively to minimise the effects of the recession 
on the Group’s results and during the year 
headcount was reduced by a further 3,400 and 
220 branches were closed. We have also taken 
ﬁrm action to exit those businesses where we 
do not see future value creation potential.
We continue to place a high degree of emphasis 
on cash generation and, in particular, driving 
improvements in working capital. This is 
reﬂected in a strong free cash ﬂow performance 
of £660 million (2009: £851 million). Our net 
debt position at 31 July 2010 improved by 
£613 million to £346 million.
Further, I am pleased to report that Wolseley 
exits the ﬁnancial year in a strong position in 
terms of its balance sheet, its assets and its 
people. That strength is in no small part due to 
the period of critical self-examination we have 
undergone as a business this year. The resulting 
strategy crafted by our new Chief Executive, 
Ian Meakins and his team, endorsed by the 
Board, is already bearing fruit and has put 
us in a much stronger position to weather the 
remainder of the recession and look forward 
to the future with great optimism. 
Ian got to grips with the business very quickly. 
He spent time reviewing the management 
structure and the future planning required to 
take the Company forward. He has drive and 
energy and a passion for operational excellence 
and delivery. It is through his leadership that I 
see a new conﬁdence in our people. The Board 
is fully supportive of Ian’s approach of focusing 
future growth on those Wolseley businesses 
where we have built sufﬁcient scale, leading 
market positions and an excellent product 
offering. He has also introduced greater rigour 
in how we drive performance improvement and 
the execution of strategy at the business unit 
level, which will serve us well in the future. 
This approach is set out by Ian in his review 
on pages 4 to 5.
Redomicile to Switzerland
In September, we announced a proposal to 
change the corporate structure of the Group. 
This will create a new holding company which 
is UK-listed, incorporated in Jersey with its tax 
residence in Switzerland. I want to emphasise 
that this proposal will not make any substantive 
change to corporate governance or to any 
existing investor protection measures, nor 
will it have any adverse tax implications 
for shareholders. It does not change Wolseley’s 
business strategy, or the day-to-day conduct of 
our businesses, including in the UK. In addition, 
the tax position of the UK businesses will remain 
unchanged.
The organisation looks to the future with increasing 
conﬁdence and an enthusiasm to develop our strong 
local market positions working from the foundation  
of a low cost base and strong, focused leadership.

However, the proposed move is intended to 
provide a more stable tax regime for our 
international business and the Board feels 
strongly that it would be delinquent in its duty to 
shareholders if it ignored the strong business 
case for redomiciling and thereby keeping the 
Group’s effective tax rate competitive. As I write, 
I am conscious of the new coalition Government’s 
publicly stated desire to simplify UK tax law as 
it applies to multinational corporations such as 
Wolseley, and naturally the Board will keep this 
under review.
Governance
As we do each year, the Board reviewed its 
effectiveness and the overall strength of the 
governance and controls framework of the 
Company. It took the opportunity to streamline 
and verify some of the Company’s policies 
and procedures and to refocus its time and 
attention on material strategic and operational 
improvements designed to further improve the 
efﬁciency of decision-making.
Dividend
The Board understands the importance of the 
dividend to investors and we have announced 
our intention to resume paying a dividend during 
the 2011 ﬁnancial year.
Board changes
In March, Steve Webster stepped down as 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) and John Martin 
was appointed by the Board as his successor 
in April. John brings a wealth of operational 
experience from Travelex Group and Hays plc 
and is already showing himself as a highly 
capable CFO. I am conﬁdent his experience  
will be of great beneﬁt to Wolseley. 
Rob Marchbank, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, 
Europe, left the Company in March following the 
reorganisation of our European businesses. 
I would like to take this opportunity to wish both 
Steve and Rob well and thank them for their 
signiﬁcant contribution to the success of the 
Company. 
As previously announced, Jim Murray, Non 
Executive Director and former Chairman of the 
Audit Committee will retire from the Board on  
30 September. I wish him well in his retirement.
Now I come to my own retirement. I do this with 
great sadness because it has been a privilege to 
be associated with this very special Company. 
However, after nearly 13 years on the Board, 
including eight as Chairman, and now with 
a new Executive team in place with a clear 
strategy to deliver future proﬁtable growth, 
it seems right to hand over to someone else. 
I do so knowing that my successor, Gareth Davis, 
was an outstanding CEO of some 14 years’ 
standing at Imperial Tobacco plc, is well 
respected in the City and has a strong track 
record of creating value. 
Wolseley today is now a very different Company 
to the one I ﬁrst chaired, and is well placed to 
continue to enjoy an exciting and proﬁtable 
future. I wish everyone at the Company the very 
best and thank you all for your support during 
the last eight years as your Chairman.
Finally I would, of course, like to pay tribute 
to Wolseley’s 47 ,000 people who work in 
25 countries around the world. As a service 
business we are wholly dependent on their 
skills and imagination to service our customers 
every day.
John Whybrow
Chairman 04 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Our objective is to maximise shareholder value through 
delivering proﬁtable growth in our chosen markets.
Operations, processes and people
A year ago I outlined in this review what I felt 
were the inherent strengths of the Wolseley 
business I had just joined. During the past 
12 months, I have undertaken a thorough 
evaluation of our operations and processes. 
Everything I have seen has reinforced my view 
that this is essentially a great business with a 
fundamentally sound business model. We have 
strong market leading positions in our core 
markets. The quality of our front line people and 
their dedication to our customers is impressive. 
We have built signiﬁcant businesses over time 
and in many geographies, which have good 
records of serving our customers well, backed 
by strong relationships with key vendors, 
talented people and an efﬁcient operating 
model. These factors should enable us to 
leverage our scale and expertise to generate 
organic growth in the future. It is also testament 
to the strength of the business model that 
over many years gross margins have remained 
broadly consistent, even during the recent 
deep recession. 
Business strategy
Between July 2009 and March 2010 the 
Company’s Executive Committee developed 
an operating framework to deliver sustainable 
and proﬁtable growth (see diagram opposite). 
Our approach is based on a top down resource 
allocation process, to allow us to choose which 
businesses will give us the best returns in the 
long term. In addition, we have also developed 
bottom up detailed business unit strategies to 
make sure we invest in the right projects and 
plans to deliver our future growth at a local level. 
To assist this I have dismantled the divisional 
structure around North America and Europe so 
that we have greater visibility of the underlying 
performance of local businesses. New monthly 
reporting processes and regular business 
reviews with country management teams 
ensure that all of us are focused on the 
right priorities.
Our objective for each business unit strategy 
is to grow proﬁtably faster than our competition. 
Our business is local in the sense that the 
majority of our 1 million customers travel less 
than 20 miles to reach a branch. Our aim is 
therefore to gain a greater share of our existing 
customers’ business in every branch and to 
gain new customers by providing them with 
the best local customer service, delivered by 
the best branch staff in the industry and by 
partnering with the key vendors in the industry. 
Underpinning this we want to operate a low cost 
efﬁcient operating model, which ensures we are 
competitive and can attract favourable terms 
from our vendors. 
We have now completed the top down resource 
allocation process, so we are clear which 
business units we want to drive for faster growth 
– in short, those where we believe we can win, 
versus the competition. We’re now building and 
executing the individual business unit strategies 
and three year plans. I believe that the progress 
we have made this year, which you can read 
about on pages 6 to 9, represents a decent 
start and there is still much to be done.
Overview of performance
During the year Wolseley experienced a 
gradual stabilisation in its markets. The repair, 
maintenance and improvement (“RMI”) 
segment has held up better than the new 
construction markets and many of our 
customers have changed their focus to the 
RMI markets. However, the new construction 
markets remain weak, especially in the 
US, and commercial markets in particular 
remain depressed. This relative stabilisation 
of our markets led to a decent second half 
performance and a return to modest like-for-like 
growth in the ﬁnal quarter. We also focused on 
protecting gross margins and carefully managing 
the cost base. Revenue of £13,203 million was 
9 per cent below last year, though the decline 
was restricted to 6 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis. The gross margin at 27.7 per cent was 
consistent with last year and we continue to 
focus on improving customer and product mix.

Other information
Trading proﬁt of £450 million was £3 million 
ahead of last year, despite the revenue decline 
and was achieved as the result of the improved 
cost base. Operating costs in the year excluding 
exceptional items were reduced by £353 million 
(or 10 per cent).
During the year we continued to manage the 
balance sheet conservatively. Cash was tightly 
controlled, but not at the expense of damaging 
customer service, and capital expenditure was 
reduced to £84 million (2009: £157 million). 
We continue to place a great deal of emphasis 
on driving good cash generation, with a 
particular focus on working capital discipline. 
Operating cash ﬂow continued to be strong at 
£705 million. As a result net debt, at 31 July 
2010 was reduced to £346 million compared 
with £959 million at 31 July 2009. We are now 
placing a much greater emphasis on driving 
across-the-year improvements and we aim to 
deliver better month-on-month cash ﬂow 
performance in the year ahead.
Restructuring and disposals
In the year ended 31 July 2010, the Group 
continued to take restructuring actions to 
lower the cost base and incurred exceptional 
restructuring costs of £81 million. During the 
year we disposed of Wolseley’s activities in 
Ireland, the Czech, Belgian and Slovakian 
plumbing and heating businesses, Friosol 
(a small Swiss refrigerant distribution business) 
and the Public Works business in France. 
In the year ended 31 July 2010 these 
businesses generated revenues of £95 million 
and £7 million of trading losses. The businesses 
disposed in the year (and businesses held 
for sale) gave rise to an exceptional loss of 
£57 million in the period which has been 
recorded as an exceptional item. Since the 
year end we have also disposed of Brandon 
Hire in the UK. 
Summary
2010 has been a challenging year for Wolseley, 
especially given the prevailing market conditions, 
against which we can benchmark our future 
performance. Good progress was made 
on customer service, vendor management, 
improving the development of our people and 
driving a more efﬁcient operating platform. 
By stepping up the intensity with which we 
manage the performance of the businesses, 
especially the ones with strong growth potential 
and those which generate synergies, we are 
well placed to deliver proﬁtable growth and 
ultimately create sustainable shareholder value. 
Our shareholders, employees, customers and 
vendors have given strong support to Wolseley 
this year and I thank them for their trust, patience 
and loyalty. We have started to deliver on our 
plans for the business and we have much to do, 
but I am conﬁdent that we are in much better 
shape for the future even in these volatile 
market conditions.

Value Creation model

In March, we introduced a 
value creation model which 
combines top down resource

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
We believe that a combination of targeted future 
capital allocation to those businesses capable 
of generating the highest return on investment 
and a greater emphasis on improved operational 
performance at the business unit level will underpin 
the Group’ s drive for long-term value creation.
Value creation 3 Strategy
Synergy driver
Take advantage of growth engine 
synergies
These business units play an important 
role in supporting and complementing 
the growth engine businesses through 
signiﬁcant economic synergies. 
Our strategy will be to continue to drive 
operational improvements in these 
businesses while maximising the synergy 
beneﬁts with the growth engine businesses.
Growth engine
Invest to create proﬁtable growth
Business units which currently generate 
or have the potential to generate the 
greatest return on investment over the 
medium to longer term. Typically they 
are large businesses with a strong ﬁnancial 
performance and a leading market position 
with clear growth potential. 
Our strategy will be to continue to drive 
operational improvements in these 
businesses while prioritising investment 
in growth through predominantly organic 
expansion and, where appropriate,  
bolt-on acquisitions. 
Resource allocation
Performance builder
Drive performance, then reclassify or exit
These business units are currently 
underperforming and/or have insufﬁcient 
scale with no clear economic synergies with 
the growth engine businesses. 
Our strategy will be to drive operational 
improvements across these businesses with 
limited investment in expansionary capital in 
the near term. Some of these businesses 
will have the potential to be reclassiﬁed as 
synergy drivers or growth engines over time. 
However, if a satisfactory level of return is 
not achieved we will exit these businesses.
As part of the resource allocation 
review, the Group’s business units 
were evaluated according to the 
following four criteria:
3 Market characteristics 
An assessment of the size and 
attractiveness of the market in which a 
business unit operates was made, as well 
as an evaluation of the potential for future 
growth in that market. This included 
examining the potential proﬁt pool 
available to constituent companies and 
the degree of cyclicality of the market.
3 Strategic position 
The market share of each business unit 
was evaluated and an assessment of the 
potential growth opportunity was made, 
as well as the scale of the business. 
3 Performance 
A review of the track record of each 
business unit’s performance over the last 
four years was undertaken, including an 
assessment of the performance of the 
management team, against key ﬁnancial 
and operational performance metrics 
including return on capital employed, 
gross margin, cash performance and 
strength of customer relationships.
3 Synergies 
An assessment was made of the 
synergies that exist with each 
business unit and others in the 
Group, eg distribution and cross 
selling opportunities.
These four factors were then 
compared to obtain a clear 
classiﬁcation for each business  
unit in the Group as follows:

In addition to top down resource allocation, 
we have also given a high degree of focus 
to bottom up detailed business unit 
strategies and three year plans to ensure 
that we invest in the right projects and 
plans to deliver proﬁtable growth. 
Our objective is to deliver the best 
operational performance from each 
business unit and we strongly believe that 
all of the business units currently in the 
Group have the opportunity to improve 
their operating performance. A detailed 
monthly performance review process has 
been established to ensure that every 
business unit is accountable.
As part of the detailed performance review 
process, targets in areas such as ﬁnancial 
performance, training and development 
of people, vendor management and 
operational efﬁciency are identiﬁed. 
Actions are agreed and business unit 
management are held accountable for 
their delivery. In addition, the performance 
review process facilitates the sharing of 
best practice across the Group which we 
believe, executed properly, is a source of 
competitive advantage for Wolseley. Strategy

Gain share of existing 
customers and gain 
new customers
Our objective for each 
business unit strategy is to 
grow proﬁtably faster than 
our competition. Our business 
is local in the sense that the 
majority of our 1 million 
customers travel less than 
20 miles to reach a branch. 
Our objective therefore in 
every branch is to gain a 
greater share of our existing 
customers’ business and 
also gain new customers 
by providing the best local 
customer service, delivered 
by the best branch staff in the 
industry. Underpinning this is 
a low cost, efﬁcient operating 
model which ensures we are 
competitive and can attract 
favourable terms from our 
vendors.
Our strategy is to drive 
improvements in customer 
service, branch staff and 
vendor relationships in every 
business. This is explained 
in more detail opposite and 
some examples are outlined 
in the Our business section  
on pages 14 to 25.
Preferred vendor
Our vendors need distributors who  
can give them access to many smaller 
customers cost effectively. We want  
to build strong relationships with  
our vendors, grow our business with 
them and beneﬁt from improved  
terms and rebates. 
Best customer service
Wolseley is a relationship business 
and there is a strong correlation in 
successful businesses between 
satisﬁed customers and proﬁtable 
growth. Our focus is to meet our 
customers’ needs better than the 
competition ensuring we deliver the 
right products, at the right price, at the 
right time, on every occasion they do 
business with us. During the year we 
have implemented regular customer 
surveys in all of our business units 
so we can take actions to improve 
our performance.
Best branch staff
In order to achieve the best customer 
service in the industry we need to have 
the right talent with relevant training, 
skills and competence in our locations. 
Within each of the business units there 
is a strong focus on ensuring that 
training programmes and tools are 
available for our people so they are 
equipped to give the best service in 
the industry.

We will focus on each business unit’ s strategy to  
ensure that we are our customers’ distributor of choice, 
in our chosen markets, by delivering the best customer 
service and best vendor management through the best 
people in our industry.
Within business units Most efﬁcient

Our objective is to operate 
the lowest cost, most efﬁcient 
operating model in our industry. 
This means ensuring that 
our distribution activities

either through a network of 
distribution centres or direct 
deliveries from our vendors 
to the customer.
There are two primary areas where cross- 
business unit synergies can be achieved by 
being part of the Group.
• Management synergies such as sharing best 
practice management development and 
corporate ﬁnance.
• Operating synergies in the areas of joint 
sourcing, own label development and the 
sharing of costs and infrastructure.
The performance review process is highlighting 
the key areas of best practice where we believe 
we can achieve the greatest beneﬁts across 
the Group. Some examples of current projects 
are outlined in the review of our operations 
on pages 14 to 25.

Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
Key performance indicator and deﬁnition Review of performance Performance table
Change in like-for-like 
revenue
The total increase or decrease in 
revenue for the year, excluding the 
effect of currency exchange, sales 
days, new acquisitions, branch 
openings or closures in the year, and 
the incremental effect of acquisitions, 
branch openings and branch closures 
in the prior year. The Group expects 
changes in like-for-like revenue in each 
of its markets to exceed that achieved 
by the remainder of the market.
Group like-for-like revenue reduced by 
6.0 per cent during the year, compared 
to a reduction of 13.9 per cent in the 
previous year.
Gross margin
The ratio of gross proﬁt excluding 
exceptional items to revenue.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gross margin was maintained at 
27.7 per cent as a result of a continued 
focus on improving customer service 
and product mix despite competitive 
market conditions.
Trading margin
The ratio of trading proﬁt to revenue. 
Over the cycle, the Group seeks to 
achieve a growth in trading proﬁt 
higher than the growth in revenue as 
a result of increasing the efﬁciency 
of operations and beneﬁting from 
its economies of scale and strong 
market position. 
 
Group trading margin overall increased 
from 3.1 per cent to 3.4 per cent, as the 
reduction in gross proﬁt was offset by 
the disposal of loss-making businesses 
and a reduced cost base.

Average cash-to-cash days
Cash-to-cash days are deﬁned as the 
average number of days from payment 
for items of inventory to receipt of cash 
from customers. 
The Group uses the 12 month average 
number of cash-to-cash days excluding 
factored receivables to monitor working 
capital efﬁciency throughout the year. 
Average cash-to-cash days reduced 
by three days between 2009 and 2010 
as the Group continued to improve its 
working capital efﬁciency.
Customer service
Different types of customer have different requirements, or different priorities in ranking their requirements. Each business unit 
needs to understand what these requirements are and how its service performance is perceived relative to the competition. 
During the year, management has implemented regular customer surveys in all business units to establish a base point from 
which progress can be measured.

Other performance indicators
Employees, health and safety 
The safety of Wolseley’s people is regarded as paramount 
and lost time incident rates are monitored closely in each 
of the major businesses. 
The Group’s health and safety performance is monitored 
using three standard KPIs: medical injury frequency, lost 
workdays and vehicle collision frequency. More information 
is provided in the Corporate responsibility report on page 36.
As customer relationships are maintained by branch staff or 
sales people, staff turnover rates are an important indicator 
and are monitored regularly.
There are numerous programmes around the Group to 
develop the skills of branch staff, either in speciﬁc product 
knowledge or more generally in sales or management. 
These are monitored by logging training programmes 
attended and, where appropriate, the level of certiﬁcation 
achieved, which often forms a part of the performance 
objectives on which individual bonuses are awarded.
Supply chain
There are numerous supply chain initiatives around the 
Group. Some can be monitored by ﬁnancial measures, such 
as annualised savings in transportation costs, and others by 
non-ﬁnancial measures, such as inventory turns and, for the 
Group’s network of distribution centres, the ﬁll rate achieved, 
which is the proportion of orders that can be fulﬁlled from 
inventory on hand at the time of the order.
Own label
Most of the Group’s businesses aim to increase the 
proportion of sales of own label products, as these 
generally command higher margins. Initiatives are tailored 
to the opportunities and circumstances of each business.
Environment
The Group’s approach to environmental management 
is set out in the Corporate responsibility report on pages 
37 and 38. 12 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Activities
Wolseley is the world’s largest specialist trade 
distributor of heating and plumbing products to 
professional contractors and a leading supplier 
of building materials to the professional market. 
The Group is an international business, 
operating 4,118 branches in 25 countries 
and employing 47 ,000 people.
The Group’s business falls into six geographic 
segments – the United States, Canada, 
United Kingdom, France, Nordic region and 
Central and Eastern Europe.
The business model is simple. Products are 
sourced directly from suppliers or through 
agents and delivered to distribution centres and 
branches. Sales to customers can be made 
over the counter at our branches, through 
supply contracts which are managed centrally, 
or through orders that can be placed with 
branches, into call centres, or over the internet. 
Products are either delivered directly to our 
customers or collected from our branches.
Customers
The Group has a wide range of customers 
operating in different industry sectors, ranging 
from individual plumbers or builders through to 
national contractor chains and house builders, 
and including large publicly quoted businesses. 
Wolseley’s primary customer focus is on 
professional contractors, who constituted 87 per 
cent of the Group’s customer base during the 
year ended 31 July 2010. These contractors 
work with households, governments, property 
developers and industrial companies in the 
repair and maintenance of properties and in the 
construction of new homes, ofﬁces and buildings.
Suppliers
The Group has over 100,000 trade suppliers. 
Key suppliers are manufacturers with market-
leading brands, usually operating internationally 
but focused on the needs of local markets. 
The Group works in partnership with key 
suppliers, offering market breadth and 
penetration and collaborating on promotions 
and incentive programmes. The Group 
continues to work with low-cost, high-quality 
manufacturers to supply our own label 
product ranges.
Wolseley is the largest specialist trade distributor 
of plumbing and heating products to professional 
contractors and a leading supplier of building 
materials to the professional market.

Markets
The markets for plumbing and heating and 
building materials are directly exposed to 
macroeconomic cycles. At the start of the 
ﬁnancial year to 31 July 2010, most of the 
countries in which the Group operates were in 
a recession with rising unemployment, restricted 
availability of commercial and consumer credit, 
falling property prices and low consumer 
conﬁdence. In the second half, like-for-like sales 
in most territories stopped falling although 
revenue for the full ﬁnancial year is below last 
year’s level.
Although our markets are cyclical, the business 
model is strong and it is underpinned by 
demographic trends towards ageing populations 
in smaller households and by the ageing 
of housing stocks. The construction industry 
can be expected to continue to account for a 
signiﬁcant proportion of economic activity.
While the Group does not operate in a regulated 
industry, the performance of the Group can be 
affected by government legislation. Changes 
to building codes and regulations, particularly 
those promoting energy efﬁciency and reducing 
environmental harm, can provide new sources 
of growth but can also make certain product 
lines obsolete. 
Our six geographic segments sell to customers 
ranging across the RMI, commercial, industrial 
and construction sectors.
Competition
The distribution of plumbing and heating and 
building materials is fundamentally a local 
business, in that the majority of our customers 
are serviced by a local branch a short distance 
from their workplace. It is also highly fragmented, 
with no dominant, and few large, players. 
Wolseley aims to have a leading market position 
in the territories in which it operates, with strong 
local and national brands.
Using public and private sources of information, 
the management of each of our business units 
estimates its position in the markets it addresses 
relative to its competitors. These estimates are 
presented for our larger business units in each 
geographic segment. 14 Wolseley plc

Business proﬁle
Ferguson is the market leading distributor of 
plumbing supplies in the US and has a history of 
very strong ﬁnancial performance. The blended 
branches business sells to customers that 
range across the residential, commercial and 
industrial sectors for new construction, repair, 
maintenance and improvement projects. 
In smaller markets that may not justify a 
stand-alone presence for heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (“HVAC”) and Waterworks, 
a blended location can also provide the 
products and services for these customers. 
The business is served by 11 distribution centres 
across the country which enables purchasing 
beneﬁts from scale and next day product 
availability which is a competitive advantage.
The Waterworks business distributes pipes, 
valves, hydrants, ﬁttings and meters to 
residential, commercial and municipal 
contractors. This is a strong business which has 
been diversifying its customer base into private 
water companies and treatment plants, and 
expanding its product range into new areas 
such as metering technologies.
The HVAC business distributes heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration 
equipment to specialist contractors, predominantly 
in the residential and commercial sectors. 
Vendors have a strong position in this market, 
and branded dealerships of high-end equipment 
are the most important parts of the business. 
The majority of revenues are generated by 
providing parts for repair and replacement.
The Industrial PVF/HDPE business distributes 
pipes, valves and ﬁttings, including specialist 
high-density polyethylene pipes, to industrial 
customers, primarily in the oil and gas, mining 
and power generation sectors. Although project 
driven, the business has historically performed 
strongly over the cycle.
The other smaller business units specialise in: 
• off-site integrated supply with centralised 
procurement, storeroom management, and 
commodity management, (“integrated 
services”);
• the supply and fabrication of ﬁre protection 
systems (“Fire and Fabrication”);
• maintenance, repair and operations services 
(“MRO”);
• websites and platforms to support ebusiness 
(“B2C”); and

100 per cent ﬁll is the key to Ferguson’s 
attitude change
Ferguson has recently developed a goal 
of providing 100 per cent availability of the 
company’s top 2,000 Stock Keeping Units 
(“SKUs”) by Distribution Centre service area.
As a ﬁrst step, Ferguson collaborated with 
their suppliers to ensure proper planning and 
production for the 5,400 unique SKUs that 
make up the regional top 2,000 SKUs. 
Next, they increased inventory and visibility 
of the top 2,000 SKUs in their distribution 
centres to improve ﬁll rates. Top 2,000 
SKUs information is incorporated into daily 
purchasing reports for immediate visibility 
and action.
In branches, the feedback has been positive 
from customers and branches have 
generated improved sales.
• master distribution of plumbing, heating 
and pipe supplies to retailers and small 
wholesalers (“Master distribution”).
These business units have synergies with the 
distribution and branch network of the larger 
units, and frequently share suppliers.
Performance
Ferguson’s revenue was 11 per cent below last 
year though the like-for-like revenue decline was 
restricted to 9 per cent. During the fourth 
quarter of the year the business generated 
like-for-like revenue growth for the ﬁrst time in 
three years as New Residential and RMI markets 
continued to recover. Overall, the recovery in 
new construction has been modest as factors 
such as high unemployment, low availability of 
credit, high levels of unsold housing inventory 
and the recent expiry of tax incentives have 
continued to hold back demand. The less 
volatile RMI segment has been relatively more 
resilient. The Commercial sector, in particular, 
remained weak throughout the year and 
continued to be restricted by the lack of 
availability of ﬁnance for construction projects. 
Industrial markets were generally better. 
With the exception of Fire and Fabrication, 
which is particularly exposed to the commercial 
market, we believe all Ferguson businesses 
continued to gain market share during the year. 
The gross margin was slightly lower than the 
prior year, with pricing pressure largely mitigated 
by a focus on improvements in the business mix 
towards showrooms, counter sales and own 
label products. Trading proﬁt of £239 million was 
£70 million below last year with the gross proﬁt 
shortfall partly offset by the improved cost base. 
Second half proﬁt was ahead of last year. 
The trading proﬁt beneﬁted from a much lower 
bad debt expense than last year and this was 
£10 million to £15 million lower than the 
expected rate in a normal year. 
In the Blended Branches business, while 
Commercial revenue was weak, New 
Residential and RMI markets showed modest 
improvements in the period. The Industrial PVF, 
Waterworks and HVAC businesses made good 
progress in the period. HVAC, in particular, 
performed strongly beneﬁting from a change 
in strategy to fewer key vendors, improved 
product availability to drive service and a 
lower cost base. The USA trading margin 
was 4.6 per cent (2009: 5.3 per cent). 16 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Business proﬁle
Canada has product groups and customer 
segments similar to our US businesses and 
they are managed together. For example, 
initiatives such as the development of private 
label products are applied across both regions. 
Canada also beneﬁts from IT platforms 
developed in the US for managing customer 
discounts and transactional ecommerce.
As in the US, the blended branches mainly 
supply plumbing equipment to residential and 
commercial contractors and DIY customers, 
and have historically delivered a strong 
performance. A signiﬁcant competitive 
advantage is the regional distribution centre, 
where throughput has grown from C$15 million 
in 2007 to almost C$160 million in 2010.
The Waterworks business serves residential, 
commercial and municipal contractors. 
Its market leadership is based on strong 
relationships both with national and continental 
vendors, and with a base of core contractors. 
The customers of the HVAC/R business are 60 
per cent residential contractors and 40 per cent 
commercial contractors. Currently the customer 
base is weighted towards small and medium-
sized contractors and to counter sales, and 
there are growth opportunities particularly 
with property managers and public sector 
customers.
The PVF/HDPE business derives three-quarters 
of its revenue from industrial customers 
and a quarter from municipal contractors. 
Growth opportunities are in gaining share of 
existing and new customers through technically 
knowledgeable sales staff and on time in 
full delivery.

Wolseley Canada makes it easier for their  
customers to do business 24/7
In January Wolseley Canada relaunched 
its ecommerce site “Wolseley Express”, 
which is based on the existing Ferguson 
ecommerce platform developed in the 
USA. With additional features and a new 
look, the platform was launched in a bid 
to boost Canada’s online sales. The new 
platform has been designed to enhance 
and complement existing customer 
relationships, whilst offering an alternative 
way to do business with the company. 
Wolseley Express gives customers 24/7 
access to pricing information and product 
availability, their account information, 
order history and status of both online 
and ofﬂine orders, and of course the 
ability to place orders. 
Doing more business online means 
Wolseley Canada can make gains in 
efﬁciency, provide a lower cost to serve 
and fulﬁl orders, offer extended hours for 
customer service and increase growth 
opportunities across the business. 
Performance
In Canada, revenue for the year was 3 per cent 
behind last year in constant currency though the 
business returned to growth in the second half. 
The growth trends were broadly similar across 
the business with some beneﬁt from tax 
incentives and government stimulus spending. 
The Canadian economy emerged from the 
downturn strongly and interest rates have now 
begun to rise. Trading proﬁt of £41 million was 
£9 million ahead of the prior year, of which 
£4 million relates to currency translation and 
the remainder relates to an improvement in the 
gross margin and a reduction in the cost base. 
Blended Branches, Waterworks and HVAC all 
generated growth during the year and improved 
market share. The business is expanding 
its Regional Distribution Centre to increase 
capacity and improve customer delivery times 
and ﬁll rates. The trading margin was higher 
at 5.4 per cent (2009: 4.6 per cent). 18 Wolseley plc

Business proﬁle
Plumb and Parts Center, the country’s leading 
plumbing and heating brand, represents 43 per 
cent of the UK’s revenues, and has delivered a 
resilient ﬁnancial performance in a tough trading 
environment. The business also provides 
spares and replacements for much of the 
product range and efﬁciencies arise from 
purchasing volumes, from opportunities to 
cross-sell and to share sites, and from use of 
the distribution centre network. More than half 
of its revenue comes from the RMI market.
Build Center is a national builders’ merchant, 
supplying contractors with bricks and blocks, 
aggregates and cement, insulation and 
plasterboard, timber, tools, and drainage 
materials. There are also specialist timber, 
ironmongery and landscape branches. 
About half its revenue comes from the new 
build market (30 per cent residential, 20 per 
cent non-residential). The business has been 
restructured over the last two years by closing 
underperforming branches and reducing 
ﬁxed costs.
Pipe and Climate Centers distribute pipes, 
valves, ﬁttings, air conditioning and refrigeration 
products. The business has a sound track 
record of proﬁtability, though volumes are 
particularly dependent on non-residential 
new build projects.
During the year the Irish business was disposed 
of, and Brandon Hire, the tool hire business 
was sold after the end of the ﬁnancial year, in 
line with the Group’s strategy of focusing on 
businesses with signiﬁcant scale and leading 
market positions.
The smaller business units include:
• Encon, a specialist distributor of insulation, 
drywall, ceilings, partitioning and ﬁre 
protection products; 
• Electric Center, which distributes lighting, 
cabling, controls, switchgear and wiring 
accessories;
• Bathstore, a retail bathroom specialist, whose 
product range includes baths, basins, 
showers, toilets, taps and bathroom furniture;

Employees Reaping the beneﬁts of branch 
manager training 
A major training programme designed 
and delivered in-house for branch managers 
in the UK has supported a business 
turnaround in the last 12 months.
The Addvance Branch Manager training 
programme has trained more than 1,880 
branch managers who have participated 
in over 146 training sessions since January 
2009. Plumb and Parts Center completed 
the roll-out of the programme in 
September 2010.
The programme is designed to give branch 
managers the knowledge and skills they 
need to add increased value to the business. 
Addvance focuses on six key modules: 
Employee and Customer Care, Performance 
Management, Recruitment and Selection, 
Operational Management, Trading and 
Metrics and Developing Sales.

• BCG, which supplies kitchens, bathrooms and 
associated ﬁttings to other builders merchants 
and to retailers;
• Drain Center, a specialist in above-ground 
drainage; and
• William Wilson, which distributes plumbing 
and heating products in Scotland.
Performance
Revenue in the UK declined by 9 per cent in the 
year, due to the impact of disposals and branch 
closures with like-for-like revenue broadly ﬂat. 
The business generated 5 per cent like-for-like 
revenue growth in the second half as markets 
started to recover. We expect the overall 
recovery to remain weak as activity levels are 
held back by fragile consumer conﬁdence, and 
low availability of credit. In addition, public sector 
activity, which represents around 25 per cent 
of our UK revenue, may come under pressure 
later in the year, following the UK Government’s 
spending review in October 2010. We have seen 
a continuation of the gradual recovery in the 
more resilient RMI sector, which represents 
about 65 per cent of our revenue. Commercial 
and industrial markets have remained relatively 
weak throughout the year. 
Trading proﬁt in the year of £91 million was 
£36 million ahead of the prior year, of which 
£23 million arose from the exit of the business 
in Ireland. A signiﬁcant decline in gross 
margins as a result of competitive pressure 
was substantially offset by reductions in the 
cost base arising from restructuring actions 
taken in the prior year. Plumb and Parts Center 
performed well and ahead of the prior year. In 
addition, Build Center, which was loss making in 
2009, strongly improved its trading performance 
and returned to proﬁt in the year beneﬁting from 
a lower cost base. The UK businesses

Business proﬁle
Stark is the leading Danish distributor of heavy 
building materials, tools, hardware, timber and 
panels. Local building contractors generate 
more than half its revenue, and approximately 
a quarter comes from do-it-yourself (“DIY”) and 
retail consumers. The market is driven more 
by RMI than new construction. Stark’s market 
leadership and its efﬁciencies of scale have 
historically delivered strong results.
Beijer is a leading Swedish distributor of building 
materials. About half its revenue comes from 
local building contractors and another third 
from retail consumers. As the Swedish market 
is very fragmented, Beijer’s reach is valuable 
to suppliers, and by maintaining efﬁciencies of 
scale and working capital management it has 
delivered good results over time.
Starkki is a Finnish chain of builders’ merchants 
with a business model based on large stores 
and well-trained specialist staff. While local 
building contractors are the largest single 
customer segment, consumers and small retail 
stores generate nearly 50 per cent of its revenue. 
Starkki has a strong record of proﬁtability based 
on efﬁciency and a ﬂexible cost base.
Silvan is a DIY and retail chain in Denmark.  
Its specialist DIY market, focused on tools  
and hardware, is driven by RMI. Silvan has 
historically performed strongly on the basis of 
good local coverage, high gross margins and 
efﬁcient supply chain management. The majority 
of its sourcing overlaps with other businesses in 
the Nordic region and therefore the business 
delivers signiﬁcant economies of scale.

Starkki makes it simple
One of the branches at Starkki, the Nordic 
region’s Finnish chain of builders’ merchants, 
came up with a simple concept to improve 
their performance. The downturn in the 
market was having an impact on their sales 
as they were selling to fewer customers 
than before. Branch staff and management 
decided to work together to ﬁnd a solution 
to improve their performance through 
increasing the value of each sale per 
customer. 
The team focused on listening hard to the 
customers developing a methodology to 
ﬁnd out what else they needed to complete 
the project that they were working on. 
The initiative was very successful and the 
branch managed to increase the average 
sale per customer by 30 per cent exceeding 
their original targets. This approach is now 
being used across all of the Starkki branches.
Annua
Performance
In the Nordic region revenue declined by 8 per 
cent in constant currency although the second 
half performance was stronger. The market 
in Denmark, our largest revenue generator, 
continued to decline as a result of low levels 
of construction activity and poor consumer 
conﬁdence. In contrast our building materials 
businesses in Sweden, Finland and Norway 
all generated like-for-like revenue growth with 
Sweden performing strongest. Overall, the 
business held market share in Denmark 
and improved market share in Sweden, 
Finland and Norway.
Trading proﬁt in the year of £100 million was 
£4 million higher than last year. The results 
included a one-off credit of £4 million and the 
business also beneﬁted from a lower cost base 
offsetting revenue decline and a slight reduction 
in gross margins. The trading margin was higher 
at 5.0 per cent (2009: 4.6 per cent).  22 Wolseley plc

Business proﬁle
The building materials division comprises Réseau 
Pro, the number two integrated distributor of 
building materials in France, selling heavy building 
materials, rooﬁng, insulation, timber and ﬂooring, 
and Panofrance, focused on timber, panels and 
interior design. The businesses have efﬁciencies 
in both sourcing and shared services.
The import and wood solutions division includes 
Softwood, the market leader in specialist sawn 
and processed woods. The structural wood 
business derives the majority of its revenue 
from trusses and other carpentry systems. 
In addition, the Group owns Cerland, a garden 
furniture specialist.
The plumbing, heating and pipes business 
mostly trades through the national branch 
network branded as Brossette Bâtiment. 
Its customer base is mainly small plumbing 
and heating contractors, though it also services 
some larger contractors and regional accounts, 
and has limited consumer sales. The other 
business units are specialists in heating, 
ventilation and air conditioning, electricals, 
drains and industrial pipes. 
During the year the underperforming Public 
Works business was disposed of.

Wolseley France on the front line
Wolseley France reviewed the results from 
customer surveys for each of their divisions 
to identify areas where they need to focus 
in order to further improve their customer 
service performance. These include product 
availability, respecting commitments such 
as delivery times and frequency of sales 
representative visits to customers. 
All three divisions have implemented 
customer service programmes to engage 
their employees in achieving this objective: 
“Client plus”, for the plumbing and heating 
division. “Le client Roi” (customer is king) 
and “100 per cent client” for the building 
materials division.
Each of the programmes focuses on simple 
behaviours, for example, the time it takes to 
greet a customer or reducing the waiting time 
at the counter. All employees commit to 
these and, in some cases sign a pledge 
which is displayed in each branch location.
Performance
Revenue in France declined by 11 per cent in 
constant currency. The French economy 
was late into recession, compared with other 
European economies. Construction markets 
continue to recover slowly with weak consumer 
conﬁdence also affecting RMI markets. Like-for-
like revenue growth in the fourth quarter of the 
year remained negative although the overall 
trend continues to improve. As a result of a 
sustained focus on achieving a good mix of 
customers and vendors, the business improved 
its gross margin over the prior year. Trading 
proﬁt in the year of £30 million was £2 million 
lower than the prior year and included a one-off 
gain of £5 million relating to the release of a bad 
debt provision. The trading margin was held at 
1.5 per cent (2009: 1.5 per cent).
Réseau Pro performed in line with the 
market with some improvement in its trading 
performance. The Import and Wood Solutions 
business beneﬁted from commodity price 
inﬂation, higher gross margins and productivity 
improvements. The Brossette plumbing and 
heating business continues to marginally 
underperform the market although the trend has 
improved throughout the year. The new 
management team has focused on further 
reductions in the cost base, removing 
unnecessary management layers and improving 
customer service levels through training and 
better stock availability. Consequently, following 
a poor ﬁrst half performance the trend improved 
in the second half.  24 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Business proﬁle
The most proﬁtable business in Central and 
Eastern Europe is in Switzerland, where 
Tobler is the leading distributor of heating 
and air conditioning and sanitaryware. 
Historically it has delivered high trading margins 
and generated strong cash ﬂows. During the 
year Tobler rationalised its distribution network 
by centralising ﬁve regional distribution centres 
into one national distribution centre. Increased 
market share will be achieved by continued 
investment in ebusiness and extending 
the geographical coverage of the current 
branch network.
The main brand in Austria is ÖAG, which 
distributes a diversiﬁed product range (heating, 
sanitaryware and pipes, valves and ﬁttings 
(“PVF”)) to a range of customer segments (local 
plumbing and heating contractors represent 
about a third, industrial another third).
The main brand in the Netherlands is Wasco-
Kopex, a distributor of heating, plumbing and 
ventilation equipment. Boilers and spares 
account for about half of its revenue, and the 
customer base is weighted to larger regional 
and national contractors.
Manzardo in Italy distributes plumbing, heating, 
sanitary and air conditioning products into a 
highly fragmented market. 
During the year the underperforming plumbing 
and heating businesses in Belgium, the Czech 
Republic and Slovakia were disposed of.

T obler drives efﬁciencies
To improve efﬁciency and to reduce the 
level of inventory required, Tobler, our Swiss 
plumbing and heating business, recently 
rationalised its distribution network by 
centralising ﬁve regional distribution centres 
into one national distribution centre in 
Däniken (North Switzerland).
Owing to Tobler’s success and continued 
growth over the last few years, the business’ 
logistics capabilities had reached their limit. 
The new distribution centre will ensure that 
the entire Tobler range of products can be 
reliably supplied to customers or to their 
building site within 24 hours of receipt of 
the order.
As well as reducing operating costs and 
working capital, Tobler has the opportunity 
to expand its product ranges and, more 
importantly, improve service to its customers. 
Performance
In Central and Eastern Europe revenue was 
13 per cent lower than last year on a constant 
currency basis, the decline arising from the exit 
of a number of underperforming businesses, 
along with deteriorating market conditions. 
The gross margin was well ahead of last year 
and trading proﬁt improved to £10 million 
(2009: £nil), £4 million of which was the impact 
of the disposal of the Belgian, Czech and 
Slovakian plumbing and heating businesses. 
The remainder was the result of restructuring 
actions in the prior year. 
In Italy, we have closed seven loss-making 
branches since the end of the year and further 
restructuring will be undertaken to bring the 
business back to proﬁtability. 
The Swiss plumbing and heating business made 
good progress in the period.  26 Wolseley plc

The Group has responded to lower revenues arising from the 
challenging market conditions by defending gross margins and 
reducing costs to generate modest proﬁt growth. Disciplined 
management of working capital and capital investment led to  
strong cash ﬂow and deleveraging is now substantially complete.
Financial review
Revenue and trading proﬁt
Group revenue of £13,203 million (2009: £14,441 million) 
was 10 per cent below last year on a constant currency 
basis. Despite continuing pressure, the Group’s gross margin 
was maintained at 27 .7 per cent. Operating expenses, before 
exceptional items, were reduced by £353 million (10 per cent) 
principally as a result of restructuring actions taken last year, 
though the Group remains vigilant in the control of costs 
given the uncertain economic outlook. The lower cost base 
compensated for the reduction in revenue and trading proﬁt 
was slightly ahead at £450 million (2009: £447 million). 
This represents a trading margin of 3.4 per cent 
(2009: 3.1 per cent).
Exceptional items
Exceptional charges of £332 million were incurred during 
the year. Over the last two years the Group has undertaken 
substantial restructuring in order to restore and maintain 
proﬁtability of the Group’s operations and to ensure that 
the Group is well equipped to take advantage of improved 
economic conditions when they arise. Restructuring costs, 
which predominantly relate to redundancy and property 
costs, amounted to £81 million in the period. These costs 
were incurred on a range of restructuring initiatives across 
all jurisdictions.
Software assets in the course of construction within the 
Business Change Programme were impaired in the ﬁrst 
half of the year and these and other associated costs 
amounted to £170 million. Losses on disposal of businesses 
(and businesses held for sale) of £57 million were incurred, 
the large majority of which was generated on the disposal 
of the Group’s businesses in Ireland. Wolseley plc 27

The Group made additional provisions in the year in relation 
to the construction loans business of £24 million as the 
Group will now seek to accelerate its exit from this business. 
Balance sheet assets employed in the business at the end 
of the year amounted to £117 million, net of provisions. 
This included construction loans receivable of £80 million 
and foreclosed properties classiﬁed within “assets held for 
sale” of £37 million.

Amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangibles
Amortisation of £92 million represents the normal 
charge relating to the Group’s acquired intangible assets. 
In accordance with accounting standards, the Group has, 
in addition, reviewed the carrying value of goodwill and 
other acquired intangibles and concluded that an impairment 
charge of £223 million is appropriate. £50 million of this 
charge relates to Brandon Hire, which was sold after the 
end of the year, and a further £42 million relates to Encon, 
reﬂecting the continued difﬁcult trading conditions in the UK. 
A £111 million impairment charge has been made in relation 
to France following the implementation of payment legislation 
and continued challenging market conditions.

Finance costs
Net ﬁnance charges in the year amounted to £77 million 
(2009: £145 million). The reduction reﬂects lower net debt 
levels combined with lower interest rates. £16 million of 
the charge relates to unwind of discounts on pensions 
and provisions.
Associate
The Group retains a 44 per cent interest in Stock Building 
Supply, a former subsidiary disposed of in 2009. The Group’s 
share of the after-tax losses of the business in the year 
amounted to £13 million. In light of the level of ongoing losses 
generated by the business, the Group has concluded that its 
investment is impaired and has written off the whole of the 
carrying value of £41 million. The Group has no requirement 
to fund any investment in future.
Tax
The Group incurred a tax charge on proﬁt before exceptional 
items and acquired intangibles of £140 million. After adjusting 
for tax and deferred tax credits in relation to impairment and 
exceptional items, the net charge was reduced to £38 million.
The effective tax rate on proﬁts before exceptional items 
and acquired intangibles was 38 per cent. However, after 
adjusting for non-recurring tax items and share option 
charges, the underlying tax rate is calculated at 34 per cent.

Earnings per share
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) before exceptional items and 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 
amounted to 74.1 pence (2009: 95.6 pence). The fall arises 
because the weighted average number of shares in the

Dividends
The Group suspended dividend payments in 2008 at the 
onset of the economic downturn in order to preserve cash. 
Substantial progress has been made towards the deleveraging 
of the Group and the Board intends to resume dividend 
payments in the 2011 ﬁnancial year.

The Group continued to generate strong cash ﬂow during 
the year. Working capital management remained a key focus 
across the Group and a modest improvement was made in 
average cash-to-cash days, the most relevant KPI. Capital 
investment was tightly controlled and amounted to £84 million 
in the year. It is expected that capital investment will return 
to more normal levels in the year ahead, likely to be in the 
range £150 million to £170 million.
The Group reclaimed tax in the year of £150 million against 
which payments of £60 million were made, leaving a net 
receipt of £90 million. The Group expects to return to 
a normal cash tax outﬂow in the year ahead.
Overall, net debt was £613 million lower at the end of the year.
Net debt
Reported net debt at 31 July 2010 was £346 million 
(2009: £959 million). After adjusting for the estimated impact 
of year end working capital measures, receivables factoring 
and borrowings funding the construction loans business, 
adjusted net debt amounted to £1,195 million compared 
to £1,690 million last year.
In due course, management will target the reduction of 
average net debt throughout the year and we expect the 
impact of year end working capital measures to decline.

Pensions
The Group’s net pension obligations under IAS 19 at 31 July 
2010 amounted to £432 million (2009: £341 million) with the 
increase principally arising as a result of the adoption of the 
latest actuarial assumptions on mortality rates which have 
effectively added two years to the life expectancy of a 65 year 
old male. Following the triennial valuation of the UK deﬁned 
beneﬁt schemes, the Group has agreed with the trustees of 
the Group’s UK pension scheme to make additional cash 
contributions of £25 million per year in order to fund the 
past service deﬁcit.
Operating lease commitments
As at 31 July 2010 the Group had total operating leases 
commitments of £1,292 million (2009: 1,329 million). There 
is substantial capacity for revenue growth utilising the existing 
infrastructure and management will remain cautious when 
considering new lease commitments in the foreseeable future.
Other ﬁnancial matters
Financial risk management
The Group is exposed to risks arising from the international 
nature of its operations and the ﬁnancial instruments which 
fund them. These instruments include cash, liquid investments 
and borrowings, and also items such as trade receivables 
and trade payables which arise directly from operations. 
The Group also enters into derivative transactions – principally 
interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts – 
to reduce uncertainty about the amount of future committed 
or forecast cash ﬂows. The policies to manage these risks 
are set by the Treasury Committee and have been applied 
consistently throughout the year. It is Group policy not to 
undertake trading in ﬁnancial instruments or speculative 
transactions.
Capital structure
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash 
ﬂows generated by operations, equity contributed by 
shareholders, and borrowings from banks and other ﬁnancial 
institutions. To assess whether the capital structure is 
appropriate for current and forecast trading, the Group’s 
principal measure is the ratio of net debt, including factoring, 
to EBITDA. The Group aims to operate within the range 
1.0 to 2.0, consistent with an investment grade credit rating.
Foreign currency
The Group has signiﬁcant overseas businesses whose 
revenue is mainly denominated in the currencies of the 
countries in which the operations are located. The Group 
does not normally hedge proﬁt translation exposure since 
such hedges have only temporary effect.
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the 
Group’s overseas operations are reinvested in the business 
to fund growth in those territories. The Group’s policy is to 
adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to 
materially match the currencies in which its trading proﬁts 
are generated.
Interest rates
The Group manages its exposure to changes in interest 
rates by ensuring that at least 20 per cent of bank 
borrowings required during the next two years are at 
ﬁxed rates. The Group generally borrows at ﬂoating rates 
of interest, and then uses interest rate swaps to get the 
desired rate proﬁle.
Other ﬁnancial risks
The nature of the Group’s business exposes it to risks which 
are partly ﬁnancial in nature. Counterparty risk is the risk that 
banks and other ﬁnancial institutions which are contractually 
committed to make payments to the Group may fail to do so. 
Credit risk is the risk that customers who have made 
purchases on credit may fail to pay in full. Commodity risk is 
the risk that, in order to satisfy its contractual commitments 
to customers, the Group may have to purchase commodities 
at unfavourable prices. The Group manages counterparty 
risk by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of 
approved counterparties, which are approved by the Treasury 
Committee and monitored regularly. The management of 
credit and commodity risk is considered to be the responsibility 
of operational management, and the Group does not prescribe 
a uniform risk management policy across the Group.
Financial reporting
These ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under IFRS. 
The Group’s accounting policies set out on pages 72 to 77 
are broadly unchanged from those disclosed last year and 
the minor changes made have not had a signiﬁcant effect 
on the Group’s ﬁnancial position or results of operations.
Going concern
The Directors are conﬁdent, on the basis of current ﬁnancial 
projections and facilities available, and after considering 
sensitivities, that the Company and the Group has sufﬁcient 
resources for its operational needs and will enable the Group 
to remain in compliance with the ﬁnancial covenants in its 
bank facilities for at least the next 12 months. Accordingly 
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.

Risk management processes
During the year, the risk management programme was 
further strengthened through a revised process for reviewing 
risk with the executive team and the appointment of a Group 
Head of Risk. Key features of the Group’s risk management 
framework include:
• ownership of the programme by the Group Executive, 
facilitated by the Group Company Secretary and General 
Counsel with sponsorship from the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer;
• a dedicated Group Head of Risk to lead and continuously 
improve risk management;
• a network of risk directors across the Group’s businesses;
• a Group risk management policy, reviewed annually;
• a six-monthly risk assessment, action planning and 
reporting cycle, including a review by senior management 
and the Audit committee of key risks and their mitigation;
• a standard set of risk categories and risk deﬁnitions, which 
are reﬁned with each reporting cycle;
• a standardised and automated risk assessment and 
reporting tool, including standard risk assessment criteria 
and evaluation of “gross” and “net” risks;
• consolidation of risk assessments for each business at 
Group level to identify organisation-wide impacts and 
trends; and
• periodic reviews of operating companies’ risk mitigation 
actions by the Group Head of Risk and Group Internal 
Audit.
However, many risk factors remain beyond the direct control 
of the Company and this programme can only provide 
reasonable but not absolute assurance that key risks are 
managed to an acceptable level. 
Signiﬁcant risks to the Company’s 
performance
The nature of the industry in which we operate and our 
chosen strategy inherently exposes the Company to a 
number of risks. Various mitigation strategies are employed 
to reduce these inherent risks to an acceptable level. 
Listed within pages 31 to 33 are risks which senior 
management have identiﬁed as the most signiﬁcant, which 
have action plans for their mitigation and which are subject 
to regular review. The materialisation of these risks could 
have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results or 
ﬁnancial condition. The Company faces many other risks 
which, though important and still subject to regular review, 
are not listed here as they have been reduced through 
mitigation or assessed as less signiﬁcant. These include 
some risks (such as those relating to international operations, 
liquidity, credit exposures and product prices), which were 
reported in last year’s Annual Report. 
The trend from 2009 indicates, in general terms, whether 
there has been an increase or decrease, or no change, to the 
Group’s assessment of the risks 12 months ago, taking into 
account any mitigation plans.
The Company continues to maintain and improve its 
comprehensive risk management programme, which is 
designed to ensure that signiﬁcant and emerging risks 
are identiﬁed, assessed and managed effectively.  Wolseley plc 31

Market 
conditions
No change The Group’s results depend on the levels 
of activity in the new construction and 
property repair and remodelling markets. 
These have decreased markedly over the 
last three years and remain suppressed. 
There continues to be a risk that markets 
may ﬂuctuate rapidly or experience a 
second downturn. Factors inﬂuencing 
this risk include:
• the general rate of GDP growth;
• consumer conﬁdence;
• the availability of credit to ﬁnance 
customer investment;
• mortgage and other interest rates;
• the level of government initiatives 
to stimulate economic activity;
• inﬂation;
• unemployment; and
• demographic trends. 
These factors are out of the Group’s 
control and are difﬁcult to forecast.
Mitigation actions remain focused on 
expense reductions, working capital, 
margin and cash ﬂow optimisation, and the 
close monitoring of business performance. 
The Group’s businesses review all available 
indicators of activity – such as market 
statistics, economic forecasts, surveys and 
competitor announcements – to assist in 
making decisions.
Measures introduced in the last 12 months 
include the completion of a Group 
resource allocation programme, a number 
of dedicated cost reduction and pricing 
initiatives and reviews of aspects of 
the Company’s property estate. 
All the Group’s businesses have active 
programmes, monitored from the 
corporate centre, to reduce their cost 
base in line with expected levels of sales, 
to identify and exploit counter-cyclical 
opportunities, and to diversify into the 
sectors, particularly RMI and commercial 
and industrial, that have proved more 
robust. Programmes remain well managed 
to improve cash ﬂow and reduce debt. 
Businesses have also been asked 
to consider what steps they would take in 
the event of a further economic downturn.
Competitive  
pressures and  
margin erosion
No change Current market conditions have further 
increased competition during the period 
under review which, if not mitigated, 
could lead to downward pressure on 
sales prices and proﬁt margins.
There is a signiﬁcant risk that such 
competitive pressures will continue and 
could be exacerbated by factors such as 
levels of economic activity, customer or 
supplier consolidation, manufacturers 
shipping directly to customers, other 
changes in the route to market, and 
changes in technology.
The Company believes high levels of 
customer service play a fundamental role 
in maintaining competitive advantage. 
During the year under review, the Group 
has launched a programme to improve 
levels of customer service, including 
improved monitoring of and response 
to customer feedback.
The Group continues to broaden its 
offering of private label products which 
attract a higher margin and the product 
mix is subject to frequent review by each 
local business.
A number of local initiatives have been 
undertaken by Wolseley businesses in 
the last 12 months. Examples include the 
introduction of a major pricing programme 
in France, a National Pricing Centre 
in Canada to monitor margin approvals on 
local sites, dedicated training and review 
of pricing authorisations in the US, supply 
chain enhancements across the UK 
businesses and an increased focus on 
long-term customer relationships in the 
Nordic region.
Capital 
expenditure  
and return on 
investment
Decrease A core element of the Company’s 
strategy is a focus on organic growth 
with “bolt on” acquisitions only where 
signiﬁcant beneﬁts and synergies 
are available.
In light of this strategy, the ability of the 
Company’s management to control 
organic capital expenditure, to accurately 
judge the economic cycle and to identify, 
value and integrate any such acquisitions 
can have a signiﬁcant impact on the 
return on investment obtained by 
investors in the Company.
Following completion of the resource 
allocation review the Company has 
closely aligned its strategic plans with 
the associated allocation of capital. 
The Company regularly reviews its capital 
expenditure policy which includes clearly 
deﬁned approval limits. A new capital 
application procedure was implemented 
in August 2010 and existing business 
acquisition and disposal policies will be 
more rigorously monitored in the ﬁnancial 
year. The Company also undertakes 
post-implementation reviews.
Risk Trend from 2009 Deﬁnition Mitigation 32 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Financial 
ﬂexibility
Decrease Wolseley’s current bank facilities include 
covenants that its net debt should not 
exceed 3.5 times its annualised earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation (“EBITDA”) and that EBITDA 
should be at least four times net interest. 
A breach of our banking covenant could 
result in a signiﬁcant proportion of the 
Group’s borrowings becoming 
payable immediately.
There is a risk that the Group might 
have to take actions to reduce costs 
or preserve cash that it would not 
otherwise have chosen to do, or that it 
might not have the resources to exploit 
opportunities it would otherwise have 
pursued.
2009 saw the successful share placing 
and rights issue, and the signing of a 
two-year forward start debt facility which 
comes into effect in 2011. Along with the 
extension of other facilities these two items 
have signiﬁcantly improved the Group’s 
ﬁnancial ﬂexibility, and in light of the 
decreased risk, further mitigation is not 
planned beyond the current monitoring 
activity summarised below.
The Group continues to re-forecast its 
future covenant positions on a monthly 
basis, regularly updates its ﬁve-year 
strategic plan to reﬂect changing market 
conditions and prepares medium-term 
ﬁnancial forecasts and shorter term 
budgets on the basis of this plan.
People
Increase Wolseley’s ability to provide leadership 
and products and services to customers 
depends on retaining sufﬁciently 
qualiﬁed, experienced and motivated 
personnel.
In order to increase productivity, and 
be able to take growth opportunities 
when markets improve, Wolseley must 
maintain the skills and experience of its 
existing management and continue to 
develop the managers of the future.
The current difﬁcult conditions 
experienced in certain markets, and 
the Group’s response to them, could 
increase staff turnover and may 
demotivate remaining staff.
The Company continues to monitor 
staff turnover, trends in open positions 
and other metrics closely and has 
increased the frequency of its review 
of, and communication with, the most 
talented individuals within the Group. 
A comprehensive succession planning 
exercise has also been undertaken in the 
last 12 months and further employment 
engagement surveys across the Group 
are planned for the coming year. In some 
markets, new branch manager rewards 
and compensation plans have been 
implemented and the Company is 
reviewing its long-term incentive schemes.
The Group continues to invest in 
development programmes for senior 
management, managers and other staff.
Systems and  
infrastructure 
capabilities 
and resilience
No change The Group can only carry on business 
as long as it has the people, the 
information technology and the physical 
infrastructure to do so. The safe and 
continued operation of such systems 
and infrastructure is threatened by 
natural and man-made perils and is 
affected by the level of investment 
available to improve them. For example:
• some of the Company’s physical 
assets are located in areas exposed 
to natural catastrophe risks;
• in light of the current economic 
environment, the Company has 
decided to postpone the deployment 
of its shared and upgraded technology 
systems across the Group. The Group 
therefore remains reliant on a variety 
of different technology systems 
across the Group, some of which have 
been operating for many years; and
• to optimise costs and supply chain 
efﬁciency, some companies within 
the Group have centralised their 
distribution network and are therefore 
reliant on a reduced number of larger 
distribution centres.
The Company’s exposure to the loss of 
any individual physical location is mitigated 
by virtue of the large number of locations, 
customers and suppliers that it has. 
In many cases, the loss of one site or 
system can be compensated for by moving 
operations to another nearby location.
For certain sites and technology systems 
where the risk exposure is greater, 
business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans are maintained and tested regularly. 
These are supplemented by speciﬁc 
business interruption studies, such as 
those undertaken in North America in the 
summer of 2010. 
Selected technology systems are also 
supported by access to pre-prepared 
“hot sites”, allowing rapid resumption 
of transaction processing.
The Company maintains a comprehensive 
insurance programme and purchases 
additional property damage and business 
interruption insurances for those parts 
of the business which are particularly 
exposed to natural catastrophe risks. 
A limited amount of insurance cover is 
also purchased for technology risks.

Governmental 
regulations
Increase The Group’s operations are affected by 
various statutes, regulations and laws 
in the countries and markets in which 
it operates. In general, the amount of 
such regulation and the penalties for 
non-compliance continue to increase. 
While the Group is not engaged in a 
highly regulated industry, it is subject to 
the laws governing businesses generally, 
including among others, laws relating 
to competition, international trade, 
corruption and fraud, land usage, zoning, 
the environment, health and safety, 
transportation, labour and employment 
practices (including pensions), 
data protection and payment terms. 
In addition, building codes or particular 
tax treatments may affect the products 
Wolseley’s customers are allowed to 
use and, consequently, changes in 
these may affect the saleability of some 
Wolseley products.
The Group monitors regulations across 
its markets to ensure that the effects 
of changes are minimised and that 
compliance with all applicable regulation 
is continually sought.
During the course of the year, a number 
of initiatives have been undertaken to 
respond to new or updated laws and 
regulations. These include, for instance, 
the launch in August 2010 of an updated 
compliance programme for the prevention 
of fraud, bribery and corruption. It is 
expected that, among other regulation, 
it will meet the requirements of the UK 
Bribery Act, which is expected to come 
into force in April 2011. The Company 
continued to deploy online competition 
law training throughout Wolseley’s 
European operations.
Restructuring 
actions
No change During the course of the year and 
in response to the depressed levels 
of activity in its markets, the Group 
continued its restructuring programme 
to reduce costs and preserve cash. 
This has involved divesting certain 
businesses and other assets, closing 
branches, reducing headcount and 
curtailing capital expenditure.
At the date of this report, the Group 
believes that a large majority of the 
restructuring actions needed to address 
current market conditions are complete. 
However, the continued economic 
uncertainty and the ability of its 
businesses to meet their performance 
targets are factors that may drive further 
restructuring over the coming months 
and years.
All decisions about closing or divesting 
businesses or exiting market sectors 
are made on the basis of cost-beneﬁt 
analyses. Group management only 
approves those closures or disposals 
which are consistent with its overall view 
on the direction of the Company’s markets 
and its longer term strategic objectives.
Each business reports monthly on the 
costs incurred, the beneﬁts realised 
to date and forecast to be realised in 
the current and subsequent ﬁnancial 
year. These reports are reviewed by 
central management.
Litigation
No change The international nature of Wolseley’s 
operations exposes it to the potential 
for litigation from third parties and 
exposure is considered to be greater 
in the US than in Europe. Litigation 
can arise in areas such as product 
liability, workers’ compensation, general 
employer liability and environmental and 
asbestos litigation.
There is a risk that the number of 
claims made against the Company 
may increase as a result of the changes 
in economic conditions, changes in 
purchasing practices or other factors.
Although the number of claims made 
against the Company has increased 
slightly during the year as an expected 
consequence of the environment 
in which it has operated, there has 
been no material change in the level of 
litigation in which the Group is involved.
Wolseley’s preferred approach is to resolve 
disputes directly with the party in question 
in a spirit of openness and co-operation. 
Litigation is generally regarded as a 
last resort.
In the case of claims related to exposure 
to asbestos, Wolseley employs 
independent professional advisers to 
actuarially determine its potential gross 
liability. Wolseley has insurance which 
signiﬁcantly exceeds the current estimated 
liability relating to asbestos claims. 
Based on current estimates, no material 
proﬁt or cash ﬂow impact is expected to 
arise in the foreseeable future. Wolseley 
has recognised a discounted liability in 
respect of asbestos litigation with an 
equivalent insurance receivable shown in 
other receivables reﬂecting the discounted 
sum recoverable from insurers in respect 
of this liability. 
For more information on the Company’s 
exposure to asbestos-related litigation, 
see page 109.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Renewed focus on people,  
integrity and performance
Our Group remains decentralised, with accountability given 
ﬁrmly to our individual business units. When we established 
the Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) framework in 2008, 
it was designed to be ﬂexible to accommodate the different 
priorities that each business unit would have and the different 
speeds at which they would be able to develop the various 
elements of their programmes. In the two years since the 
launch of the CR framework, the Group has changed 
signiﬁcantly in size and focus. The continuing effects of the 
economic downturn kept pressure on our businesses to 
persevere with their disciplined working capital management 
and cost reduction programmes. Our ﬁnancial results in 
2009/10 show that they were effective in doing so. This cost 
pressure had an impact on the number and speed of 
implementation of some of the CR-related programmes that 
were planned a year ago. Despite these constraints, we have 
broadly met our targets for the year, principally because, 
wherever possible, the activities in our CR programme are 
integrated into our business practices. We also considered 
whether the overall CR framework remained appropriate 
for our businesses and concluded that it was robust enough 
to remain in its current form.
Wolseley’s framework for Corporate 
Responsibility
The ﬁve key themes of Wolseley’s CR strategy are set out  
in the table opposite. Alongside each theme, the table 
summarises the minimum standard to which any member  
of the Group must adhere. It also identiﬁes the aspirational 
goals for each theme and explains their principal beneﬁts  
to our business. In each case, our businesses have or will 
have detailed programmes, targets and measures which 
are aligned with their own operational priorities and with  
the strategic objectives of the Group as a whole.
Values
During the year, following discussions with management 
and employees around the Group, the Executive Committee 
agreed a common set of values and behaviours appropriate 
to all Wolseley employees that are central to our business 
and to the way we do business. During the ﬁnancial year 
2010/11 we intend to engage all employees in these values, 
which can be broadly categorised into three common themes:
 Integrity – we expect all our people to act with honesty and 
integrity in everything they do.
 Performance – we are never satisﬁed with our current level 
of performance and have a constant desire to improve.
 People – we value all our employees; their development 
is important to us and essential in maintaining our 
competitive strength.
These values underpin our new Code of Conduct and ethics 
programme, relaunched during the year, and the way we do 
business generally.
Risk management
An explanation of the Group’s risk management programme 
is set out on pages 30 to 33. Those risks which might have 
an impact on the key elements of our CR programme, 
and consequently on our business, are discussed in 
more detail in the relevant sections of this CR report.
Governance
The Board has oversight of the Group’s CR programme 
and conducts an annual review of the programme and 
its objectives. The Executive Committee discusses the 
programme in detail and decides on the degree of 
emphasis that should be placed on each of the themes. 
Each business unit is then tasked with developing and 
implementing CR plans that are integral to its operations so 
that they are aligned with local objectives, market conditions 
and available resources. The Group Company Secretary 
and General Counsel is responsible for the overall delivery 
of the programme and regularly discusses progress with 
business unit representatives.
Wolseley’s commitment to responsible and reliable business 
practices includes a broad-ranging internal audit programme 
and the regular review of the effectiveness of internal controls 
and of the suitability of the policies and procedures that 
apply throughout the Group. The Board and members of 
the Executive Committee also conduct an annual review 
of the authorities delegated to senior members of staff 
and the commitments that they may enter into on behalf 
of the Company.
This year , the Company redeﬁned its strategic 
focus through the resource allocation process 
and by driving strategy execution primarily through 
its business units. Our Corporate Responsibility 
programme was also reviewed to ensure that 
it still provided the right framework to support 
our businesses’ improvement plans.

Health and safety
We will provide a safe and healthy working 
environment and we will not compromise the 
health and safety of any individual.
During the year, the work on improvement of health and 
safety performance continued and the enhanced quality and 
accuracy of reported data allowed each business to focus on 
those areas where there was greatest need for improvement. 
The three KPIs that are reported and reviewed consistently 
across the Group remain the most appropriate (shown 
below), whilst individual businesses use additional KPIs for 
their speciﬁc improvement targets. We have not provided 
a comparison with performance last year, as such a 
comparison would not be meaningful: this has been another 
year of signiﬁcant change in the scope and size of our 
Company, involving branch closures, redundancies and 
reorganisations. In addition, the disposal of Stock Building 
Supply resulted in the retention of a minority interest in that 
business through a joint venture arrangement. The ﬁgures for 
that business have been excluded from this report. However, 
this year’s data is more complete and accurate, with over 
98 per cent of the Group’s businesses by turnover now 
providing data against which it will be possible to provide 
a comparison in next year’s report.
Our Group health and safety policy was re-issued this year, 
with a reinforcement of the Company’s commitment to 
improve our management of health and safety. In addition, 
each business has its own health and safety programme 
adapted to its particular needs and risks. We deeply regret 
the sad loss of three of our colleagues in fatal accidents 
in the workplace this year. Each of these incidents was 
thoroughly investigated both internally and by the relevant 
authorities. We are now even more determined to ensure 
that all of our employees remain appropriately trained and 
aware of occupational health and safety risks and we will 
take every possible measure to prevent similar tragedies 
from happening in the future.
In ﬁnancial year 2010/11, we will continue to use our Group-
wide KPIs as a basis for improvement. The leadership teams 
of our businesses have been set improvement targets which, 
together with their continuing management programmes, 
will be regularly monitored and reviewed.

Wolseley Canada – developing health and 
safety initiatives
Recent local legislation has deﬁned a set of 
occupational health and safety management system 
requirements (OHSMS 18001) which provides 
standardisation across each of the provinces of 
Canada. Following this process, Wolseley Canada 
has now been identiﬁed as a leader in the industry 
through customer service and safety.
Wolseley Canada is in the process of introducing a risk 
management system designed to eliminate hazards in 
the workplace. During the year, it will continue to 
pursue its aim of eliminating workplace injuries by 
ensuring that the risks associated with its unique 
business lines have the necessary control measures. 
In addition, the development of e-learning training 
modules for Wolseley Canada employees will ensure 
that appropriate training is available for everyone.
Wolseley Canada’s initiatives promote harmonisation, 
giving full consideration to the need for uninterrupted 
and efﬁcient operations for all business lines, with the 
ultimate goal of a risk-free workplace. Wolseley plc 37

Environment
We will run efﬁcient operations that minimise waste 
and reduce any negative effect on our business 
activities on the environment. We will promote 
sustainable development.
Around the Group, our businesses have introduced 
programmes that have helped us to reduce the impact of 
our operations on the environment whilst improving efﬁciency 
and saving costs. Those programmes are integral to the way 
we work. In some of our markets there is increasing demand 
from our customers for products which are more energy-
efﬁcient or otherwise contribute to reducing the impact of 
construction on the environment. In many cases, we work 
with our customers to identify the most suitable materials 
for their projects. 
Overall, the Group has reduced its environmental footprint 
this year (greenhouse gas emissions down by 5 per cent, 
non-hazardous waste by 30 per cent and hazardous waste 
by 14 per cent) compared with last year, although to a large 
extent, reductions can be attributed to changes in the 
business in the year, including a decrease in the size of 
the portfolio and reduced distribution and sale of products. 
Greenhouse gas emissions (“tCO2e emissions”)
The vast majority of the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions 
derive from electricity use at our facilities (44 per cent) and 
the transportation of our goods (30 per cent). Fuel use in 
operations and the transportation of people account for a 
smaller proportion of the total tonnes of CO2-equivalent 
emissions (13 per cent and 12 per cent respectively). 
To help us to reduce our emissions, as well as reducing 
fuel consumption, our businesses have continued to 
develop various measures throughout the year, including 
the introduction of, or improvements to, environmental 
management systems, resource efﬁciency plans, ﬂeet 
management systems and ﬂeet backhauling programmes. 
For example, Ferguson in the US has continued to replace 
inefﬁcient lighting with more efﬁcient alternatives, which has 
made a signiﬁcant contribution to reducing the Group’s total 
electricity use. More information on these activities can be 
found online at: http://www.wolseley.com/corporate-
responsibility.aspx
As in previous years, tCO2e emissions have been reported 
in accordance with the principles of the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development and the World 
Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG 
Protocol”). The GHG Protocol categorises emissions 
as follows:
• Scope 1 – Direct emissions. 
These are emissions for which businesses are directly 
responsible. 
• Scope 2 – Electricity Indirect emissions. 
These are emissions from the electricity that a company 
buys to use in its equipment or operations. 
• Scope 3 – Other Indirect emissions.  
These are emissions from activities that are relevant to 
a company, but not within its direct control. For example, 
transport in vehicles not owned by the company.
Wolseley reports on its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as 
deﬁned in the GHG Protocol. However, given the nature of 
our operations and the degree of control we exercise over 
certain activities, we will aim to report on the emissions 
from third-party provided transportation, as well as from 
our employees’ business travel. Accordingly, these Scope 3 
emissions, together with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, are 
included in the data reported below. Approximately 
65 per cent of the emissions data provided is derived, 
or partly derived, from estimates.

1  Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as tonnes of CO2 equivalent 
(abbreviated as tCO2e), based on the Global Warming Potential (“GWP”) 
of each of the “basket of six” greenhouse gases, as deﬁned by the Kyoto 
Protocol. The GWP of CO2 is 1 (1 tonne CO2 = 1 tonne CO2e). For other 
greenhouse gases in the “basket of six”, including refrigerants, the GWP is 
relative to CO2 over a 100-year time horizon (eg one tonne of the refrigerant 
R407C is equivalent to 1,526 tonnes of CO2 in terms of the potential climate 
change impact).

Waste management
The Group’s businesses generate non-hazardous waste and, 
to a lesser extent, hazardous waste. Although deﬁnitions vary 
from country to country, hazardous waste may include items 
such as batteries and electronic equipment; non-hazardous 
waste typically includes materials such as paper, plastic 
and metal. 
Wolseley aims to minimise the waste generated by its business 
activities to reduce our environmental impact, at the same 
time as lowering waste removal costs. Where possible we 
re-use or recycle waste. In FY2009/10, 7 per cent of 
hazardous waste and 29 per cent of non-hazardous waste 
was recycled. The remaining waste was either sent to landﬁll 
or incinerated. Of the total waste generated by the Group in 
2010 (noted below), approximately 79 per cent is based on 
actual data. The remaining 21 per cent of data was partly or 
entirely estimated. We aim to increase the proportion of actual 
data reported next year in order to improve data quality.

Water use
The Group is not a large consumer of water, compared to 
manufacturers. The majority of the Group’s water consumption 
is related to normal operational and sanitary water use. 
We have, however, continued to measure water consumption 
throughout the Group in an effort to improve our water 
efﬁciency. This year, our reported water use has increased 
by 2 per cent overall. We believe that this increased ﬁgure 
is predominantly due to improved data quality, rather than 
other business-related factors. The Group’s water is almost 
exclusively supplied by local utility providers.

Starkki – working towards lowering energy 
requirements
During the ﬁnancial year, Starkki in Finland joined a pilot 
group of companies and organisations taking part in a 
Finnish initiative which has been set up by think tank 
“Demos Helsinki” and the Finnish Innovation Fund, 
“Sitra”. This new organisation, Peloton, aims over the 
next three years to bring together companies and 
consumers in all matters relating to climate change. 
Finland is currently one of the highest energy use 
consumers in Europe and has signiﬁcant carbon 
emissions per capita. 
Through this project, Peloton is helping this pilot group 
to create products, services and social innovations  
that can systematically lower the energy requirements 
of the Finnish lifestyle. The aim of this pilot is for groups 
to work together with representatives from different 
companies, such as Starkki, to develop innovative ideas 
on how to lower the energy usage of their customers, 
to offer sustainable solutions, and to introduce a new 
way of thinking into their own business models. Wolseley plc 39

People
We value our employees and their diversity. We will 
develop our people and reward them fairly.
As a result of poor market conditions, the Group experienced 
another challenging year for its businesses. During the year 
employee numbers remained stable at approximately 
47 ,000 as most of the major redundancy and restructuring 
programmes were completed last year. We have invested in a 
number of development programmes this year. These include 
leadership development programmes in Europe, the US and 
Scandinavia; and local training programmes, focusing on the 
knowledge and skills needed to add increased value to the 
business. An example of this is described further on page 19.
Online training modules continue to be developed and used 
across the Group. At ÖAG in Austria an e-learning concept 
has been introduced, speciﬁcally to train apprentices. 
In Canada, a new e-learning site has been launched to 
provide employees with access to vendor product and 
service training which develops employees’ expertise in 
the products and services sold in order to enhance the 
customer experience.
We have also improved our succession planning process, 
which allowed for a rigorous and thorough review of our top 
talent and future leaders. The Executive Committee and the 
Board now review the senior leadership team and their 
successors twice per year.
For a number of years we have been steadily improving 
our employees’ awareness of the value of diversity to our 
business and to our customers. A particularly successful 
example is that of Ferguson in the US, which has been 
operating a diversity and inclusion programme since 2006. 
Relying on the commitment and accountability of the 
Ferguson executive management team, a Diversity Council 
has recently been established, comprising a cross-section 
of individuals from different business units. This ensures that 
leadership and management teams are engaged in diversity 
initiatives and that there is collaboration across department 
lines and business units. Raising awareness of diversity and 
inclusion throughout Ferguson has been achieved though 
employee resource groups, mentoring programmes, online 
training and the introduction of a quarterly newsletter. 
In addition, Ferguson is continuing to develop its supplier 
diversity programme to support the interests of suppliers 
operated by minority groups and to foster inclusive 
environments to allow their business partners to grow 
strategically in a competitive market.
In the ﬁnancial year 2010/11, we will be continuing employee 
engagement surveys in each business around the Group. 
The results will be individually assessed and will form the 
basis of improvement programmes based on the most 
important concerns and opportunities identiﬁed by our 
employees.
Responsible business
We are committed to observing both the spirit and the 
letter of the laws and regulations of all jurisdictions 
in which we operate and to comply with our Code 
of Conduct. We expect our suppliers, contractors 
and agents to adhere to our Code to adopt similar 
ethical standards.
During the year, in consultation with representatives from our 
main businesses, we developed and introduced a revised 
Code of Conduct as part of an integrated ethics and anti-fraud 
programme to maintain the Group’s high ethical standards. 
This has been improved so that it can be adopted by each 
business for easier communication and wider employee 
engagement. Copies will be available at all our locations and 
it can also be viewed at www.wolseley.com. In addition, 
we developed a detailed programme to combat fraud and 
corruption, which includes clear policy statements 
emphasising our zero tolerance of any form of fraud, bribery 
or corruption. These policies are supported by a manual 
containing case studies relevant to our operations, standard 
forms, guidelines and procedures to ensure that risks can be 
minimised. All employees will receive brieﬁngs and training on 
the Code of Conduct; those exposed to fraud and corruption 
risks will also take part in a bespoke online training programme 
and will receive face-to-face brieﬁngs as needed in each 
business. Given the number of employees that this training 
will reach, we expect this to continue throughout ﬁnancial 
year 2010/1 1. The training programme on combating corruption 
will recognise the requirements of the new UK Bribery Act 
2010, which is expected to come into force in April 2011, 
the provisions of which will have Group-wide effect.
As part of the relaunch of our ethics programme, 
we introduced a new conﬁdential reporting system which 
replaced our existing whistleblowing hotline. The new system, 
called “Speak Up!”, was launched with a coordinated 
communication campaign to ensure that we could maximise 
employees’ awareness of this secure facility for reporting any 
concerns about the integrity of our business. All reports that 
are registered through Speak Up! (either by telephone or 
online) are investigated and appropriate corrective action 
is taken. The concerns raised, and the opportunities for 
improvement, are discussed by the Audit Committee as 
part of its regular review of suspected fraud and corruption.
Timber sourcing
In July 2010, the European Parliament voted in favour of new 
legislation which will make it a criminal offence to place illegal 
timber or timber products into the market in an EU member 
state. Member states will have up to two years to implement 
this legislation into their own laws, which will require 
companies to exercise due diligence when they purchase 
timber from producer countries. The legislation is similar 
to that already in force in the United States. The Company 
procures timber from a number of countries around the 
world and already has a well-established and robust 
procedure in place with the aim of ensuring that the 
timber is legal and from forests certiﬁed as well-managed. 
The system is designed to identify and track timber from 
origin to the eventual customer and to ensure that there is 
integrity at every stage of the chain of custody. Despite these 
safeguards, it remains difﬁcult to ensure that all timber that is 
purchased by the Company is from appropriate sources.  40 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
This is because, in some cases, the timber passes through 
a number of intermediate stages before it is transferred to us. 
It is the Company’s target to eliminate all “risk timber” from 
its operations as soon as practicable and in any event in 
advance of the date on which the new EU legislation comes 
into force.
Other product sourcing
As part of the Group’s continuing commitment to responsible 
business, a Group-wide product safety policy has been 
developed and will be introduced this year. This conﬁrms 
Wolseley’s commitment to source and sell safe products, 
comply with legislation concerning product safety and take 
quick and decisive action to resolve any product safety 
issues which may arise. To that end, a Corrective Action 
Procedure has been established to provide general 
guidance on the standards and systems that each 
business must have in place. 
Wolseley UK introduced an Ethical Sourcing Policy in 
February 2010, which details the minimum standards 
expected from suppliers and the commitments that have 
been made to ensure that suppliers operate in accordance 
with those standards. Offering a range of over 400,000 
product lines, supplied by over 10,000 suppliers, Wolseley 
UK’s ﬁrst commitment is to understand its supply chains, 
many of which are complex and involve a number of stages 
in the manufacture and distribution of the products and their 
component parts. In addition, these various stages in the 
supply chain may take place in countries that have signiﬁcant 
social and cultural differences, as well as different local laws 
and systems of governance.
Wolseley UK has recently embarked on a programme to 
engage with a selected number of its suppliers which operate 
in a number of countries and supply a range of products. 
The initial phases of this programme have identiﬁed the 
current levels of declared compliance and the most successful 
methods of collecting and verifying the types of evidence that 
is required in order to support these declarations. The next 
phases will see further development of the veriﬁcation 
process and a strategy to roll out the programme across 
a wider supply base.
Corporate responsibility continued
Wolseley France – timber certiﬁcation obtained
This year, Silverwood and Sinbpla again received PEFC 
certiﬁcation and in February 2010, Forest Stewardship 
Council certiﬁcation was also granted for most of their 
panel products. In addition, in March 2010, all 
Panofrance branches and those branches of Réseau 
Pro which specialise in wood products, also obtained 
PEFC certiﬁcation. 
The Wolseley France commitment to purchase, 
produce and sell products in a sustainable way was 
further rewarded by a “Three Leaf” label (the highest 
level), given by the “Le Commerce du Bois” in France 
in November 2009. As a result, Silverwood was 
recognised this year by the main business magazine 
in France as “Best Contributor to Sustainable 
Development”. 
These achievements in sustainable development aim 
to give the business a competitive advantage over our 
competitors and ensure that our customers are able 
to identify those products which are from sustainably 
managed forests. Directors’ report – Business review

Community engagement
We will be a responsible member of the communities 
in which we work.
Despite the severe impact of the recession on our operations 
and our employees, our businesses have continued to 
support the communities in which they work, usually 
through continuation of established partnerships with 
charitable organisations and often through the outstanding 
enthusiasm of individuals. Most of these efforts are 
determined by individual businesses’ concerns for their local 
communities. They are all motivated by the desire to make a 
positive impact in areas that have a connection to our sector 
and the products we supply. For example, we aim to reduce 
homelessness and improve the quality of housing and the 
built environment, and we aim to improve the social 
conditions and the employability of people who may be at 
risk of being marginalised. In addition, this year, Wolseley plc 
became a member of the group of construction sector 
companies supporting the “Raising the Roof” campaign, 
whose target is to raise £3 million to help fund a new centre 
for neurosciences, as part of the major redevelopment 
programme at Great Ormond Street children’s hospital 
in London.
We also decided to partner with Impetus Trust 
(www.impetus.org.uk), an organisation which targets small 
charities and social enterprises that help the economically 
and socially disadvantaged to build their capacity to achieve 
their aims of social improvement. Impetus has pioneered an 
effective model of charity support: their tri-partite investment 
model provides a distinctive combination of strategic funding, 
hands-on support to management and specialist expertise 
(often provided by the private sector), which enables these 
small charities to grow rapidly and effectively over a period 
of three to ﬁve years. In the UK, among the charities 
included in Impetus’ portfolio, Wolseley has contributed 
to the objectives of Blue Sky Development & Regeneration, 
whose principal activity is the employment of recently 
released ex-offenders on six-month contracts to fulﬁl 
grounds maintenance contracts for local authorities. 
Blue Sky’s mission is to help break the cycle of reoffending 
and to achieve long-term beneﬁts for society, with the 
aim of enabling ex-offenders to move successfully into 
long-term employment.
It is important to our businesses to build and develop strong 
relationships with their local communities and to encourage 
charitable initiatives. As a result, many of our employees and 
their businesses support a wide range of charities and 
community projects which are relevant to the countries and 
locations in which they operate, as well as charities for 
which our employees have a particular passion.
More information about our CR programme, including 
further case studies, statistics and examples of 
our practices, awards and community engagement 
can be found on the Wolseley plc website at http://

Ferguson and Christopher Newport University
Ferguson’s relationship with this University, which is 
based in the same city as its corporate ofﬁce in 
Newport News, Virginia, began in 2004, with an 
investment in the Ferguson Center for the Arts. The 
partnership was expanded in 2007 when Ferguson 
began supporting the Center for Service and Learning 
and Social Entrepreneurship. The Center provides 
lessons to students in leadership, civic responsibility 
and character development gained through community 
engagement. During 2010, two new projects offered by 
the Center were funded by Ferguson: Youth Services 
Survey and Ferguson Fellowship Funding. The Youth 
Services Survey will result in a website that will connect 
citizens to all youth support systems in the community. 
The Youth Service initiative will also provide action plans 
for increased future student involvement in the Newport 
News community. The Ferguson Fellowship will fund up 
to 15 “Ferguson Fellows” – students who will plan and 
implement socially innovative projects during 2010, 
resulting in initiatives that will have practical applications 
to produce sustainable beneﬁts for partner organisations 
locally, nationally or globally.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Corporate governance report
including the report of the Audit Committee
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to the highest standards of 
corporate governance. It recognises that it is accountable 
to the Company’s shareholders for good governance, 
to facilitate efﬁcient and effective management in order 
to deliver shareholder value over the long term, within 
appropriately established risk parameters. 
At the date of this report, the principal governance rules 
applying to UK companies listed on the London Stock 
Exchange are contained in the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance (the “Code”), as adopted by 
the Financial Reporting Council (the “FRC”) in 2008 
(www.frc.org.uk/corporate). In May 2010, following lengthy 
review and consultation, the FRC published a new code, the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Governance Code”) 
which will replace the Code for ﬁnancial years beginning on 
or after 29 June 2010. The FRC has stated that changes 
have been made to help company boards to become more 
effective and more accountable to shareholders. This report, 
including the report from the Audit Committee and the 
Remuneration report, describes how the Board applied the 
principles of good governance, as contained in section 1 of 
the Code, and seeks to demonstrate how those principles 
have been applied during the year under review. Where 
applicable, the Company has already adopted principles 
from the Governance Code.
Board organisation and structure
Board composition, constitution and independence
As at 31 July 2010, the Board of Directors was made up 
of 10 members consisting of the Chairman, three Executive 
Directors and six Non Executive Directors. During the year, 
two new Non Executive Directors were appointed to the Board. 
Alain Le Goff was appointed with effect from 1 September 
2009 and Michael Wareing with effect from 1 October 2009. 
In addition, Robert Marchbank stepped down from the Board 
on 1 March 2010 and Stephen Webster stepped down on 
31 March 2010 and was replaced by John Martin who was 
appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer on 1 April 
2010. As noted on page 3, Mr Whybrow will step down from 
the Board at the end of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 20 January 2011 and will be succeeded by Mr Davis 
as Chairman. Biographical details of each of the Directors 
currently in ofﬁce are shown on pages 42 to 43.
The Board meets regularly during the year, as well as on an 
ad hoc basis as required by time-critical business needs. 
The Board’s primary role is to provide effective and 
entrepreneurial leadership necessary to enable the Group’s 
business objectives to be met and to review the overall 
strategic development of the Group as a whole. It has a 
formal schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision, 
while day-to-day operational decisions are managed by the 
Executive Committee.
Each of the Non Executive Directors brings his own senior 
level of experience and expertise to the Board. The Chairman 
and the Non Executive Directors are each considered by the 
Board to be independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement. The Company’s policy 
relating to the terms of appointment and the remuneration of 
both the Executive and Non Executive Directors is detailed in 
the Remuneration report. 
Director re-election 
It has been Board policy that Non Executive Directors are 
normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which 
is then reviewed and extended for up to a further two 
three-year periods. It is also Board policy that Non Executive 
Directors should not generally serve on the Board for more 
than nine years and that, in cases where it is proposed to 
exceed this period, the Director concerned will retire annually 
and offer himself for re-election. The Company’s Articles of 
Association also provide that one-third of the Directors 
should retire by rotation each year and that each Director will 
seek re-election by the shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting at least once every three years. Additionally, new 
Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the ﬁrst 
opportunity after their appointment. 
In accordance with a new provision included in the 
Governance Code, all Directors will seek re-election at the 
next Annual General Meeting. Although this provision of the 
Governance Code would not apply to the Company until the 
ﬁnancial year ending 31 July 2011, the Board has decided to 
comply this year. Mr Martin will seek election having been 
appointed to the Board during the year.
Division of responsibilities
The distinct roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are 
acknowledged, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. 
The Chairman is responsible for the overall leadership and 
governance of the Board and for ensuring that the Directors 
have an understanding of the views of the Company’s major 
shareholders. The Group Chief Executive is responsible for 
the effective leadership of the Company, management and 
development of the Group and for delivery of the Company’s 
agreed objectives and strategy.
Although permitted under the Code, the Chairman has 
conﬁrmed that he does not chair any other board of directors 
in the FTSE 100. Gareth Davis is the Company’s Senior 
Independent Director. His role includes being available for 
approach or representation from investors and shareholders, 
where communication through the Chairman or the Executive 
Directors may not seem appropriate. The Nominations 
Committee, as well as the Board as a whole, considers 
succession planning and the appropriate composition 
of the Board.
Board effectiveness
Board procedures and responsibilities 
A 12-month rolling programme of items for discussion by the 
Board is prepared to ensure that all matters reserved and 
other key issues are considered at appropriate times. 
The Board met eight times during the year and Director 
attendance is shown in the table on page 45. Together with 
the Group Chief Executive and the Group Company 
Secretary, the Chairman ensures that the Board is kept 
properly informed and is consulted on all matters reserved 
to it. In accordance with the Code, Board papers and other 
information are delivered at times to allow Directors to be 
properly briefed in advance of meetings to ensure that 
they are provided with sufﬁcient resources to undertake 
their duties. Wolseley plc 45

The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed 
necessary, to take independent professional advice at the 
Company’s expense in the furtherance of their duties. This is 
in addition to the direct access that every Director has to the 
Company Secretary, who is charged with ensuring that Board 
procedures are followed and that good corporate governance 
and compliance is implemented throughout the Group.
Following their appointment, formal comprehensive and 
tailored induction is offered to all Directors. This is 
supplemented by meetings, as required, with major 
shareholders, visits to key locations within the Group and 
meetings with members of the Executive Committee and 
other senior executives. Meetings led by the Senior 
Independent Director between the Non Executive Directors, 
both with and without the presence of the Chairman and the 
Group Chief Executive, are scheduled in the Board’s annual 
timetable. The Board endeavours to hold at least two Board 
meetings each year at operating locations to help all Board 
members gain a deeper understanding of the business, 
whilst also providing senior managers from across the Group 
the opportunity to present to the Board and to meet the 
Directors on more informal occasions. 
Board evaluation
Each of the Directors continues to be considered by the 
Board to be effective and to demonstrate commitment to 
his respective role. A recommendation from recent UK 
governance reports, including the Walker Report and the 
Governance Code, was that external Board performance 
evaluation be completed every three years. Consistent 
with this recommendation, a full evaluation of the Board’s 
own performance and that of the individual Directors was 
completed with the assistance of an external facilitator during 
2009. Using the results of that review, this year the Board 
further analysed its performance and effectiveness and 
focused, in particular, on the areas for improvement that had 
been previously identiﬁed. The changes to the composition of 
the Board, improved succession planning and the increased 
focus on customer service, have contributed to the 
effectiveness of the Board’s performance.
During 2010, the Audit and Remuneration Committees each 
conducted a detailed assessment of their own effectiveness, 
using a set of questions which had been adapted to 
address the activities and concerns of each Committee. 
The questions were in the form of online surveys which 
encouraged comment and qualitative evaluation of each 
Committee’s effectiveness, its individual members and the 
contributions received from advisers. The results of the 
surveys formed the basis of discussion of areas for further 
improvement by each Committee and actions were then 
taken to change the scope, content and timing of items 
to be considered by each Committee.
The Board and its Committees will continue to critically 
review their procedures, effectiveness and development 
throughout the year ahead and the Chairman has reiterated 
that should any Director have any concerns or observations 
which they wish to raise, these should be notiﬁed to him 
directly or to the Group Company Secretary.
External directorships
As part of their continuing development, the Executive 
Directors are encouraged to take on not more than one 
external non executive directorship on the board of a 
non-competitor company, for which they may retain 
payments received in respect of such appointment, as the 
Board believes there are signiﬁcant beneﬁts to be achieved 
for both the Company and the individual. In order to avoid 
any conﬂict of interest, all appointments are subject to the 
Board’s approval. The Board monitors the extent of Directors’ 
other interests to ensure that the effectiveness of the Board 
is not compromised. Details of such external appointments 
are shown in the biographical details of the Directors 
currently in ofﬁce on page 42 to 43.
Succession planning
The Nominations Committee has speciﬁc responsibilities 
for succession planning to ensure that the Board has 
the correct balance of individuals to discharge its duties 
effectively. In addition, during the year, the Board as a whole 
took a more active involvement in the development of the 
Company’s succession processes. The senior leadership 
team was reviewed in more depth, both individually and as 
a whole, and it was agreed that this more detailed process 
would be completed annually. Action plans have already 
been implemented following the identiﬁcation of succession 
weaknesses and clear communication plans are also in 
place. The overall aim of this year’s review was to ensure 
that employees with the required skills, experience and 
knowledge are being suitably developed for the future and 
that adequate procedures are in place to encourage the 
development of talent across the Group. 
Indemnities
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, 
the Company has always indemniﬁed its Directors in respect 
of liabilities incurred as a result of their ofﬁce to the maximum 
extent permitted by law. Qualifying third-party indemnity 
provisions (as deﬁned in section 234 of the Companies Act 
2006) have been granted to all Directors in ofﬁce and to the 
Group Company Secretary and these remain in force as at 
the date of this report. The Company has also arranged 
appropriate insurance coverage in respect of legal action 
against its Directors and Ofﬁcers. Neither the Company’s 
indemnity nor insurance would provide any coverage to the 
extent that a Director is proved to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly. 46 Wolseley plc

Committees
The Committees of the Board consist of the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nominations, Disclosure and Treasury 
Committees. In addition, executive and management matters 
are addressed by the Executive Committee and other 
committees to whom speciﬁc authority has been delegated 
to implement Board strategy or policy. The formal terms of 
reference for the Board Committees, which have been 
approved by the Board and comply with the Code, are 
available from the Group Company Secretary and can also 
be found on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com. 
Membership and activities of the various Committees are 
summarised below. The Group Company Secretary and 
General Counsel, whose appointment and removal is a 
matter for the Board as a whole, acts as Secretary to all 
Board Committees.

held during the year ended 31 July 2010:
Chairman M P Wareing 3(3)
Members G Davis 4(4)
J I K Murray 4(4)
N M Stein 4(4)
The Committee is made up of four Non Executive 
Directors and the Board considers that each member of 
the Committee is independent within the deﬁnition set out 
in the Code. The Committee’s membership is reviewed by 
the Nominations Committee and by the Chair of the Audit 
Committee at regular intervals. Members of the Committee 
are appointed by the Board following recommendations by 
the Nominations Committee. All members of the Committee 
receive appropriate induction, which is in addition to the 
induction which all new Directors receive and includes an 
overview of the business, its ﬁnancial dynamics and risks. 
Members of the Committee may undertake ongoing training 
as required. Each member of the Committee brings relevant 
experience at a senior executive level. In addition to the 
existing members of the Audit Committee, Mr Wareing, who 
was International Chief Executive of KPMG until his retirement 
in September 2009, provides the Board with further 
assurance that the Audit Committee has the appropriate 
skills and experience and that it meets the Code requirements 
that at least one member of the Committee has signiﬁcant, 
recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience. The expertise and 
experience of each of the members of the Committee are 
summarised on pages 42 to 43. 
The Audit Committee has wide-ranging oversight 
responsibilities assigned to it by the Board. It reports regularly 
to the Board on compliance in relation to the business 
activities for which it has responsibility within its terms of 
reference. Audit Committee members are expected to have 
an understanding of the following areas:
• the principles of, contents of and developments in ﬁnancial 
reporting, including the applicable accounting standards 
and statements of recommended practice and, 
in particular, the appropriateness of the Company’s 
accounting policies and integrity of the ﬁnancial statements; 
• the Company’s wider corporate policies and its ﬁnancing; 
and;
• the Company’s systems of internal control and matters 
that require the use of judgement in the presentation 
of accounts and key ﬁgures as well as the role of internal 
and external auditors.

Owing to attendance at another Committee meeting and to a prior overseas 
business commitment, two Directors were each unable to attend a 
Nominations Committee meeting, which had been scheduled at relatively 
short notice. 
The Committee reviews the structure, size and composition 
of the Board and its Committees. It makes recommendations 
with regard to any changes that are considered necessary, 
both in the identiﬁcation and nomination of new Directors 
and the continuation of existing Directors in ofﬁce. There 
is a formal procedure in place for selecting and recruiting 
Directors. The Committee evaluates the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board and, in light of 
that evaluation, it prepares the description of the relevant 
role and capabilities required of prospective candidates. 
After a rigorous interview process of shortlisted candidates, 
the Committee makes its recommendations to the Board. 
The Committee retains external search consultants for 
appointments to the Board. Mr Whybrow would not chair the 
Committee or attend if it were to consider the appointment 
of a successor Chairman. The Committee also advises the 
Board on succession planning for Board appointments 
although the Board itself has overall responsibility for 
succession generally. 
The Committee meets as required and the matters discussed 
during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2010 primarily related 
to the changes of Executive Board members and the 
resulting succession plans.  Wolseley plc 47

All the members of the Remuneration Committee are 
considered independent within the deﬁnition set out in the 
Code. During the year, the Committee reviewed and updated 
its terms of reference to take into account developments 
in governance relating to remuneration and comments 
made in public consultation documents or reports on the 
subject of good practice regarding executive remuneration. 
The Committee has also conducted a detailed effectiveness 
survey to address its activities and to raise any concerns 
from both members and attendees of the Committee. 
The results of the survey showed that the Committee 
had been performing effectively; however, it highlighted 
some areas for improvement which the Committee has 
undertaken to adopt. 
The Committee has delegated authority to deal, on behalf of 
the Board, with all remuneration matters, including pension 
entitlements and any compensation payments. It is 
responsible for setting the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors and the Group Company Secretary in accordance 
with the remuneration policy approved by the Board. It is also 
responsible for determining the fees of the Chairman and for 
monitoring and approving the remuneration policy in relation 
to senior management below Board level. As part of the 
review of its terms of reference, the increased scope of the 
Committee’s role in setting the overarching principles and 
parameters of remuneration policy for the Group as a whole 
were updated. The Committee prepares, for the Board’s 
approval, the Remuneration report, which is presented to 
shareholders at each Annual General Meeting. The chairman 
of the Committee attends the Annual General Meeting to 
respond to any questions shareholders may raise on the 
Committee’s activities.

Report from the Audit Committee
The composition, attendance and responsibilities of the 
Audit Committee are set out on page 46.
Structure
The Committee meets regularly throughout the year and 
its agenda is linked to events in the Company’s ﬁnancial 
calendar. The Committee reviews the Company’s policies 
and procedures relating to governance, risk and control 
and, in addition to the regular items, each member of the 
Committee may request reports on matters of interest.
The Committee invites the Chairman, Group Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Group Financial Controller 
and the Head of Internal Audit, together with senior 
representatives of the Company’s external auditors, to 
attend each meeting and receive its papers, although it 
reserves part of each meeting for discussions without those 
invitees present. Other senior executives are also invited to 
certain meetings to present such reports as are required  
for the Committee to discharge its duties. The Committee 
members periodically meet the Head of Internal Audit  
and the external auditors without the presence of  
executive management.
The chairman of the Committee reports to the subsequent 
meeting of the Board on the key issues covered by the 
Committee, and the Board also receives copies of the 
minutes of each meeting. The chairman of the Committee 
attends the Annual General Meeting to respond to any 
shareholder questions that might be raised on the 
Committee’s activities.
Audit Committee effectiveness
Each year the Committee critically reviews its own 
performance and considers where improvements can be 
made. This year, the performance of the Committee was 
evaluated as part of a committee effectiveness review, 
as highlighted on page 45. The Committee’s terms of 
reference were reviewed and updated during the year.
Financial reporting
The Committee assists the Board to fulﬁl its responsibilities 
relating to external ﬁnancial reporting and associated 
announcements. During the year, the matters considered, 
either by the Committee or subsequently by the Board, 
included: 
• the Half Year and Full Year ﬁnancial statements, including 
the requirements for ﬁnancial reporting; 
• the Half Year and Annual Final results announcements 
made to the London Stock Exchange; 
• the Company’s Interim Management Statements and all 
proposed announcements to be made by the Company 
to the extent that they contained material ﬁnancial 
information; 
• documentation relating to tax-related matters associated 
with the Group’s corporate structure; 
• accounting and auditing issues; 
• review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function 
and the review of the effectiveness and continued 
independence of the external auditor; 
• litigation, contingent liabilities and tax matters, including 
compliance with statutory tax obligations; 
• fraud reports and the operation of the Company’s 
whistleblowing policy;
• the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control and 
risk management procedures;
• the updated Company policies and procedures relating to 
fraud and the prevention of corruption and the Company’s 
new Code of Conduct; and
• the evaluation of the Committee’s own effectiveness.
External audit and external auditors
The Committee is also responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Company’s policy 
on external audit and the Committee reserves oversight 
responsibility for monitoring independence, objectivity 
and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. 
The Committee recommends the appointment and 
reappointment of the Company’s external auditors and 
annually reviews a formal letter provided by the external 
auditors conﬁrming their independence and objectivity 
within the context of applicable regulatory requirements 
and professional standards.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company’s 
auditors for many years. The Committee is satisﬁed with 
their effectiveness and independence and has not 
considered it necessary this year to conduct a tender 
process for the appointment of its auditors. In 2009, 
the Committee carried out a review of its auditors, which 
included cost comparisons. This provided the Committee 
with the assurance that the auditors continued to be 
cost-effective.
The Committee monitors the rotation of key partners within 
the external auditors from time to time in accordance with 
UK regulations. The Committee also scrutinises all 
proposals for non-audit work to be performed by the 
external auditors for the Company, to ensure that the 
provision of those non-audit services falls within the agreed 
policy regarding such services and does not impair the 
objectivity or independence of the external auditors. 
Under the policy, the external auditors cannot be 
engaged to perform any of the following services:
• book-keeping services related to accounting records 
or ﬁnancial statements; 
• design and implementation of ﬁnancial information 
systems;  Wolseley plc 49
Annual Report and Accounts 2010

Financial statements
Other information
• appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions and 
contributions in kind reports; 
• actuarial services; 
• internal audit outsourcing services; 
• management functions including human resources; 
• broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment 
banking services; or 
• legal and other services unrelated to audit work. 
The policy requires pre-approval by the chairman of the 
Committee for any non-audit work, subject to maximum 
budget levels. The external auditors provide audit related 
services such as regulatory and statutory reporting, and 
reviewing shareholder or other circulars. The external 
auditors report to the Committee any material departures 
from Group accounting policies and procedures that they 
identify during the course of their audit work. Within the 
constraints of the APB Ethical Standards on Auditing, the 
external auditors undertake certain due diligence reviews 
and provide assistance on tax matters. The provision of 
non-audit services within such constraints of the agreed 
policy is assessed on a case by case basis so that the 
best-placed adviser is retained. 
During the year, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness 
of the external auditors, which included receiving responses 
from each of the Group’s operating companies and 
considered whether the agreed audit plan had been 
fulﬁlled and the reasons for any variation from the plan. 
The Committee also considered the external auditors’ 
rigour and the degree to which the external auditors were 
able to assess key accounting and audit judgements. 
The Committee reviewed and approved the terms, areas 
of responsibility and scope of the audit (including schedules 
of unadjusted errors and representation letters) as set 
out in the external auditors’ engagement letter; the overall 
work plan for the forthcoming year, together with the 
cost-effectiveness of the audit as well as the auditors’ 
remuneration and performance; any issues which arose 
during the course of the audit and their resolution; key 
accounting and audit judgements; errors identiﬁed during 
the audit; and the recommendations made to management 
by the auditors and management’s response.
The total fees paid to PricewaterhouseCoopers in the year 
ended 31 July 2010 were £10.4 million (2009: £13.4 million), 
of which £6.7 million (2009: £8.5 million) related to non-audit 
work. £1 million of the non-audit work fees were pursuant 
to work required in relation to the Group’s proposed change 
in corporate structure and domicile. Further disclosure of 
the non-audit fees paid during the year ended 31 July 2010 
can be found in note 3 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Internal audit
The internal audit function is fully independent of the 
day-to-day operations of the Group. It is involved in the 
assessment of the quality of risk management and internal 
control and helps to promote and further develop effective 
risk management within the businesses. Certain internal 
audit assignments (such as those requiring specialist 
expertise) continue to be outsourced by the Head of Internal 
Audit to KPMG LLP as required. A policy has been 
established which restricts the recruitment of staff from 
both KPMG LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The 
Head of Internal Audit attends all Audit Committee meetings 
in addition to having regular meetings with the chairman of 
the Committee. The Committee reviews key performance 
indicators relating to the activity of the department. 
These reviews occur either at each Committee meeting, 
or annually when KPIs are reviewed against the audit plan. 
The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group’s 
internal audit function, including its terms of reference, its 
audit plans, its general performance and its relationship 
with the external auditors. Throughout the year, the 
Committee reviewed the internal audit function’s plans and 
its achievements against those plans. The Committee 
considered the results of the audits undertaken by the 
internal audit function and considered the adequacy of 
management’s response to matters raised, including the 
time taken to resolve any such matters. The Committee 
carried out its annual review to consider the effectiveness 
of the internal audit function using guidance issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales and 
the Institute of Internal Auditors – UK.
Internal control
The Board retains overall responsibility for internal control, 
for establishing the systems of internal control and reviewing 
their effectiveness and for the identiﬁcation and 
management of business risk. 
The Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of 
the Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies 
and practices, standards of risk management and risk 
management procedures and compliance controls, as 
well as the Company’s statements on internal controls, 
before they are agreed by the Board for each year’s 
Annual Report. 
In a decentralised Group, where local management has 
considerable autonomy to run and develop their 
businesses, a well-designed system of internal control is 
necessary to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the 
Company’s assets and depends on regular evaluation on 
the extent of the risks to which the Company is exposed. 
In accordance with the guidance set out in the Turnbull 
Report “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code”, an ongoing process has been 
established for identifying, managing and evaluating the 
risks faced by the Group, including reputational risk, and 
the effective internal controls required to maintain such 
effectiveness.
The Group’s internal control systems are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate business risk. They facilitate 
the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our operations; 
safeguard the Group’s assets against material misstatement 
or loss; contribute to the safeguarding of assets, including 
the prevention and detection of fraud; fairly report the 
Group’s performance and position; maintain the reliability of 
both internal and external reporting and ensure compliance 
with relevant legislation, regulation and best practice, 
including that related to social, environmental and ethical 
matters. These systems and their effectiveness have been 
in place for the full ﬁnancial year and up to the date on  50 Wolseley plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Corporate governance report continued
which the ﬁnancial statements were approved, and are 
reviewed by the Board regularly to deal with any changing 
circumstances.
Effective ﬁnancial controls, including the maintenance of 
proper accounting records, are an important element of 
internal control. They help ensure that the Company is not 
unnecessarily exposed to avoidable ﬁnancial risks and that 
published ﬁnancial information is reliable. Summaries of the 
key ﬁnancial risks inherent in the Group’s business are given 
in the Financial review on pages 26 to 29 and in note 29 
of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. 
The Company’s whistleblowing policy, which supports 
the Group-wide Code of Conduct, gives details of the 
international conﬁdential telephone reporting lines and 
secure website reporting facility, which are operated on 
behalf of the Group by an independent third party. The 
reporting channels are a conﬁdential means for employees 
to notify any concerns about actual or potential breaches 
of law or company policy, including in relation to accounting, 
risk issues, internal controls, auditing issues and related 
matters. All matters reported are investigated and, where 
appropriate, reported to the Committee. Statistics on the 
volume and general nature of all disclosures made are 
reported to the Committee quarterly. A copy of the Group’s 
Code of Conduct is available on the Company’s website at 
www.wolseley.com. Information on the improvements 
that the Company has made to its ethics programme 
(including its Code of Conduct and policies on prevention 
of fraud and corruption) is included in the Corporate 
Responsibility report on page 39.
Control processes
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives 
annually and approves Group company budgets and 
strategies in light of these. Control is exercised at Group 
and business unit level through monthly monitoring of 
performance by comparison to budgets, forecasts and 
cash targets and by regular visits to Group companies by 
the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and 
Managing Directors of our main geographical units. 
The Board has formal procedures in place for the approval 
of investment, acquisition and disposal projects, with 
designated levels of authority, supported by post-investment 
review processes for major acquisitions or disposals and 
capital expenditure. The Board takes account of social, 
environmental and ethical matters in relation to the Group’s 
businesses when reviewing the risks faced by the Group. 
The Board is conscious of the effect such matters may 
have on the short- and long-term value of the Company.
Risk management
The detailed review of risk management is carried out by 
the Committee, with responsibility for the risk management 
process, as well as the internal control programme, 
delegated to the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer. The risk 
management programme is owned by the Group Executive, 
facilitated by the Group Company Secretary and General 
Counsel, while a dedicated Group Head of Risk has 
responsibility for the day-to-day management of the 
programme. During the ﬁnancial year, the risk management 
programme was further improved throughout the Group, 
following the introduction during 2009 of an upgraded risk 
assessment and reporting tool.
This provides a more consistent analysis of risks, a more 
effective means of ensuring accountability, and a more 
rigorous means of measuring responses, identifying key 
risks and reviewing risk mitigation plans.
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral part of the 
Group’s annual planning cycle. The management team of 
each Group company is responsible for risk management 
and internal control within its own business and for ensuring 
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. Each 
Group company or business unit has also appointed a risk 
director whose primary role in such capacity is to ensure 
compliance by local management with the Group’s risk 
management programme and to document the strategic 
objectives and the effectiveness of the Group’s systems 
of both internal control and risk management activities. 
Group operating companies and Head Ofﬁce functions are 
required to submit risk management reports bi-annually to 
the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer which identify and document 
each signiﬁcant risk, together with the mitigating actions 
taken, and to be taken, to manage, monitor or reduce those 
risks. The Executive Committee and senior management 
review these submissions and the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer 
presents them to the Committee. The chairman of the 
Committee reports to the Board on any matters which have 
arisen from the Committee’s review of the way in which the 
risk management and internal control processes have been 
applied and on any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, these 
processes. These processes have been in place throughout 
the year ended 31 July 2010 and have continued to the date 
of this report.
The internal auditors have reviewed the overall approach 
adopted by the Group towards its risk management activities 
and the improvements made have also been taken into 
account so as to reinforce the Company’s internal control 
procedures. More information on the Group’s approach is 
set out in Risk Management on pages 30 to 33.
Compliance statement
The Company applied all of the principles set out in 
section 1 of the Code for the period under review and has, 
throughout the year, complied with the detailed provisions 
set out therein. The Company’s auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, are required to review 
whether the above statement reﬂects the Company’s 
compliance with the nine provisions of the Code speciﬁed 
for their review by the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority and to report if it does not reﬂect such 
compliance. No such report has been made.

Directors’ responsibility 
statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Remuneration report and the ﬁnancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRSs”), as adopted by the European Union, and the 
parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(“UK GAAP”) (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and 
applicable law). In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRSs, issued 
by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). 
Under company law, the Directors must not approve the 
ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Company and 
Group for that period.
In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union 
and IFRSs issued by IASB and applicable UK Accounting 
Standards, have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Group and 
parent company ﬁnancial statements respectively; and 
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern 
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business. 
 
 
 
 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company 
and the Group and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial 
statements and the Directors’ Remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United 
Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of ﬁnancial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are 
listed on pages 42 to 43, conﬁrms that, to the best of his 
knowledge:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and 
loss of the Group; and 
• the Financial review contained in the Directors’ report 
includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces. 52 Wolseley plc

There are no restrictions on the voting rights attached to the 
Company’s ordinary shares or on the transfer of securities in 
the Company. No person holds securities in the Company 
carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. 
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the 
transfer of securities or on voting rights. The Company’s 
Articles of Association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the Company’s shareholders.
Share options
During the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2010, options were 
exercised pursuant to the Company’s share option schemes 
resulting in the allotment of 560,458 ordinary 10 pence 
shares. A further 7 ,605 ordinary 10 pence shares have been 
allotted under these schemes since the end of the ﬁnancial 
year to the date of this report. Details of shares issued during 
the year are set out in note 34 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Employee Beneﬁt T rusts
The Wolseley plc 2004 Overseas Employee Beneﬁt Trust, 
the Wolseley plc 2004 Employee Beneﬁt Trust and the 
Wolseley plc 2004 Directors’ Beneﬁt Trust were established 
in October 2004 in connection with the Wolseley Share 
Option Plan 2003 and the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term 
Incentive Scheme, details of which are set out in the 
Remuneration report. The trustees of each of the Trusts have 
waived their rights to receive dividends on any shares held 
by them. At the date of this report, the Trust holds 1,948,919 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each. 
Authority to issue shares
At the Annual General Meeting held in 2009, authority was 
given to the Directors to allot new 10 pence ordinary shares 
up to a nominal value of £18,922,625. The Directors intend to 
propose at the next Annual General Meeting to seek authority 
to allot and grant rights to subscribe for or to convert 
securities into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£18,958,599, representing approximately two-thirds of the 
Company’s issued share capital as at 27 September 2010, 
of which 94,792,996 shares (representing approximately 
one-third of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital) 
may only be allotted pursuant to a fully pre-emptive rights 
issue. If approved, this authority will expire at the conclusion 
of the Annual General Meeting to be held in December 2011.
Subject to the terms of the authority noted above, the 
Directors will also recommend that they be empowered to 
allot equity securities for cash other than pro rata to existing 
shareholders, until the Annual General Meeting to be held 
in December 2011. This authority shall be limited to the 
allotment of equity securities for cash, in connection with 
an open offer to existing shareholders in proportion to their 
existing holdings up to an aggregate nominal amount of 
£1,422,037 , being 5 per cent of the ordinary share capital 
issued at the date of this report. The Directors currently have 
no intention to issue ordinary shares, other than pursuant 
to the Company’s employee share schemes and any share 
dividend alternatives. The Directors recommend that you 
vote in favour of these resolutions to maintain the Company’s 
ﬂexibility in relation to future share issues, including any 
issues to ﬁnance business opportunities should appropriate 
circumstances arise.
Authority to purchase shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the 
Company to purchase its own ordinary shares and a special 
resolution will be proposed at the next Annual General 
Meeting to renew the Directors’ limited authority, last granted 
in 2009, to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares in the 
market. The authority will be limited to a maximum of 
28,440,742 ordinary shares (being approximately 10 per cent 
of the Company’s issued share capital at the date of this 
report) and sets the minimum and maximum prices which 
may be paid. The Directors will use this authority to purchase 
shares only after careful consideration, taking into account 
market conditions, other investment opportunities, 
appropriate gearing levels and the overall ﬁnancial position 
of the Company. The authority will enable the Directors 
to continue to be able to respond promptly should 
circumstances arise in which they consider that such 
a purchase would result in an increase in earnings per 
share and would be in the best interests of the Company. Wolseley plc 53

Other information
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) 
Regulations 2003 allow shares purchased by the Company to 
be held as treasury shares that may be cancelled, sold for 
cash or used for the purpose of employee share schemes. 
The Company holds no shares in treasury but the Directors 
currently intend that any shares which are purchased will be 
held in treasury. The authorities to be sought by each of the 
resolutions noted above are intended to apply equally to 
shares to be held by the Company as treasury shares and to 
the sale of treasury shares. The Directors consider it desirable 
for these general authorities to be available to provide ﬂexibility 
in the management of the Company’s capital resources. 
Auditors and audit information
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue as 
auditors of the Company and resolutions concerning their 
reappointment and the determination of their remuneration 
will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting.
The Directors in ofﬁce at the date of this report conﬁrm that, 
so far as they are each aware, in respect of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2010, 
there is no relevant audit information of which 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are unaware and each 
Director has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken 
as a Director to be aware, in respect of the consolidated 
ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 July 2010, 
of any relevant audit information and to establish that 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are aware of that information.
Change of control
The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
that would provide compensation for loss of ofﬁce or 
employment resulting from a change of control following a 
takeover bid, except that provisions of the Company’s share 
schemes may cause options and awards granted under such 
schemes to vest in those circumstances. All of the 
Company’s share schemes contain provisions relating to a 
change of control. Outstanding options and awards would 
normally vest and become exercisable for a limited period 
of time upon a change of control following a takeover, 
reconstruction or winding up of the Company (not being 
an internal reorganisation), subject at that time to rules 
concerning the satisfaction of any performance conditions.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms 
and conditions of trading with their suppliers. It is the 
Company’s policy that payments to suppliers are made 
within agreed terms and are, where applicable, consistent 
with The Prompt Payment Code, which is sponsored by the 
UK Department for Business Innovation & Skills (“BIS”). 
Copies of this Code can be obtained from BIS. At 31 July 
2010, the Company had no trade creditors (2009: nil). 
The amount of trade creditors for the Group as at 
31 July 2010 was equivalent to 67 days (2009: 65 days) 
of trade purchases.
Donations
The Group’s charitable donations in 2010 totalled £1,521,000 
(2009: £1,555,000).
At each of the Annual General Meetings held since 2002, 
shareholders have passed a resolution, as a precaution, 
to approve donations to political organisations and to incur 
political expenditure (as such terms are now deﬁned in 
sections 362 to 379 of the Companies Act 2006). Each year, 
the Board has conﬁrmed that it operates a policy of not 
giving any cash contribution to any political party in the 
ordinary meaning of those words and that it has no intention 
of changing that policy. The Directors propose to seek, once 
more, authority for the Group to make political donations 
and/or incur political expenditure for amounts not exceeding 
£125,000 in a total aggregate, which they might otherwise be 
prohibited from making or incurring under the terms of the 
Companies Act 2006 and which would not amount to 
“donations” in the ordinary sense of the word. This authority 
would last until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting.
Employees
We believe that our employees are central to our future 
success. The Group actively encourages employee 
involvement and places particular importance on keeping 
employees regularly informed on the Company’s activities 
and ﬁnancial performance and on matters affecting them 
individually and the business generally. This can be through 
informal bulletins, in-house publications and brieﬁngs, as well 
as via the Company’s intranet sites. The Group operates on a 
largely decentralised basis with a rigorous control framework 
exercised by a small head ofﬁce team. This allows for greater 
autonomy and accountability at a local level and provides 
encouragement for the development of entrepreneurial ﬂair. 
Local management is responsible for maintaining high 
standards of health and safety and for ensuring that there 
is appropriate employee involvement in decision making.
A European Works Council (“EWC”) has been operating 
since 1996 to provide a forum for informing and consulting 
employees in Europe on such matters as signiﬁcant 
developments in the Group’s operations, management’s 
plans and expectations, organisational changes within the 
Group and also for employee representatives to consult 
Group management about concerns over any aspect of 
the Group’s operations. At the date of this report, there 
were 24 EWC representatives of which 18 were employee 
representatives and six were management representatives. 
Employee representatives are appointed from each European 
country in which Wolseley operates, with more than one 
employee representative appointed from the UK, France 
and Denmark.
All employees are offered a range of beneﬁts depending 
on their local environment. They are also encouraged to build 
a stake in the Company through the ownership of shares, 
where possible, through participation in the Company’s 
employee share schemes.
Employment policies
Our employment policies aim to attract the very best people 
and we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture is a key 
factor in being a successful business. The Group remains 
committed to equality of opportunity in all of its employment 
practices. It is the Group’s policy that the selection of 
employees for appointment, career development and 
promotion be determined solely on the skills and attributes 
which are relevant to the job and which are in accordance 
with the laws of the country concerned, without having 
regard to an employee’s gender, race, religion, age or 
disability. Ongoing training of employees and the continued 
development of their skills is of prime importance to the 
Group. These policies also cover the continuation of 
employment and appropriate retraining for employees 
who become disabled during their employment. 54 Wolseley plc

UK pension schemes
Wolseley currently has two pension schemes in respect 
of UK employees: 
Deﬁned Beneﬁt Scheme – the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Beneﬁts Plan and the William Wilson Group Pension Scheme 
merged on 1 January 2010. Both have been closed to new 
entrants since 31 May 2009. The merged plan is known as 
the Wolseley Group Retirement Beneﬁts Plan and has three 
trustees consisting of an independent trustee, a member-
nominated trustee and a corporate trustee. The corporate 
trustee consists of nine trustee directors and, save for 
Mr David Tucker, chairman of the trustees and Ian Percy, CBE, 
a trustee director, all of the other trustees and trustee directors 
are UK-based employees or former employees of the Group.
Deﬁned Contribution Scheme – the Wolseley Group Deﬁned 
Contribution Plan is a trust-based deﬁned contribution 
pension scheme with three Company-nominated trustees, 
one of whom is an independent trustee and two who are 
UK-based employees of the Group. In addition, there are 
potentially three member-nominated trustees. In July 2009 
only one member was nominated; a further selection process 
was run in August 2010. The chairman of the trustees is 
Wayne Phelan of PS Independent Trustees Limited. 
Communication with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on 
communication with its shareholders, including its employee 
shareholders. Our investor relations policy reﬂects our 
commitment to our shareholders. It includes:
• regular dialogue with institutional shareholders; 
• meetings with shareholder representatives; 
• promotion of communication with private shareholders 
through their attendance at the Annual General Meeting; 
• close involvement in investor relations by the Group Chief 
Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer; 
• ensuring that the views of our major shareholders are 
reported to the Board by the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and 
by the Chairman and are discussed at its meetings; and
• the maintenance of contact, when appropriate, with 
shareholders to discuss overall remuneration plans 
and policies.
The Chairman ensures that the Board as a whole maintains 
an appropriate dialogue with shareholders and, although the 
Non Executive Directors are not formally asked, at present, 
to meet the Company’s shareholders, their attendance at 
presentations of the Annual Final and Half Year Results is 
encouraged. A senior executive has day-to-day responsibility 
for all investor relations matters and for contact with 
institutional shareholders, as well as with ﬁnancial analysts, 
brokers and the media. Investor relations are controlled by 
written guidelines to ensure the protection and appropriate 
disclosure of sensitive information which could affect the 
Company’s share price and which has not already been 
made generally available to the Company’s shareholders. 
The Annual Report and Accounts are available to all 
shareholders either in paper form or electronically and can be 
accessed via the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com 
or via Shareview, an internet service offered by the 
Company’s Registrars, as detailed in Shareholder information 
on page 142. The Group’s Half Year and Annual Final Results, 
as well as all announcements issued to the London Stock 
Exchange, are published on the Company’s website,  
www.wolseley.com. During the year, the Company issued 
regular updates to the market and these, together with 
copies of presentations to analysts and interviews with the 
Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, are also 
posted on the Company’s website. 
Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
The AGM will take place on 20 January 2011.
AGM procedure
The Notice of the AGM is circulated to all shareholders 
at least 20 working days before such meeting and it is 
Company policy not to combine resolutions to be proposed 
at general meetings. All shareholders are invited to the 
Company’s AGM, at which they have the opportunity to put 
questions to the Board and it is standard practice to have the 
Senior Independent Director and the chairmen of the Audit, 
Nominations and Remuneration Committees available 
(whether in person or by video link) to answer questions. 
Some questions may not be answered at the meeting, 
should they not be in the interests of the Company, involve 
the disclosure of conﬁdential information or if it would not 
be to the good order of the meeting. The Chairman may also 
nominate a Company representative to answer a speciﬁc 
question after the AGM or may refer to a response on the 
Company’s website. 
The proxy votes received for and against each resolution, 
as well as abstentions which may be recorded on the proxy 
form accompanying the Notice of Meeting, are counted 
before the AGM and the results are made available shortly 
after the meeting. The results are also announced to the 
London Stock Exchange via Regulatory News Service and 
are published on the Company’s website.
AGM resolutions
The resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to be held on 
20 January 2011, together with explanatory notes, will be 
detailed in full in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 
issued to each shareholder in advance of the meeting. 
This document will be available on the Company’s website 
at www.wolseley.com
The location of the AGM and the details of some of the 
resolutions to be put to the meeting may change if the 
Company’s proposals to change its corporate holding 
structure are approved. The Company, and if the proposals 
are approved, the new holding company for the Group, 
will keep shareholders informed.

Remuneration report
For the year ended 31 July 2010
Introduction
This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 (the “Act”), the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority 
and Statutory Instrument 2008/410: The Large and Medium-
sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008 (the “Regulations”). Furthermore, the Board 
has applied the principles of good governance relating to 
Directors’ remuneration contained within the UK Combined 
Code (the “Code”) and, where applicable, has already 
adopted principles from the UK Corporate Governance Code 
(the “Governance Code”) which will come into effect from 
ﬁnancial years beginning or after 29 June 2010. The Act 
requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
shareholders on the audited information within this report 
and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report 
have been prepared in accordance with the Act. The auditors’ 
opinion is set out on page 125 and those aspects of the 
report which have been subject to audit are clearly marked.
Remuneration Committee
The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. 
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within 
its agreed terms of reference (available on the Company’s 
website, www.wolseley.com) on the Company’s framework 
of executive remuneration and its cost. It determines, with the 
agreement of the Board, speciﬁc remuneration packages for 
each of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Group 
Company Secretary. It also determines the remuneration, 
based on proposals from the Group Chief Executive, for the 
members of the Executive Committee. The Chairman and 
the Executive Directors determine the remuneration of the 
Non Executive Directors. The Committee is also responsible 
for the Company’s share incentive schemes for all employees. 
Following a review of its terms of reference during the ﬁnancial 
year, the Committee broadened the scope of its work to 
include the review of overall remuneration policy for 
employees below executive level.
The current members of the Committee, as detailed on 
page 47 , consist of four Non Executive Directors, all of whom 
are independent within the deﬁnition set out in the Code. 
The Group Chief Executive, Mr Meakins, the Chairman, 
Mr Whybrow and the Group HR Director, Mr Morrison, are 
usually invited to attend the meetings to respond to speciﬁc 
questions raised by members of the Committee. This 
speciﬁcally excludes such matters concerning the details 
of and any discussions relating to their own remuneration. 
To reach informed decisions on executive remuneration, 
the Committee sources detailed external research on market 
data and trends from experienced independent consultants. 
Since 2003, the Committee has sought external advice from 
Hewitt New Bridge Street, who provide no other services 
to the Company. A review of the service provided by Hewitt 
New Bridge Street took place in September 2009 and in 
October 2009 it was agreed that their contract would be 
renewed for a further year. The Committee met six times 
during the year, at which all eligible Committee members 
were in attendance. Mr Le Goff attended one meeting, in July 
2010, after his appointment to the Committee in May 2010. 
The Committee has scheduled meetings throughout the year, 
as well as ad hoc meetings to consider additional items as 
they arise. For example, an ad hoc meeting was called in 
January 2010 to review and approve the severance packages 
for the outgoing Directors and the service agreement and 
remuneration for the new Executive Director.
Dear Shareholder 
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) has 
continued its approach of reviewing the packages of the 
senior executives and wider remuneration policies in 
general, taking into account the challenging business 
conditions in a global economy balanced by the need to 
ensure that executives are fully incentivised to deliver 
shareholder value. In so doing, the Committee has agreed 
the following key policy decisions for 2010/11:
• the approach to Executive Directors’ base salaries 
would be the same as that for the whole of the UK 
workforce, or in the case of our US-based director, 
the US equivalent. Non Executive Directors’ fees have 
been reviewed using the same policy and will not be 
increased for the 2010/11 year; and
• at the start of the ﬁnancial year 2009/10, a key focus 
for the Company was the continued generation of cash 
ﬂow. This was reﬂected in its equal weighting with 
trading proﬁt on bonus plans. Signiﬁcant strides have 
been made in reducing Group debt, to the extent that 
greater focus is now concentrated on trading proﬁt. 
Accordingly, the weightings in the Directors’ bonus plans 
have been modiﬁed to reﬂect this.
2009/10 was a very challenging year for the Company. 
Despite falling sales the Committee set ﬁnancial objectives 
aiming to exceed the previous year’s trading proﬁt while 
delivering further reductions in net debt. By the second 
half of the year the Company was again delivering 
like-for-like sales growth, underperforming businesses 
were either restructured or disposed and trading proﬁt 
exceeded the previous year. Having delivered against 
challenging ﬁnancial objectives, set against the backdrop 
of continuing market declines, the Committee has 
approved bonuses at the upper end of the range.
In 2009, share options and long term incentive plan 
awards were scaled back to reﬂect the greater expected 
value arising from share price volatility. Award ranges will 
remain broadly the same for 2010, recognising the 
improved outlook for future performance improvements. 
2010 earnings per share fell from 2009 levels but the 
Committee has decided to retain the higher 2009 EPS as 
the base from which future performance targets are set. 
Consequently, vesting will require 2011 earnings in 
excess of consensus and 2012 and 2013 earnings 
at historical levels.
The Committee appreciates the dialogue and feedback 
it receives from investors and it hopes to receive your 
support at the AGM on 20 January 2011.

Policy on Directors’ remuneration
Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy continues to be to 
provide remuneration packages that fairly reward Executive 
Directors for the contribution they make to the business, 
taking into account the size and complexity of the Group’s 
operations and the need to attract, retain and motivate 
executives of the highest quality. Remuneration packages 
comprise salary, performance bonuses, share options, long 
term incentive awards, beneﬁts in kind and retirement beneﬁt 
provisions. The Company takes into account all of these 
individual elements in adopting a comprehensive approach 
to remuneration.
The Company’s policy is that each of the packages should 
incorporate components linking individual and Company 
performance, short- and long-term returns, as well as 
absolute and relative ﬁnancial performance. None of the 
variable elements of remuneration are pensionable. These 
packages have been designed by the Company to be broadly 
comparable with those offered by other similar international 
businesses and reﬂect competitive practices in the countries 
and markets in which the Executive Directors operate.
The Committee believes that the choice of performance 
measures for the Company’s incentive plans continues to 
be suitable and provides an appropriate mix and balance. 
Following a review completed during the year, it is felt that 
the choice of EPS growth as a performance measurement 
for executive share options continues to be appropriate. 
The Committee reviewed the EPS targets in respect of the 
2009 executive share option awards and adjustments were 
made in order to increase the targets so as to ensure that 
they remained demanding for the next three years. During 
the year the Committee also completed a thorough review 
of alternative comparator groups for measurement of TSR 
under the Long Term Incentive Scheme. It concluded that 
the existing TSR comparator group remained the most 
appropriate. The policy is designed such that a signiﬁcant 
proportion of total remuneration is performance-related to 
incentivise the Executive Directors to meet the Company’s 
ﬁnancial and strategic objectives. The Committee considers 
that the targets set for the different elements of performance 
related remuneration are appropriate and demanding in 
the context of the Company’s trading environment and 
the business challenges it faces, and that the targets 
align executives’ interests with those of the shareholders. 
The contribution of ﬁnancial bonus targets based on trading 
proﬁt and cash ﬂow, personal targets linked to customer 
service, health and safety and other strategic objectives, 
and longer term incentives provide strong alignment with 
the Group’s strategy.
The following chart shows total remuneration (base salary, 
target and maximum amounts relating to bonus and the 
value of long term incentive awards and executive share 
options granted during the ﬁnancial year) for the Executive 
Directors in ofﬁce during ﬁnancial year 2009/10:
Non Executive Directors 
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors is made up 
of a basic fee plus an additional fee where a Non Executive 
Director acts as chairman of either the Audit or Remuneration 
Committees or has been nominated as Senior Independent 
Director; details of these fees are listed below. The Non 
Executive Directors’ fees are reviewed from time to time 
by the Chairman and the Executive Directors of the Board. 
Fees Additional fees
Senior Independent Director £10,000
Remuneration Committee chairman £12,000
Audit Committee chairman £16,000
The Non Executive Directors have letters of engagement 
rather than service agreements and do not participate in any 
incentive plan, nor is any pension payable in respect of their 
services as Non Executive Directors. 
The Board’s policy is that Non Executive Directors are 
normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which is 
then reviewed and extended for a further three-year period. 
Appointments may be terminated upon six months’ notice 
by either party. There are no provisions for compensation 
in the event of termination. The terms and conditions of 
appointment of the Non Executive Directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered ofﬁce during normal 
business hours and at the Annual General Meeting.

Salaries
The Committee intends that base salary reﬂects the level of 
responsibility of the Director, the relevant market in which he 
operates and individual performance. Independent external 
advice is taken to benchmark salaries with market data, 
derived from a group of companies selected on the basis 
of comparable size, geographic spread and business focus. 
It is the Committee’s objective to set basic salaries around 
the market median, with the opportunity to go above this 
level in the event of sustained individual high performance. 
In accordance with the core principles of the Governance 
Code, consideration has also been given to general pay and 
employment conditions across the Group. The Committee 
will continue to assess these and other matters, such as 
the prevailing market conditions, when determining levels 
of remuneration for Executive Directors and the 
Executive Committee.
For new appointments, in particular internal promotions, the 
policy is for base salary to progress towards the mid-market, 
once expertise and performance has been proven and 
sustained. The payment of salaries at this level is considered 
appropriate for motivation and retention of the calibre of 
executive required to ensure the successful management 
of the Company in the challenging international business 
environment in which it operates.
The Committee reviews the fees of the Chairman and the 
salaries of the Executive Directors annually, having sought 
the views of both the Chairman and the Group Chief 
Executive (other than in the case of their own remuneration). 
In recognition of the ﬁnancial circumstances faced by the 
Company during 2009, the Committee agreed that base 
salaries for each Executive Director and the Executive 
Committee for the ﬁnancial year commencing 1 August 2009 
remain unchanged from the amounts paid from 1 August 
2008. The Board also agreed that the fees payable to the 
Non Executive Directors should also remain unchanged for 
the ﬁnancial year 2009/10.
Following receipt of external market data, consideration of 
the performance of each Executive Director, and increases 
for the wider employee population, the Committee agreed 
that base salaries for each Executive Director and the 
Executive Committee for the ﬁnancial year commencing 
1 August 2010 should be reviewed. It was agreed that the 
fees payable to the Chairman and Non Executive Directors 
should remain unchanged for the forthcoming ﬁnancial year. 
The fees payable to the Chairman and Non Executive 
Directors and base salaries in respect of the Executive 
Directors for the ﬁnancial year commencing 1 August 2010 
are therefore as follows: J W Whybrow £360,500; I K Meakins 
£794,375; J Martin £492,000; F W Roach $986,637; and, 
for each of the Non Executive Directors, £61,800 (exclusive 
of Committee fees). In the case of the Executive Directors, 
this represents an increase of 2.5 per cent with the exception 
of F W Roach, which represents an increase of 3 per cent.
Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements for the Executive Directors 
are designed to encourage individual performance, corporate 
operating efﬁciencies and proﬁtable growth. Stretching 
targets are set for each element of the bonus, determined by 
the Committee each year, which also considers the levels of 
performance targets to be achieved for bonus payments to 
be made in the succeeding year. The annual bonus awards 
are based on a mix of demanding ﬁnancial targets, derived 
from the Company’s annual long-term strategic business 
plan and annual budget, as well as market expectations. 
For ﬁnancial year 2009/10, 80 per cent of potential bonus 
was driven by ﬁnancial performance, with the balance 
depending on speciﬁc strategic personal objectives set 
for each Executive Director and member of the Executive 
Committee. The ﬁnancial performance measure was targeted 
equally at trading proﬁt and cash ﬂow, with tough trading 
proﬁt and cash stretch targets set for each market and at 
the overall Company level to drive the turnaround in business 
performance that the Board identiﬁed was necessary. 
Depending on their particular responsibilities and their 
performance, Executive Directors were eligible to receive 
up to 100 per cent of salary for UK-based directors and up 
to 110 per cent of salary for US-based directors, for on-target 
performance. No Director fully achieved the stretch levels 
for their personal objectives in the year.
For the forthcoming ﬁnancial year, the ﬁnancial components 
will continue to account for 80 per cent of the total potential 
bonus, with increased weighting on trading proﬁt. 
The remaining 20 per cent will again target speciﬁc strategic 
personal objectives for each Executive Director. The Committee 
believes that setting such stretching targets is appropriate 
and will report on achievement against them in similar terms 
in next year’s report. The Committee has determined that 
the following percentages of base salary will be payable as 
bonus, subject to the achievement of the minimum, on-target 
and maximum levels of performance for each element (with 
the percentages increasing on a linear basis for achievement 
between each level):

Beneﬁts in kind
Beneﬁts in kind consist of the provision of car beneﬁts at the 
Company’s expense and healthcare insurance. In addition, 
to ensure that Mr Roach as a senior executive and US citizen 
is not disadvantaged as a result of paying both UK and US 
taxes on his income, the Company meets the cost of any 
additional tax he would be obliged to pay through the 
operation of a tax equalisation mechanism. Wolseley plc 59

Executive Board changes
On 25 January 2010, the Company announced that 
Mr Robert Marchbank, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer for Europe 
and Managing Director of Wolseley UK Limited, would step 
down from the Board on 1 March 2010 as the European role 
was no longer appropriate following a review of the overall 
business structure. It was also announced that Mr Stephen 
Webster would step down as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of 
the Company from 31 March 2010 with Mr John W Martin 
succeeding him from 1 April 2010. 
The Committee agreed a package for Mr Martin, which is 
considered to be competitive, appropriately incentivising 
and in alignment with the interests of the Company’s 
shareholders. This comprised an annual base salary of 
£480,000, a maximum annual bonus for 2009/10 of 100 per 
cent of base salary and total awards in 2009/10 of executive 
share options and long term incentive awards of 125 per cent 
and 90 per cent of base salary respectively. A cash 
allowance of 25 per cent of base salary in lieu of joining the 
Company pension scheme was also made to Mr Martin.
Mr Marchbank received a termination payment and beneﬁts 
consistent with his entitlements upon his redundancy.
The outgoing Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Mr Webster, received 
the contractual severance entitlement of 12 months’ salary 
and beneﬁts. Under the respective share plan rules, all of his 
share options and long term incentives, to the extent not 
already exercised, lapsed on 31 March 2010. Mr Webster 
continued to be eligible for a bonus payment for the ﬁnancial 
year 2009/10 to be pro rated for completed months’ service. 
Service agreements
The Executive Directors have service agreements with 
Wolseley plc. In each case, the notice period is 12 months 
if given by the Company and six months if given by the 
executive. This reﬂects current market practice and the 
balance that should be struck between providing contractual 
protection to the Directors that is fair and promoting the 
interests of shareholders. Typically, upon termination by the 
Company, a payment would be made equal to the aggregate 
of base salary, any pension contributions made and the cost 
to the Company of providing other beneﬁts to the executive. 
The Company would also seek to ensure that any termination 
payment is mitigated in the event that the executive ﬁnds 
alternative employment during the notice period.

Other senior executives
The members of the Executive Committee, who are not on 
the Board, are senior executives whose roles are considered 
able to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ability of the Group to meet 
its strategic objectives. The Committee determines the level 
of remuneration for this group, based on proposals from the 
Group Chief Executive. Their total remuneration including 
salary and beneﬁts, actual bonus, and the fair value of 
long term incentives granted or awarded during the year 
ended 31 July 2010 is summarised below:

Director share ownership
A share ownership programme (the “programme”) was 
introduced with effect from 1 August 2004. Following the 
capital reorganisation and share issue in 2009, the targets 
were reset to take into account the changes resulting from 
those actions. The programme is designed to encourage all 
Directors and members of the Executive Committee to build 
up a shareholding in value equivalent to the following levels:
Group Chief Executive 1.5 times basic salary 
Other Executive Directors 1 times basic salary 
Chairman and Non Executive 
Directors 1 times annual fees
Executive Committee members 0.5 times basic salary
For Executive Directors and members of the Executive 
Committee, share ownership may be achieved by retaining 
shares received as a result of participating in a Company 
share plan, after taking into account any shares sold to 
ﬁnance option exercises or to pay a National Insurance or 
income tax liability or overseas equivalent. The programme 
speciﬁcally excludes the need for executives to make a 
personal investment should awards not vest. Normally these 
levels of shareholding should be expected to be achieved 
within three to ﬁve years from the time the individual is 
included in the programme. The Committee has reviewed 
and noted the progress which has been made towards 
meeting these targets during the year. Directors’ current 
interests in shares are set out below.

Pensions (audited)
Mr Webster participated in the Wolseley Group Retirement 
Beneﬁts Plan (the “Plan”) until the termination of his 
employment on 31 March 2010. The Plan is a deﬁned beneﬁt 
scheme and provides beneﬁts based on ﬁnal pensionable 
salary. The Company makes contributions to the Plan based 
on the recommendation of the Plan actuary. Bonuses 
payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable. While he 
was an employee, Mr Webster contributed eight per cent per 
annum of his pensionable salary to the Plan.
Mr Webster was subject to the Plan speciﬁc earnings cap 
on his beneﬁts accrual, which for the Plan year 2009/10 was 
£123,600. The Company had previously agreed to provide 
Mr Webster with beneﬁts which were broadly comparable 
with those that would have applied under the Plan had the 
cap not been introduced, which were provided for by 
payments into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Beneﬁt 
Scheme (“FURBS”). Following the introduction of the Finance 
Act 2004, the FURBS was no longer a tax efﬁcient vehicle 
to fund pension beneﬁts. Accordingly, since 6 April 2006, 
Mr Webster’s beneﬁts were provided through the Plan and 
through a cash supplement which, together, were broadly 
comparable to those to which he would previously have 
been entitled.
The table below shows, for Mr Webster, the amount of 
beneﬁt accrued under the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension 
scheme as at his date of leaving on 31 March 2010.
In accordance with the terms of the termination of his 
employment, Mr Webster received a payment equivalent to 
12 months’ beneﬁts in relation to his pension contributions. 
An amount of £84,619 was paid to the Plan to provide this 
beneﬁt, of which £9,888 was paid by Mr Webster. In addition 
to this, his life assurance cover was extended to 31 March 
2011. A premium of £2,981 was paid to the insurers for 
this cover.
Messrs Marchbank and Roach, who are US citizens, 
participated in the deﬁned contribution pension arrangements 
of Ferguson Enterprises, Inc., receiving contributions at the 
level of 23 per cent of their base salary. Bonus is not included 
in the calculation of Company pension contributions. The 
following table shows the cost of the Group’s contributions

During his career with the Company, Mr Marchbank 
participated in Ferguson Enterprise, Inc.’s Executive 
Retirement Plans, which included the Supplemental 
Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), pursuant to which the 
Company contributed funding for certain pension beneﬁts. 
In the accounts for the 2007/08 and 2008/09 ﬁnancial years, 
this funding was disclosed as £107 ,000 and £137 ,000 
respectively. As at the date of cessation of his employment, 
the value of Mr Marchbank’s accumulated beneﬁt under 
the SERP stood at $1,478,030 (the “SERP retirement 
fund”) and this had not vested at that date. In recognition of 
Mr Marchbank’s service to the Company, the Remuneration 
Committee agreed to pay Mr Marchbank the amount that had 
accumulated in the SERP retirement fund, together with a 
further contribution of $119,716 in respect of his notice period. 
After these payments have been made, the Company will 
not be liable to make any further payments in relation to 
Mr Marchbank’s pension.
Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a 
commitment to a former director, who is a French citizen, 
to pay an annual pension of €232,701 (2009: €231,123), with 
a widow’s entitlement of 60 per cent, subject to an annual 
increase based on the agreed French pension index. The full 
actuarial cost of this arrangement was provided in previous 
years as part of Brossette’s ongoing pension obligations. 
The Company is guarantor of this future pension commitment 
which at 31 July 2010 was estimated at approximately 
£2.7 million (2009: £2.7 million).

Notes: Until his termination on 31 March 2010, Mr Webster built up beneﬁts at the rate of 1/30ths of the earnings cap, payable from age 60. On leaving he was 
granted one additional year of pension by the Company in lieu of notice of which he contributed an additional £9,888. Mr Webster also had a FURBS into which 
no contributions were paid during the year, while he was employed. 62 Wolseley plc

Long term incentives (audited)
The Company currently operates a long term incentive plan 
under the Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme 
(“LTIS”), which was approved by shareholders in December 
2002 and amended at the 2004 Annual General Meeting. 
The purpose of the LTIS is to reward executives for relative 
outperformance of the Company against a deﬁned list of 
comparator companies. The LTIS (as amended) provides for 
awards of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company, 
subject to the Company meeting TSR targets over separate 
three-year periods. All awards are made subject to the 
achievement of stretching performance conditions. 
The measure of TSR has been selected as the appropriate 
performance measure to ensure that the interests of the 
Executive Directors and senior executives are more closely 
aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders over the 
long term (as further detailed on page 56). Calculations of 
TSR are independently carried out and veriﬁed before being 
approved by the Committee.
The following performance conditions apply for awards made 
under the LTIS:
Wolseley’s TSR position in the comparator group
Percentage of award  
which will vest
Top decile 100%
Between median and top decile 26–99%
At median 25%
Below median 0%
The lists of comparator companies for awards made under 
the LTIS are based upon the constituent members of the 
FTSE 100 as at the respective dates of grant, excluding 
banks, telecommunications, IT and utility companies but 
including CRH plc and Travis Perkins plc, which compete 
in the same sector as the Company. A similar group of 
companies will be selected for the 2010 awards under 
the LTIS. 
The LTIS is discretionary. The Committee’s current policy 
is to make annual awards to the Group Chief Executive, 
Executive Directors and other senior executives. Awards are 
made in shares, save where there may be material securities 
or tax law constraints in overseas jurisdictions where the 
scheme would be operated, in which case conditional 
awards in cash would be considered. A total of 498,269 
shares were conditionally granted under the LTIS in October 
2009 to 87 employees (2008: 104). Under the same plan, 
27 ,135 shares were conditionally granted to Mr Martin on 
1 April 2010 following his appointment to the Board as 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
The maximum amount that can be granted under the LTIS 
for each award is 200 per cent of base salary per annum; 
however, awards made to date have not exceeded 125 per 
cent, or in the case of the Group Chief Executive 150 per 
cent, of base salary. Each year the Committee assesses the 
relevant proportion of awards arising from both share options 
and long term incentive awards. Extant awards remain 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions 
following a participant’s agreed retirement and vesting is only 
determined at the end of the performance period.
The following table sets out the percentage of each award 
which has vested and the percentage of each extant award, 
had it vested on 31 July 2010:
Year of award
Percentage vested on maturity or indicative  
vesting percentage base on  
performance as at 31 July 2010
2005 0% (vested 31 July 2008)
2006 0% (vested 31 July 2009)
2007 0% (at 31 July 2010 )
2008 0% (performance after 24 months)
2009 0% (performance after 12 months)
Details of the awards conditionally made under the LTIS to the Executive Directors in ofﬁce during the year and the number of

1  In accordance with the rules of the 1989 Scheme and the Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), all options lapsed on 1 March 2010 as a consequence 
of Mr Marchbank’s cessation of employment. All options granted under the rules of the 2003 Option Plan prior to October 2006 have an exercise period of six 
months following the date of cessation of employment, accordingly the options granted in 2004 and 2005 lapsed on 1 September 2010. For awards granted 
after October 2006, the six-month period commences from the date that the option would ordinarily have vested (the third anniversary of the date of grant) 
and is subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions. These options will therefore be subject to their performance tests in 2010, 2011 and 
2012 respectively. The UK Sharesave options were exercised on 26 August 2010, in accordance with the termination provisions set out in the rules of this 
scheme. A total of 429 options were exercised; the remaining 875 lapsed.
2 Options lapsed on 2 November 2009 as the 2006 grant did not pass the relevant EPS performance conditions.
3  Under the ESPP, a total of 410 options were granted in April 2009. However, the exchange rate increased between the date of grant and the date of maturity 
in May 2010, which led to a lower number of options equating to total contributions being exercised. Accordingly the balance of options lapsed.
4  In accordance with the rules of the 1989 Scheme and the 2003 Option Plan, all options lapsed on 31 March 2010 as a consequence of Mr Webster’s 
cessation of employment.
5  Performance targets were not passed prior to the options reaching the 10-year limit from the date of grant.
6  Mr Webster exercised executive share options on 25 March 2010 in respect of 11,990 ordinary shares at an option price of 1458 pence (the closing 
mid-market price was 1604 pence). Of these, Mr Webster sold 425 ordinary shares at 1603 pence in order to cover tax and NIC withholdings.
The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary 10 pence shares during the year was 1724 pence and the lowest 
was 1160 pence. The price of the Company’s ordinary 10 pence shares on 31 July 2010 was 1438 pence. 64 Wolseley plc

Executive share options (audited)
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (“2003 Option Plan”) 
received shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting 
held in November 2003. Consequently, no further options have 
been granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 
1984 (“1984 Scheme”) nor under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme 1989 (“1989 Scheme”), which are now closed. 
No options under any of these schemes have been or will 
be granted at a discount to the relevant middle market price 
at the time of grant and no option under any such scheme 
can be exercised unless performance conditions have 
been satisﬁed.
The purpose of the 2003 Option Plan is to reward executives 
for absolute EPS growth of the Company above UK inﬂation. 
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company and 
its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the 2003 Option 
Plan. Participants are selected by the Committee at its 
discretion and upon the recommendation of the Group Chief 
Executive. The Committee considers annually the levels of 
grant, which are phased over time. It also determines the 
size of each award at the time of grant based on individual 
performance, the ability of each individual to contribute to 
the achievement of the performance conditions, and market 
levels of remuneration. Awards may not exceed an amount 
equal to ﬁve times salary for US-based executives and three 
times salary for European-based executives, although the 
Committee may, if it so determines, also use the ﬁve times 
salary limit in exceptional circumstances. 
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date 
on which the 2003 Option Plan was approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. In October 2008, the Committee 
formally reviewed the 2003 Option Plan and concluded that 
it remained suitable and appropriate as part of the senior 
executive remuneration package. 
Satisfaction of options
The Company continually monitors the effect that awards 
made under the various employee and discretionary share 
plans may have on dilution limits. Options are either satisﬁed 
by the issue of new shares or shares purchased in the 
market. In accordance with the recommendations of the 
Association of British Insurers (“ABI”), the number of new 
shares that may be issued to satisfy options granted under 
the 2003 Option Plan and any other employee share scheme 
is restricted to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company over any 10-year period. Further, as 
set out in the ABI principles and guidelines, the number of 
new shares that may be issued to satisfy executive options 
granted under the 2003 Option Plan and any other 
discretionary share scheme is restricted to ﬁve per cent of 
the issued ordinary share capital of the Company over any 
10-year period. The Company adheres to these requirements. 
In addition, for US-based participants, the Company 
ensures that the 2003 Option Plan is restricted such that 
the aggregate number of shares for which options may 
be granted to such participants during the life of the 2003 
Option Plan will not exceed 5 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company as at the date the 2003 Plan 
was approved by shareholders.
At 31 July 2010, awards had been granted resulting in shares 
being issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 
10 years under all of the Company’s employee share plans 
representing 9.01 per cent of the issued ordinary share 
capital at that date and 4.24 per cent of the issued ordinary 
share capital under the Company’s discretionary share plans. 
These percentages remain high, as the adjustment factors 
used during the capital reorganisation and share issue in 
2009 cannot be applied to shares which have already been 
issued under the Company’s share option schemes in the 
last 10 years, the period used for this calculation. It is not 
expected that the granting of new options in 2010 will breach 
these limits.
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise 
depends on the satisfaction of a performance condition; 
its operation is explained below.
Performance conditions
The extent to which options will be capable of exercise 
depends on the satisfaction of a performance condition, 
based on achieving growth above UK inﬂation in the 
Company’s EPS. The performance of the Company is 
measured over three ﬁnancial years, starting with the ﬁnancial 
year in which the option grant takes place. For all grants 
under the 2003 Option Plan made on or after 5 November 
2004 there is a single three-year performance period and, 
in the event that the performance conditions are not fully 
met on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the unvested 
options will lapse. Provided the performance condition has 
been satisﬁed, an option may be exercised at any time until 
it lapses, 10 years from the date of grant. No amount is 
payable on the grant of an option.
The Committee may set different EPS targets from those 
described below, provided that the new conditions are no 
less challenging at the time of resetting than when the initial 
targets were agreed. As noted on page 56, during the 
ﬁnancial year 2009/10 the Committee decided to revise the 
EPS targets in advance of grants made in November 2009. 
The Committee has decided to retain these higher targets 
for grants made in 2010. Additionally, the Committee has 
decided to index the base EPS at the 2009 achieved EPS 
which is higher than that achieved in 2010. In order for grants 
made in 2010 to vest EPS must again be at historic levels by 
2012 and 2013 and exceed concensus expectations for 2011. 
It is the Committee’s opinion that these revised targets fulﬁl 
the requirement that any adjustments be more challenging 
than those previously set.
The performance conditions are currently as follows:
Sliding scale for 
options granted 
under the 2003 
Option Plan in 
2003–2008
Sliding scale for 
options granted 
under the 2003 
Option Plan from 
2009/10
Multiple of salary worth
of shares under option
Total margin of growth over 
UK inﬂation after three years
First 100% of salary 9% 9%
Second 100% of salary 12% 15%
Next 50% of salary 15% 21%
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21% 21%
The Committee can also vary the terms of existing options to 
take account of any technical changes, for example, changes 
in accounting standards. Any amended target will be 
materially no less challenging as a result of any such change. 
The Committee continues to believe that the EPS condition 
is appropriate for share options, as it requires substantial 
improvement in the Company’s underlying ﬁnancial 
performance and complements the inherent requirement 
for share price growth for an option to have value. Wolseley plc 65

In November 2009, 4,003,386 options were granted under 
the 2003 Option Plan to 1,121 employees (2008: 1,279) at 
an option price of 1269 pence. An award of 37 ,688 options 
under the 2003 Option Plan was made to Mr Martin at an 
option price of 1592 pence on 1 April 2010 upon his 
appointment to the Board. The table on page 63 shows the

Savings related share option schemes 
(audited)
The UK-based Executive Directors may also participate in the 
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“UK Sharesave”) 
and the US-based Executive Directors may participate in the 
Employee Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Under the UK 
Sharesave, participants can enter into a savings contract 
for three, ﬁve or seven years, up to a maximum level of £250 
per month (over all contracts) and are granted options to 
subscribe for shares in the Company. Under the ESPP, a US 
Code 423 Plan, US participants may enter into a one-year 
savings contract to a maximum level of no more than $400 
per month (the savings amount is linked to the £250 UK 
savings amount and is therefore adjusted annually for 
exchange rate purposes). The Board may determine that 
the options granted under either scheme may be awarded 
at a discount. The maximum discount, which was applied to 
the 2010 awards, is 20 per cent for the UK Sharesave, and 
15 per cent for the ESPP, of the average market prices used 
to determine the price of the award. A similar scheme is also 
offered to employees across Europe under the Wolseley 
European Sharesave Plan (“WESP”). 
Allowing for lapses completed after the date of grant, a total 
of 385,326 options were granted in April 2010 to 3,537 
employees in the United States and Canada under the ESPP 
and 385 employees across Europe under the WESP, at an 
option price of 1355 pence per share. In the UK, a total of 
179,130 options were granted at an option price of 1276 
pence per share to 1,003 employees. 
The table on page 64 sets out the number of share options 
granted to Executive Directors during the year under the UK 
sharesave and ESPP and the number of options outstanding 
as at 31 July 2010.

  Group accounting policies 
Year ended 31 July 2010 
 
 
  
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
72 Wolseley plc 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union, including 
interpretations issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (“IASB”) and its committees, and with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. The date of transition to IFRS was 
1 August 2004. 
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by 
the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial 
statements is set out below. 
Basis of accounting 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the 
revaluation of available-for-sale investments and financial 
assets and liabilities held for trading. 
Accounting standards and interpretations 
adopted during the year 
The Group has adopted IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial 
Statements” (revised 2007) in the year. This requires changes 
in equity to be shown in a primary statement. As a result, 
changes in equity are disclosed in these consolidated financial 
statements in a primary statement rather than in the notes. 
The Group has also adopted IFRS 7 (amendment) Improving 
Disclosures about Financial Instruments. The amendment 
requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement 
and liquidity risk including the disclosure of fair value 
measurements by level of a fair value measurement hierarchy. 
The Group has also adopted the following new financial 
reporting standards, interpretations and amendments to 
published standards in the year which have not had a material 
effect on the results or the financial position of the Group for 
the year ended 31 July 2010. 
IFRS 2 (amendment) Share-based Payment 
IAS 23 (revised) Borrowing Costs 
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 
IFRS 3 (revised) Business Combinations 
IAS 27 (revised) Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements 
IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those material items which, by virtue of 
their size or incidence, are presented separately in the income 
statement to enable a full understanding of the Group’s 
financial performance. These exclude impairments of acquired 
intangibles which are also presented separately in the income 
statement. Transactions which may give rise to exceptional 
items include restructurings of business activities and gains or 
losses on the disposal of businesses. 
Consolidation 
The consolidated financial information includes the results of 
the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up 
to 31 July 2010. 
The trading results of businesses other than discontinued 
operations acquired or sold during the year are included in 
profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations from 
the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale. 
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised 
gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are 
eliminated on consolidation. 
Discontinued operations 
When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a 
business component that represents a separate major line of 
business or geographical area of operations it classifies such 
operations as discontinued. The post-tax profit or loss of the 
discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face 
of the income statement, separate from the other results of 
the Group. 
Foreign currencies 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the 
Group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the 
currency of the primary economic environment in which the 
subsidiary undertaking operates (the “functional currency”). 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in 
sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group  
and the functional currency of the parent company. 
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling 
during the relevant financial period. 
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the 
period end. Exchange differences arising between the 
translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary 
undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the 
year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are 
exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the 
extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge 
against foreign currency net assets. 
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of 
derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign 
currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions 
of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve 
(see the separate accounting policy on derivative financial 
instruments). 
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, 
the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income 
statement is determined after taking into account the 
cumulative currency translation differences that are 
attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are 
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency 
translation differences are taken to the income statement with 
the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to 
the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge 
against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.  
Revenue 
Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods 
and services falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, 
excluding intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales 
returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax 
and similar sales taxes.   
 
 
 
   
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
Wolseley plc 73
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when  
the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been 
transferred to the customer. The risks and rewards of 
ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred 
when the goods are shipped to, or are picked up by,  
the customer. 
Revenue from services is recognised when the service 
provided to the customer has been completed. 
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate 
component of the sales transaction in which they are granted. 
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is 
allocated to the loyalty credits and deferred over the period 
that loyalty credits are redeemed. 
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only 
recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed 
or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. 
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing 
inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and 
overheads attributable to assembly and construction services. 
Vendor rebates 
The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors 
providing for inventory purchase rebates. These purchase 
rebates are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a 
reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of 
sales when the related product is sold. 
Business combinations 
The Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting 
for the acquisition of subsidiaries. 
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the 
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred 
or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured initially at their fair values 
at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any 
minority interest. Acquisition related costs are expensed. 
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of 
the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is 
recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than 
the fair value of the Group’s share of the net assets of the 
subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in 
the income statement. 
Intangible assets 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the net identifiable 
assets of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date  
of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary 
undertakings is included in intangible assets. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the 
carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of 
cash-generating units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of impairment 
testing. Each of those CGUs represents the lowest level within 
the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for 
management purposes and are not larger than the reporting 
segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating 
Segments”. 
Other intangible assets 
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary 
asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits 
attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its 
cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be 
identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from 
contractual or other legal rights. 
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer 
relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are 
capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment 
losses. Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance 
method for customer relationships and the straight-line 
method for other intangible assets. The cost of the intangible 
assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: 
Customer relationships 4 – 25 years 
Trade names and brands 1 – 15 years 
Other 1 – 4 years 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, 
plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible 
asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include software 
licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, 
design and implementation of the computer software and 
internal costs directly attributable to the development, design 
and implementation of the computer software. Costs in 
respect of training and data conversion are expensed as 
incurred. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line 
method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to 
the income statement over its estimated useful life as follows: 
Computer software 3 – 5 years 
Property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) 
PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets  
in the course of construction, which are not depreciated and 
are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the items. In addition, subsequent costs are 
included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a 
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that 
future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to 
the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the 
income statement during the financial period in which they 
are incurred. 
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line 
method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value 
over its estimated useful life, as follows: 
Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35 – 50 years 
Short leaseholds over the period  
 of the lease 
Plant and machinery 7 – 10 years 
Fixtures and fittings 5 – 7 years 
Computer hardware 3 – 5 years 
Motor vehicles 4 years 
The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and 
adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.  Group accounting policies continued 
Year ended 31 July 2010 
 
 
 
  
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
74 Wolseley plc 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term 
construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part 
of the cost of the asset. 
Leased assets 
Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the 
asset have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the 
balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term or their useful lives. The asset is recorded at the lower  
of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at the inception of the lease. The capital elements 
of future obligations under finance leases are included in 
liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current 
and non-current amounts. The interest elements of future 
obligations under finance leases are charged to the income 
statement over the periods of the leases and represent a 
constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate 
method. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.  
The cost of operating leases (net of any incentives received 
from the lessor) is charged to the income statement on a 
straight-line basis over the periods of the leases. 
Assets and disposal groups held for sale  
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount 
will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in 
the business. Where a group of assets and their directly 
associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single 
transaction, such disposal groups are also classified as held 
for sale. For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group 
must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, 
and management must be committed to and have initiated a 
plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, 
was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months. 
Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated. 
Assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale 
are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair 
value less costs to sell.  
Associates 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant 
influence but not control, generally accompanying a 
shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the 
voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for 
using the equity method of accounting and are initially 
recognised at cost. 
The Group’s share of its associates’ post-acquisition profits or 
losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of 
post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in 
reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are 
adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When 
the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds 
its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured 
receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, 
unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate. 
Impairment of assets 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill,  
are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for 
impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 
Assets that are subject to amortisation and assets under 
construction are tested for impairment whenever events or 
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for 
the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of 
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable 
value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) 
method or the average cost method as appropriate to the 
nature of the transactions in those items of inventory. The cost 
of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom 
duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing 
costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, 
rebates and other subsidies. It excludes borrowing costs.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the 
ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling 
expenses. 
Taxation 
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or 
recoverable) on the taxable income for the year using tax 
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet 
date and taking into account any adjustments arising from 
prior years. 
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on 
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated 
financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it 
arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction, other than a business combination, that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable 
profit or loss. 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet 
date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax 
asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred 
tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profit will be available against which the 
temporary differences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the 
reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.

Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate 
swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial 
risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the 
financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in 
derivative financial instruments. 
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of 
derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument together with its risk management objective and 
the strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group 
also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the 
hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, 
of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in 
the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and 
liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet 
date. Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the 
criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in 
their fair values are recognised in the income statement.  
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging 
relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow 
hedges or net investment hedges. Where the hedging 
relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying 
amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the 
increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged 
risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income 
statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it 
will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging 
instrument. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a 
hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is 
amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity. Where 
the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or 
as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is 
effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument 
arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity 
rather than in the income statement. When the hedged item is 
recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains 
and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the 
income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-
financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial 
carrying amount. When a hedging instrument expires or is 
sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at 
that time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 
Pensions and other post-retirement 
benefits 
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other 
post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred. 
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement 
benefits, the cost is calculated annually using the projected 
unit credit method and is recognised over the average 
expected remaining service lives of participating employees,  
in accordance with the recommendations of independent 
qualified actuaries. The current service cost of defined benefit 
plans is recorded within operating profit. The total expected 
return from pension scheme assets less the total interest on 
pension scheme liabilities is recorded within finance revenue 
if a gain and finance costs if an expense. Past service costs 
resulting from enhanced benefits are recorded within 
operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested. 
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences 
between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets 
and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are 
recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in 
the period in which they occur. The defined benefit liability or 
asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total 
for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation at 
the balance sheet date, less any past service costs not yet 
recognised, less the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the 
balance sheet date. Where a plan is in surplus, the asset 
recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past 
service costs and the present value of any amount which the 
Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in 
future contributions.  
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for 
impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of the 
receivables. Examples of such evidence include significant 
financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor 
will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or 
delinquency in payments. The amount of the provision is the 
difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the 
present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at 
the original effective interest rate. The amount of the loss is 
recognised in the income statement. Trade receivables are 
written off against the provision when recoverability is 
assessed as being remote. Subsequent recoveries of 
amounts previously written off are credited to the income 
statement.  Group accounting policies continued

Construction loans 
Construction loan receivables are secured loans made to 
builders to finance the construction of properties or the 
purchase of land. These receivables are financed from bank 
facilities which have a purpose clause under which the Group 
can borrow to finance construction loan receivables, but only 
to the extent that it has sufficient receivables to offset these 
borrowings. This clause has the consequence that any 
borrowings designated for this purpose are repayable when 
the corresponding receivables are either collected or go into 
default. In the latter case, amounts not expected to be 
recoverable have to be funded from the Group’s normal 
facilities. 
Accordingly, the Group restricts the amount designated as 
construction loan borrowings to the recoverable amount of the 
loan portfolio. This amount is then disclosed separately in the 
financial statements as it is not considered part of the Group’s 
net debt. The construction loan borrowings are classified as a 
current liability since the amounts are repayable when the 
corresponding receivables are collected, and the receivables 
are classified as current assets. 
Construction loan receivables are recognised initially at fair 
value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using  
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.  
A provision for impairment of construction loan receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables. Examples of such evidence 
include significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability 
that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, 
and default or delinquency in payments. The amount of the 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows 
collectible from the debtor or recoverable from the disposal 
of the asset on which the receivable is secured, discounted 
at the original effective interest rate. The amount of the loss 
is recognised in the income statement. Construction loan 
receivables are written off against the provision when 
recoverability is assessed as being remote. Subsequent 
recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
to the income statement. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits 
held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the 
extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net 
settlement with cash balances. 
Share capital 
The Company has two classes of shares, ordinary and 
deferred shares, which are both classified as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from 
the proceeds, net of tax. 
Where any group company purchases the Company’s equity 
share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, 
including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of 
tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or 
disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or 
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly 
attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax 
effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s 
equity holders. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the 
consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.  
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with 
any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) 
and the redemption value being recognised in the income 
statement over the period of the borrowings using the 
effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Financial assets 
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following 
categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss; 
loans and receivables; held-to-maturity investments; and 
available-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends 
on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. 
Management determines the classification of its financial 
assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation 
at every reporting date. 
(a) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 
This category comprises financial assets held for trading 
which have been acquired principally for the purpose of 
selling in the short term. Derivatives also fall within this 
category unless they are designated as hedges and the 
hedge is effective for accounting purposes. Assets in this 
category are classified as current.   
 
 
 
   
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
Wolseley plc 77
(b) Loans and receivables 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with 
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market and with no intention of trading. They are 
included in current assets, except for maturities greater than 
12 months after the balance sheet date, which are classified 
as non-current assets. Construction loans are shown 
separately on the balance sheet. Other loans and receivables 
are included in trade and other receivables in the balance 
sheet. 
(c) Held-to-maturity investments 
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial 
assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed 
maturities that the Group’s management has the positive 
intention and ability to hold to maturity. They are included in 
non-current assets unless the investment is due to mature 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
(d) Available-for-sale financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial 
assets that are either designated in this category or not 
classified in any of the other categories. They are included in 
non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of 
the financial asset within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus 
transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value 
through profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when 
the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Group has 
transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. 
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair 
value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair 
value. Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity 
investments are subsequently carried at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Realised and unrealised gains 
and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the 
“Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss” category 
are included in the income statement in the period in which 
they arise. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes 
in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as 
available-for-sale are recognised in equity. When securities 
classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the 
accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income 
statement as gains and losses from investment securities. 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether 
there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a Group 
of financial assets is impaired. In the case of equity securities 
classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged 
decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is 
considered as an indicator that the securities are impaired. 
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial 
assets, the cumulative loss, measured as the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current value, less any 
impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised 
in profit or loss, is removed from equity and recognised in the 
income statement. 
Provisions 
Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs, 
product and service warranties and legal claims are 
recognised when the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more 
likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required 
to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. Such provisions are measured at the present value 
of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to 
settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. The 
discount rate used to determine the present value reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money. 
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. 
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based 
on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling 
outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported at the 
balance sheet date on certain risks retained by the Group. 
Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the 
Group’s executive share option, long-term incentive and 
employee share purchase schemes. The Group recognises a 
compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based 
on the fair value of the awards, measured using Black-
Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. 
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at 
the date of grant (including the impact of any non-vesting 
conditions such as a requirement for employees to save) and 
is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on 
which the award was granted are modified. For cash-settled 
schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and 
is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is 
settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period. Adjustments are 
made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the 
vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions 
or non-market performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Group’s 
financial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in 
the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim 
dividends).  Notes to the consolidated financial statements

1. Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions  
in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts. The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in  
the areas set out below. 
Allowance for doubtful accounts 
Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired. Within each of the businesses 
assessment is made locally of the recoverability of accounts receivable based on a range of factors including the age of the 
receivable and the creditworthiness of the customer. The provision is assessed monthly with a detailed formal review of 
balances and security being conducted at the full year and half year. Determining the recoverability of an account involves 
estimation as to the likely financial condition of the customer and their ability to subsequently make payment. If the Group is 
cautious as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may provide for accounts that are subsequently recovered. 
Similarly if the Group is optimistic as to the financial condition of the customer the Group may not provide for an account that 
is subsequently determined to be irrecoverable. Furthermore, while the Group has a large geographically dispersed customer 
base, a slowdown in the markets in which the Group operates may result in higher than expected uncollectible amounts 
and therefore higher (or lower) than anticipated charges for irrecoverable receivables. The amount relating to continuing 
operations charged to the income statement in 2010 in respect of doubtful accounts represented 0.32 per cent of revenue 
(2009: 0.62 per cent). 
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2010 amounting to £60 million (2009: £81 million). 
Inventories 
For financial reporting purposes the Group evaluates its inventory to ensure it is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable 
value. Provision is made against slow moving, obsolete and damaged inventories. Damaged inventories are identified and 
written down through the inventory counting procedures conducted within each business. Provision for slow moving and 
obsolete inventories is assessed by each business as part of their ongoing financial reporting. Obsolescence is assessed based 
on comparison of the level of inventory holding to the projected likely future sales. Future sales are assessed based on historical 
experience, and adjusted where the manufacturer has indicated that it will no longer continue to manufacture the particular item. 
To the extent that future events impact the saleability of inventory these provisions could vary significantly. For example, 
changes in specifications or regulations may render inventory, previously considered to have a realisable value in excess of 
cost, obsolete and require such inventory to be fully written off. The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 
31 July 2010 amounting to £140 million (2009: £151 million). 
Impairment of long-lived assets 
Wolseley periodically evaluates the net realisable value of long-lived assets, including goodwill, other intangible assets, property, 
plant and equipment and investments in associates, relying on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans 
and projected future cash flows. 
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually 
and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are 
subject to amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount 
exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the 
cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group. Estimates are used in deriving 
these cash flows and the discount rate.  
As disclosed in notes 14, 15, 16 and 17, the Group has charged £402 million in respect of the impairment of long-lived assets 
during the year ended 31 July 2010 (2009: £879 million). 
The results of tests for impairment are sensitive to the assumptions made in the value in use calculations. The Group has 
estimated the effect of increasing the discount rate by one percentage point, and of decreasing the trading margin for each 
asset group by half a percentage point in the final year of the cash flow forecast. The additional impairment charges that would 
arise from applying either of these alternative assumptions to those cash-generating units impaired in the year is £109 million. 
The impact on the Group’s other cash-generating units of the alternative assumptions would be a charge of less than 2 per cent 
of the carrying amount of their goodwill and acquired intangible assets of £1,585 million at 31 July 2010. 
Captive insurance 
The Group operates a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited, which is registered and operational in the Isle 
of Man. This company provides reinsurance exclusively to certain companies within the Group, principally to cover US casualty 
and global property damage risks. Provision is made based on actuarial assessment of the liabilities arising from the insurance 
coverage provided. The actuarial assessment of the reserve for future claims necessarily includes estimates as to the likely trend 
of future claims’ costs and estimates as to the emergence of further claims subsequent to the year end. An actuarial review of 
claims is performed annually. To the extent that actual claims differ from those projected the provisions could vary significantly. 
At 31 July 2010, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was £55 million (2009: £57 million).

1. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued 
Consideration received from vendors 
The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates primarily upon 
achievement of specified volume purchasing levels with many of these agreements applying to sales in a calendar year.  
For certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made.  
The Group accrues the receipt of vendor rebates as part of its cost of sales for products sold, taking into consideration 
cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected purchases through to the end of the qualifying period. Rebates are 
accrued for each reporting period with an extensive reassessment of the rebates earned being performed at the end of the 
financial year and half way through the financial year. The Group has agreements with numerous and geographically dispersed 
suppliers, but a slow down in the markets in which the Group operates, or a significant change in the profile of products 
purchased may result in purchases for the remainder of the year differing significantly from those projected. Consequently the 
rebate actually received may vary from that accrued in the financial statements. 
Legal, environmental and other provisions 
The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos 
related litigation and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate 
may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter. In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account 
the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers. 
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may vary from the amounts provided and may be dependent 
upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement 
negotiations. There can, therefore, be no assurance that any losses that result from the final outcome of these matters will not 
exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the Group’s financial statements. At 31 July 2010 legal, environmental and 
other provisions amounted to £152 million (2009: £107 million). 
Onerous lease provisions 
When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of 
the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the 
assets (in the case of finance leases) and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract (for all leases). 
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, 
and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property 
will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the 
property is sublet. To the extent that actual cash flows received differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised 
could differ materially. At 31 July 2010, the provision for onerous leases was £88 million (2009: £124 million). 
Impairment of construction loan receivables and foreclosed properties held for sale 
A provision for impairment of construction loan receivables is made when management estimates that the present value of 
future cash flows recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount. Determining the amount of such 
provision requires estimating the amount and timing of such future cash flows, which requires an assessment of:  
 the financial condition of the debtor; 
 the ability of the debtor to meet contractual payments; and 
 in the event that the Group forecloses on the property on which the receivable is secured, the likely cost of enhancing the 
marketability of the property, the likely disposal proceeds, and the likely period for which the property will be held to before a 
sale can be achieved. 
To the extent that actual amounts recovered differ from those estimated, the amount of provision recognised could differ 
materially. At 31 July 2010, the provision for impairment of construction loans receivables was £36 million (2009: £39 million) 
and the provision against foreclosed properties held for sale was £24 million (2009: £18 million). 
Taxation 
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates in relation to tax audit issues and 
exposures. Amounts accrued are based on management’s interpretation of country-specific tax law and the likelihood of 
settlement. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions are probable of being sustained. Once considered to be 
probable, management reviews each material tax benefit to assess whether a provision should be taken against full recognition 
of the benefit on the basis of any potential settlement through negotiation and/or litigation. All such provisions are included in 
creditors due within one year. Any recorded exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are 
accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial 
statements. These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, 
and are disclosed in note 32.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

1. Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued 
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect 
the balance sheet and income statement. The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and 
life expectancy. The Group has estimated the sensitivity of the financial statements to changes in these assumptions as follows:

2. Segmental analysis 
Wolseley’s reportable segments, which are those reported to the Group’s Executive Committee, are the operating businesses 
overseen by distinct divisional management teams responsible for their performance. All reportable segments derive their 
revenue from a single business activity, the distribution of plumbing and heating products and building materials. The UK 
segment, which was formerly named “UK and Ireland”, includes the results of the Irish business up to the date of disposal. 
The Group’s business is not highly seasonal but revenue and trading profit are normally somewhat higher in the second half. 
The Group’s customer base is highly diversified, with no individually significant customer. 
The revenue, trading profit and operating (loss)/profit of the Group’s reportable segments are detailed in the following tables.

At 31 July 2010 (13) (15)
On 6 May 2009 the Group sold 100 per cent of the shares of its subsidiary Stock Building Supply Holdings LLC to Saturn 
Acquisition Holdings LLC (“Saturn”) in exchange for 49 per cent of the voting rights and common equity of Saturn and nominal 
consideration. Since 6 May 2009 additional non-voting equity has been issued by Saturn such that as at 31 July 2010 the 
Group had a 44 per cent interest in its common equity.  
The associate released certain restructuring provisions during the year. The Group’s share of the after tax credit to income of 
£11 million has been disclosed as an exceptional item (2009: net restructuring costs of £6 million). 
In the year ended 31 July 2010, Saturn recorded revenue of £605 million and a loss after tax of £29 million. In the period from  
6 May 2009 to 31 July 2009 Saturn recorded revenue of £110 million and a loss after tax of £33 million. 
b) Impairment 
During the year ended 31 July 2010 Saturn continued to be loss making due to challenging conditions in its markets. 
Consequently there is significant uncertainty as to whether the Group will receive dividends or other returns from its investment 
in the future and therefore the Group has fully impaired the carrying value of its investment at year end.

before the disposal and comprise staff redundancy costs of £9 million and provisions for future lease rentals on closed branches 
and asset write-downs of £147 million.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

A tax loss arising on the disposal of Stock Building Supply Holdings LLC was carried back against taxable US profits of earlier 
years resulting in a £130 million tax refund in the year. 
10. Dividends 
No dividends were approved or paid in 2009 or 2010 and no dividend is proposed for the year ended 31 July 2010. 
11. (Loss)/earnings per share 
Basic loss per share from continuing and discontinued operations of 120.6 pence (2009: loss per share of 558.0 pence) is 
calculated on the loss for the year attributable to shareholders of £340 million (2009: loss of £1,173 million) on a weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. 
Basic loss per share from continuing operations of 129.8 pence (2009: loss per share of 348.2 pence) is calculated on the loss 
after tax from continuing operations of £366 million (2009: loss of £732 million) on a weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by Employee Benefit Trusts, of 282 million (2009: 210 million). As detailed 
in note 12 below, the Group believes that profit measures before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of 
acquired intangibles provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements. Basic earnings per share from 
continuing operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles, has, therefore, 
been presented in the following table: 
Continuing operations 2010 2009
Before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles 74.1p 95.6p
Add back: exceptional items (net of tax) (102.1)p (170.3)p
Add back: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles (net of deferred tax) (101.8)p (273.5)p
Basic loss per share (129.8)p (348.2)p
The impact of all potentially dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of 
shares in issue to 283 million (2009: 211 million). The diluted loss per share from continuing operations is also 129.8 pence 
(2009: loss per share of 348.2 pence). Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before exceptional items and the 
amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is 73.9 pence (2009: 95.5 pence).

12. Non-GAAP measures of performance 
Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles. It is a non-GAAP measure. Exceptional items are material non-recurring items which are excluded from trading profit 
to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s underlying financial performance. In addition, the current 
businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition. Operating profit includes only 
the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 
31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 (where no 
amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised), businesses that have developed organically (where no 
intangibles are attributed) and those businesses more recently acquired (where amortisation and impairment of acquired 
intangibles is charged).  
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing 
the Group’s performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly 
able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group. The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance 
indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal 
assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.

14. Intangible assets – goodwill continued 
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations. On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP 
was allocated to cash-generating units and groups of cash-generating units (“CGUs”). These are independent sources of 
income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management 
purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level. Goodwill arising on business combinations after 
1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.  
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow 
projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management. The key assumptions for these forecasts are those 
regarding revenue growth, trading margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management 
estimates based on past experience, reflecting the cyclicality of earnings, and expectations of future changes in the market. 
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average 
long-term nominal growth rate for each market (ranging from 1.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent), and discounted back to present 
value. The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.3 per cent, 
based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates. The pre-tax discount rate which 
ranges from 10 per cent to 12 per cent has been applied to the risk adjusted cash flows of each CGU. 
Impairment tests were performed for all CGUs during the year ended 31 July 2010. These impairment reviews have resulted in 
the recording of the following impairment charges.

Market conditions have been more challenging than expected in France and a more gradual recovery in profit is now expected. 
In addition the implementation of unfavourable supplier payment legislation has affected the level of working capital required to 
support the business. As a result of reflecting these changed expectations in the value in use calculations of Brossette and 
PBM, all of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to Brossette have been impaired and an impairment 
charge has been recorded against the goodwill relating to PBM. The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired 
intangibles relating to PBM was £144 million at 31 July 2010. 
The UK segment has continued to experience challenging market conditions and this has been reflected in reduced 
expectations in its value in use calculations for certain businesses. Goodwill and acquired intangibles relating to the Brandon 
Hire and Electric Center businesses have been fully impaired. The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired 
intangibles relating to the Encon business was £50 million at 31 July 2010. 
The Woodcote business in the Nordic segment has continued to perform below expectations as a result of difficult market 
conditions and its long-term outlook has been downgraded. Consequently its goodwill and other acquired intangibles have 
been fully impaired.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated. Other intangible assets arise on 
business combinations. Included in the amounts above are £8 million (2009: £134 million) relating to assets under construction. 
In December 2009 the Board determined that the branch deployment of the supply chain management part of the Group’s 
Business Change Programme, that was intended to commence in 2010, would be deferred for a period of at least 24 months 
after which time the future migration plan would be reconsidered. Given the uncertainty surrounding future deployment, 
the Board currently believes that it cannot conclude that it is probable that deployment will recommence and therefore certain 
software assets under development, held at the Group centre, with a book value of £138 million have been impaired. Total 
software assets relating to the Group’s Business Change Programme now have a book value of £26 million. In addition the 
Group has provided for a further £32 million of costs relating to contractual and constructive obligations which have been 
classified as an exceptional item (see note 4). 
More details on the impairment charge for the year in respect of trade names and brands and customer relationships 
is provided in note 14.

Tax losses in the USA have been recognised on the basis that they are forecast to have sufficient taxable profits in the future to 
enable these to be utilised. 
There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £48 million (2009: £96 million) that have not been 
recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain. The tax losses in Italy of £21 million and the Czech 
Republic of £15 million expire after five years. The remaining tax losses of £12 million can be carried forward indefinitely. 
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investment in subsidiaries. 
However, tax may arise on £503 million (2009: £567 million) of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control 
the timing of the reversal of the associated temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.   Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

Provisions for impairment of receivables are made locally, and have two components: 
 a provision for amounts that have been individually determined not to be collectible in full, because of known financial 
difficulties of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency in payment, amounting to £47 million at 31 July 2010  
(2009: £66 million); and  
 a provision based on historic experience of non-collectability of receivables, amounting to £13 million at 31 July 2010  
(2009: £15 million). 
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Group’s customer base is large and unrelated. Accordingly, 
management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.  
Trade receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established with 
customers as follows:

Other receivables include an amount of £44 million (2009: £42 million) which has been discounted at a rate of 3.7 per cent 
(2009: 4.3 per cent) due to the long-term nature of the receivable. The fair value of the remaining balances in trade and other 
receivables approximates to book value.

Interest rate swaps 
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings. The fair value of 
interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.  
The Group’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on LIBOR. Interest rate swap contracts comprising 
fixed interest payable on notional principal of €300 million (2009: €900 million) were designated and effective as cash flow 
hedges for the first half of the year, with the valuation gains being deferred in equity. The contracts expire between August 2010 
and August 2011 (2009: August 2009 and August 2011), and the fixed interest rates range between 4.57 per cent and 4.59 per 
cent (2009: 2.59 per cent and 4.59 per cent).

The interest rate swap contracts were not designated as hedges for the second half of the year. Valuation gains have been 
credited to profit and loss. As the cash flows which were the subject of the hedge relationship are still forecast to occur, 
valuation losses deferred in equity are being recycled over the duration of the previous hedge relationship.

The Group’s private placement borrowings are at fixed rates. Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable 
on notional principal of $729 million (2009: $729 million) are designated as hedges of the fair values of these borrowings. 
The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps has been analysed into a proportion that is effective as a hedge, and a 
proportion that is ineffective; both portions have been charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the 
change in fair value of the hedged borrowings (see note 6). The contracts expire between November 2012 and November 2020 
and the fixed interest rates range between 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent (2009: 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent).

Construction loan receivables are secured principally against homes in the course of construction or completed homes awaiting 
sale and are all denominated in US dollars. These loans are generally settled when completed homes are sold, rather than at a 
fixed term. The average age since origination is 15 months (2009: 20 months). As the contractual maturity of these loans, which 
did not exceed 12 months from the reporting date, was set at origination to correspond to the normal operating cycle of the 
construction business, and the Group normally expects to realise the loans within their contractual maturity, these loans have all 
been classified as current assets. 
As at 31 July 2010, the effective rate of interest on construction loans was 7 per cent (2009: 8 per cent).   Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

exceptional charge of £20 million for impairment of construction loan receivables shown above and an exceptional charge 
of £4 million to write down assets held for sale to their recoverable amount. 
Construction loan receivables on which payments are delinquent are subject to foreclosure of the property on which the  
loan is secured, such that the disposal proceeds of the property can be applied in settlement of the outstanding liability.  
After foreclosure, the balance of receivables net of provisions for impairment is transferred to assets held for sale.  
Provisions for impairments of receivables comprise:  
 a provision for amounts that have been individually determined not to be collectable in full, because of known financial 
difficulties of the debtor or evidence of default or delinquency in payment, amounting to £12 million at 31 July 2010  
(2009: £13 million); and  
 a provision based on historic experience of the shortfall of disposal proceeds of foreclosed properties to the outstanding 
balance due, amounting to £24 million at 31 July 2010 (2009: £26 million). 
Management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.  
Construction loan receivables can be aged with respect to the payment terms specified in the terms and conditions established 
with customers as follows:

Amounts not yet due 65 107

Construction loan receivables at 31 July 2010 includes £27 million in respect of loans on which foreclosure proceedings have 
been started (2009: £54 million). The fair value of collateral held in respect of construction loans receivable is believed to be 
sufficient to cover the net amount of construction loans receivable. During the year ended 31 July 2010 disposal proceeds 
of £41 million (2009: £36 million) were realised from the sale of foreclosed properties, in respect of loans with a principal value 
of £70 million before provisions (2009: £46 million). Undrawn committed facilities at 31 July 2010 amounted to £25 million 
(2009: £30 million).

At 31 July 2010 the Group was in the process of disposing of its Brandon Hire business and on 24 August 2010 the Group 
announced that it had agreed to sell the business for a total cash consideration of £43 million, subject to normal closing 
adjustments. Accordingly this business was classified as a disposal group held for sale at 31 July 2010 with £27 million 
transferred from property, plant and equipment and £14 million transferred from trade receivables. 
At 31 July 2009 the Group’s plumbing and heating businesses in Belgium, Slovakia and the Czech Republic were classified

Interest receipts and payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short-term benchmark 
rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR. 
At 31 July 2010 borrowings with a par value of £598 million carried a weighted average fixed interest rate of 5.0 per cent 
(2009: £560 million at 5.1 per cent). As certain tranches of the borrowing have been hedged with interest rate swaps, the 
carrying amount of these tranches has been adjusted to fair value, such that these fixed rate borrowings have a carrying value 
of £666 million (2009: £597 million). 
Hedge of net investment in overseas operations 
The Group has financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net 
investment in its overseas subsidiaries. The principal value of these financial instruments at the balance sheet date was 
£1,401 million (2009: £1,551 million). 
The loss on translation of the borrowings into sterling of £71 million (2009: loss of £381 million) has been taken to the 
translation reserve.

(b) Financial instruments by measurement basis 
Financial instruments in the categories “derivatives used for hedging”, “fair value through profit or loss” and “available-for-sale” 
are all measured in the balance sheet at fair value. With effect from 1 August 2009, the Group has adopted the amendment 
to IFRS 7 for such financial instruments. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy: 
 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1); 
 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly 
(level 2); 
 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3). 
The following tables present the Group’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 31 July 2010 and 31 July 2009:

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. 
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) is determined 
by using valuation techniques. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future 
cash flows based on observable yield curves. The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out 
the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.

The Group’s other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value. Because current assets and liabilities are 
either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values. The book values and fair values

(c) Financial risk management 
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group has well defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty 
exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial periods ended 31 July 2009 and 31 July 2010. By the 
nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated 
to operating businesses. There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group. 
The Treasury Committee of the Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are 
summarised below. When the Group enters into derivative transactions (principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign 
currency contracts), the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the 
Group’s operations and its sources of finance. It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy 
that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken. 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders 
and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions. To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current 
and forecast trading, the Group’s principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt, including receivables factoring 
facilities, to EBITDA. The Group’s target is to keep this ratio within a range of 1 to 2, consistent with an investment grade credit 
rating. The Group’s main borrowing facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to 3.5:1, and 
requiring the ratio of EBITDA to net interest to exceed 4.0. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amounts of dividends paid to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and bolt-on acquisitions for 
the following financial year with an additional contingent safety margin. Large acquisitions are funded shortly before the 
acquisition is made. As at 31 July 2010, the Group had undrawn centrally managed facilities maturing as follows:

At 31 July 2010, the Group had £274 million (2009: £168 million) drawn and £96 million (2009: £169 million) undrawn on 
receivables factoring facilities.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its bank and 
construction loan borrowings on an undiscounted basis. The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated 
using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates 
at the balance sheet date. These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows:

Foreign currency risk 
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in 
which the operations are located. Approximately 39 per cent of the Group’s revenue is in US dollars and 23 per cent in euros. 
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposure. However, those that do arise are 
generally hedged with either forward contracts or currency options. The Group does not normally hedge profit translation 
exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect. 
Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Group’s overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund 
growth in those territories. The Group’s policy is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to match the 
currencies in which its trading profit is generated, as this hedges the ratio of net debt to EBITDA in the covenant calculation.  
Net debt at 31 July 2010 by currency was as follows:

Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the 
translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary 
on page 137. The net effect of currency translation was to increase revenue by £223 million (1.5 per cent) (2009: £2,439 million, 
or 16.5 per cent) and to increase trading profit by £5 million (1.1 per cent) (2009: £147 million, or 18.7 per cent). These currency 
effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars and Euros as follows:

Interest rate risk 
To manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Group’s policy is that at least 20 per cent of bank borrowings 
required during the next two years should be at fixed rates. The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates 
which reset at least every 12 months, which are regarded as floating rates, and then uses interest rate swaps to generate the 
desired interest rate profile.  
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at both Treasury Committee and Board meetings. The Treasury 
Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements. 
The Group’s financial assets and liabilities are exposed to both fair value interest rate risk (fixed rate borrowings) and cash flow 
interest rate risk (floating rate borrowings). The interest rate profile of the Group’s net debt at 31 July 2010 and 31 July 2009, 
after including the effect of interest rate swaps, is set out in the following tables.

Fixed rate borrowings at 31 July 2010 carried a weighted average interest rate of 4.6 per cent fixed for a weighted average 
duration of 1.6 years (31 July 2009: 4.2 per cent for 1.4 years). Floating rate borrowings at 31 July 2010 carried a weighted 
average interest rate of 1.5 per cent (31 July 2009: 1.8 per cent). 
Credit risk 
Wolseley provides sales on credit terms to many of its customers. There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to 
pay outstanding balances. The Group’s construction loan business also provides loans to finance the construction of properties. 
There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances. At 31 July 2010 the maximum 
exposure to credit risk was £1,863 million (2009: £2,031 million) of which £80 million (2009: £163 million) is secured against 
homes under construction or completed homes awaiting sale.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
Year ended 31 July 2010

29. Financial instruments and financial risk management continued 
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables. Significant 
outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis. 
In many cases, protection is provided through lien rights on projects, or through credit insurance arrangements. All of the major 
businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based. Appropriate provisions are made for debts that 
may be impaired on a timely basis. 
The Group’s construction loans are secured on the related properties and are managed by a dedicated lending team within 
that business. Policies are also applied to provide further protection and KPIs are monitored regularly by management outside 
the business. 
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts (such as 
interest rate swaps) which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions. These transactions give rise 
to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of £744 million (2009: £850 million). This risk is 
managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties, all of which have credit ratings 
equivalent to Standard & Poor’s A or higher. In exceptional circumstances the Treasury Committee will allow deposits with 
relationship banks with other investment grade ratings, subject to close monitoring of the exposure. The limits are approved  
by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly. 
Market price risk 
The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of  
a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates. On the basis of the Group’s analysis, it is estimated that the 
maximum effect of a rise of one percentage point in the principal interest rates on the Group’s continuing businesses would 
result in a credit to the income statement of £1 million (2009: charge of £4 million), arising from the Group’s net exposure to 
floating rate deposits at 31 July 2010, and have no effect on equity (2009: charge of £4 million, resulting from changes in the fair 
value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges). Similarly, it is estimated that a weakening of sterling by 10 per cent 
against all the currencies in which the Group does business would result in a charge to the income statement of £1 million 
(2009: charge of £2 million) arising from derivatives held at fair value through profit and loss, and a charge to equity of  
£62 million (2009: £122 million), arising from the translation of borrowings denominated in foreign currency and designated  
as net investment hedges. 
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit 
risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Group’s exposure to any of the 
macro-economic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding 
claims and claims incurred but not reported on certain risks retained by the Group (principally US casualty and global property 
damage).  
The environmental and legal provision includes the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis using a long-
term discount rate of 3.7 per cent (2009: 4.3 per cent). This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2010 based 
on advice from independent professional advisers. The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient cover for the 
estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables. Based on current 
estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material 
profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future. There were 249 claims outstanding at 
31 July 2010 (31 July 2009: 273). 
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs, future lease rentals on closed branches and asset  
write-downs. In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using 
appropriate government bond rates. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately four years. 
Other provisions include the Group’s best estimate of the cost of potential product and service warranty claims arising in Stock 
Building Supply Holdings LLC (“Stock”) before its disposal on 6 May 2009, separation costs relating to the disposal of Stock 
and contractual and constructive obligations relating to the Business Change Programme (note 15). Other provisions also 
include rental commitments on vacant properties other than those arising from restructuring actions, dilapidations on leased 
properties and warranties. The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

32. Retirement benefit obligations 
(i) Description of plans 
United Kingdom 
The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits 
based on final pensionable salaries. The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme’s retirement 
benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies. 
Employees salary sacrifice either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits accruing. The Group 
contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary. This scheme 
was closed to new entrants in 2009. A defined contribution scheme is also operated and contributions are charged to the 
income statement in the period in which they fall due. In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined contribution plans 
charged to the income statement was £1 million (2009: £1 million). 
Outside the United Kingdom 
North America 
The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance 
with US 401k rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans. Contributions are 
charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due. In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined 
contribution plans of continuing operations charged to the income statement was £14 million (2009: £21 million). 
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada, a defined benefit scheme and a 
defined contribution scheme are operated. One of the US schemes and the Canadian scheme are funded; two plans are closed 
to new entrants. The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies. 
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme. The remaining 
schemes provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) 
Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.  
Europe 
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are 
calculated in accordance with actuarial advice. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period 
in which they fall due. In the year ended 31 July 2010 the cost of defined contribution schemes charged to the income 
statement was £20 million (2009: £21 million). 
Post-retirement healthcare 
There are no material obligations to provide post-retirement healthcare benefits. 
The Group expects to contribute £54 million to the UK defined benefit schemes in the year ending 31 July 2011, including 
an additional £25 million arising as a result of the recently completed funding valuations. The Group expects to contribute 
£11 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes.

The expected long-term rates of return for equities are long-term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice. 
The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return (determined by reference to government bond rates 
in the countries in which the plans are based) plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities. For the 
UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 2.9 per cent per year as at 31 July 2010 (2009: 3.2 per cent) over the 
expected return from government bonds. For the principal overseas schemes in USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar 
approach was adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice. 
The Group’s investment strategy for its funded post-employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, the trustees of the 
plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements. The Group’s objective for the investment strategy is to achieve 
a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative 
to the liabilities. 
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to 
deliver the target rate of return. Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will 
result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable 
boundaries of risk. 
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset 
classes, principally bonds. The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the 
Group. For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities 
with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.

Employee Benefit Trusts 
Three Employee Benefit Trusts have been established in connection with the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 and the 
Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme. No shares were purchased by the trusts during the year. The market value 
of the 1,948,919 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts at 31 July 2010, which have a nominal value of £0.2 million, 
was £28 million (2009: £26 million). During the year, 29,118 shares were allocated from the Employee Benefit Trusts to 
employees under the Restricted Share Plan. Dividends due on shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts are waived in 
accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds.

34. Share-based payments 
The Group operates six share option plans: the 1984 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1989 Executive Share Option 
Scheme and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the “Executive Option Schemes”); the Wolseley Employees 
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1981 and the Wolseley European Sharesave Plan 2001 (collectively, the “Employees 
Savings Option Schemes”); and the Wolseley Employee Share Purchase Plan 2001 (the “ESPP”). 
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the 
growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index 
over the same period by at least 9 per cent and consequently vest over a period of three years. Awards granted under the 
Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods ranging from three to seven years. Awards granted under the ESPP 
vest over a one-year period. 
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Scheme (“LTIS”) and the Wolseley Restricted Share Plan (“RSP”) for senior 
executives. Under the LTIS, executives are awarded a variable number of shares depending on the level of total shareholder 
return over the next three years relative to that of a number of comparator companies. The vesting period is three years. 
The maximum award under the LTIS is determined at grant date and then adjusted at vesting date in accordance with the 
market performance condition. Under the RSP, executives (excluding Directors) are granted free shares. The vesting period 
is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment. 
Following the capital reorganisation and share issue which was completed during April 2009, appropriate adjustments were 
made to reflect the dilutive effect of both transactions on outstanding awards. The calculations were made in accordance 
with HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) recommendations. Such calculations were reviewed by the Company’s auditors, 
who performed specific procedures to recalculate the adjustments made to outstanding awards, on the basis that the Directors 
of the Company deemed the adjustments to be fair and reasonable. 
After adjustments had been made to outstanding awards to reflect the capital reorganisation, a further adjustment was made 
using the theoretical ex-rights price calculation (“TERP”) as agreed with HMRC. All outstanding awards made under the 
Company’s share plans were multiplied by a TERP factor of 2.398177677 and the respective option prices and market prices 
at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.416983283. 
These formulae were designed to minimise the effect of the capital reorganisation and the share issue upon outstanding awards 
and, subject to roundings, ensured that the overall value of outstanding awards was the same after adjustment.  Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued

The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all 
schemes except the LTIS, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The fair value of shares granted under the RSP was 
calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid 
over the vesting period. 
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: 
 Executive Share Options Employee Share Options  
Long Term Incentive

Expected life 5.8 years 5.8 years 1–7 years 1–7 years  3 years 3 years
Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of 
extraordinary volatility due to the capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009. Expected life has been estimated on the basis 
of historical data on the exercise pattern.

Ordinarily, the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued would be credited to a non-
distributable share premium account. However, the rights issue was effected through a structure which resulted in the excess 
of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued being recognised within retained earnings under Section 
131 of the Companies Act 1985.

Total operating lease commitments 1,292 1,329
Operating lease payments mainly represent rent payable by the Group for certain of its properties. Some of these  
operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material.  
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2010 is  
£16 million (2009: £16 million). 
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for. 
At 31 July 2010 provisions include an amount of £88 million (2009: £124 million) in respect of minimum lease payments for 
such onerous leases net of sublease payments expected to be received (note 31). 
44. Contingent liabilities 
The Group has quantifiable contingent liabilities under sundry guarantees and indemnities of £9 million (2009: £13 million) which 
arose in the ordinary course of business and which have not been provided in these accounts since no actual liability is 
expected to arise. In addition the Group has exposure in the ordinary course of business to certain legal and product liability 
claims. Whilst provision is made for any known or quantifiable items, it is possible that additional claims may arise in the future. 
45. Post balance sheet events 
On 24 August 2010 the Group announced that it had agreed to dispose of Brandon Hire, its UK tool and equipment hire 
business, for a cash consideration of £43 million, subject to normal closing adjustments. The disposal was completed on  
22 September 2010. 
46. Parent company 
Wolseley plc is a limited liability company incorporated in England and Wales and domiciled in the United Kingdom. It operates 
as the ultimate parent company of the Wolseley Group. Its registered office is Parkview 1220, Arlington Business Park, Theale, 
Reading RG7 4GA, United Kingdom. 
The Group’s principal subsidiary undertakings are set on pages 140 to 141. 
47. Accounting standards and interpretations that are not yet effective 
Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2010 or later periods, but which the Group has not early 
adopted. The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Group’s operations are as follows: 
IAS 24 (revised) Related party disclosures (applicable from 1 August 2011) 
This revision simplifies the definition of a related party, clarifying its intended meaning and eliminating inconsistencies from the 
definition, and provides a partial exemption from the disclosure requirements for government-related entities. Management is 
currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group’s future financial statements. 
IFRS 9 Financial instruments – classification and measurement (applicable from 1 August 2013) 
The part of this standard so far issued is the first stage in a comprehensive revision of the accounting for financial instruments. 
This standard requires all financial assets to be classified on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing the financial 
assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset; to be initially measured at fair value plus, in the case 
of a financial asset not at fair value through profit and loss, particular transaction costs; and to be subsequently measured at 
amortised cost or fair value.  
  Independent auditors’ report  
to the members of Wolseley plc 
   
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
Wolseley plc 125
We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2010 which comprise the 
Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group statement of changes in equity, the Group 
balance sheet, the Group cash flow statement, the Group accounting policies and the related notes. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as adopted by the European Union.  
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements  
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 July 2010 and of its loss and cash flows for the year then 
ended;  
 have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the lAS Regulation.  
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006  
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the consolidated financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the consolidated financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:  
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
 the Directors’ statement, set out on page 29, in relation to going concern; and  
 the part of the Corporate Governance Report relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review.  
Other matter  
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2010 and 
on the information in the Remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

  Notes to the Company financial statements 
Year ended 31 July 2010 
 
   
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
Wolseley plc 127
1. Company accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
These Companies Act 2006 financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with 
applicable UK accounting standards. The principal accounting policies, as set out below, have been applied consistently 
throughout the period. 
Note 10 on page 88, note 32 on pages 110 to 113, note 33 on page 114 and note 34 on pages 115 to 118 of the Wolseley plc 
consolidated financial statements form part of these financial statements. 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss 
account. Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 (revised 1996) the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare 
statements of cash flow as the consolidated statements have been published. 
Foreign currencies 
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the 
date of investment. 
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are recorded at cost less provision for impairment. The Company assesses at each balance sheet date 
whether there is objective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired. 
Taxation 
Current tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years. 
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or asset has arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by 
the balance sheet date and have given rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or the right to pay less tax in the future. 
An asset has not been recognised to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain. Deferred tax 
assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted. Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the 
distribution to the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where dividends have been recognised 
as receivable. 
Derivatives and financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks 
arising from the business activities of the Company and the financing of those activities. There is no trading activity in derivative 
financial instruments. 
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Company documents the 
relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy 
underlying the proposed transaction. The Company also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging 
relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values 
or cash flows of the hedged items. 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date. 
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in FRS 26, changes in their fair 
values are recognised in the income statement. 
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net 
investment hedges. Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset 
or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is 
recognised in the profit and loss account where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying 
amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity. 
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is 
effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather 
than in the profit and loss account. When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and 
losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the profit and loss account or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial 
asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a 
hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in 
equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account. When a forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to 
the profit and loss account.  Notes to the Company financial statements continued

1. Company accounting policies continued 
Financial guarantees 
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at the reporting date. Fair value is 
estimated by discounting expected cash flows at a market rate. Changes in fair value are recognised in the income statement. 
Pensions and post-retirement benefits 
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement 
as incurred. 
For defined benefit pension plans, the Company has taken advantage of the multi-employer exemption under the terms of 
FRS 17. It is not possible to obtain a reasonable allocation of the scheme assets and liabilities for the employees of the 
Company and accordingly the Company accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. 
Cash at bank and in hand 
Cash at bank and in hand includes cash in hand and deposits held at call with banks. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and practice of net settlement 
with cash balances. 
Share capital 
The Company has two classes of shares, ordinary and deferred shares, which are both classified as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax. 
Where the Company or the Company’s trust purchases the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration paid, including 
any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until 
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration 
received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity 
attributable to the Company’s equity holders. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs)  
and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective 
interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability 
for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Share-based payments 
Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Company’s executive share option, long-term incentive and share 
purchase schemes. The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value 
of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies. For equity-settled schemes, 
the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award 
was granted are modified. For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at 
each balance sheet date until the liability is settled. Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure 
to satisfy service conditions or achieve non-market performance conditions. 
Dividends payable 
Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are 
approved by the shareholders of the Company (generally in the case of the final dividend) or paid (in the case of interim 
dividends).

10. Retirement benefit obligations 
The Company participates in the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan. This is a defined benefit multi-employer plan,  
the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group. The Company is unable to identify its share of the 
underlying assets and liabilities of the plan and accordingly accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. 
Information in respect of the plan is provided in note 32, on pages 110 to 113, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial 
statements. The total contribution to the defined benefit plan in the year was £nil (2009: £nil). 
11. Share-based payments 
Details of share options granted by Group companies to employees, and that remain outstanding, over the Company’s shares 
are set out in note 34, on pages 115 to 118, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. The Company recognised

Interest rate swaps 
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its and the Group’s exposure to interest rate movements on their 
borrowings. The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated on the basis of the market values of equivalent instruments 
at the balance sheet date. 
The Group’s bank borrowings generally attract variable interest rates based on six-month LIBOR. For Group purposes interest 
rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on notional principal of €300 million (2009: €900 million) and basis point 
swaps with notional principal of €300 million (2009: €900 million) were designated and effective as cash flow hedges in the first 
half of the year, with valuation gains recognised in that period deferred in equity until realised. The Company has recognised 
the valuation gains through profit and loss throughout the year. The contracts expire between August 2010 and August 2011 
(2009: August 2009 and August 2011), and the fixed interest rates range between 4.57 and 4.59 per cent (2009: 2.59 and 
4.59 per cent).

Currency swaps

14. Contingent liabilities 
Provision is made for the Directors’ best estimate of known legal claims and legal actions in progress. The Company takes legal 
advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on 
that advice, that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made. 
In addition the Company has given certain banks authority to transfer at any time any sum outstanding to its credit against or 
toward satisfaction of its liability to those banks of certain subsidiary undertakings. 
The Company has given indemnities and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group 
companies in respect of which no material liabilities are expected to arise. 
15. Employees, employee costs and auditors’ remuneration 
The average number of employees (including Directors) of the Company in the year ended 31 July 2010 was 17 (2009: 17). 
Total employee costs of the Company for the year including termination costs and retirement benefit were £7 million (2009: 
£5 million). 
Fees payable to the auditors for the audit of the Company’s financial statements are set out in note 3, on page 84, to the 
Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. 
16. Dividends 
Details of the Company’s dividends are set out in note 10, on page 88, to the Wolseley plc consolidated financial statements. 
17. Related party transactions 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” to dispense with the 
requirement to disclose transactions with fellow subsidiaries, all of whose voting rights are held within the Group, and which are 
included in the consolidated financial statements of Wolseley plc. 
18. Accounting standards and interpretations that are not yet effective 
Certain new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Company’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 August 2010 or later periods, but which the Company has not early 
adopted. The new standards which are expected to be relevant to the Company’s operations are as follows: 
Amendment to FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill (effective from 1 August 2010) 
The amendment requires enhanced disclosure around the assumptions used to estimate value in use or the net realisable value 
of a fixed asset or income-generating unit. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment on the Company’s 
future financial statements. 
Amendment to FRS 20 Share-based Payment (effective from 1 August 2010) 
The amendment clarifies both the scope of the standard and the accounting for group cash-settled share-based payment 
transactions in the separate or individual financial statements of the entity receiving the goods or services when that entity has 
no obligation to settle the share-based payments transaction. Management is currently assessing the impact of this amendment 
on the Company’s future financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 
134 Wolseley plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2010 which comprise the 
Company balance sheet and the related notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors  
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibility statement set out on page 51, the Directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.  
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or 
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may 
come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
Opinion on financial statements  
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:  
 give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 31 July 2010; 
 have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and  
 have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:  
 the part of the Remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; 
and  
 the information given in the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the parent company financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report by exception  
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  
in our opinion:  
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or  
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or  
 certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.  
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the consolidated financial statements of Wolseley plc for the year ended 31 July 2010.

Shareholder information
Access to shareholder information 
All Wolseley plc shareholder information is available 
electronically. Shareview, a service offered by our registrars, 
Equiniti, allows shareholders online access to a range of 
shareholder information. It provides access to individual’s 
shareholding details in the Company and practical help on 
transferring shares or updating personal details. It also allows 
shareholders to decide how to receive their shareholder 
communications and to submit their votes for all shareholder 
meetings. 
To register, shareholders simply need to log on to  
www.shareview.co.uk using their shareholder reference 
number and complete the simple on-screen registration 
process. First-time users will need to enter certain information 
and to choose a personal identiﬁcation number before they 
are able to access their shareholding details. 
The Company can, at shareholders’ request, send an  
email notiﬁcation each time a new shareholder report  
or other shareholder communication is put on the website. 
Shareholders will then be able to read and/or download the 
information at their leisure, but will still be able to request 
paper copies of the documents should they so wish.

convenient telephone and internet share sale and purchase

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Forward-looking statements
Certain information included in this Annual Report and 
Accounts is forward-looking and involves risks, assumptions 
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied by forward-
looking statements. Forward-looking statements cover all 
matters which are not historical facts and include, without 
limitation, projections relating to results of operations and 
ﬁnancial conditions and the Company’s plans and objectives 
for future operations, including, without limitation, discussions 
of expected future revenues, ﬁnancing plans, expected 
expenditures and divestments, risks associated with changes 
in economic conditions, the strength of the plumbing and 
heating and building materials market in North America 
and Europe, ﬂuctuations in product prices and changes 
in exchange and interest rates. 
Forward-looking statements can be identiﬁed by the use 
of forward-looking terminology, including terms such as 
“believes”, “estimates”, “anticipates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, 
“intends”, “plans”, “projects”, “goal”, “target”, “aim”, “may”, 
“will”, “would”, “could” or “should” or, in each case, their 
negative or other variations or comparable terminology. 
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future 
performance. All forward-looking statements in this Annual 
Report and Accounts are based upon information known 
to the Company on the date of this Annual Report and 
Accounts. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any 
particular expectation will be met and readers are cautioned 
not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, 
which speak only at their respective dates. 
Additionally, forward-looking statements regarding past 
trends or activities should not be taken as a representation 
that such trends or activities will continue in the future. Other 
than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations 
(including under the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority), the 
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or 
revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of 
new information, future events or otherwise. Nothing in this 
Annual Report and Accounts shall exclude any liability under 
applicable laws that cannot be excluded in accordance with 
such laws.

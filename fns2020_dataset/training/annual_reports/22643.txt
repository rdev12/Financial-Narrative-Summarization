Introduction
On behalf of the Board of Compass Finance Group plc (“Compass Finance” or “the Group”),
I am pleased to present the results for the period ended 30 September 2004.
The Group was originally incorporated on 9 April 2003 and was formerly known as Sound
Growth plc up until its acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Compass Finance Ltd
(and its dormant subsidiary Compass Homeloans Ltd) and Compass Capital Planning Ltd
(dormant) on 8 March 2004. On the same date the Company changed its name and
commenced trading. The consolidated figures therefore only include the results for the Group
for the period from 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004. On 8 September 2004 the trading
assets of Compass Finance Ltd were hived up into Compass Finance Group plc and is now
the only trading company in the Group.
On 8 March 2004 and in conjunction with this acquisition the Group floated on AIM and
commenced trading.
The Group is a finance broker and packager of re-mortgages, secured loans and unsecured
loans for clients requiring debt consolidation and financial solutions. It should be noted that
Compass Finance does not lend money to customers; the Group earns its income from
commissions and fees received primarily from third party lenders.
Statutory Results
For the period from 9 April 2003 to 30 September 2004, the Group reported turnover of
£8.57 million and a profit before tax of £1.52 million. For the same period earnings per share
were 1.46p.
In the period 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004, following the acquisition of Compass
Finance Limited, the Group received broking commission on funds of £115 million which were
lent to customers by a number of lenders. Net debt at 30 September 2004 was £2.21 million
resulting in gearing at 30 September 2004 of 33%.
The net asset value of the Group as at 30 September 2004 was £6.64 million.
Pro-forma Results
The statutory results from 9 April 2003 to 30 September 2004 are contained in full in the
financial statements from page 12. In order to understand the underlying trends on a year on
year basis, the operating results presented and discussed here are pro-forma unaudited
results for the 12 months to September 2004 and September 2003 unless otherwise stated.

Compass Finance includes the trading businesses of Compass Finance Ltd and Compass
Homeloans Ltd for the 12 months periods ending 30 September each year. The trade and
assets of Compass Homeloans Ltd were hived up into Compass Finance Ltd on 
31 December 2002. The 2003 pro-forma figures include three months of Compass
Homeloans Ltd’s unaudited management accounts for 1 October 2002 to 31 December
2002. The results of Compass Finance Group plc are included from 8 March 2004.
Pro-forma turnover of the Group’s companies for the 12 months to 30 September 2004 was
£13.16 million which reflected record sales in the last six months of £7.54 million. 
Pro-forma operating profit for the 12 months period to 30 September 2004 was £2.19 million
(2003: £1.76 million). The 2004 profit before tax includes costs associated with the
acquisition of Compass Finance Ltd from 8 March 2004 to 30 September 2004 totalling
£524,000, including bank loan interest of £142,000 and amortisation of £278,000. Adding
back the £524,000 the adjusted profit before tax and plc costs is £2.58 million, which is 48%
up on 2003.
Dividends
In view of the sustained growth in profits, the Board has decided to pay a maiden final
dividend of 0.15p per share for the period ended 30 September 2004. Subject to approval of
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 February 2005, the dividend will
be paid on 6 April 2005 to those shareholders on the register at 18 February 2005. 
Subject to the Group’s results, the Board plans to implement a progressive dividend policy
going forward.
Operating Highlights
On 17 September 2004 the Group received authorisation from the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) to conduct mortgage and general insurance business following legislative
changes.
To underline the Group’ s growth, I have summarised the last five year’ s sales history of the Group’ s
companies on an annualised basis. This includes the trading businesses of Compass Finance Ltd
and Compass Homeloans Ltd for the 12 months periods ending 30 September each year. From 8
March 2004 the results of Compass Finance Group plc are included.

Turnover 469 1,109 3,446 8,258 13,156 
The encouraging sales growth for the period ended 30 September 2004 reflects the
commissions earned from increasing volumes of loans sold. As at 30 September 2004, £180
million of loans had been packaged compared to £118 million for the year ended 30
September 2003.
Staff numbers during the period have grown from 79 to 115 reflecting the growth in new
business. I have summarised the last five years’ employee numbers (as at the September
year ends):

The Group attracts customers through target marketing and advertising. It then undertakes a
comprehensive fact-find to ensure the needs and circumstances of the client are matched to
one of a portfolio of lenders. To complement this, a service based approach with personal
visits to customers by client account executives enables the Group to convert 18% of all
enquiries received. 
Current Market Conditions 
The housing market is not showing the significant rises it did earlier on in 2004. As Compass
Finance rarely provides new mortgages, its fortunes are not directly aligned to the housing
market. Any sustained reduction in house prices, along with continued interest rate rises,
would impact on the mortgage market, and we believe that demand for the Group’s services
could feasibly increase, as debt servicing becomes more onerous. 
Consumer debt now borders on £1trillion in the UK. With the Group’s penetration into its
chosen markets remaining minimal, organic growth continues to be the main strategy,
although other expansion opportunities will be explored when appropriate.
Customer borrowing has been at record levels, fuelled by historically low interest rates.
Recent interest rate rises have shifted the opportunity to debt consolidation products as
customers struggle to service existing debt.
The new FSA regulatory environment will further improve the perception of the mortgage
industry and drive consolidation, providing the Group with the opportunity to consider
acquiring businesses and to build market share.
Current Trading and Prospects
The UK debt consolidation market has experienced significant growth in recent years and
Compass Finance has established itself as a force within the mortgage and loans broking
industry. A combination of tailored customer service, marketing specifically targeted at
borrowers requiring debt consolidation and credit repair, and industry leading levels of
conversion of new leads has produced strong growth and momentum.
Trading since the 30 September 2004 has been encouraging and in line with management’s
expectations, the Board expects further good progress in the current year and remains
confident about the Group’s long-term potential.

Summary performance
I am pleased to report that 2004 has been a very exciting year for Compass Finance Group
plc, including flotation on AIM in March, a substantial increase in staff numbers and a 59%
increase in pro-forma revenue from £8.26m in 2003 to £13.16m in 2004. 
The statutory results generated £8.57m of sales revenue with the resultant profit before tax
of £1.52m. Profit after tax was £977,000. I am particularly pleased that these excellent results
have allowed the Board to announce a maiden final dividend of 0.15p per share, following
which £877,000 of retained earnings will be transferred to reserves.
We have made significant progress in building a strong and experienced management team
who I am confident can deliver the ambitious targets we have set ourselves for the coming
year. Our investment in people has enabled us to continue to deliver market leading sales
conversion rates, excellent customer service and a speedy and efficient completions process.
We have also strengthened the infrastructure of the business through continued investment
in state of the art IT solutions and systems.
All our business sectors experienced revenue growth in the year to 30th September 2004.
Sales Mix
Mortgage/re-mortgage
Our revenue from mortgage and re-mortgage broking activities grew £2.5m to £5.1m and
now stands at 39% of total revenue compared with 34% in 2003. We plan to develop this
division further and expand into areas of mortgage broking where we have limited or no
presence.
Secured loans
Revenue from our second charge broking grew £2.7m to £7.4m. It is currently 57% of our
business compared to 59% in 2003. We anticipate further strong revenue growth from the
secured loans division during 2005.
Other sales
The balance of revenue comprised commissions from arranging unsecured loans, insurance
sales and other activities. 6 compassfinance group plc
New initiatives
We continue to generate a substantial amount of business from our expanding client base, a
testament to the high quality service these customers have received in the past. We plan to
offer a wider range of products and services to these clients during 2005 and we are also
developing our presence in the business to business and affinity sectors.
We are scheduled to relocate to larger offices during 2005 and this should offer us a variety
of opportunities to streamline systems and improve efficiencies further.
Financial Services Authority authorisation
On 17 September 2004 we received our authorisation from the Financial Services Authority
(FSA) to conduct mortgage and general insurance business following legislative changes on
31 October 2004. This legislation should further complement our business as increased
emphasis is placed on advice and a higher level of personal attention to customer needs.
Corporate governance
We are committed to good corporate governance with our plc Board comprising 3 executive
and 2 non-executive directors, meeting monthly to discuss strategy, direction and future
development of the Company. We have established Audit and Remuneration Committees
which consist of the non-executive directors.
Prospects
Compass Finance Group plc is in a strong financial position and well placed to continue to
grow. The Group’s penetration into its chosen markets remains minimal and with the UK
outstanding consumer debt now bordering £1trillion, organic growth remains the core
strategy, although acquisitions will be considered where appropriate. The Group is focused
on delivering strong earnings growth during 2005 and developing a progressive dividend
policy.
Overall I am confident that we can continue the great success story that Compass has
become since its formation and look forward to the new financial year with confidence. 
In conclusion, I must thank all my colleagues for the hard work and dedication they have
contributed during the year.

7 December 2004 statement of directors’ responsibilities
10 compassfinance group plc
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss
for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate
to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They have general
responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets
of the company and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. independent auditors’ report

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Compass
Finance Group plc (formerly Sound Growth plc)
We have audited the financial statements on pages 12 to 27.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section
235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the directors’ report and, as described on page 10,
the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the United Kingdom
by statute, the Auditing Practices Board and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view
and are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to
you if, in our opinion, the directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the
company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding
directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company is not disclosed. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements. 
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the
Company and the Group as at 30 September 2004 and of the profit of the Group for the
period from 9 April 2003 (date of incorporation) to 30 September 2004 and have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material
in relation to the Group’s financial statements. 
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the
historical cost accounting rules.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its material subsidiary
undertaking made up to 30 September 2004. The acquisition method of accounting has been used.
The Company was incorporated on 9 April 2003 and re-registered as a public limited company on 9 December 2003.
On 8 March 2004 the company acquired the entire issued share capital of Compass Finance Limited (trading) and
Compass Capital Planning Limited (dormant). Under the acquisition method of accounting the results of subsidiary
undertakings acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition, being 8
March 2004, to the year end, being 30 September 2004. The results on page 12 therefore represent six months and
23 days trade. 
On 8 September 2004 the Company acquired the trade and assets of Compass Finance Limited.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company alone for the period 9 April 2003 to
30 September 2004 has not been presented as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Related party transactions
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption in Financial Reporting Standard Number 8, paragraph 3(c) and
have not disclosed transactions with entities that are part of the Compass Finance plc group.
Goodwill
Purchased goodwill (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the net
assets acquired) arising on business combinations in respect of acquisitions is capitalised. Positive goodwill is
amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life of twenty years. 
Fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its estimated useful life:
Computer equipment – 33% on straight line balance
Motor vehicles – 33%/25% on reducing balance 
Fixtures and fittings – 33% on straight line balance
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes. Provision is made in full for
deferred tax liabilities in accordance with FRS 19. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, on the basis
of all available evidence it is more likely than not that all amounts are recoverable.

The Group’s financial instruments at the year end comprised cash, bank borrowings, hire purchase finance and various
non derivative financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors. As permitted by Financial Reporting
Standard 13 short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures in this note.
The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so. The
main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and hire purchase arrangements.
The interest rate risk profile of the Group’s financial liabilities is as follows:

3333
Interest on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant bank base rate plus 2.5%.
The Group has no derivative financial instruments at 30 September 2004 and in the opinion of the Board the fair value
of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is equal to book value.
Liquidity risk
Throughout the year the Group’s policy has been to ensure the continuity of funding through loan and hire purchase
funding. Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. The maturity profile of financial liabilities is as follows:

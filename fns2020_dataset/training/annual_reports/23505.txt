Investment case
In May 2015, Enterprise announced a new long-term strategy 
that embraces different operating models for our pubs to allow 
the Group to respond to changing markets, consumer needs and 
regulation and to best serve our publicans, employees and the 
communities in which they are based.
Our strategy is designed to deliver significant value to shareholders 
by optimising the returns from each asset within our property 
portfolio.
The key components of our investment case are:
•	 Leading operator of leased and tenanted pubs in the UK with 
growing managed pubs and commercial property division
•	 Highly cash generative, largely freehold asset-backed business
•	 Clear strategy to deliver value for shareholders by optimising the 
value of assets in our portfolio
•	 Secure capital structure comprising equity and primarily fixed rate 
long-term debt
•	 Experienced leadership team with a track record of delivering net 
income growth in the leased and tenanted business

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
Chairman’s  
statement
Introduction
I am pleased to present our Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year 
ended 30 September 2016, a year in 
which we have made strong progress 
in building a more valuable Enterprise 
Inns. The business is performing well 
with continued growth momentum 
and strategic evolution on track, 
providing a clear path to maximising 
shareholder value through the 
optimisation of returns from every 
one of our 4,920 properties.
Market and strategy
The market in which the Group 
operates is routinely subject to 
regulatory and legislative scrutiny and 
during the year the Government’s 
response to the Pubs Code and Pubs 
Code Adjudicator consultation was 
published, resulting in a new statutory 
code which became effective on 
21 July 2016. We are pleased that 
the uncertainty created during the 
wait for its implementation has now 
ended and believe that our strategic 
plans represent the most appropriate 
response to this change in regulatory 
environment.
We are evolving from a predominantly 
leased and tenanted operation to a 
portfolio of businesses which operate 
a variety of models and trading styles, 
providing the flexibility to optimise the 
returns from every asset. These take 
the form of publican partnerships, 
commercial properties, managed 
operations and managed investments. 
We are on track with our conversions 
to these various operating models. 
We have 273 properties trading as 
commercial properties and more 
than 100 pubs within our managed 
business. 
Performance  
and dividends
The Group delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £292 million, 
resulting in a profit before tax and 
exceptional items for the 2016 year of 
£122 million and an adjusted earnings 
per share (EPS) of 19.6p, 0.2p up on 
the previous year.
Publican Partnerships (our leased and 
tenanted estate) continues to achieve 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
for each quarter and an increase of 
2.1% for the full year. We have now 
achieved 13 successive quarters 
of like-for-like growth. Commercial 
Properties like-for-like net income 
has increased by 3.8%. These strong 
results have generated free cash flow, 
which has been used to reinvest in 
the business to drive future growth 
and reduced leverage. In addition, and 
while the Board continues to believe 
that the resumption of dividend 
payments is not appropriate, we 
took the opportunity to create value 
by returning funds to shareholders, 
through the share buyback 
programme launched in March 2016. 
The Board has committed to return 
£25 million to shareholders, and at the 
date of this report £13 million has so 
far been returned from the 14 million 
shares bought back.
People
I would like to acknowledge  
and say thank you on behalf of 
the Board for the hard work and 
dedication that our colleagues 
and publicans have demonstrated 
throughout the year. It has been a 
year of incredible change, as our new 
strategy has significant ramifications 
across the Group. Our colleagues 
have responded with renewed energy 
and commitment. The fact that 
Enterprise can deliver such strong 
results throughout this period is a real 
testament to our people.
Outlook
Whilst the legislation is now certain, 
its impact on our business is not yet 
clear; however, with the work done 
over the last few years, the Group 
is in the best position to be able 
to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities, as they arise. Although 
mindful of the potential consequences 
of Brexit, we have seen no discernible 
impact to date on consumer spending 
and no consequential impact on our 
trading performance.

Pub beer/cider volumes (%) UK eating out and 
drinking out growth
www.enterpriseinnsplc.com
Stock code: ETI

Our market
The Group operates in the highly 
dynamic UK out-of-home eating and 
drinking market, a market of large 
scale and wide reach: the value of 
out-of-home eating and drinking is 
in excess of £75 billion
1
 and 85% 
of consumers claim to visit pub 
restaurants to eat and drink out. 
Notably, more people visit pub 
restaurants than any other eating out 
channel
2
 with the sector well placed 
to capture lower-spend casual dining 
occasions.
The market is increasingly fluid, as 
historic conventions between in-
home and out-of-home consumption 
blur. Supermarkets are extending 
their in-store offer into hospitality, 
food delivery services are rapidly 
expanding in the major conurbations, 
the ‘on-the-go’ food sector is growing 
as out-of-home breakfast sales 
increase, and ‘pop-up’ street-food 
providers and event spaces are adding 
further diversity and innovation into 
this already complex market. 
Long-term growth in the out-of-home 
food and drink market is aligned 
to consumers’ desire to add more 
leisure activity into their available 
time, and is an embedded trend going 
back several decades, interrupted only 
by periods of economic uncertainty. 
Whilst the Brexit referendum result 
earlier this year may affect consumer 
and business confidence in the 
short-term, eating out has escaped 
the slowdown in consumer spending 
during the last recession and has 
achieved strong growth in the past 
few years.
Around 40%
1
 of food and drink 
spending in the UK now takes place 
out-of-home. However, the underlying 
long-term trend for food spending 
to move out-of-home, where the UK 
is emulating the USA market, is in 
contrast to the UK beer sector. This 
was historically dominated by the 
on-premise channel, but just over half
3
 
of market volume is now sold through 
the off trade, a trend that has been 
encouraged by long-term movements 
in relative price.
These structural shifts are reflected 
in the changing pub market. The 
number of pubs in the UK has fallen 
from 59,000 to just over 52,000 since 
the end of 2010, with the leased and 
tenanted sector in which the Group 
predominantly operates reducing 
by the most. However, leased and 
tenanted pubs still account for over 
40% of the UK pub population
4
 
and it is progressively focusing on 
fewer better sites, with average-
per-pub drinks sales growing by 3% 
in the year to June 2016
5
. At the 
same time the sector is developing 
trading models and formats that give 
operating companies more control 
over the pub proposition, including the 
evolution of managed operations.
The consequence of rationalisation 
is that standards are improving, and 
with over £7 billion of pub industry 
turnover now derived from food, 
the pub sector is aligning more 
closely with contemporary consumer 
aspirations. Pubs are well suited to 
an increasingly informal out-of-home 
eating market, but they are also

Strategic report
widening their consumer appeal, 
particularly addressing the potential 
of trade in the mornings, with more 
sophisticated breakfast, brunch and 
coffee propositions.
On-premise retailers are also adapting 
to rising consumer expectations, 
moving their proposition in a 
more aspirational direction. This 
is manifested in product category 
trends, with a move towards more 
premium products. Whilst volume 
sales in the out-of-home drink market 
are flat, overall sales have grown by 
3%, driven by strong performance 
from premium categories, exemplified 
by double digit market volume growth 
for premium and super-premium 
spirits, and over 40%
5
 volume growth 
for craft beer. We believe this broad 
and long-running trend towards 
premiumisation will continue.
The Group’s estate strategy 
acknowledges these market 
dynamics. In particular we are 
developing the capability to operate a 
significant managed house business, 
with over 100 pubs already trading, 
and a plan in place for around 800 
by 2020. This includes an expanding 
series of innovative partnerships with 
selected managed house ’expert’ 
operators, to develop opportunities in 
high quality sites in our estate. 
In this leaner, fitter pub market, 
industry sales are expected to 
grow to around £21 .5bn
2
 in 2016, an 
increase of 1% on 2015, with modest 
sales increases also forecast for the 
near-term future. 
Regulation and 
legislation
The market in which the Group 
operates is routinely subject to 
regulatory and legislative scrutiny, 
and over the past decade, the pub 
sector has been affected by a number 
of important changes, on top of the 
Government’s fiscal adjustments to 
the alcohol duty regime. 
Among the more significant examples 
of recent legislative actions are:
•	 the National Living Wage, which 
disproportionately affects the 
hospitality sector;
•	 the proposed ‘sugar tax’ which will 
be applied to certain types of soft 
drinks; and 
•	 the Pubs Code, and the 
appointment of an independent 
Adjudicator to enforce the Code.
The advent of the Pubs Code brings 
significant specific changes to the 
leased and tenanted pub sector and 
these are discussed in more detail in 
the Chief Executive’s review.

Our strategy
Our key strategic objective is to optimise value creation  
for every asset in our portfolio. 
To achieve this we have developed a broader mix of operating 
models, employing our four stage process to optimise the use of 
every asset and underpin value creation.
Using our segmentation 
tool, understand the retail 
potential of each of our 
property assets.
Take the recommendations 
from the segmentation tool 
and match each asset to 
the most suitable retail offer.
Manage the transition 
of assets to their final 
destination, in order to 
generate the greatest 
returns.
Through the asset optimisation 
process using returns-based 
assessment, select the best 
operating model to support 
delivery of the chosen retail 
proposition.
FY16 progress: Roll out of our segmentation 
tool to assist in identification of opportunities 
to enhance performance, and when 
recruiting, helping match the right publicans 
to the right pub.
FY16 progress: All site investment 
supports retail offers that match 
segmentation recommendations. 
FY16 progress: This year we opened 
over 70 managed houses and 
significantly increased our commercial 
properties estate. We are on track to 
achieve our vision for 2020.
FY16 progress: The Asset 
Optimisation Panel approves our 
asset conversions, taking into account 
required return thresholds for each 
operating model. In 2016, over 850 
sites passed through the Panel.

Our strategy
Operating business units
To be truly successful we must be confident about the strengths 
and capabilities of our operating models. 
They have been developed as best suited to optimise the range 
of retail propositions identified from the segmentation exercise, 
most of these operating models extend beyond individual retail 
propositions and some operating business units overlap creating 
competition and ultimately the optimum outcome for the Group.
Our leased and tenanted estate continues 
to be our core business and we strive to 
maintain our like-for-like net income growth by 
supporting publicans to continually grow their 
businesses. We pride ourselves on our ability 
to attract and retain new and experienced 
entrepreneurial publicans to run our pubs 
and continually reassess our offer to ensure 
that both the nature of our contractual 
agreements and the range of support we 
provide is competitive and impactful. Whilst 
we expect the size of our Publican Partnership 
estate to gradually reduce, we will endeavour 
to continually improve its quality.
The Group’s commercial property business manages 
a developing portfolio of assets which it leases to third 
parties on commercial property terms. The portfolio 
incorporates predominantly pub assets, which are 
let to tenants on a commercial free-of-tie basis and 
also assets that were previously pubs, now converted 
to an alternative use (such as a convenience store). 
Our tenants include household names as well as 
independent public house and restaurant operators.
We work alongside other business units in evaluating 
group assets, identifying opportunities to optimise 
value by bringing assets into our commercial property 
portfolio. While this will often be by granting a lease 
on a free-of-tie basis, we also add value by obtaining 
planning consents and deploying development 
capital where there is opportunity to release the 
embedded value in properties through development. 
This includes releasing value from land and buildings 
adjacent to our pub properties. We also develop 
standalone and residential sites on land that is surplus 
to pub requirements, which may then be sold.

THE CRAFT UNION PUB COMPANY
The Craft Union Pub Company aims to put quality 
pubs back in the heart of local communities. We 
want to be the pub of choice for locals to meet up 
and watch their favourite sports as we believe pubs 
play a vital role in the lives of their customers and 
we are committed to nurturing this, through working 
with outstanding operators that share our passion. 
Our pubs are generally smaller operations with 
no food offering, but have excellent audio visual 
equipment, with sports and entertainment being 
key footfall drivers. 
We have pubs in our estate where we believe there is a significant 
upside potential which has yet to be realised. We recognise that 
this is often due to the pub needing a specialist offering from an 
experienced operator in order to release the optimum value. For 
these sites, we are looking to partner with some of the best operators 
in the pub industry in order to tap into their expertise. We provide a 
good pipeline of sites, and the buying power and support of a large 
business, whilst they bring exceptional retail capability.
Our first managed investment partnership, with Rupert Clevely as 
Hippo Inns Limited, has opened six sites during the year, following 
transformational capital investment projects. Since that time, we have 
announced further partnerships, which include:
•	 Mash Inns, with Laine Pub Group
•	 Frontier Pubs, with Food & Fuel
•	 Hunky Dory Pubs, with Oakman Inns & Restaurants
•	 Marmalade Pub Co, with The Marylebone Leisure Group
BERMONDSEY PUB COMPANY
Bermondsey Pub Company is our business 
unit for operating our fully managed pubs.  We 
are dedicated to giving our customers great 
service, good food and drink, and above all, fun 
times in any of our Bermondsey pubs, and are 
passionate about the great British pub being 
at the heart of every community.  The principal 
format is our Meeting House offer, which attracts 
passing trade as well as locals through offering 
an informal and vibrant atmosphere

Formerly a leased and tenanted pub that had closed, the 
Ye Olde George Inn is a picturesque country pub on an 
estuary, with the majority of its trade coming from tourists in 
the summer. 
Using our segmentation tool to assess the best offer and 
our asset optimisation process to assess the investment 
opportunity, we determined this to be an upper/mid-market, 
food-led pub, ideal for conversion to a Bermondsey site. This 
also gave Bermondsey a prime location presence on the 
south coast, in line with its expansion plans. 
Through some extensive renovation work, to ensure the pub 
maintained its traditional feel whilst introducing a modern 
urban twist, we made improvements to all areas of the site, 
paying particular attention to the courtyard, which sets 
the site apart from its competitors. Following a full review of 
those competitors, we opened the pub with an innovative 
pizza-led offer in partnership with Dough Ball Pizza, who 
specialise in traditional handcrafted dough, to drive speed 
of service and provide a quality food solution to customers 
with year round appeal. 
After much hard work and targeted social media activity, 
the pub was successfully opened by the local MP in July 
2016, exceeding all expectations since with a significant 
increase in weekly trade.
The new manager who was extremely keen to join the 
Bermondsey team given the exciting potential of the new 
site and the chance to help refine the Bermondsey offer, has 
worked hard building relationships with the local community 
to ensure a steady flow of regular customers through the off 
peak winter months, establishing regular events such as jazz 
evenings and quiz nights. 
Overall the Ye Olde George Inn is a great example of how 
an under-invested site can be turned into a true hub of the 
community and an excellent addition to the Bermondsey 
family.

Overview
We are pleased to report our full 
year results for the year ended 30 
September 2016, during which period 
we have delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £292 million, 
down £4 million on the comparative 
period primarily as a result of planned 
asset disposals. Profit before taxation, 
excluding exceptional items, was 
unchanged at £122 million as lower 
interest costs, resulting from reduced 
levels of debt, have offset the decline 
in EBITDA. 
Through the execution of our strategic 
plan we have set out to improve our 
capability in retailing, developing 
our understanding and usage of 
consumer insights to help us to 
identify the most appropriate retail 
proposition for each of our assets, to 
inform our subsequent investment 
decisions and to determine the 
appropriate operating model with 
which to optimise the return from 
each asset and deliver greater 
shareholder value. This means we are 
evolving from a predominantly leased 
and tenanted operation to a portfolio 
of businesses operating a variety of 
models and trading styles. Our Group 
vision is to be recognised as the 
most innovative, progressive, value-
creating portfolio manager of pubs 
and properties in the UK. 
Enterprise Publican 
Partnerships 
Enterprise Publican Partnerships is 
the trading name for our tied leased 
and tenanted business which is the 
largest part of our Group. Whilst the 
scale of our tied leased and tenanted 
business is expected to decline over 
the coming years, as we migrate 
assets to alternative operating 
models, we are confident that the 
quality of the retained Enterprise 
Publican Partnerships estate will be 
enhanced. Such quality enhancement 
will be delivered through the disposal 
of the poorer performing sites; 
continued capital investment in tied 
tenancies to drive enhanced retail 
offers; market-leading support from 
our highly trained regional managers; 
our plans to share the knowledge 
and experience we are gaining from 
our directly managed operations with 
our tied publicans; and our ability to 
leverage scale benefits from managed 
operations which can then be shared 
with our tied publicans.
As at 30 September 2016, there 
were 4,470 pubs trading within the 
total leased and tenanted estate 
which delivered growth in like-for-like 
net income of 2.1% in the financial 
year. The improvement in trading 
performance has been achieved 
across all geographic regions within 
our estate throughout the year. 
It is particularly pleasing to see 
like-for-like net income growth being 
delivered across all regions with the 
North reporting growth for the first 
time in several years (up 1 .1%). We 
have maintained our like-for-like net 
income growth in the Midlands (up 
1 .7%), and delivered strong growth in 
the South (up 2.7%).

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
15
We provide our tied leased and 
tenanted publicans with a broad range 
of services to help them operate 
their pubs efficiently and effectively. 
Where appropriate we also provide 
direct financial assistance to publicans. 
In the year we provided £5 million 
(2015: £6 million) of such assistance. 
As a consequence of the successful 
application of these initiatives we 
have further reduced the number of 
unplanned business failures, down 
14% in the current year compared 
to the prior year. The proactive 
intervention of our regional managers 
to identify and then avoid these 
potential business failures is a key 
driver of the consistent improvements 
achieved in our like-for-like net income. 
Following the recent regulatory 
changes and specifically the 
introduction of the Market Rent 
Only (MRO) option for publicans 
there is now a degree of uncertainty 
with regard to the level of future 
income that we might earn from 
long-term tied leases. Therefore we 
no longer offer new tied leases for 
a period of greater than five years, 
we are unlikely to invest significantly 
in existing long-term tied leases 
and we more closely scrutinise 
such agreements at the time of 
renewal or assignment to protect 
our interests. We do offer a wide 
range of tied tenancy agreements to 
prospective publicans including our 
Beacon “managed tenancy” , for the 
competitive value wet-led retail offer, 
and our new Partnership Tenancy 
Plus, which we launched in the 
second half of the financial year. 
Enterprise Commercial 
Properties 
We continue to expand our high 
quality commercial property portfolio 
operated within our Enterprise 
Commercial Properties business and 
in the financial year properties that 
traded as commercial properties 
throughout both this year and the 
prior year increased like-for-like net 
income by 3.8%. 
As at 30 September 2016 we had  
273, and at 14 November 2016 we 
have 291, commercial properties, the 
vast majority of which trade as pubs 
on a free-of-tie basis. These properties 
have an annualised rental income of 
£18.0 million (with an average rent 
of £62,000) and were valued at 30 
September 2016 at £208 million, 
resulting in a gross yield of 8.7%. 
On 7 June 2016 we sold a portfolio 
of 22 commercial properties 
which comprised of 17 pubs and 5 
convenience stores geographically 
spread across England. The disposal 
generated £20 million of net proceeds, 
representing a 9% premium to the 
prior year-end book value and a 6.7% 
yield based upon the gross rental 
income of £1 .34 million. The disposal 
package is typical of the type of assets 
we are now adding to our commercial 
property portfolio and therefore 
provides an indication of the inherent 
value of the portfolio.
We expect to be operating around 
400 to 450 commercial properties 
by 30 September 2017 , although, 
as demonstrated by the recent 
disposal described above, growing 
the scale of our commercial property 
portfolio in itself is not our primary 
objective, and we will constantly 
assess opportunities to crystallise and 
capture value from this estate.

leased and tenanted business
 — Continued momentum with leased and tenanted 
like-for-like net income up 2.1% (2015: up 0.8%)

operational control, complete 
transparency of all sales and cost 
lines and the use of consumer 
insights are giving us increased 
certainty over the returns achievable 
from these managed pubs.
Utilising our segmentation model 
we have identified that our existing 
pub estate provides us with a robust 
pipeline for the future expansion of 
our managed retail formats and we 
are confident that the original target, 
set in May 2015, of a managed house 
estate comprising between 750 and 
850 pubs by 2020 is deliverable.

Enterprise Managed 
Operations: Craft Union  
Pub Company
Our largest managed house operation 
is the Craft Union business which 
operated 71 sites at 30 September 
2016. It operates 75 sites at 14 
November 2016 and we expect it 
to be operating around 170 sites by 
30 September 2017 . This business 
predominantly operates in the north 
of England, but is beginning to 
expand south and we expect its offer 
to appeal nationally. Currently, its 
offer is wet-led with quality beers, 
at affordable prices, served in local, 
well-invested, community pubs. The 
simplicity of the offer mitigates our 
execution risk and also improves the 
efficiency of our capital investment. 
As at 14 November 2016, we had 38 
pubs operating within Craft Union 
that had traded for more than six 
months and these pubs are to-date 
generating average annualised site 
EBITDA of £92,000, from an average 
capital investment of £126,000, 
which delivers pre-tax returns of 
36%. A number of these early sites 
have delivered exceptional trading 
performance which we may not be 
able to replicate as we extend our offer 
and accelerate the rollout programme. 
We would expect our Craft Union sites 
to generate site EBITDA in the range 
of £80,000 to £100,000 on average. 
After an average capital investment in 
the region of £100,000, we expect to 
yield returns on investment in excess 
of 20%.
Enterprise Managed 
Operations: Bermondsey 
Pub Company 
As at 30 September 2016 we 
operated 28 managed pubs within 
our Bermondsey business. As at 14 
November 2016 we operated 30 pubs 
and expect to have in the region of 50 
pubs in this model by 30 September 
2017 . All of these Bermondsey 
pubs operate under our successful 
“Meeting House” format, an upper 
mid-market, mixed food and drink offer.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
During the year we trialled five 
Bermondsey sites operating under 
our “Friends and Family” format in 
the value-led, mixed food and drink 
segment. We found this market 
segment to be highly competitive, 
requiring significant investment 
and scale of operation in order to 
deliver adequate returns. We have 
therefore determined that this retail 
segment should not be a priority for 
our business and have subsequently 
either sold, let free-of-tie or converted 
the trial sites to an amended retail 
offer within our managed operations.
At 14 November 2016 we had 11 pubs 
operating within our Bermondsey 
business that had traded for more 
than six months and these pubs 
are to-date generating average 
annualised site EBITDA of £116,000, 
from an average capital investment 
of £187 ,000, which delivers pre-tax 
returns of 25%. As we enhance 
our offers within the Bermondsey 
business we would expect the 
average capital investment to be in 
the region of £200,000 with average 
site EBITDA expected to grow to be 
in the range of £125,000 to £175,000, 
which we expect to yield returns on 
investment in excess of 15%.
Enterprise Managed 
Investments 
In some retail segments, pub 
operators have to be both innovative 
and highly flexible in order to be 
able to continually adapt more 
complex retail offers to the changing 
demands of consumers. Within our 
Managed Investments business we 
have developed a partnership model 
whereby we can work with carefully 
selected managed house operators to 
share in the benefits of trading certain 
high quality establishments in such 
retail segments. 
We entered our first such partnership 
with Hippo Inns, established with 
Rupert Clevely, founder of Geronimo 
Inns, and Hippo Inns currently has 
six pubs in operation. To date we 
have established four additional 
partnerships with the creation of: 
Mash Inns, a new venture with Laine 
Pub Group; Frontier Pubs, a venture 
with Food & Fuel; Hunky Dory Pubs 
in conjunction with Oakman Inns; and 
Marmalade Pub Company, a venture 
with the Marylebone Leisure Group. 
In aggregate these partnerships 
enable us to provide a broader range 
of consumer offers across a wider 
geographic market than we might 
have achieved on our own. As at 30 
September 2016 we had eight pubs 
and as at 14 November 2016 we had 
a total of 11 pubs trading under our 
various relationships and we expect 
to grow this model in the coming year 
such that by 30 September 2017 we 
expect to be operating with around 
ten partners and trading in the region 
of 30 pubs. 
Optimising capital 
allocation to enhance 
returns
Enterprise generates significant 
cash flows from trading activities 
supplemented by disposals of 
under-performing assets. We have 
established a returns-based approach 
to the use of our future cash flows 
which seeks to continue our debt 
reduction programme and to provide 
a balance between additional value 
enhancing investment opportunities 
and more immediate returns to 
shareholders. 
Our capital allocation framework 
first seeks to ensure that all priority 
calls upon cash flows are satisfied, 
including corporation tax, interest, 
scheduled debt amortisation 
and costs associated with debt 
refinancing, followed by on-going 
investment in our business. We are 
committed to gradually reducing our 
leverage over the medium-term and, 
assuming we are on track to satisfy 
this objective, then any “excess” cash 
flow can be assessed for alternative 
use, including in particular, further 
investment in the estate or the return 
of capital to shareholders.

Capital investment
Capital investment is a value-
enhancing use of cash generated 
by the business and includes the 
recycling of proceeds of disposals. It is 
an important contributor to delivering 
improved like-for-like net income within 
our leased and tenanted business and 
is an essential element of the strategic 
evolution of the business as we invest 
in the conversion of pubs to our 
managed operations. 
Total capital investment in the year 
was £74 million (2015: £69 million), 
of which 57% was directed toward 
income growth opportunities 
(2015: 44%). We target Return on 
Investment (ROI) in excess of 15% 
on our growth oriented capital 
expenditure and have achieved an 
average ROI of 22% (2015: 19%) on 
schemes delivered during the  
financial year. 
Allocation of excess cash
During the year to 30 September 
2016 we generated £48 million of 
excess cash flow. Applying our capital 
allocation framework, the Board 
decided to utilise this excess cash 
flow to fund the £27 .5 million cost 
to repurchase £250 million of the 
2018 bonds and, in order to optimise 
shareholder returns, to fund a £25 
million share buyback of ETI shares 
for cancellation. This share buyback 
programme was initiated on 22 March 
2016 and as at 14 November 2016 we 
have purchased 14 million shares at 
an average price of 91p per share.
Outlook 
Trading in the first six weeks of the 
new financial year has been in line 
with our expectations and we are 
confident that the actions we are 
taking to execute our strategic plans 
are the most appropriate response 
to changes in the regulatory and 
economic environment. Whilst 
mindful that the potential impact of 
the regulatory changes is not yet 
completely clear, we plan to deliver 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
in our leased and tenanted tied pub 
estate for the full year and to further 
expand our commercial property and 
managed house businesses in line 
with our strategy.   
Regulatory review
On 21 July 2016 the new Statutory 
Code of Practice introduced by the 
Small Business, Enterprise and 
Employment Act 2015 came into 
effect. The Pubs Code applies to 
the six companies with over 500 
pubs operating under tied leased 
and tenancy agreements in England 
and Wales, and is overseen by an 
independent Adjudicator.
The new legislation includes 
a tenant’s right, under certain 
circumstances, to change the freely-
negotiated commercial terms of 
their existing agreement to a new 
Market Rent Only (MRO) compliant 
agreement. This enables some 
occupational tenants to elect to 
opt-out of the supply tie at certain 
points or after certain exceptional 
events during the term of their lease 
agreement and therefore occupy the 
premises on a standard commercial 
property lease, paying rent only. In 
the event that a tenant elected to 
invoke this option, whilst our income 
derived from the supply of tied drinks 
products would be partially offset by 
increases in rent, it is possible that 
our total income from that property 
would be adversely affected.
The impact of MRO is expected to 
take effect over five years, as MRO 
trigger events are largely expected 
to arise through the cycle of five 
yearly rent reviews and agreement 
renewals, which apply only to our 
leases. As such, since the concept 
of MRO agreements was first 
announced in November 2014, 
we have worked hard to reduce 
our exposure to such longer-term 
leases and increase the proportion 
of our tied business operating under 
shorter-term tenancies where rent 
reviews and renewals do not apply. 
As at November 2014 we had 3,035 
long-term lease agreements and this 
has reduced by 634 to 2,401 as at 30 
September 2016. 
From the date of the implementation 
of the new Pubs Code, there have 
been 285 potential MRO trigger 
events. In 94 of these cases the 
publican made a valid request for an 
MRO quote. Whilst none of these 
requests has yet to result in the 
introduction of an MRO compliant 
agreement, at this stage it is too 
early to say how many may ultimately 
do so. In our 2017 financial year we 
expect to have approximately 600 
cyclical rent reviews and agreement 
renewals which may potentially 
constitute MRO events. Although we 
experienced a short-term slowdown 
in letting activity upon implementation 
of the Pubs Code, due to the need to 
re-market all lets in line with the new 
regulatory requirements, we do not 
expect this to impact our expectations 
for the current year financial 
performance.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
The Duke of Sussex in Lower Marsh, Waterloo was the third 
site in our Hippo Inns Managed Investments business, 
opening in April 2016. The pub had been operated as a 
traditional ‘wet-led’ pub for over 30 years by the previous 
publican. Following lease expiry, Enterprise, under its new 
strategy was able to occupy, invest and evolve the offer 
to include great food, trade longer hours and create a 
modern vibrant pub. The opening has been celebrated by 
customers and local community groups alike, has increased 
employment in the local area, and is now one of the most 
successful businesses in Lower Marsh, providing solid 
returns for the investment and creating substantial value for 
Enterprise. 
Our partnership with Rupert Clevely and the unique ‘magic’ 
that is provided through design, great service culture and 
people has allowed us to deliver what many have described 
as the future pub experience today. Hippo Inns now 
operates six pubs in this model with more in the pipeline.

Several of the KPIs selected by the Group have been changed in the year to better reflect the linkages between strategy, 
performance and the remuneration of directors. In addition, the prior year included KPIs for EBITDA and PBT before 
exceptional items and for business failures. The EBITDA and PBT measures are clearly shown in our income statement 
and business failures has been omitted this year as our KPI for like-for-like net income for the leased and tenanted estate 
is considered to incorporate the impact of business failures.

We have delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £292 million, 
down £4 million compared to the 
prior year primarily due to our disposal 
programme. 
Leased and tenanted estate like-
for-like net income, the primary 
component of our EBITDA, is derived 
from our rental income and our net 
income from the sale of beer and 
other products to our publicans. 
Adjusted for the effect of disposals 
we have seen our like-for-like leased 
and tenanted net income grow to 
£338 million (2015: £331 million), up 
2.1%. In the year our like-for-like net 
income from rents is in line with last 
year, primarily assisted by growth 
at rent reviews and the reduction 
in unplanned business failures. This 
reduction in failures has enabled us to 
reduce our discretionary support by 
£1 million, whilst our net income from 
beer supply has grown by £6 million 
as pricing and mix benefits, net of 
discounts, have offset volume decline. 
Pre-exceptional administrative costs in 
the year were £40 million (2015: £37 
million), reflecting the recruitment of 
additional capability to assist in the 
delivery of our strategic objectives 
and an element of incremental cost 
associated with the introduction 
of the new Pubs Code. Whilst we 
continue to apply rigorous focus on 
tightly controlling our cost base we 
do expect our administrative costs to 
grow further, to around £42 million, in 
the current financial year in support of 
our strategic development. 
Pre-exceptional net finance costs of 
£154 million (2015: £158 million) are 
£4 million lower than the comparative 
period as a result of our strategy 
of debt reduction, a strategy which 
we plan to continue in the current 
financial year, resulting in expected 
pre-exceptional net finance costs of 
around £148 million to £150 million.
Total pre-tax exceptional charges 
are £47 million (2015: £193 million) 
comprising a charge of £7 million 
(2015: £26 million) in respect of debt 
refinancing costs; a £33 million (2015: 
£163 million) charge in respect of 
the valuation of the property estate; 
a £9 million (2015: £8 million) charge 
relating to goodwill allocated to 
disposals; a £3 million  
(2015: £1 million) charge of 
exceptional administrative costs and 
a profit on disposal of property, plant 
and equipment of £5 million (2015: £5 
million). The property estate valuation 
charge of £33 million (2015: £163 
million) consists of a charge of £18 
million (2015: £120 million) arising 
from the annual valuation exercise 
and a charge of £15 million (2015: £43 
million) arising from the revaluation 
of assets on transfer to non-current 
assets held for sale.
Total tax in the period was a charge 
of £4 million (2015: £6 million credit), 
representing a charge of £25 million 
(2015: £25 million) on the pre-
exceptional trading profit and a credit 
of £21 million (2015: £31 million) 
relating to the tax on exceptional 
items. The effective tax rate on the 
pre-exceptional trading profits arising 
in the year is 20.1% (2015: 20.5%) 
which is in line with our estimated 
effective tax rate for the financial year 
ending 30 September 2017 .
Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 
19.6p (2015: 19.4p), was up 0.2p on 
the prior year. Basic EPS was 14.2p 
compared to a loss per share of 13.0p 
in the prior year, primarily due to 
lower exceptional charges incurred 
in respect of debt refinancing and 
property valuation movements.

ThE CrAfT UnIOn PUB COMPAny 
ThE QUEEns, BrAdfOrd
The Queens, Bradford started trading as a Craft Union site in May 2015 
following a £140,000 investment to redevelop its entire retail proposition and 
is an excellent example of how this Craft Union offer works within an urban 
location. The Queens is very much a local community hub with the majority 
of its income driven by day time trade. The customer base for the pub is a 
mix of locals and passing trade to and from the main train station in Bradford 
City Centre, but its sports related offer is a key footfall driver for this site. Whilst 
boxing is proving very popular, it has become a key venue for home fans of 
Bradford City Football Club. 
By the end of September 2016, the Queens was consistently trading ahead 
of our original expectation and delivering annual house EBITDA nearly five 
times higher than the year before conversion as a leased and tenanted pub.
Using our segmentation tool we were able to ensure the site had the ideal 
demographic statistics for the Craft Union offer, demonstrating how Bradford 
falls within our target socio-economic catchment. Craft Union targets this 
particular demographic audience as we can offer competitive pricing in an 
environment with a high quality retail proposition.

Strategic report
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operating 
activities at £269 million  
(2015: £265 million), was higher than 
the comparative period primarily as 
a result of tax payments being lower 
by £15 million due to the tax benefits 
from the prior year refinancing costs 
and repayments from HMRC in 
respect of prior year overpayments 
and capital allowance claims. 
Net cash flows from investing 
activities created an inflow of £24 
million (2015: £6 million). We reinvest 
the majority of our net disposal 
proceeds in capital investment in the 
estate, with net proceeds received 
from disposals of £98 million  
(2015: £75 million) helping fund 
the £74 million (2015: £69 million) 
invested in the period.
Financing cash flows of £275 million 
(2015: £267 million), primarily reflect 
net interest paid of £154 million  
(2015: £157 million), net loan 
repayments of £104 million  
(2015: £77 million), refinancing costs 
of £7 million (2015: £28 million) 
and £11 million (2015: £5 million) of 
payments to acquire own shares.
Balance sheet
Our balance sheet remains strong 
with a total net asset value of £1 .4 
billion, represented by £3.6 billion of 
property assets offset by net debt 
of £2.2 billion. The property asset 
valuation is based upon the valuation 
undertaken as at 30 September 
2016. The Unique property estate 
is valued by Colliers International 
and the assets that secure the ETI 
corporate bonds are valued by GVA 
Grimley with the balance of the estate 
being valued internally. The basis of 
valuation is consistently applied with 
94% of the property portfolio valued 
by independent external valuers. 
The result from this year’s valuation 
was an increase in the total value of 
the estate by £3 million, or 0.1%, 
compared to a reduction in the prior 
year of £101 million, or 2.7%.
The share price at 30 September 2016 
of 93p (2015: 108p), which equates to 
an equity value of £454 million  
(2015: £540 million), compares to a 
net asset value per share of £2.96 
(2015: £2.70). We believe that the 
successful execution of our strategic 
plan, which will optimise the use and 
value of our asset portfolio, should 
lead to a significant reduction of this 
value differential.

Capital structure
We have a long-term, secure, flexible 
and tax efficient financing structure 
comprising of bank borrowings, 
securitised notes and corporate 
bonds. We are a cash generative 
business and have, over the past few 
years, used excess cash to reduce 
debt. During the year we have used 
cash generated by the business to 
meet the scheduled amortisation of 
securitised notes leaving total net 
debt at £2.2 billion (2015: £2.3 billion). 
Corporate and  
convertible bonds 
As at 30 September 2016 we had 
£1,125 million (2015: £1,125 million) of 
secured corporate bonds outstanding 
which are non-amortising, secured 
against ring-fenced portfolios of 
freehold pubs and attracting fixed 
interest rates averaging approximately 
6.5% (2015: 6.5%). 
On 4 November 2016, we completed 
a partial refinancing of our corporate 
bonds. Prior to the refinancing, £350.5 
million of secured corporate bonds 
due in 2018 were outstanding with 
a coupon of 6.5%. We repurchased 
£250 million of these bonds at a 
cash purchase price of 111 .0% of 
their principal amount, representing 
a cash repurchase premium of £27 .5 
million, which will be recorded as 
an exceptional finance charge in 
the current year income statement. 
The repurchase was financed by the 
issue of a new £250 million secured 
corporate bond due in February 2022 
at a coupon of 6.375%. The result of 
the transaction is a reduction of the 
corporate bonds maturing in 2018 to 
£100.5 million.
In addition to the corporate bonds, 
we have unsecured convertible bonds 
that were issued in September 2013 
for gross proceeds of £97 million and 
which mature in 2020. The convertible 
bonds have a coupon rate of 3.5% 
and are convertible at a share price of 
£1 .91 into 50.8 million ordinary shares 
at any time up to 2020.
Bank borrowings 
At 30 September 2016 our drawn 
bank borrowings net of Enterprise 
company cash were £32 million  
(2015: £50 million). The non-amortising 
revolving credit facility of £138 million, 
which was in place throughout the 
financial year ended 30 September 
2016, was replaced on 24 October 
2016 by a new £120 million non-
amortising revolving credit facility 
which is available through to August 
2020. The terms of the new facility 
are consistent with the old facility, 
including a coupon rate of 3% above 
LIBOR applicable to any drawn portion 
of the facility.
securitised notes 
During the period we have repaid, 
in accordance with scheduled 
amortisation, £74 million of the 
Unique A3 and A4 securitised 
notes. In addition we purchased and 
cancelled £10 million (2015: nil) of 
securitised notes in the open market, 
which left £1 .1 billion outstanding at 
30 September 2016. Operational cash 
generated from the business has 
been used to meet this scheduled 
amortisation of the securitised notes. 
The notes amortise over a period 
to 2032 and attract interest rates 
of between 5.7% and 7 .4%. At 30 
September 2016 the Group was £80 
million ahead of the amortisation 
schedule of the “class A ” securitised 
notes through early repayment 
and market purchases. Scheduled 
amortisation will require us to make 
payments of £77 million in 2017 , £81 
million in 2018 and £85 million in 
2019.
On 24 March 2016 the noteholders 
of the Unique securitisation voted 
in favour of proposals to amend 
certain aspects of the transaction 
documentation to permit increased 
numbers of managed houses within 
the securitisation property portfolio. 
With these amendments in place, 
we believe the capital structure can 
fully accommodate the delivery of our 
strategic plans.

We are continuously evolving our 
corporate social responsibility (CSR) 
agenda, and are committed to 
operating our business in an ethical 
and responsible manner. This is 
demonstrated in particular this year 
by the launch of our vision and values, 
which will help deliver consistent 
behaviours amongst all those who 
interact with the Group and its 
employees in whatever capacity. 
This report does not contain 
information about any policies of the 
Group in relation to human rights 
issues since it is not considered 
necessary for an understanding of the 
development, performance or position 
of the Group’s business activities. 
Our CSR delivery framework is based 
on strategic drivers being community, 
people, publicans, responsible 
retailing and environment and they 
are now underpinned by our vision 
and values.
COMMUNITY
Our focus on community recognises 
that we have over 4,900 properties 
across the length and breadth of 
England and Wales, each responsible 
for delivering a service to the 
community in which it operates. We 
strive to ensure we do the best that 
we can to positively impact those 
communities, through partnering 
with publicans and employing people 
that want to live and work in these 
areas, and remaining sensitive to local 
issues.
Each of the pubs we own or operate 
is unique and we and our publicans or 
employees aim to provide a distinctive 
service to attract a diverse range of 
customers and community groups. 
All pubs aim to create a congenial, 
non-discriminatory atmosphere and 
promote the prevention of crime 
and disorder, preservation of public 
safety, prevention of public nuisance 
and protection of children from 
harm, and must operate so that 
commercial initiatives do not override 
our core values. We work to ensure 
that licensing hours and conditions 
attached to pub premises licenses 
are appropriate and take account of 
the opportunities and interests of all 
parties.
Community heroes awards
At the start of our Community Heroes 
scheme, we committed to spend £1 
million, which we have done over the 
past five years. Each year, the number 
of entrants has increased, and we 
have heard and seen some incredible 
contributions to local communities. 
Our 2016 winners were Russell 
and Sarah Clark of The Cleveland 
Bay in Redcar, North Yorkshire. They 
impressed the judges with their 
tireless efforts to make their pub 
a true hub of the community, with 
various groups meeting there almost 
every night, and the great lengths 
they have gone to in ensuring the pub 
is fully accessible to those less able, 
and won the £6,000 top prize.
supporting industry trade 
bodies and associations
We support key industry trade bodies 
and associations including the British 
Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), the 
leading body representing Britain’s 
brewers and pub companies who 
strive to promote and protect one of 
the nation’s most iconic and important 
industries, and the Federation of 
Licensed Victuallers Associations 
(FLVA), an organisation looking after 
the business interests of self-
employed licensees in the licensed 
trade. The FLVA and the British 
Institute of Innkeeping (BII) regularly 
attend our recruitment events and 
entepriselive roadshows to discuss 
the benefits of membership with both 
potential and existing publicans. 
We also continue to be a proud 
sponsor of the Pub is The Hub 
campaign, which offers guidance and 
advice to publicans on how to offer 
additional services through their pub, 
to cement it at the heart of its local 
community.
Charity
The Group is committed to supporting 
charitable causes through its charity 
committee. The committee both 
organises fundraising events at Head 
Office to support various causes, such 
as Macmillan, and agrees Company 
donations to sponsor employees in 
their individual challenges.
Enterprise is again working with 
Charles Wells to support the British 
Legion, and has re-launched ‘Poppy’ 
beer for which the Legion will 
receive 10 pence for each pint sold. 
This initiative raised £15,000 when 
launched in 2015, with a similar 
amount hoped for this year.
We continue to work in a Primary 
Authority Scheme partnership with 
West Midlands Fire Service. Our 
contribution of £15,000 per year 
to support this partnership is used 
to promote the charity Safeside, 
experiential learning centres 
in Eastside and Handsworth in 
Birmingham. 
Through our managed businesses 
we have sought to align our ethos of 
being involved in and supporting the 
communities in which we operate. 
We have worked with Stride Ventures 
over the last year running the ‘Putting 
Young Minds to Work’ programme 
of eight classes of school children 
in London. This project is designed 
to kick start entrepreneurship, 
develop employability skills and raise 
aspirations. The children participating 
showed self-assessed improvement 
in their understanding of the 
economy, how the UK makes its 
money and what businesses need to 
be successful.

Employee engagement
The Group is committed to 
communicating with its employees, 
and does so by way of its intranet and 
regular briefing sessions throughout 
the business. Since 2014 we have 
held an annual opinion survey with 
employees to understand how they 
feel about their jobs. In 2016, 94% 
of our team completed the survey 
and we achieved another high score 
of 82% of people who are proud 
to work for Enterprise. The output 
of the survey, and various sessions 
across the business to interrogate the 
results, has enabled us to identify the 
drivers of engagement to focus on 
for 2016/17 to continue to promote 
engagement.
diversity and inclusion
We are committed to equal 
opportunities and the creation 
of an entirely non-discriminatory 
working environment and operate 
to ensure that all employees are 
recruited, developed, promoted and 
remunerated on the basis of their 
skills and job suitability. In addition, 
the Group is dedicated to undertaking 
its business operations in a way which 
respects individual human rights, 
diversity and equality, and treats 
individuals with dignity and allows 
freedom of association.
We give full consideration to 
applications for employment 
from disabled persons where the 
requirements of the job can be 
adequately fulfilled by them. We 
endeavour to retain the employment 
of, and arrange suitable retraining for, 
any employee who becomes disabled 
during their employment as well as 
providing training, career development 
and promotion to disabled employees 
wherever appropriate.
Training
We recognise that in order to get the 
best from our employees and drive 
business performance, we need to 
provide training to enhance skills and 
development opportunities to advance 
our employees. We endeavour to 
fill our vacancies through internal 
progression, however where people 
join us we aim to provide the best 
possible start with structured 
induction plans in place for everyone. 
All new starters receive a Group 
induction, followed by department 
specific inductions and training. 
We encourage and support our 
employees to develop a long-term 
career with us, with 46% of our 
employees having been with us for 
over five years and 30% of employees 
having over 10 years’ experience.

Internal progression is something we 
are proud to champion. Our series 
of dedicated training programmes, 
which includes our Management 
Development Programme that we 
launched last year, support our 
employees to develop their career 
from stepping into their first line 
manager role through to becoming 
a member of our Senior Leadership 
Team. Since the launch of our strategy 
in May 2015, over 10% of our team 
have achieved internal progression.
We have also supported 31 
employees to obtain professional 
qualifications during the year, 
covering a broad range of areas from 
accountancy and legal to marketing 
and chartered surveying, and we have 
recruited our first apprentices into 
finance and administrative roles at our 
head office. Our managed businesses 
are committed to a target of 10 
apprentices through 2017 which will 
give qualifications in front of house 
hospitality and kitchen service.
In 2016 we retained our Gold 
accreditation by Investors in People, 
an accolade we have held since 1999.
r eward and recognition
Enterprise offers a flexible benefits 
scheme to employees, which allows 
them to choose from a selection 
of benefits to suit their individual 
lifestyle. The benefits include a 
cycle to work scheme, leisure club 
membership, private medical and 
dental insurance, flexible holiday 
benefits, a health screening service 
and a childcare voucher scheme. Over 
half of our employees have opted to 
join at least one available scheme. 
In addition, the Group supports the 
provision of a confidential employee 
assistance programme. Enterprise 
encourages employee ownership 
of Company shares through the 
provision of a Save as You Earn 
Scheme and a Share Incentive Plan.
Our employee handbook takes 
account of relevant employment 
legislation and best practice. New 
policies, procedures and related 
training are developed as required. 
The Group’s anti-bribery and 
corruption code of conduct sets out 
how Group employees, publicans and 
suppliers must act to ensure that our 
zero tolerance approach to bribery and 
corruption is upheld.
We recognise that paying the National  
Living Wage supports our aim of 
attracting and retaining great people 
to operate our businesses and in turn 
will reduce staff turnover and improve 
motivation and productivity. As a 
result, we have built the implications 
of paying the National Living Wage 
into our expansion plans in our 
managed businesses.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
PUBLICANS
Enterprise is committed to fair, 
transparent and lawful dealing 
with our publicans. Our Code of 
Practice was replaced in the year 
by a Statutory Pubs Code which 
now governs our dealings with our 
publicans. The Pubs Code is overseen 
by an Independent Adjudicator for 
the six companies with over 500 
pubs operating under tied lease and 
tenancy agreements in England and 
Wales. 
new publican support 
Our new publican support programme 
gives our new publicans the best 
possible chance of success to run 
a sustainable business. From the 
first contact with Enterprise we 
ensure they have all the support and 
information they need and explain 
everything that will happen in the first 
few months of being an Enterprise 
publican. 
As part of the first months and 
beyond, publicans have access to 
award-winning training, business 
tools and materials, comprehensive 
commercial support, a dedicated 
Regional Manager and an 
independent mentor to help them 
shape their plans for their future 
business and run it to achieve their 
goals.
Operating a pub for the first time 
can be a challenge. The new publican 
support programme ensures that 
all of the focus is on building a 
great business and for areas where 
they need support, there should be 
experienced people available and at 
their disposal.
Training
We are passionate about the training 
support we provide to our publicans 
and have 11 different courses 
available for our publicans and their 
teams to attend free of charge. In 
the past 12 months, Enterprise and 
our retained training partners have 
trained 1,617 people and delivered 
11,319 hours of training, with 16% of 
pub businesses taking advantage of 
training opportunities. We market our 
training online through our Publican 
Channel, targeted e-shots and at the 
enterpriselive roadshows. 
We continue to add to the variety of 
courses and their availability, with 
particular focus currently on helping 
our publicans maintain quality and 
drive performance. 
There are currently 180 apprentices  
in the leased and tenanted estate 
which is a rapid expansion and we 
are pleased that we are really starting 
to see some traction compared with 
prior years. 
r etail standards
As part of our drive for continual 
improvement our Regional Managers 
work with our publicans and 
employees to help them ensure 
they offer the highest level of retail 
standards to their customers and 
provide a safe and welcoming 
environment. We also work closely 
with Cask Marque who provide 
customer visits and specialist advice 
to our publicans on all things cask 
related.
RESPONSIBLE RETAILING
Alcohol
Enterprise recognises that it has a 
responsibility towards the promotion 
and management of responsible 
drinking, and that we have to work 
with our publicans, consumers, 
other retailers and the wider 
legislative environment to ensure 
that irresponsible behaviour does 
not adversely affect our pubs or 
the communities they sit within. To 
fulfil its responsibilities, the Group 
participates in various schemes such 
as sponsoring the Drinkaware Trust, 
promoting proof of age schemes, 
and other initiatives associated with 
addressing the consequences of 
alcohol misuse and minimising alcohol 
related harm.
Within our managed pubs, we ensure 
that all members of staff are fully 
trained on responsible retailing, such 
that they are confident in challenging 
for both proof of age and alcohol or 
drug misuse. We also make sure that 
our pricing and promotional strategies 
do not encourage irresponsible 
behaviours towards alcohol.
supply chain management
In 2015 we revisited the need for an 
ethical purchasing policy and formed 
a dedicated procurement team who 
over the last 12 months have worked 
with our key suppliers to ensure they 
share similar values to our own, to 
ensure sustainability is considered 
as part of the procurement process 
and that suppliers have the highest 
standards of ethical business 
decisions and practices. In our 
managed businesses we seek to 
promote relationships with local 
suppliers and where practical our 
managed pubs stock at least one local 
real ale helping to support breweries 
in the communities where we trade.
health and safety
Enterprise takes the health and 
safety management of its employees, 
publicans, supply chain partners and 
customers very seriously. To ensure 
the health and safety function is best 
placed to meet the evolving needs 
of the business, we operate two 
groups which deal with strategic 
safety and operational issues. These 
are designed to ensure that every 
area and function of the organisation 
can contribute to the development 
of relevant safety systems and 
procedures. We continue to 
participate in the Government’s 
Primary Authority Scheme (PAS) and 
regularly interact with regulators. 
The Company has a relationship with 
Westminster City Council for health 
and safety, West Midlands Fire and 
Rescue Service for fire safety and 
Milton Keynes Borough Council for 
food safety and related enforcement. 
The PAS arrangement ensures a 
company trading across council 
boundaries is guaranteed access to 
robust and reliable advice in relation 
to regulatory responsibilities.

ENVIRONMENT
We recognise our responsibilities 
to operate effective environmental 
practice and to continue to strive 
for improvement in areas of 
environmental impact. Our approach 
is to work through education, 
communication and direct action. 
Working with our specialist energy 
consultants we have completed 
energy saving upgrades in our 
managed and our leased and tenanted 
estate to reduce consumption and 
monitor and identify savings made in 
kWhs and energy spend. Upgrading 
included installation of ECO flo 
chillers to reduce the energy usage 
by the cellar beer chillers. These 
are fitted with smart controls which 
can be pre-set to reflect the trading 
hours of the site along with variable 
speed drive which reduces the fan 
speed of the chillers dependent on 
the trading demand. Upgrades also 
included LED lighting reducing the 
majority of lamps from between 40 
and 55 watts per unit to between 
4 and 5 watts, installing weather 
compensation controls to boilers to 
optimise the heating systems and 
room thermostats installed to control 
private accommodation heating 
separately to the pub.
Our managed businesses
Where we now have operational 
control of our estate of managed 
pubs, this enables us to influence 
how best to manage waste disposal, 
recycling and energy efficiency. As 
our managed business grows we 
will grow our capabilities to deliver 
sustainable operating procedures 
which are mindful of the environment 
and the local community.
Water management
We are reviewing ways of working to 
better manage water consumption 
across our head office, in our 
managed estate and by offering 
training and solutions to the leased 
and tenanted estate. With our energy 
consultants we are monitoring water 
meter readings for our managed 
houses and acting on any anomalies 
or irregularities to drive efficiencies. 
Our managed houses are in the 
process of having SMART water 
meters installed which will provide us 
with more visibility on usage. As part 
of the energy reduction programme in 
the managed estate we are reviewing 
new technologies including waterless 
urinals and cistermisers. Our learnings 
from these trials will influence the 
way we are able to support publicans 
in our leased and tenanted estate to 
benefit from the same efficiencies we 
are delivering in our own managed 
estate.
distribution efficiencies
Wherever possible we combine 
all drinks deliveries into a single 
vehicle drop to reduce road miles, 
congestion, fuel and costs.
Packaging waste
Enterprise continues to fulfil its 
obligations imposed by the Packaging 
Waste Regulations based on all 
recyclables sold to publicans. In 2015, 
Enterprise changed its membership 
to the SUSTAIN Drinks Packaging 
Partnership, a pub industry initiative 
led by the BBPA, which will provide 
an improved waste packaging 
consultancy service and lowest cost 
compliance. SUSTAIN will also help 
us prepare for the more complex 
obligations required for our managed 
pubs, including food packaging waste. 
All our managed pubs have the 
facilities to recycle 100% of the glass 
used in the business.
Oil recycling
Enterprise has been working with 
suppliers to recycle cooking oil used 
in the estate. Publicans participating 
in this initiative receive a cash back 
incentive encouraging them to recycle 
oil. In the past year this has delivered 
over £70,000 cash back to publicans 
and we are seeing the amount of 
oil recycled increasing significantly, 
with over 350,000 litres deposited 
for recycling, almost double the prior 
year.
Greenhouse gas emissions:
Carbon reduction 
During the course of this year 
we have implemented initiatives 
promoting carbon reduction. We have 
made good progress in assessing the 
benefits of and installing new energy 
efficient equipment in a number of 
sites across the estate, highlighting 
where the greatest reductions could 
be achieved and prioritising those 
sites. Utilising the industry standard 
measures of Scope 1 and Scope 2 of 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard Revised Edition 2004) we 
aim to engender a carbon saving 
culture across all stakeholders in the 
organisation. 
head office
Our head office building is now 15 
years old and some of the plant 
and systems are reaching the end 
of their life cycle. After completing 
a feasibility study assessing the 
upgrading of a number of systems it 
is intended to replace items in 2017 
with the aim of achieving improved 
energy performance, reduce running 
and maintenance costs and overall 
reduction in energy consumption.

Strategic report
Waste reduction 
To reduce waste we are targeting 
a minimum 75% of all waste being 
recycled. This has already been 
achieved at the head office and to 
ensure this is attained within the 
managed estate our approved supply 
chain has been instructed that our 
policy is to return all packaging to 
source for recycling. We will monitor 
and manage this process to ensure 
adherence.
We are working with waste 
management providers across our 
managed estate with trials at over 
10 sites. Across the trial we have 
achieved 0% waste direct to landfill, 
3% residual to landfill, 63% direct to 
recycling and 34% to energy from 
waste initiatives. 
Business travel
We have conferencing telephony 
available in all meeting rooms and 
encourage web-based meetings 
and conference calls where 
feasible. On completion of our 
head office refurbishment we have 
the opportunity to further mitigate 
our Carbon Footprint by enhanced 
facilities aiming to reduce road miles.
We continue to proactively promote 
to our staff the potential alternatives 
for each journey undertaken including 
public transport, car sharing and 
cycling. 
Our Car Fleet Policy ensures all new 
cars procured are subject to CO
2
 
restrictions and car option choices 
have been extended to include at 
least one super hybrid/ECO car.
Energy Performance 
Certificates (EPC)
We continue to make good progress 
towards compliance with the 
Minimum Energy Performance 
Standards Regulations to ensure that 
where in our portfolio leases and 
tenancies are approaching expiry they 
are appropriately rated for energy 
performance prior to deadlines set for 
2018. We are proactively managing 
the future requirements of EPCs 
and where low efficiencies are 
identified we are seeking to prioritise 
those by investing in remedial 
works and following these up by 
further trial installations to capture 
the consumption savings prior to 
reviewing the roll out possibilities 
across the wider estate and 
businesses. 
In 2016 we embarked on a project 
to model and evaluate energy saving 
measures that will help to underpin 
an eco-friendly approach to operating 
our leased and tenanted business. 
In conjunction with our energy 
consultants we have undertaken a 
series of energy reduction feasibility 
studies across the estate to better 
understand the running costs 
associated with energy usage in the 
pub estate and methods to reduce 
them. The sample sites all vary in 
size, trading style and opening hours 
and allow us to generate an accurate 
picture of energy usage associated 
with lighting, heating, water and 
cellar cooling and then model these 
with various methods of reducing 
consumption. We expect feasibility 
surveys to be completed early in 2017 .

Energy savings Opportunity 
scheme (EsOs)
We confirm that we were fully 
compliant with reporting requirements 
by 5 December 2015 and have 
embraced this initiative and take 
learnings from all of the energy saving 
opportunities highlighted in our ESOS 
report. We have continued to complete 
surveys on all properties moving into 
our managed estate, working towards 
the next ESOS submission in 2019 and 
highlighting the ways to reduce energy 
consumption when pubs move from 
the leased and tenanted estate to our 
management.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
(GhG) statement
The greenhouse gas emissions 
statement (GHG) below provides a 
summary of Enterprise’s greenhouse 
gas (carbon) emissions each year from 
1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. 
It gives a summary of emissions from 
fuel combustion and the operation of 
our facilities which include our offices, 
managed houses and company cars 
(Scope 1), and from our purchased 
electricity used during the year 
(Scope 2). 
We have adopted the operational 
control approach, as defined in 
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A 
Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (Revised Edition), 2004. 
Therefore, emissions associated with 
our tenanted pubs and commercial 
property portfolio are not included in 
this statement as they are considered 
to be outside of our operational 
control. For ease of comparison the 
GHG statement is set out in two parts; 
an assessment breakdown for the 
head office only with the baseline year 
2013 and the total combined emission 
statement (head office and managed 
houses) with the baseline year of 2015 
ensuring year on year continuity as we 
grow our managed businesses.
When comparing the greenhouse gas 
statement against that reported for 
2015, a 4% reduction in emissions at 
our head office has been made. There 
has been an increase in the overall 
emissions across the entire estate due 
to the increased number of managed 
pubs under our direct operational 
control which opened and operated in 
2016. 
Our strategy is to grow the number of 
pubs in our managed business over 
the coming years and it is expected 
that with that the carbon emissions 
will continue to rise. As stated above, 
as we are better able to harness 
energy efficiencies where we have 
direct control we will do so to manage 
the growth in emissions.

The use of the operational control approach causes a variation to those assets listed in 
our financial statements. The tenanted pubs listed on our balance sheet were not under 
our operational control and are therefore not included in our emissions table. However, 
approximately 273, (2015: 233) leased vehicles and 46 hire cars, which were under our 
operational control appear in our emissions table but not in our consolidated financial 
statements

Risks and 
uncertainties
The Board formally reviews the principal risks identified through our 
risk identification and evaluation process that is described in the 
Audit Committee report and ensures that these are appropriately 
managed by the executive management team.
The Board retains ultimate 
responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework, including 
the on-going monitoring and review 
of its effectiveness, however it has 
delegated responsibility for annually 
reviewing the overall effectiveness of 
the risk management programme to 
the Audit Committee, who formally 
report back to the Board. 
The internal audit function provides 
assurance to the Audit Committee 
on the effectiveness of the internal 
control procedures through 
completion of the annual internal 
audit plan, which takes into account 
current business risks.
The following table sets out the 
principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the Group and how we mitigate them. 
Our principal risks are those that are 
deemed by the Board as high risk, 
together with some medium risks 
which the Board deems should be 
disclosed due to their nature. This is not 
intended to be an exhaustive analysis of 
all the risks the Group may face.

Strategic report
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Strategy and business model
Regulation of the tied pub model
Due to the introduction of MRO during the current year the risk 
presented to the business of regulation has increased.
The new Statutory Code of Practice introduced by the Small 
Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 came into effect 
on 21 July 2016. This includes a tenant’s right, under certain 
circumstances, to change the freely-negotiated commercial 
terms of their agreement to a new MRO compliant agreement, 
and is overseen by an independent Adjudicator. 
Although this removes some of the uncertainty in the sector, 
there remains a lack of clarity around some areas of the Code, 
leaving elements open to interpretation. The operation of 
the regime could have an impact upon our profitability, our 
operational strategy and our relationships with our publicans.
In addition, there is a risk that other changes to the regulations 
relating to the sale of alcohol could have an impact on the 
Group’s business and the ability of our publicans to operate 
their pubs. These risks include changes to licensing legislation, 
increases to alcohol duties imposed by the Government and the 
impact of social responsibility issues on the industry in general.
The Group already operated effective policies and procedures in 
order to satisfy the existing industry code of practice framework, 
and had recruited additional compliance resource to ensure 
that we could satisfy any additional requirements of the Pubs 
Code. Now that we have more certainty over the content of the 
Code, we can ensure that our resource is suitably directed to 
safeguard compliance.
In order to mitigate any potential impact to total income, the 
Group is developing the necessary operational flexibility and 
capabilities to enable it to apply alternative operating models to 
the pubs in the estate that could potentially be affected by MRO.
We also work closely with Local Authorities as necessary to ensure 
licensing requirements are dealt with whenever appropriate.
The Group is a member of a number of trade bodies and 
associations, is a contributor to the Drinkaware T rust, and works 
closely with these organisations to promote responsible drinking 
practices. Further details can be found in the corporate social 
responsibility section of our website at www.enterpriseinnsplc.com.
Litigation The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Group operates in a heavily regulated industry and may be 
involved in legal or statutory proceedings in relation to our pubs 
or publicans. The impact of such litigation may be immaterial in 
value but may result in harm to the Group’s reputation.
The Group employs an in-house solicitor and other specialists to 
ensure we comply with legislation and to manage any litigation 
with our publicans.
The Group will work with Local Authorities as necessary 
whenever any statutory issues are raised in relation to its pub 
estate. Where appropriate, the Group takes legal proceedings 
against publicans to ensure compliance with their agreements.
Health and safety
As our estate of managed houses has grown, the risk associated 
with health and safety has increased.
A health and safety incident could result in serious injury to the 
Group’s employees, publicans or customers.
The Group has developed an effective health and safety 
management system to ensure compliance with all legal 
duties placed on the organisation by health and safety law. All 
systems are subject to regular review with training provided as 
appropriate.
These measures have been expanded to ensure effective 
control of the managed house operations as well as continued 
appropriate focus on the issues facing the leased and tenanted 
estate.
The Group employs a health and safety manager and a fire 
safety manager to maintain the health and safety management 
system along with the identification and remediation of specific 
risks. It also operates a strategic and operational health and 
safety regime and operates within a Primary Authority Scheme 
with Westminster City Council, Milton Keynes Borough Council 
and also with the West Midlands Fire Service.
Implementation of strategy
This risk has decreased slightly from last year as the  
Group has established its various operating models  
and transitioned pubs in line with its plans.
There is a risk that there is not enough expertise, resource 
or time to build the necessary support infrastructure to 
successfully execute the strategy in the desired timeframe. 
In addition, there is a risk that assets are not allocated to the 
optimum segment, impacting the effectiveness of the strategy.
The Group is developing the necessary infrastructure to support 
the strategy, including the recruitment of high quality, skilled 
individuals into areas of the business for which it historically 
has less experience. The Group also uses outsourced resources 
where required. 
The Group strategy includes a diverse portfolio of operating 
approaches, including ensuring that we utilise external specialist 
operating experience, for example in the managed investments 
model, where their retail flair and capability in pubs with retail 
complexity and exceptional profit potential will allow us to 
optimise the value of such sites.

Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
General economic conditions 
Following the European referendum result, and the uncertainty  
of its impact on the economy, this risk has increased.
The Group’s business operations are sensitive to economic 
conditions and the general economic outlook remains uncertain, 
especially post Brexit which could impact publican profitability 
due to decreased consumer spending or an increase in the 
underlying cost base of our publicans. In addition, changes 
in interest rates and other economic factors could lead to 
an increase in the Group’s weighted average costs of capital 
(WACC), reduced revenues or increased costs, all of which could 
impact our profitability and could lead to an impairment in the 
value of goodwill carried on the balance sheet.
The Group regularly monitors its key income streams and 
publicans’ performance to ensure the Group is competitively 
placed in the market, including regularly reviewing financial 
forecasts to assess the impact of economic conditions on its 
budget, strategic plans and its publicans. Careful consideration 
is given to all publicans’ requests for additional operational and 
financial support as well as assessing appropriate investment 
in the development of our pubs to ensure that we remain 
competitively placed in the market.
The Group continues to foster mutually beneficial relationships 
with key suppliers to ensure the impact of any price increases is 
minimised wherever possible.
The Group regularly reviews its WACC in line with the capital 
structure, and how it compares to its competitors. It annually 
reviews the carrying value of goodwill and would write down the 
value if it deemed an impairment was necessary. Any goodwill 
that is allocated to pubs that are disposed, is written off during 
the year.
Pub operations
People The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Group is reliant on the ability to attract, train and retain 
the best employees, publicans for its leased and tenanted 
pubs as well as managers and team members for its managed 
pubs. Failure to do this could impact on the Group’s strategic 
objectives.
The Group is committed to providing appropriate employee 
training, retention and reward policies and holds the prestigious 
accolade of ‘Gold’ status for Investors in People. As outlined in 
the corporate social responsibility section on pages 26 to 33, 
we conduct an annual staff engagement survey which is used 
to identify issues and opportunities to improve the working 
environment. 
The Group’s publican recruitment and training programme and 
its variety of tenancy and lease agreements are designed to 
attract the best quality people. We offer an industry leading 
range of flexible agreements, funding options, tailored deals for 
appropriate applicants and award winning training courses.
The Group has also established a robust programme for the 
recruitment, induction and training of all of the managers and 
team members in each of its managed pub operations.
Supply chain management The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Group places reliance on key suppliers and distributors to 
ensure that there is a continuous supply of drinks and other 
products to its publicans. Interruption or failure of these key 
suppliers and distributors could result in such products not being 
delivered to publicans on time.
The Group works closely with its key suppliers and distribution 
partners to ensure good working relationships, as well as 
taking reasonable steps to try to ensure that key suppliers and 
distributors have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place to 
maintain continuity of supply.
The Group also has its own contingency plans to minimise the 
disruption of any external interruption to supply.

Strategic report
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Property management
Property valuations The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
Valuations of the Group’s property portfolio have historically 
been affected by general economic conditions and resulting 
downwards pressure on maintainable income streams. These 
circumstances could continue and therefore reduce the 
valuation of the portfolio over time. There is a risk that future 
changes in the UK property market, including the uncertainty 
following the vote to exit the EU persisting, and general 
economic conditions could impact the value of our portfolio 
and the ability to dispose of underperforming pubs and the 
realisations from such disposals. Property valuations also have 
an implication for the overall value of the Group and impact on 
financial covenants.
The Group ensures that every pub in its portfolio is valued 
annually at market value by qualified external and internal valuers 
in accordance with RICS Valuation Standards (8th Edition). 
These valuations comply with the requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards. The valuation this year has led 
to a marginal uplift in the book values of the pubs recorded in 
property, plant and equipment.
While the valuers have noted a degree of abnormal uncertainty 
in the property market following the vote to exit the EU, they 
have confirmed that there has been no material impact to-date 
and the market has remained strong post the vote.
Our segmentation tool now guides our investment decisions, 
allowing us to direct investment to the best returns. 
We invested £74 million on developing and improving our pubs 
during the year.
Capital structure
Liquidity risk
The Board believes through the proactive management  
of refinancing events that this risk has reduced relative  
to last year.
The Group has a flexible financing structure comprising bonds 
issued from the Unique securitisation (securitised bonds), 
corporate bonds issued by the Company and bank borrowings. 
The Group makes quarterly payments of interest on the Unique 
bonds, and amounts of principal on the two amortising bonds. 
The corporate bonds are non-amortising, and the next scheduled 
maturity at 30 September 2016 was £350.5 million of bonds due 
in 2018.
The bank borrowing facility of £138 million at the balance sheet 
date was £55 million drawn.
The primary liquidity risks are the requirement to meet all 
on-going finance costs, repay the principal amounts of the 
securitised borrowings as they amortise and the corporate 
bonds as they fall due, ensuring there are sufficient funding 
facilities in place to enable the business to meet all cash 
flow requirements as they fall due and meeting the financial 
covenants associated with the financing structure.
The Board regularly reviews detailed financial forecasts 
to ensure there is sufficient cash available to meet the 
requirements of the Group. These reviews include the ability to 
meet restricted payment conditions in the securitised bonds in 
order that cash can be released by the payment of dividends 
through the securitisation structure to the Company.
There are a number of options available to the Group to manage 
its financing commitments, including the disposal of pubs, 
reducing capital expenditure on the estate as well as raising new 
capital through a bank facility or issuing new corporate bonds. 
Throughout the year the Group tests all of the financial 
covenants and forecasts which are prepared during the 
budgeting process. The Board regularly reviews detailed financial 
forecasts of the Group to ensure there is sufficient headroom on 
all covenants. 
Subsequent to the year end, on 24 October 2016 the Group 
concluded the arrangement of a new bank facility of £120 million 
which extends to 2020, to replace its existing facility. In addition, 
on 4 November 2016 it completed a refinancing of £250 million 
of the outstanding £350.5 million corporate bonds due in 2018. 
The new £250 million bonds are non-amortising, and are due in 
2022.

Risks and 
uncertainties
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the 
Group over a period significantly longer than 12 months 
from the approval of the financial statements. 
The Board has concluded that the most relevant time 
period for this review should be the three year period of 
the normal business forecasting cycle; however, given that 
in the prior year the Group announced its strategic plan 
that will evolve over a five year period and the occurrence 
of specific financing events over that same period, the 
assessment has been carried out over the remaining four 
year period to 30 September 2020.
The Board has continued to review its progress against its 
strategic plans during the year, and evolved these plans 
where opportunities and the market have suggested it 
is necessary. In addition, as in prior years, the Group has 
continued to assess the principal risks and mitigating 
factors that could impact the Group. The current and future 
risks, controls and assurances available have been fully 
analysed and documented, resulting in a clear picture of 
the risk profile across the whole of the business. This has 
been reviewed and the principal risks, which are detailed 
on pages 34 to 38, agreed by the Board. 
Those risks that could affect the future viability of the 
Group over the next four years were identified and the 
resilience of the Group to the occurrence of these risks in 
severe yet plausible scenarios has been evaluated.
The directors have specifically considered the current debt 
facilities maturing within the period and have concluded 
that they have a reasonable expectation that these will 
be adequately refinanced prior to being repayable such 
that the Group will be able to continue in operation and 
meet its liabilities as they fall due over the four year period 
assessed.
Going concern
The directors have considered the Group’s financial 
resources including a review of the medium-term financial 
plan, which includes a review of the Group’s cash flow 
forecasts for the period of at least 12 months from the 
date of approval of these financial statements along with 
the principal risks and uncertainties.
Based on the outcome of the above considerations the 
directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason the directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in 
preparing the financial statements.
Description and potential impact Mitigation processes
Information technology
Systems failure The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
The Group’s daily operations are reliant on its information 
technology systems for accounting, reporting and 
communication. There is a risk of serious disruption if these 
systems fail for an extended period of time.
A thorough business continuity plan is in place to ensure the 
business could continue to function in the event of a major 
systems failure. This plan is tested in full at least annually. This 
plan and testing has been extended in order to incorporate the 
managed house businesses.
There are comprehensive controls in place to protect information 
technology systems, including anti-viral software and the back 
up and off-site storage of data.
Cyber risk The Board believes there is no change to this risk.
Increasing levels of cyber-crime represent a threat to every 
business with the potential to cause a loss of system availability, 
which could have a consequential financial loss.
The threats facing IT are regularly monitored as part of the 
on-going review by the IT Steering Committee, which regularly 
reports to the Executive Management Group.
IT disaster recovery and business continuity plans exist and 
are tested regularly to ensure the business could continue to 
function in the event of a major incident.

Directors’ 
report
The directors submit the statutory financial statements for 
the Group for the year ended 30 September 2016.
The Governance report on pages 46 to 50 and the 
corporate social responsibility report (with regard to 
information about the employment of disabled persons, 
employee involvement, share schemes and greenhouse 
gas emissions) are also incorporated into this report by 
reference.
The Company has chosen, in accordance with section 414 
C(11) of the Companies Act 2006 to include the disclosure 
of likely future developments in the strategic report (see 
pages 1 to 39).
Results and dividends
The Group’s profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to 
£71 million (2015: loss of £65 million). 
The directors are not recommending the payment of 
any dividend on its ordinary shares for the year ended 
30 September 2016 (2015: nil) but will consider future 
dividend policy in the light of results from the business 
going forward.
Share capital
As at 30 September 2016, the Company’s issued share 
capital was 544,932,627 ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each 
as set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 120.
Authority of the directors to allot shares
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on 11 February 2016 
to allot shares and to grant rights to subscribe for, or 
convert securities into, shares up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £8,432,957 .24. 
This authority will expire at the 2017 AGM and the 
directors will be seeking a new authority for the directors 
to allot shares, and to grant subscription and conversion 
rights, to ensure that the directors continue to have the 
flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares or granting such 
rights. There are no current plans to issue new shares 
except in connection with employee share schemes and 
on conversion of the convertible bonds.
Purchase of own shares by the 
Company
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 11 February 2016 to purchase up to a maximum 
of 14.99% of issued share capital (excluding treasury 
shares) as at 7 December 2015 in the market. The price 
per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at 
a minimum amount (excluding expenses) of 2.5 pence 
per ordinary share and a maximum amount (excluding 
expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over the average of the 
previous five business days’ middle market prices; and (ii) 
the higher of the price of the last independent trade and 
the highest current independent bid on the trading venue 
where the purchase is carried out. Under the ongoing 
share buyback programme, 11,044,808 shares with a 
nominal value of 2.5 pence were purchased and cancelled 
under this authority during the period under review for  
£10 million, representing 2.2% of issued share capital. This 
authority will expire at the 2017 AGM and the directors will 
be seeking a new authority for the Company to purchase 
its ordinary shares, which will only be exercised if market 
and financial conditions make it advantageous to do so. 
Further details are set out in the explanatory notes to the 
Notice convening the AGM on pages 143 and 144.
Treasury shares and the Employee 
Benefit Trust
As at 30 September 2016, the Company held 50,000,000 
shares in Treasury as set out in note 29 to the accounts 
on page 120. There has been no change to the number of 
shares held in Treasury during the period under review.
In addition, 6,851,312 shares are held by the Company’s 
Employee Benefit Trust and movements during the year 
are set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 120. These 
shares are held to satisfy awards made under the various 
incentive and employee share schemes, details of which 
are set out in note 30 to the accounts on pages 120  
to 123.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
relating to authority to allot shares and pre-emption 
rights, and any resolution of the Company in a general 
meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at 
the disposal of the directors and they may allot (with or 
without conferring a right of renunciation), grant options 
over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at 
such times and on such terms as they think proper.

Directors’ 
report
Change of control
In respect of directors’ remuneration, in the event of 
a change of control of the Company or other relevant 
corporate event, unvested share awards will usually vest. 
In the case of any LTIP award for which the performance 
period has not ended, the number of shares in respect of 
which the award vests shall be determined by applying 
the performance conditions and, unless the Remuneration 
Committee determines otherwise, time prorating by 
reference to the period from grant to early vesting as a 
proportion of 36 months. Any LTIP award for which the 
performance period has ended will vest in respect of 
all the shares subject to it, subject to satisfaction of the 
performance conditions. Deferred Share Awards shall vest 
in respect of all the shares subject to them.
Awards under the Company’s all-employee share plans 
will vest early in the event of a change of control of the 
Company in accordance with the rules of those plans.
If a demerger, delisting, special dividend or other event 
is proposed which, in the opinion of the Committee 
would affect the price of shares in the Company, the 
Remuneration Committee may permit awards under the 
LTIP and Deferred Share Awards to vest early in whole or 
in part.
In relation to significant agreements, all agreements 
in relation to bank borrowings, convertible bonds and 
corporate bonds, to which the Company is party, contain 
provisions that allow the counterparties to terminate 
funding to the Company in certain circumstances where 
there has been a change of control of the Company. These 
are detailed within the financial instruments note to the 
accounts on page 114.
Rights and obligations attaching to 
shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares 
are set out in the Articles.
Voting rights attaching to shares
On a show of hands, every member who is present in 
person or by proxy shall have one vote. On a poll, every 
member who is present in person or by proxy shall have 
one vote for every share of which they are the holder.
Where shares are held by the Trustee of the Employee 
Benefit Trust and the voting rights attached to such shares 
are not directly exercisable by the employees, it is the 
Company’s practice that such rights are not exercised by 
the Trustee. Shares purchased by employees, along with 
matching shares, held in a SIP Trust are capable of being 
voted through a direction to the Trustee by the relevant 
employee.
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to 
appoint a proxy, who need not be a member of the 
Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend 
and to speak and vote at a general meeting. A member 
may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general 
meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by 
that member. A member that is a corporation may appoint 
one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a general 
meeting as a corporate representative.
Restrictions on voting rights attaching 
to shares
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise 
determine, exercise any voting rights either personally or by 
proxy at a general meeting if any call or other sum presently 
payable by him/her to the Company in respect of any share 
or shares remains unpaid or in respect of shares where a 
person has been served with a disclosure notice and has 
failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares. The Company is not aware of any 
arrangements between shareholders that may result in a 
restriction on voting rights attaching to shares.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights 
attaching to shares
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting of the 
Company in respect of which the business being voted 
upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised in person, 
by proxy, or by corporate representatives (in relation to 
corporate members). The Articles provide a deadline for 
the submission of proxy forms (electronically or by paper) 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the 
holding of the meeting or the adjourned meeting.
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that shares may be held in 
uncertificated form and title to such shares may be 
transferred by means of a relevant system or that shares 
should cease to be so held and transferred. 
Variation of rights attaching to shares
The Articles provide that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the 
holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of 
the issued shares, or with the sanction of an extraordinary 
resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the 
holders of those shares. At every such separate general 
meeting, the quorum shall be two persons holding or 
representing by proxy at least one-third in nominal value 
of the issued shares (calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury). The rights conferred upon the holders of any 
shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in 
the rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be 
varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking 
pari passu with them.

Governance
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares 
in the Company other than:
• restrictions which may from time to time be imposed 
by laws and regulations (for example, insider trading 
laws);
• restrictions pursuant to the Company’s share dealing 
code whereby the directors and certain employees 
require approval of the Company to deal in the 
Company’s shares; and
• where a person with an interest of at least 0.25% in the 
Company’s certificated shares has been served with a 
disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company 
with information concerning interests in those shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between 
shareholders that may result in a restriction on the transfer 
of ordinary shares.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the 
Company may by ordinary resolution from time to time 
declare dividends not exceeding an amount recommended 
by the directors. The directors may pay interim dividends 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the 
opinion of the Board, justifies such payment. The Board 
may withhold payment of all or any part of any dividend or 
other monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares 
from a person with an interest of at least 0.25% if such a 
person has been served with a disclosure notice and has 
failed to provide the Company with information concerning 
interests in those shares required to be provided by the 
Companies Act.
Appointment and replacement of 
directors
Unless determined by ordinary resolution of the Company, 
the number of directors shall not be less than two but 
is not subject to a maximum number. While a director is 
not required to hold any shares in the Company by way 
of qualification, the Company has adopted shareholding 
guidelines for executive directors which require them to 
build up and retain a holding of shares. Executive directors 
are expected to build up the required shareholding by the

The Board may appoint any person to be a director and 
such director shall hold office only until the next AGM, 
when he or she shall then be eligible for reappointment 
by the shareholders. The Articles provide that, at each 
AGM, all those directors who have been in office for three 
years or more since their election or last re-election shall

for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company.
The Company was authorised by shareholders at the 
AGM held on 11 February 2016 to allot, issue and make 
market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares. This 
authority will expire at the 2017 AGM and the directors will 
be seeking a new authority for the Company to allot, issue

indemnities have been granted.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the Company and 
its directors or employees providing for compensation 
for loss of office or employment that occurs as a result 
of a takeover bid. Details regarding change of control

related agreements are included within the directors’ 
remuneration report. Further details of the directors’

Governance 
report
Letter from the Chairman of the  
Board of Directors
Dear Shareholders,
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 
governance report for the year ended 30 September 2016. 
Our approach to corporate governance is set out in this 
report which also provides the information required by the 
UK Corporate Governance Code.
As I confirmed last year, following the appointment 
of Marisa Cassoni, we consider the Board has the 
appropriate skills and experience to challenge and support 
the execution of the Company’s five year strategy which 
was presented in May 2015.
In 2016 we conducted an internal Board evaluation, which 
concluded that the Board is operating at a high level. The 
size, composition and mix of skills is appropriate, key 
issues are confronted quickly, processes are efficient 
and appropriate, and the openness, transparency and 
leadership of the executive management was particularly 
noted. 
During the year, we continued our initiative of partnering 
individual non-executive directors (including myself) with 
the key businesses and executives below Board level. This 
mentoring process ensures that non-executive directors 
stay close to the businesses as the strategy evolves. 
We also continued with our programme of holding Board 
meetings on the road which has become an integral part of 
the cycle of Board meetings and provides the opportunity 
to meet with key suppliers and advisers, in the operating 
regions and in new business areas.
So, we are 20 months into our ambitious five year strategy 
to change the profile of the estate and the Board continues 
to monitor, challenge, and encourage the successful 
execution of the five year plan. Each member of the senior 
executive team attended Board meetings to update on the 
delivery of key parts of the strategic plan. Going forward, 
the Board will continue to closely monitor the execution of 
the strategy. 
Robert Walker 
Chairman
Compliance with the UK  
Corporate Governance Code 2014
The UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 (Code) sets 
out guidance in the form of main principles and specific 
provisions on how companies should be directed and 
controlled to follow good governance practice. The rules 
of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) require listed 
companies incorporated in the UK to disclose, in relation 
to the Code, how they have applied those principles 
and whether they have complied with the provisions 
throughout the financial year.
The Company reviews its compliance with the Code 
regularly and considers that it has fully complied with 
the provisions of the Code that are applicable to it for the 
whole of the year ended 30 September 2016.
The Audit Committee report on pages 51 to 56, the 
Nomination Committee report on page 57 and the 
directors’ remuneration report on pages 58 to 72 are also 
incorporated into this report by reference. For further 
details on the Company’s compliance with the Code and 
the terms of reference for each of its Committees, see the 
Company’s website (www.enterpriseinnsplc.com).
Leadership
Role of the Board
The Board has a collective responsibility for the overall 
control and effective oversight of the Group and its 
business and to promote the long-term success of the 
Company for its shareholders. Its role includes reviewing 
and approving key policies and decisions of the Company, 
particularly in relation to Group strategy and operating 
plans, governance and compliance with laws and 
regulations, business development, major investments and 
disposals and, through its Committees, financial reporting 
and risk management.
The Board has established a schedule of matters reserved 
for Board decision. This schedule details key aspects of the 
affairs of the Company which the Board does not delegate, 
including key strategic, operational and financial issues. 
This schedule is reviewed annually and can be found on 
the Company’s website.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Governance
The Board delegates to management the day-to-day 
operation of the business, subject to appropriate risk 
parameters. Board meetings are scheduled to coincide 
with key events in the Company’s financial calendar, 
including interim and final results and the AGM. Other 
meetings during the year will review the Company’s 
strategy and budgets for the next financial year and the 
Company’s key risks as well as reviewing each of the 
main operating functions including: financial, commercial, 
operational, managed houses and commercial property.
Board Committees
Subject to those matters reserved for its decision, 
the Board has delegated to its Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees certain authorities. The 
terms of reference for each of the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees are reviewed regularly and 
published on the Company’s website. Separate reports 
for each of these Committees are included in this Annual 
Report and Accounts from page 51 .
Role of the Chairman
Robert Walker is the Chairman and is responsible for the 
leadership and effectiveness of the Board, taking into 
account the interests of stakeholders and promoting 
the highest standards of governance. A summary of the 
Chairman’s responsibilities has been agreed by the Board, is 
set out in writing and is available on the Company’s website. 
In accordance with the Code, the Chairman met with the 
non-executive directors six times during the year, without 
the executive directors being present, to discuss in detail 
matters which they believed to be relevant for the purposes 
of the strategic business review, including key operational 
and financial issues, and the performance of the CEO. In 
2016 the Chairman conducted the internal Board evaluation 
and delivered feedback arising from the evaluation process.
Role of the Senior Independent Director 
(SID)
David Maloney is the SID. He is available to shareholders, 
provides a sounding board to the Chairman and 
serves as an intermediary for the other directors if 
necessary. The SID’s role includes responsibility for the 
Chairman’s appraisal and succession. A summary of the 
responsibilities of the SID has been agreed by the Board, 
is set out in writing and is available on the Company’s 
website. In compliance with the Code, the SID met with 
the other non-executive directors during the year in a 
forum that did not include the Chairman or the executive 
directors. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)
Simon Townsend is the CEO. The CEO is responsible 
for the preparation, evaluation and implementation of 
the Company’s strategic goals and in leading the senior 
management team. The role is distinct and separate to that 
of the Chairman and clear divisions of accountability and 
responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out 
in writing and are available on the Company’s website.
Role of the Company Secretary
Loretta Togher is the Company Secretary. The role of the 
Company Secretary is to develop, implement and sustain 
good governance practices. This includes supporting 
the Chairman and non-executive directors as necessary, 
managing Board and Committee meetings, facilitating the 
induction of new directors, ensuring appropriate directors’ 
and officers’ insurance is in place and that the Group 
is compliant with statutory and regulatory governance 
requirements. The written responsibilities of the Company 
Secretary have been agreed by the Board, are set out in 
writing and are available on the Company’s website.
Independence of directors
The Board has a strong independent element and at the 
date of this report currently comprises, in addition to the 
Chairman, two executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. The Chairman and all of the non-executive 
directors throughout the year are considered to be 
independent in character and judgement; they satisfied 
the criteria in the Code on appointment and continue to 
satisfy the criteria. The non-executives have a wide range 
of skills and experience; they constructively challenge 
management; help develop the Company’s strategy and 
have satisfied themselves as to the integrity of the Group’s 
financial information, controls and risk management 
strategy. Further information about how they have 
achieved this can be found in the Audit Committee report 
on pages 51 to 56 and the directors’ remuneration 
report on pages 58 to 72.
All directors may take independent professional advice 
at the Company’s expense. There is a formal written 
procedure, available on the Company’s website, 
concerning independent professional advice and setting 
out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board.
At the date of this report David Maloney has been on 
the Board for over eight years and his reappointment is 
subject to a rigorous review. Peter Baguley, Adam Fowle 
and Marisa Cassoni have been on the board for four, three 
and two years respectively and their reappointment is also 
subject to rigorous review. The Board believes that David 
Maloney, Peter Baguley, Adam Fowle and Marisa Cassoni 
continue to display all of the qualities of independence as 
set out in the Code.

(iv) The executive directors have attended meetings of the Nomination Committee by invitation.
We recognised that, subject to re-election at the AGM in 
February 2017 , David Maloney will have served nine years 
on the Board in July 2017 . After careful consideration, 
and mindful of the balance between executive and non-
executive members, David’s knowledge and experience, 
the wider board composition and the pathway to delivery 
of our 2020 strategy it is not the Board’s intention to invite 
him to step down as a non-executive director at the point 
he will have served nine years. It is David’s intention in 
July 2017 to stand down as the SID and Chairman of the 
Audit Committee but to remain a non-executive director, 
and subject to annual re-election. Part of our long-term 
succession planning was the appointment of Marisa 
Cassoni, who has the requisite skills to chair the Audit 
Committee and has had the opportunity of being an active 
Board member and member of the Audit Committee 
before she takes up the additional role and responsibility 
of chairing the Audit Committee in July 2017 . At that time 
we also envisage Adam Fowle, who does not chair a 
committee, to be nominated as the SID.
Effectiveness
Meetings and attendance
The Board held six scheduled meetings in the year under 
review. In addition, a strategic business review was held 
‘off site’ at which high level strategic issues, including 
future business direction and its financial and operational 
implications, were reviewed and debated. The Board 
has an agreed approach for dealing with conflicts of 
interest in relation to matters which are scheduled for 
Board consideration, although no such conflicts arose 
during the year under review. If directors are unable to 
attend meetings in person then they are consulted prior 
to the meeting and their views made known to the other 
directors and/or they may attend the meeting or part 
thereof by telephone or other conference facility.
A monthly ‘board pack’ is prepared at the end of each 
financial period which includes an update on key 
performance targets, trading performance against budget 
and includes detailed financial data and analysis including a 
review of applicable financial covenants. Board papers are 
generally circulated seven days prior to meetings to ensure 
directors have sufficient time to review papers ahead of 
the meeting. Attendance at scheduled meetings is set out 
below:

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Governance
Training and development
The Company’s directors have a wide range of expertise 
as well as significant experience in strategic, financial and 
operational matters. New directors receive a personalised 
induction programme designed to develop their 
knowledge and understanding of the Group, its culture and 
operations.
All directors have access to management and to the 
advice of the Company Secretary, who regularly updates 
the Board on material governance and compliance issues.
The training and development needs of directors are 
reviewed and assessed by the Chairman as part of the 
annual Board performance evaluation process.
Business mentoring by non-executives
The Board continues with the allocation of operating 
sectors and central functions to non-executive directors, 
including the Chairman. This practice is now firmly 
embedded in the Board culture so that each year non-
executive directors are allocated an operating sector and/
or central functions such as property, commercial and 
new business. The non-executive director then organises 
regular contact, meetings and visits throughout the year 
with his/her respective assignment. Assignments are 
regularly rotated so that the benefit of the mentoring 
programme continues to be relevant.
This initiative continues to be highly successful; in effect 
integrating the Board more closely with the business, its 
field operations, new business and commercial activities 
across all geographic regions of the estate.
Board evaluation
As referred to above, during the year the Board conducted 
an internal evaluation of its effectiveness. This evaluation 
took the form of written questionnaires followed up by 
individual discussion between the Chairman and the Board 
members. The summary of the outcome was presented 
to the Board for discussion. Whilst satisfied the Board is 
effective, it was recommended and agreed that during 
the period of intense activity and change in the business, 
as it works to deliver the strategic plan by 2020, that 
the executive management group members’ regular 
attendance at the Board meetings would be expanded 
to make more detailed and more frequent presentations 
on their areas of responsibility and execution against the 
strategic plan.
The CEO is responsible for regularly reviewing other 
executive directors’ performance against objectives and 
the CEO’s performance is assessed by the Chairman in 
consultation with the non-executive directors. In addition, 
the Remuneration Committee regularly reviews executive 
director performance in connection with their personal 
performance objectives. The Chairman’s performance 
is appraised by the SID in consultation with the non-
executive directors, taking into account the views of the 
executive directors, and the non-executive directors’ 
performance is reviewed by the Chairman. As a result 
of these individual reviews, it is considered that the 
performance of each director continues to be effective and 
that each director demonstrates sufficient commitment to 
their role. Consequently, the Chairman can confirm that 
each director is suitable for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for proactively 
reviewing and refreshing the Board’s composition and 
further information about the roles and responsibilities of 
this Committee can be found on page 57 . 
Election of directors
The directors comply with the requirements of the Code 
and submit themselves for re-election every year, if 
they wish to continue serving and are considered by the 
Board to be eligible. Accordingly, the whole Board will be 
proposed for re-election at this year’s AGM.
Service agreements
The service agreements of the executive directors and 
copies of the letters of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection during business 
hours on any weekday (excluding public holidays) at the 
registered office of the Company and will be available for 
inspection for 15 minutes prior to, and during, the AGM.
External appointments
The executive directors may accept outside appointments 
provided that such appointments do not in any way 
prejudice their ability to perform their duties as executive 
directors of the Company. None of the executive directors 
currently hold any such outside appointments where fees 
are payable, but are encouraged to do so in the event that 
it would bring them further experience and benefit the 
Board.
The role of non-executive director requires a time 
commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus 
additional time as necessary to properly discharge their 
duties. There is no restriction on outside appointments 
provided that they do not prevent the director from 
discharging their responsibilities effectively.

Governance 
report
Accountability
The Board should present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s position 
and prospects, maintain sound risk management and 
internal control systems and manage an appropriate 
relationship with the Company’s auditor.
Further information about how these principles have been 
applied is detailed in the Audit Committee report on pages 
51 to 56.
Remuneration
Levels of remuneration should be sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run 
the Company successfully, whilst avoiding paying more 
than is necessary for this purpose, and there should be a 
formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on 
executive remuneration.
Further information about how these principles have been 
applied is detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 58 to 72.
Relations with shareholders
We are committed to, and place a great deal of importance 
on, having an active dialogue with our investor base. The 
Company maintains constructive engagement with its 
key stakeholders, including institutional shareholders. 
During the year, our CEO and Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO) met with a number of our leading shareholders to 
discuss issues relating to the performance of the Group, 
strategy and new developments. In addition, the Chairman 
engaged with the majority of our top ten shareholders on 
a range of governance matters. The SID and the other non-
executive directors are available to shareholders to discuss 
any matter they wish to raise.
As regards governance issues, the Chairman aims to 
meet with most of our major shareholders shortly after 
each AGM. These meetings with shareholders are timed 
early in the process so that the Board has enough time to 
consider, and respond to, any shareholder concerns well 
in advance of the next year’s Annual Report. The Chairman 
normally contacts as many major shareholders as possible, 
and not simply the very largest, to ensure the widest 
consultation possible and also to ensure that the views of 
any shareholder who has substantially increased its stake 
during the year, have been fully taken into account.
Following the announcement of results, an investor 
relations report is produced for the Board which 
summarises feedback from shareholders and ensures the 
Board has a balanced view from our major investors.
The Company ensures that any price-sensitive information 
is released to all shareholders at the same time in 
accordance with regulatory requirements. All major 
presentations are available to shareholders through the 
Company’s website.
Shareholders may choose to receive the Annual Report 
either in paper form or electronically. This Report, along 
with a wide range of shareholder information including 
the Interim Report, is also available on the Company’s 
website. Additional information for shareholders can be 
found on the inside back cover.
AGM
Shareholders receive at least 20 working days’ notice 
of the AGM. The AGM offers the opportunity for the 
Board, including the Chairmen of the Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees, to communicate the 
Company’s progress directly to shareholders. The Board 
aims to ensure that all members of the Board, including 
in particular the Chairmen of the Board Committees, are 
available to answer questions at the AGM. To encourage 
shareholders to participate in the AGM process, the 
Company offers electronic proxy voting through the CREST 
service and all resolutions are proposed and voted on at 
the meeting on an individual basis by shareholders or their 
proxies. Voting results are announced on the same day 
as the meeting through RNS and made available on the 
Company’s website.
Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM to 
be held on 9 February 2017 can be found in the Notice 
convening the AGM on pages 138 to 140.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Governance
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce the Audit Committee report for 
the year ended 30 September 2016, which outlines the 
activities of the Committee during the year. It was a year 
in which the Committee continued to devote particular 
attention to such matters as reviewing the financial 
reporting controls and risk management processes across 
the Group, ensuring the effectiveness of the internal 
control framework, overseeing the internal and external 
audit processes and also reviewing the significant issues 
relating to the financial statements for the year ended  
30 September 2016.
As part of these activities, and in conjunction with the Risk 
Committee, we have reviewed those areas of risk and 
controls that need to be considered on an ongoing basis 
across the business; those principal risks and uncertainties 
that are of sufficient significance to be disclosed in the 
Annual Report; and also those material residual risks, that 
could still pose a significant threat to the viability of the 
business as a whole, so need to be fully considered as 
part of the viability statement process. 
In line with prior years, the members of the Committee 
have spent time with the operations and property teams 
in the field and have also participated in key discussions 
on areas of financial judgement, such as the valuation 
meetings between the external auditor and professional 
valuers, so that we can better understand the risks and 
challenges facing the business.
As a result of all of the above activity, we are satisfied that 
the business has maintained robust risk management and 
internal controls and that the internal audit programme is 
appropriately formulated to confirm that those controls are 
effective. The Company’s principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out on pages 34 to 38 and have been reviewed in 
detail by the Committee to ensure that we are comfortable 
that the business has addressed them appropriately within 
its ongoing operating model and priorities.
The Committee can also confirm, on behalf of the Board, 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable.
Finally, after nine years on the Committee, I will be 
stepping down from my role as Chairman in July 2017 and 
my colleague, Marisa Cassoni, will take over as Chairman 
of the Committee at that time.

The Committee is formed of the non-executive directors, 
being Peter Baguley, Adam Fowle, Marisa Cassoni and 
David Maloney, as Chairman, so that the Board can be 
confident that the entire Committee is independent. David 
Maloney has been the Chairman of the Committee since 
2009, as the Board considers that, by virtue of his former 
executive and current non-executive director positions (full 
details of which are set out on page 45), he has current 
and relevant financial experience. 
Roles and responsibilities
While the Board has ultimate responsibility for maintaining 
a robust framework of internal controls and risk 
management; for overseeing, reviewing and ensuring 
the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and 
internal control systems; and for ensuring that the Annual 
Report and Accounts, when taken as a whole, are fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position, performance, business model and strategy, it has 
delegated the detailed assessment of these areas to the 
Committee.
The Committee is therefore responsible for advising the 
Board in respect of each of these areas. 
Accordingly, the Committee met three times during the 
year to consider all relevant information to enable it to 
assess and confirm that:
• the interests of shareholders are protected in relation to 
financial reporting and internal control by monitoring the 
integrity of the annual and interim financial statements, 
monitoring any formal announcements relating to the 
Company’s financial performance, and reviewing and 
challenging as necessary the judgements and actions of 
management in relation to the financial statements;
• the interim and year end results, preliminary 
announcement and the Annual Report and Accounts 
are fair, balanced and understandable to the Board. 
This involves reviewing the documents to ensure that 
the description of the business agrees with our own 
understanding, the risks reflect the issues that concern 
us, appropriate weight has been given to the ‘good 
and bad’ news, the discussion of performance properly 
reflects the ‘story’ of the relevant period and that there 
is a clear and well-articulated link between all areas of 
disclosure;

Committee report
• the internal audit programme is sufficiently robust to 
confirm the effectiveness of the Group’s controls. This is 
achieved by reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness 
of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
systems, including the internal audit function, reviewing 
the Group’s systems and controls for preventing and 
detecting fraud and bribery and reviewing the adequacy 
and effectiveness of the Group’s arrangements for 
its employees to raise concerns about possible 
wrongdoing in financial reporting or other matters;
• there is a sufficiently robust and effective external 
audit. Specifically, the Committee considers the 
independence of the external auditor, the appointment 
and reappointment of the external auditor and all 
reports from the external auditor in respect of the 
auditor’s review of the interim results, the audit plan 
for the year and the results of the annual audit. These 
reports included the scope of the interim review 
and annual audit, the approach to be adopted by 
the external auditor to address and conclude upon 
key estimates and other key audit areas, the basis 
on which the external auditor assesses materiality, 
the terms of engagement for the external auditor 
and an ongoing assessment of the impact of future 
accounting developments on the Group. To monitor its 
independence, the Committee annually reviews the 
remuneration, terms of engagement and objectivity of 
the external auditor, including its appropriateness to 
undertake non-audit work;
• the principal risks and uncertainties have been 
appropriately identified and assessed, including 
reviewing internal processes used to identify and 
monitor all key risks and associated controls. The 
Committee reviewed those key risks and the quality 
of the assurance on the effectiveness of the controls 
that mitigate those risks, allowing it to conclude on the 
principal risks for disclosure and what, if any, material 
residual risks remain so that they could be factored 
into the assessment of going concern and the Group’s 
ongoing viability;
• the Group’s compliance related policies and procedures 
have been adequately established and implemented to 
ensure that regulatory areas, such as the statutory Pubs 
Code implemented during the year, are fully complied 
with as required;
• all key control policies and procedures in the business 
remain appropriate, including an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s whistleblowing policy; and
• the Committee continues to operate appropriately for 
the circumstances of our business. As part of this, we 
review our terms of reference, we ensure that there is 
sufficient expertise and resource in the Committee’s 
composition for us to fulfil our responsibilities 
effectively and we perform an annual review of the 
Committee’s performance.
The Committee reports to the Board on how we have 
discharged our responsibilities. The full terms of reference 
are available on the Company’s website, or on request 
from the Company Secretary.
Significant issues considered in 
relation to the financial statements
During the year the Committee, management and the 
external auditor considered and concluded on what 
the significant issues were in relation to the financial 
statements and how these would be addressed.
Valuation of the estate
The value of property, plant and equipment is the largest 
number on the balance sheet and therefore it is critical 
to ensure the assets are appropriately valued. The Group 
has a policy of accounting for its estate at fair value based 
on an annual revaluation exercise, so the Committee 
therefore focuses attention on understanding and 
challenging the valuation, and the appropriate accounting 
approach and disclosures, by reviewing the planned 
approach, the key assumptions, the valuation reports 
and other documentation analysing the outcome of the 
process.
The annual valuation of the estate is performed by two 
independent valuation firms, covering approximately 94% 
of the Group’s estate by value, with the remainder valued 
by an internal team of RICS qualified chartered surveyors 
on a basis consistent with the external valuation. 
Peter Baguley, Marisa Cassoni and David Maloney all 
attended the meeting held between the external auditor 
and each of the external independent professional valuers 
and the internal professional valuers. The purpose of the 
meeting is for the external auditor and the Committee to 
understand and challenge (if appropriate) any assumption 
or material changes in valuation. To assist the discussion, 
detailed analysis is prepared by both management and 
Ernst & Young (EY) which explores the underlying basis of, 
and conclusions reached in respect of, the annual valuation 
of the Group’s assets (further details of which are set 
out in note 17 to the accounts on pages 96 to 103). Any 
outliers in the valuation were also analysed in further detail 
by management and EY .
As a consequence of all of the above activity, the 
Committee was satisfied that a thorough and robust 
valuation exercise had been undertaken and appropriate 
values incorporated into the balance sheet at 30 
September 2016.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Governance
Going concern and viability review
The Group has to comply with a number of financial 
covenants that relate to the financing structure of the 
Group as set out in note 23 on pages 107 to 114 of the 
accounts. Reaching a conclusion on the reliability of the 
budgets prepared by management is considered important 
to the Committee to ensure that covenants will not be 
breached and the Group will remain a going concern.
The Committee therefore reviewed, challenged and 
concluded upon the Group’s going concern review 
including giving due consideration to the appropriateness 
of key judgements, assumptions and estimates underlying 
the budgets that underpin the review, and a review of 
compliance with key financial covenants. This also included 
a comprehensive review of the key risk factors impacting 
the Group and the assessment of the internal controls 
that mitigate this risk, together with reviewing how the 
risks have been considered in the assessment of going 
concern.
The Committee also reviews the refinancing and funding 
strategy and the proposed plans for implementing that 
strategy, such as the refinancing of £250 million of the 
remaining £350 million 2018 corporate bonds, completed 
in November 2016. 
This process enabled the Committee, on behalf of the 
Board, to assess whether any material residual risks 
remained that could pose a significant threat to the 
viability of the business as a whole. The Committee also 
assessed over what period such a viability review would 
be appropriate. The impact of those risks that could affect 
the future viability of the Group between now and 30 
September 2020 was then reviewed and the resilience of 
the Group to the occurrence of these risks, in severe yet 
plausible scenarios, evaluated. As a result of this analysis, 
the disclosures detailed in the viability statement, on page 
38, were recommended to, and approved by, the Board.
Goodwill impairment review
In conjunction with the assessment of going concern and 
the Group’s future viability, the Committee reviewed and 
approved the Group’s impairment review in respect of its 
property, plant and equipment and intangible fixed assets. 
The Group allocates its goodwill across different operating 
segments, requiring impairment to be tested by operating 
segment. Included in the key assumptions underlying the 
impairment review were the discount rate and growth 
rate applied to cash flows utilised in such calculations, 
considered by operating segment to allow for variations 
in the rate if it were applicable. The Committee reviewed 
the calculation of the rate used, compared to the prior year 
and to the rate used by other companies in comparable 
operating segments (see note 15 on pages 94 and 95 of 
the accounts) and concluded that the rate adopted was 
appropriate at the current time.
Deferred tax
The provisioning for deferred tax remains a complex 
technical area requiring the Group to reflect the interaction 
between multiple elements of tax legislation and the 
specific requirements of IFRS. The application of these 
requirements to an estate comprising approximately 
4,900 individual assets, introduces further risks which are 
addressed through the use of detailed tax models against 
information held on an asset by asset basis.
The Committee ensures that adequate resource is 
dedicated to the ongoing maintenance of these tax 
models, that the output of these models is subject to 
robust and rigorous internal review and that, where 
necessary, management have validated the manner in 
which tax legislation and/or IFRS should be applied with 
our external tax adviser and, where appropriate, the 
external auditor.
The Committee was satisfied that the deferred tax 
provisions were appropriate.
Approach to appointing the external 
auditor and how objectivity and 
independence are safeguarded 
relative to non-audit services
The Company’s policy on the independence of the external 
auditor is consistent with the ethical standards published 
by the Audit Practices Board. We also comply with the 
Competition and Markets Authority Order 2014 relating to 
audit tendering and the provision of non-audit services, as 
discussed further below.
Independence safeguards and the 
reappointment of the external auditor
The reappointment of EY as the Group’s external auditor 
was reviewed in the year and approved.
While EY has been the Group’s external auditor since the 
Company started trading in 1991, the audit was put out to 
a market tender during 2012, with EY chosen to continue 
with the audit services and KPMG appointed for taxation 
services. Therefore, the Group is planning to tender the 
audit again for the year ending 30 September 2021, in 
accordance with recent EU regulations, but will initiate 
the tender process ahead of time to allow for the audit 
to be moved to another firm of auditors for that financial 
year. These plans will be kept under annual review and if 
legislation changes, or there are any concerns as to EY’s 
independence, the quality of their audit or the service 
levels, then the audit tender might be undertaken sooner.

Audit 
Committee report
In accordance with best practice and professional 
standards, after five years in the role, EY rotated their 
audit partner at the AGM on 11 February 2016 and the 
Committee is satisfied that the new engagement partner 
has the experience and industry knowledge to be the lead 
audit partner.
Independence and non-audit services
A key issue that could impair auditor independence, and 
the auditor’s objective opinion on the Group’s financial 
statements, is the engagement of the external auditor for 
the provision of non-audit services.
The Group’s policy on engaging the external auditor for 
non-audit services has always been designed to ensure 
that such engagements do not result in the creation of a 
mutuality of interest between the auditor and the Group, 
that a transparent process and reporting structure is 
established to enable the Committee to monitor policy 
compliance and that unnecessary restrictions on the 
engagement of the auditor for non-audit services are 
avoided where the provision of advice is commercially 
sensible and is more cost effective than other providers.
The existing policy applicable throughout the year to 
September 2016 specified:
• services that are specifically not permitted – this 
includes work relating to accounting records that 
will ultimately be subject to external audit, valuation 
services, remuneration advice for key management 
and the provision of strategic advisory or consultancy 
services;
• services that are permitted with prior approval of the 
CFO – this includes accounting advice and reviews of 
accounting standards and advice, due diligence matters 
as required by debt prospectuses, assurance work in 
respect of tax matters including tax compliance, routine 
tax planning and tax advisory services; and
• services that are permitted with prior approval of the 
Committee – this includes any new engagement for an 
individual service or specific project other than defined 
within the above two categories.
The CFO reports to the Committee annually outlining all 
proposals considered during the year and the decisions 
taken, any proposals which the Committee is or has been 
requested to approve and the current level of expenditure 
for non-audit fees.
The total fees paid to the external auditor during the year 
under review amounted to £469,000. Of this amount, 
£224,000 related to non-audit services, being work 
associated with our financing activities and the interim 
review. This is work that would normally only be performed 
by the external auditor as it requires confirmations to third 
parties, such as Trustees, as to the correct extraction of 
data from our accounting records. Full details are set out in 
note 7 to the accounts on page 89.
In addition, during the year, the Committee reviewed the 
existing policy for non-audit services in light of recent 
guidance from the Financial Reporting Council and revised 
the policy for the 2017 financial year, a year ahead of when 
the changes would be mandatory for the Group. The key 
impacts of the changes are:
• to be more prescriptive about the activities that the 
external auditor cannot undertake;
• to require approval in advance by the Committee for all 
work they do undertake; and
• to restrict the level of fees paid for non-audit services to 
70% of the audit fees over a rolling three year period, 
commencing 1 October 2016.
Independence and performance 
assessment by the Committee
The Committee has assessed the independence of the 
external auditor and is satisfied that their independence 
is not impaired due to the fact that the audit engagement 
partner rotation policy has been complied with; the level 
and nature of the fees paid for non-audit services was of 
a level that does not present any ongoing threat to their 
independence and a separate external firm is appointed for 
taxation compliance and advisory services.
The Committee has authority to take independent advice 
as it determines necessary in order to resolve issues on 
auditor independence. No such advice was required during 
the year and there are no contractual restrictions over 
choice of auditor.
The Committee also reviewed the external auditor’s 
performance, taking into account input from management, 
consideration of responses to questions from the 
Committee and the audit findings reported to the 
Committee. As part of the process, the Committee 
reviewed the external auditor’s performance against 
criteria consistent with that adopted in the prior year.

for the year ended 30 September 2016
Governance
In addition to the above, the Committee Chairman, on 
behalf of the Committee, met with the external auditor and 
with the Director of Internal Audit without the presence 
of management during the year and had regular contact 
with the audit engagement partner during the year. Robert 
Walker also had two private meetings with the audit 
engagement partner during the year.
Based on all of this information the Committee concluded 
that the external audit process was operating effectively, 
that EY remains sufficiently independent and that it 
continued to prove effective in its role as external auditor. 
The Committee has therefore recommended to the Board 
to propose to shareholders the reappointment of EY as 
auditor until the conclusion of the AGM in 2018. Full details 
are set out in the Notice convening the AGM on pages 138 
to 140.
Role of internal audit
Internal audit is independent of business operations, 
undertaking an ongoing programme to provide assurance 
on the adequacy of internal control and risk management 
processes across the Group’s operations. It is responsible 
for reviewing and reporting on the effectiveness of internal 
controls and risk management systems to the Committee 
and, ultimately, the Board. The Director of Internal Audit 
attends Committee meetings to present the findings of 
such reviews at regular intervals throughout the year 
and reports on internal audit’s performance against the 
agreed annual internal audit plan, such plan being agreed 
during the year by the Committee. The existing Director 
of Internal Audit resigned during the year to be replaced 
by someone with extensive internal audit experience who 
the Committee was satisfied would be able to continue to 
ensure a robust and independent internal control function. 
In addition, we are in the process of recruiting additional 
resource in internal audit to address the increased focus 
on compliance activity in the Group, in relation to the Pubs 
Code, and from additional operational risks arising from 
the managed house business. 
Effective risk management and internal 
control
The system of internal controls is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Operating policies and controls are in place, and have been 
in place throughout the year under review, and cover a 
wide range of issues including financial reporting, capital 
expenditure, information technology, business continuity, 
cyber security and management of employees. Detailed 
policies ensure the accuracy and reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements 
including the consolidation process. The key elements 
of the Group’s ongoing processes for the provision of 
effective internal control and risk management systems 
which have been in place throughout the year include:
• established organisational structure with clearly defined 
lines of responsibility and levels of authority;
• documented operational and control policies and 
procedures;
• regular Board meetings to consider matters reserved 
for directors’ consideration;
• an annual Board corporate strategy review to assess 
the appropriateness of the current business strategy 
and any potential changes to the future Group strategy, 
including a formal review of material business risks 
and uncertainties facing the business facilitated by 
third party risk consultants to ensure that the Board 
can consider the latest best practice risk management 
advice and approaches;
• regular review by the Board of financial budgets, 
forecasts and covenants with performance reported to 
the Board monthly;
• regular management reporting, providing a balanced 
assessment of key risks and controls;
• an asset optimisation review process to consider 
all viable options for each asset, utilising both local 
operational knowledge and a custom built segmentation 
model to identify all the relevant trends in the locality of 
the asset;
• a detailed investment process for major projects, 
including capital investment coupled with a post-
investment appraisal analysis;
• a formal management risk committee, which meets 
quarterly, responsible for the ongoing process of 
identifying, evaluating and managing the principal risks 
faced by the Company through maintenance of the 
risk register and evaluation of controls and assurances, 
reporting its findings back to the Committee;
• an internal audit function which implements the annual 
internal audit plan and provides independent assurance 
to executive management, the Committee and the 
Board on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk 
management. This includes evolving the internal audit 
plan to ensure that it focuses, where relevant, on the 
highest risk areas identified in the key risk register and 
assurance framework; 
• the continued development and expansion of the wider 
compliance related teams, such as tie compliance, retail 
audit and the Pubs Code compliance teams, to ensure 
appropriate focus on the key areas of risk to the Group;

Audit 
Committee report
• an anti-bribery and corruption code of conduct as the 
Group is committed to conducting its business with the 
highest degree of integrity, including a zero tolerance 
approach towards all forms of bribery, corruption, fraud 
and theft. Procedures within the Company have been 
designed to minimise these risks and comply with 
our published policy, which is available on the Group’s 
website; and
• a whistleblowing policy, which is reviewed annually, 
that encourages employees to report any malpractice 
or illegal acts or omissions or matters of similar concern 
(whether in the UK or elsewhere) by other employees 
or former employees, contractors, publicans, suppliers 
or advisers using internal mechanisms for reporting. 
In reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal 
control, the Committee has:
• received six-monthly self-assurance statements 
completed by key senior managers confirming that 
controls and risk management processes in their 
business units have operated satisfactorily. These 
returns are reviewed in detail by the Director of 
Internal Audit and challenged where appropriate by the 
management risk committee, which updates the risk 
register;
• received and reviewed the risk register, including 
detailed analysis of the key financial and accounting 
controls that provide assurance to mitigate the key 
risks, and proposed principal risks and uncertainties 
disclosures, which were then approved for use in the 
Annual Report and Accounts; and
• met with the Director of Internal Audit without 
management being present to discuss their remit and 
any issues arising from internal audits carried out, 
reviewed all the internal audit reports and monitored 
management’s responsiveness to the findings and 
recommendations of those reports.
In respect of Group financial reporting, the finance 
department is responsible for preparing the Group financial 
statements using a well-established consolidation process 
and ensuring that accounting policies are in accordance 
with IFRS. All financial information published by the Group 
is subject to approval by the Committee. There have been 
no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial 
reporting during the year under review that has materially 
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the 
Company’s control over financial reporting.
Following advice from the Committee, the Board has 
confirmed that it is satisfied that we have carried out a 
robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, 
including those that threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity. As a result it has 
concluded that an effective system of internal controls 
and risk management processes are in place which 
enable the Company to identify, evaluate and manage key 
risks and which accord with the FRC’s Guidance on Risk 
Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and 
Business Reporting 2014.
The Committee believes that the Group’s risk 
management process was sufficiently robust from the 
start of the financial year and up to the date of approval 
of the accounts. Further details of risk management 
frameworks and the principal risks and uncertainties facing 
the business can be found on pages 34 to 38.
There have been no material instances of whistleblowing 
or any recorded instances of bribery or corruption during 
the period under review.
Accountability
The Board is required to present a fair, balanced and 
understandable assessment of the Company’s financial 
position and prospects. The responsibilities of the directors 
and external auditor are set out on pages 73 and 136. As 
set out in the directors’ report, the directors consider the 
Company’s business is a going concern.

Governance
Dear Shareholders,
The Nomination Committee is responsible for monitoring 
the performance, appropriateness and future succession 
of the Company’s executive Board talent. 
As mentioned last year, we are now in the position of 
having both the stability and the right mix of skills at 
executive and Board level. The Committee’s main focus 
in 2016 was therefore, to review the recruitment and 
performance of executive talent across the business. 
Ensuring the Company has the right talent in place to 
execute our five year strategy will remain a priority for the 
Committee in the coming year.
Finally, David Maloney will complete his nine year 
membership of the Board in July 2017 . In reviewing David’s 
performance and the need for continuity at this stage 
of the Company’s evolution, we are recommending that 
David extends his tenure by one year, until July 2018. 
Since he will no longer be considered independent, his 
position as Senior Independent Director will be taken by 
Adam Fowle and Marisa Cassoni will take over as Chair 
of the Audit Committee. Both handovers will take place 
in July 2017 , when the Board will commence a search for 
David’s replacement.
Robert Walker 
Chairman, Nomination Committee 
Composition
In compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the Committee was composed of all of the non-executive 
directors, being Robert Walker, David Maloney, Peter 
Baguley, Adam Fowle and Marisa Cassoni. The executive 
directors attended meetings of the Committee when 
requested.
Roles and responsibilities
The key roles and responsibilities of the Committee are:
• identify and nominate for Board approval, candidates 
to fill Board vacancies having regard to, amongst other 
things, the benefits of diversity including gender, as and 
when they arise;
• act proactively, recognising it is important to plan Board 
succession well in advance and for all scenarios;
• ensure that the Company’s Board 
and executive leadership skills are fully 
aligned to the Company’s long-term strategy;
• succession planning for directors and other senior 
executives taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the Company; and
• ensure any appointees have sufficient time to  
undertake their role.
In planning any appointments, the Committee prepares a 
full description of the role, skills and capabilities required; 
appoints external search firms, each time reviewing 
available options, and ensuring that the firm selected has 
signed up to the relevant industry codes (for example, on 
diversity) and has no connection with the Company; and 
finally, engages from time-to-time with the Group’s major 
shareholders on future skills requirements and ideas for 
potential candidates.
What the Committee did in 2016
The main focus of the Committee’s work in 2016 included:
• completing a review of the roles of the non-executive 
Board members for change in 2017 , as outlined above;
• reviewing the senior management structure and talent 
below Board level and senior appointments to the 
business; and
• reviewing the Committee’s terms of reference, and the 
annual review of the Committee’s performance.
Diversity
The Board and the Committee continue to be mindful 
of the issue of diversity, including gender diversity, 
throughout the business where 43% of the growing 
workforce are female including six of 17 of the most 
senior managers. While we are not committing to any 
specific targets for the number of women on the Board, 
we continue to consider and make appointments based on 
merit with the overriding objective of appointing the best 
candidate for the role. We use executive search firms who 
have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct setting 
out the seven key principles of best practice to abide by 
throughout the recruitment process and we continue to 
follow a policy of appointing talented people at every level 
to deliver high performance.

Directors’ 
remuneration 
report
Information not subject to audit:
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
I am pleased to introduce our remuneration report for the 
2016 financial year which sets out amounts earned by the 
executive directors in respect of the financial year ended  
30 September 2016 under the remuneration policy that  
was agreed by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.
Business performance and  
incentive impact
In February 2016 shareholders approved the structure of 
new share plans relating to executive directors’ annual 
bonus and long-term incentive arrangements together 
with a new policy on directors’ remuneration as set out 
in last year’s directors’ remuneration report. The new 
arrangements and policy were designed to support 
our 2020 strategy and the new policy was approved by 
shareholders with a vote in favour of 92.81%. The Chief 
Executive Officer and his management team have worked 
closely with the Board to progress the execution of the 
strategy and to deliver a new business with significantly 
improved earnings potential and growth in shareholder 
value and for the benefit of all stakeholders. 
In March and May 2016 the Company updated the markets 
on the progress of the execution of its strategic plan, and 
the framework in place to allocate excess cash flow in the 
business, including the announcement of a share buyback 
programme of £25 million using excess cash flow. At the 
date of this report the Company has purchased 14 million 
shares at an average price of 91p.
We continue to unlock the embedded value in every asset 
within our property portfolio, moving assets between 
operating models to secure the optimum level of income 
and feeding the pipeline requirements of our new business 
units from our Publican Partnership estate. 
Introducing more flexibility into the Publican Partnership 
estate has attracted ambitious entrepreneurs to this low 
cost route of entry into the pub sector to run their own 
businesses. Improving publican profitability in this estate 
has helped further to reduce unplanned business failures, 
down 14% compared with the prior year. This re-invigorated 
leased and tenanted business saw like-for-like net income 
up 2.1% (2015: 0.8% growth) and it was particularly 
pleasing to see growth achieved across all geographic 
regions of our estate. 
The pubs operating under the Bermondsey banner 
increased to 28 in the year under review as we focused on 
securing high quality sites or sites capable of growing our 
income through our asset optimisation process. Our Craft 
Union business has accelerated rapidly and at the end of the 
financial year had 71 pubs, and both managed businesses 
have a strong pipeline in place to deliver the immediate and 
longer-term growth plans to 2020. During the year, adding 
to the first partnership with Rupert Clevely, the business 
entered into a further four strategic partnerships with 
expert managed house operators and opened eight pubs 
within our managed investment business during the year. 
In addition, we continue to grow the commercial property 
portfolio, where we incur minimal overheads and require 
lower capital expenditure, and at the end of the year under 
review had 273 high quality properties in that portfolio with 
average rents in the commercial property portfolio growing 
by 3.8% during the year. 
Overall performance has generated annual bonus pay-
outs for the executive directors in respect of the 2016 
financial year in the range of 70% to 71% of the maximum 
opportunity of 150% of salary, compared with between 
61% to 63% of the maximum opportunity of 100% of salary 
in the prior year. Further details are provided on pages 63 
to 65 on how performance under the annual bonus targets 
translated into bonus payments. The LTIP awards granted in 
respect of plan year 2012, which was based solely on TSR 
performance in the three year period prior to December 
2015, did not meet the challenging minimum vesting target 
and lapsed in full.
Executive remuneration for 2017
We remain firmly committed to a responsible approach 
in respect of executive pay and that our remuneration 
structure should reward sustainable business performance 
and therefore deliver long-term value to shareholders. 
Salary reviews for the executive directors have not yet 
been conducted for the financial year ending 30 September 
2017 . Any reviews will be effective on 1 January 2017 and 
I anticipate increases, if any, would be modest, as they 
were last year, and will be based on merit and in line with 
the Group’s average pay increase and prevailing market 
conditions. Other benefits, including pension provision, will 
be maintained at existing levels or by reference to existing 
percentages of base salary as applicable. The structure 
and quantum of the bonus and LTIP arrangements will be 
unchanged from the arrangements introduced in 2016.
The Committee recognises the expectations of our 
shareholders on executive pay and we were pleased that 
the 2015 annual report on remuneration received a 99.93% 
vote in favour at the last AGM and the new policy a 92.81% 
vote in favour, along with strong support for the amendment 
to the 2015 LTIP . The 2016 annual report on remuneration 
will be subject to an advisory vote at the AGM to be held 
on 9 February 2017 and we will continue to actively engage 
with shareholders to maintain our high levels of support.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts

Governance
Role of the Committee
The Committee is responsible for considering and making 
recommendations to the Board on the:
• general policy on executive and senior management 
remuneration;
• overall remuneration packages for executive 
directors including base salary, pensions, benefits 
and performance-related short-term and long-term 
incentives;
• Chairman’s remuneration; and
• design and operation of the Company’s share incentive 
plans.
The Committee reports to the Board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities and operates within agreed 
terms of reference, a copy of which is available on the 
Company’s website or on request from the Company 
Secretary. Details of the members of the Committee 
and of the advisers to the Committee are provided in the 
annual report on remuneration on page 61 .
Policy on executive director 
remuneration
The Committee regularly reviews the executive directors’ 
remuneration packages to ensure that they take account 
of the Company’s specific circumstances and are aligned 
to the Company’s key strategic objectives as set out in 
the strategic report on pages 1 to 39. In formulating the 
remuneration policy, the Committee:
• considers market practice (both in terms of the size and 
structure of executive remuneration);
• takes into consideration pay practices elsewhere within 
the Group;
• encourages open dialogue and consults with major 
shareholders when looking to make material changes to 
the remuneration policy;
• ensures that incentive structures for executive directors 
do not raise any environmental, social or governance 
risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible 
behaviour; and
• ensures with regard to the overall remuneration 
structure, there is no restriction on the Committee 
which prevents it from taking into account 
environmental, social or governance matters or indeed 
any other operational/financial risks that relate to the 
Company’s business.
The Committee continues to believe that the policy and 
approach (described more fully in the policy table in the 
2015 Annual Report) allows the Company to operate the 
remuneration arrangements in a way which promotes 
the long-term success of the Company and remains both 
relevant and appropriate in terms of the balance between:
• fixed and variable pay, ensuring a significant proportion 
of the overall remuneration package is performance-
related; 
• short-term and long-term incentive pay; and
• cash-based and share-based remuneration.
The Committee also believes that the performance-
related elements provide rewards which reflect an 
appropriate balance between the performance of the 
Group and individual performance, and aligns the rewards 
of executive directors with the long-term interests of the 
shareholders and the Company’s strategic goals.
Directors’ remuneration policy
The remuneration policy published in last year’s Annual 
Report and approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM 
on 11 February 2016 will continue to apply. Accordingly, 
we have not included the directors’ remuneration policy 
in this report, however, a copy is available in the directors’ 
remuneration report of our Annual Report 2015 at 
www.enterpriseinnsplc.com. 
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This annual report on remuneration sets out how the 
Company’s remuneration policy for directors was 
implemented during the year under review. This report 
has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large 
and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and 
Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and 9.8.8R of 
the Listing Rules. An advisory resolution to approve this 
report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM. 
The information on pages 62 to 69 as indicated has been 
audited.

The charts illustrate the potential rewards available under the remuneration policy for the 2016 financial year as 
summarised in the table above and the actual amounts earned by each executive director. 
The values assume a constant share price and do not take into account share price fluctuation or dividends/dividend 
equivalents that could be received on the share awards. Therefore, the amounts that ultimately vest to directors under 
the deferred shares and LTIP arrangement could be higher or lower than set out above. The potential monetary rewards 
available for performance in line with expectations under the annual bonus and LTIP are provided for illustration only and 
do not reflect formal policy decisions that these amounts are received. 
Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on the weighted average salary for the 
2016 financial year (£472,000 for Simon Townsend and £385,000 for Neil Smith). The value of taxable benefits is based 
on the cost of supplying those benefits (as disclosed in the table on page 62) for the year ended 30 September 2016 
and includes Simon Townsend’s participation in the SIP (the executive directors can participate in this all-employee share 
scheme on the same basis as other employees).
The actual remuneration received represents the remuneration paid to the executive directors as set out in the single 
figure for remuneration table on page 62.

Governance
Composition of the Committee
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Committee comprised the following non-executive directors: 
• Peter Baguley, Chairman
• David Maloney
• Adam Fowle 
• Robert Walker
• Marisa Cassoni
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided. The Company’s CEO 
attends meetings by invitation of the Committee except where his own remuneration is being discussed. The Committee 
receives assistance from the Company Secretary as appropriate and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Committee. 
Advisers
During the year under review, the Committee received external advice on directors’ remuneration matters from Deloitte 
LLP , appointed by the Committee in 2014, as its independent adviser. Deloitte also provided services in relation to estate 
segmentation modelling and advice on internal audit and risk management matters.
Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under its code of 
conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. During the year, the Chairman of the Committee reviewed the 
performance of Deloitte, in terms of the quality and independence of advice, the potential for conflicts of interest (which 
are actively managed within Deloitte) and its knowledge and understanding of market practice. Having reviewed these 
factors, the Committee is satisfied that Deloitte are objective and independent and chose to continue to retain them as 
its adviser in 2016. The Committee recognises that it needs to exercise independent judgement and is not over reliant on 
its remuneration consultants.
The total fees paid to Deloitte were £39,050. The fees charged for major projects are normally negotiated in advance of 
the work being undertaken. However, an element of the fees relates to sundry ongoing advice, in line with Deloitte’s 
role to provide ongoing support to the Committee over the entire remuneration year and are predominantly charged on a 
‘time spent’ basis. 
Fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors
The fee policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors for the year under review from 1 January 2016 was as 
follows:
• Chairman – £208,000
• Base Board fee – £57 ,742
• Additional fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee – £6,242
• Additional fees for the Senior Independent Directorship – £2,080

(i) Taxable benefits include car allowances or use of a motor car, fuel, private medical, travel, accident and legal expenses insurances.
(ii) This comprises either direct contributions to personal pension arrangements or cash in lieu of directors’ pension contributions (these sums are not 
included in any bonus or share incentive award calculations). Of the amounts shown, the element for 2016 relating to salary supplements in lieu of 
contributions are £118,000 (2015: £116,000) for Simon Townsend and £96,000 (2015: £94,000) for Neil Smith. The pension contributions for Simon 
Townsend have been restated for the prior year and increased by £1,000.
(iii) The 2016 bonuses were payable based on EPS performance, individual personal and strategic targets and delivery of progress of the strategic plan. 
Bonus pay-outs ranged from 105.5% to 106.5% of salary (2015: 61% to 63%). At least half of any award over target performance is deferred into 
shares. Simon Townsend deferred a greater sum equivalent to 19% of his bonus (20% of salary) into deferred shares (2015: 9% of bonus) and Neil 
Smith also deferred a greater sum equivalent to 19% of his bonus (20% of salary) into deferred shares (2015: 10% of bonus). Deferred shares ordinarily 
vest after 3 years and are not subject to any further performance conditions. Details of the bonuses earned are set out on page 65. 
(iv) No amounts vested in respect of a performance period ending during the financial year. The performance period for the 2011 performance and matching 
awards ended on 3 January 2015. The award was subject to a TSR performance condition and the Company’s TSR performance was in the upper 
quintile of the comparator group of the FTSE 250 at the date of the grant. The awards were achieved in full, and vest in 3 equal tranches in 2015, 
2016 and 2017 . Simon Townsend and Neil Smith have both exercised the first and second tranches and the third tranche is not subject to any further 
performance conditions. Accordingly, in the LTIP figure in the above table for 2015, the value of the full award has been included, calculated using the 
share price on the date of vesting of 110.2 pence.
(v) The SIP is an all-employee share plan under which in December 2015 the Company matched on a 1:1 basis shares purchased up to a value of £1,800. 
The 1:1 basis used values the matching shares at the date of grant at £1,800. Continued employment and a three year holding period apply to the 
matching element. In accordance with HMRC requirements no performance conditions are set. 
(vi) Marisa Cassoni was appointed to the Board on 1 April 2015.
Annual bonus 2016
Awards under the plan are subject to demanding performance targets. For the year under review, the bonus was 
structured as follows:
• 80% of salary subject to a sliding scale of challenging adjusted basic EPS targets; 
• 20% of salary subject to challenging individual personal and strategic targets; and
• 50% of salary was based on and linked to key milestones in the delivery of the 2020 strategy.
Any bonus earned in respect of the latter two elements can only be paid if a threshold level of adjusted EPS 
performance is delivered. 
Executive directors are required to defer 50% of any bonus earned over target into shares with the remainder paid in 
cash (executive directors can choose voluntarily to defer more of the award into shares if they so wish and have both 
done so).

EPS targets
The adjusted EPS targets for the bonus plan were set at the beginning of the year and reflected the outlook at that time 
taking into account the Company’s plans to generate cash and pay down debt. 
The targets for the proportion of the bonus based on EPS are set out in the table below. For performance between the 
EPS targets specified, a straight line sliding scale applies.

Personal and strategic targets
Each executive director was given a number of different personal and strategic objectives individually tailored to their role 
and the needs of the business in the year now under review. Different weightings were applied to each objective. The 
achievements against objectives were considered carefully by the Committee and weightings given to each individual 
component. The precise objectives are considered by the Company to be commercially sensitive and, accordingly, are 
not disclosed. The Committee agreed that on a combined assessment of performance the executive directors had 
achieved well above target. Target would deliver 50% of the maximum (10% of salary) and the final agreed bonus for this 
element for each director is set out below.

Delivery of the 2020 strategy
The additional element of the annual bonus, with an opportunity of up to 50% of salary for both executive directors, was 
based on strategic milestones aligned to the delivery of the 2020 strategy and the growth and quality in the numbers of 
sites in the categories below. The Committee considered the delivery by the executive directors across all elements of 
the strategic milestones in assessing the overall level of performance and the bonus attributable. The Committee agreed 
that on a combined assessment of performance the executive directors had achieved just above target, which delivers 
50% of the maximum (25% of salary), and the final agreed bonus for this element was set at 27 .5% for both executive 
directors.

(i) Face value is calculated as the value of the shares on the respective date of grant of each award, except as noted in (iii) below. 
(ii) This reflects the actual number of shares granted on 14 December 2015. As explained in the 2015 directors’ remuneration report, this figure was 
previously based on an estimated market value of shares. 
(iii) The share price at which the number of deferred shares granted under the bonus plan is calculated will not be confirmed until after the date of approval 
of the accounts. The number of deferred shares awarded for the 2016 financial year is therefore estimated by using the closing mid-market price of the 
shares on 30 September 2016, being 93.0 pence. The number of shares granted along with the actual grant and exercise dates will therefore be revised 
to reflect the result on the actual date of grant, when an announcement will be made to shareholders. 
Deferred shares ordinarily vest after three years and are not subject to any further performance conditions but are 
subject to future service conditions which are set out in the policy table of the directors’ remuneration report included in 
our Annual Report 2015.
£1 in aggregate is payable on the exercise of each year’s award under the bonus plan.

Directors’ 
remuneration report
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP has been operated from 2005 to 2014 under the 2005 LTIP and since 2015 under the 2015 LTIP . Under the 2005 
LTIP two types of award could be made: 
• an award of ‘performance shares’, worth up to 150% of salary each year; and
• an award of ‘matching shares’ linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in ‘investment shares’, which were 
then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that counted as ‘investment shares’ were: 
• shares subject to a Deferred Share Award under the bonus plan; and 
• shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to a maximum of 25% of salary. 
Under the 2015 LTIP there is no matching share element.
In the table below we have shown the vesting schedule for the awards granted in respect of 2016.

financial years in the performance period being year ends September 2016, 2017 and 2018.
(iii) The Committee considers that disclosing the forward looking three year ROCE budget is commercially sensitive and has therefore chosen not to 
disclose it in advance but will provide full details if the award vests.
(iv) Cumulative Free Cash Flow (FCF) is total cash flow from operations less interest and taxes but before capital expenditure and disposals for the three 
financial years in the performance period.
(v) Irrespective of performance against TSR, ROCE and FCF , the award will only vest to the extent that the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the 
Company’s underlying financial performance over the performance period supports the vesting.
There will be straight line vesting between the points and no reward below threshold performance. 
Performance is measured over three years; however, awards vest after three, four and five years in equal tranches.

(i) Plan Year 2011 LTIP awards (granted in respect of the financial year ended 30 September 2012) vested in full in January 2015. One-third of the award 
became exercisable in January 2015, one-third became exercisable in January 2016 and the final one-third will become exercisable in January 2017 , 
subject to continued employment. The 2011 LTIP award is based on a notional share price of 86.1 pence.
(ii) Plan Years 2012, 2013 and 2014 LTIP awards (granted in respect of the years ended 30 September 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively) are based on a 
policy of using a five day average share price (following the date of the announcement of the results for that year) to determine the number of shares 
comprising the LTIP award. This was 76.30 pence for those granted in December 2012, 148.12 pence for those granted in December 2013 and 108.04 
pence for those granted in February 2015. 
(iii) Plan Year 2015 LTIP award (granted in respect of the year ended 30 September 2016) is based on a policy of using a three month average share price 
leading up to the date of grant, which was 99.53 pence. This number of shares is fixed for grants that may be made in respect of the next two financial 
years.
(iv) Plan Years 2011, 2012 and 2013, the performance conditions applying to these awards are solely based on relative TSR performance, which compares 
the Company’s TSR performance over the three year performance period with the TSR of the FTSE 250 as follows:
Company’s TSR ranking v the FTSE 250  
over the three year performance period 
Percentage of performance 
share award that vests
Level of matching share award (matching award 
shares: investment shares)
Below median 0% 0:1
Median 0% 0:1
Upper quintile 100% 2:1
(v) Plan Year 2014 – The performance conditions applying to these awards are based on relative TSR (as regards 70% of the award) and ROCE performance 
(as regards 30% of the award). Straight line vesting will occur if the Company’s TSR ranking is between the median and upper quintile/quartile (as 
appropriate) and for ROCE performance between threshold and maximum. As with previous LTIP awards, vesting occurs in three equal tranches on 
the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant. In addition, irrespective of the Company’s TSR or ROCE performance, awards will only vest if the 
Committee is satisfied that the TSR or ROCE result is reflective of the Company’s underlying financial performance over the relevant period.
(vi) Plan Year 2015 – The performance conditions are set out on page 66.
(vii) LTIP award granted on 12 December 2012 was based solely on TSR performance in the three year period prior to December 2015, it did not meet the 
challenging minimum vesting target and lapsed in full.
£1 in aggregate is payable on the exercise of each year’s LTIP award.

The highest and lowest closing mid-market prices of the Company’s shares during the year under review were 111 .80 
pence and 72.75 pence respectively. The closing mid-market price of the Company’s shares at 30 September 2016 was 
93.0 pence. 
Share Incentive Plan (SIP)
During the year under review, Simon Townsend purchased 1,727 shares under the SIP at 104.2 pence per share (2015: 
1,405 at a price of 106.8 pence per share). These shares were matched by the Company on a 1:1 basis (2015: 1:1) 
conditional upon continued employment. The face value of the shares awarded under the matching arrangement was 
£1,800 (2015: £1,500). Details of the total partnership and matching shares held under the SIP are included in the table 
of directors’ interests on page 69. 
Dilution limits
Whilst the Company has authority and retains discretion to issue new shares and/or treasury shares under its 
employees’ share plans, since 1 October 2004 the Company’s policy has been to satisfy all awards and options granted 
under the Company’s executive share schemes and all-employee share incentive plans using existing shares purchased 
in the market by the Trustees of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust (the Trust). At 30 September 2016 no new shares 
or treasury shares have been issued to satisfy awards or options granted in the previous ten years under any of the 
Company’s employee share incentive plans and, as at 30 September 2016, the total number of shares held in the Trust 
was 6,851,312 equivalent to 1 .4% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, excluding treasury shares.
Directors’ share interests 
Since 2011 share ownership guidelines have existed for the executive directors which require them to build up and 
retain a holding of shares equal in value to their base salaries. In 2016 the requirements were increased to two times’ 
salary for the CEO and one and a half times’ salary for the CFO. Executive directors are expected to build up the 
required shareholding by the later of: (i) the fifth anniversary of the introduction of the guidelines in 2011 (or, as regards 
the additional element following the revision of the guidelines in 2016, the fifth anniversary of that revision); and (ii) 
the fifth anniversary of them joining the Board; and they are required to retain 50% of the net of tax vested awards 
under the LTIP and/or Deferred Share Awards until the guidelines are met. The directors either already hold the required 
shareholdings under the original guidelines or are not yet at the anniversary dates for them to do so.

(i) Beneficial share interests include partnership and matching shares held under the SIP of 42,080 shares for Simon Townsend at 30 September 2016 
(2015: 38,626 shares).
(ii) Full details of LTIP awards, including performance conditions and exercise periods, are set out in the table on page 67 .
(iii) Full details of Deferred Share Awards, including exercise periods, are set out in the table on page 65. The calculation of the deferred shares awarded 
for 2016 is estimated by using the closing mid-market price of the shares on 30 September 2016, being 93.0 pence. The number of shares granted, 
along with the exercise dates will therefore be revisited to reflect the result on the actual date of grant, when an announcement will be made to 
shareholders. The 2015 disclosure above has been similarly adjusted.
In respect of directors serving at 30 September 2016, save for contributions to the SAYE scheme, there have been no 
other changes in share interests from 30 September 2016 to the date of this report.
The directors are not permitted to hold their shares in hedging arrangements or as collateral for loans without the 
express permission of the Board. None of the directors currently holds their shares in such an arrangement.

The table above shows the movement in the remuneration for the CEO between the current and previous financial 
year compared with movement of the average remuneration (per head) for all Group employees. The total number of 
employees has increased in the year as we have increased the number of employees within our expanding managed 
pubs businesses. This change in employee mix has led to the apparent reduction in reward for the average employee. 
The profile of the employee base is expected to continue to change in accordance with the 2020 strategy.

External appointments 
The executive directors may accept outside appointments provided that such appointments do not in any way prejudice 
their ability to perform their duties as executive directors of the Company. The extent to which any executive director is 
allowed to retain any fees payable in respect of such outside appointments, or whether such fees are remitted to the 
Company, will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Neither of the executive directors held any such appointments in 
the year under review (2015: none).

Base salaries and fees
At the date of this report the Committee has not reviewed the salaries for the executive directors which take effect on 
1 January 2017 . It is anticipated that any increase will be modest, would not exceed the increases awarded to the wider 
workforce and would be based on merit. 
Also at the date of this report the fees for the Chairman and non-executive directors effective from 1 January 2017 have 
not been reviewed. The fee policy is as set out in our remuneration policy. 
The two all-employee share plans, SAYE and SIP , will be considered on an annual basis and may be offered subject to the 
limits permitted under the relevant legislation.

Directors’ 
remuneration report
Annual bonus 2017
The maximum bonus opportunity for the 2017 financial year will be 150% of salary for both executive directors: an award 
of up to 80% of salary may be earned subject to the achievement of a sliding scale of adjusted basic EPS targets; up 
to 20% of salary may be earned subject to personal and strategic targets; and up to a further 50% of salary may be 
earned subject to the achievement of specific strategic milestones connected to the delivery of the 2020 strategy. The 
Committee considers that the targets for the 2017 bonus, are commercially sensitive at this time and has therefore 
chosen not to disclose them in advance. Details of the targets will be set out retrospectively in next year’s annual report 
on remuneration in line with the disclosures provided this year for the 2016 bonus. The personal measures are focused 
on three to four lead indicators of performance and the strategic targets based on the 2020 strategy and will continue 
to include measurable targets based on: number of new experts under our managed model; number of managed sites; 
number of commercial properties; and average rents. All targets are considered to be demanding in the context of the 
Company’s circumstances. 
LTIP awards 2017
The structure of the award will be unchanged from the awards made in 2016 and will vest subject to the achievement of 
stretching performance targets based on relative TSR, ROCE and FCF as set out in the table below. The LTIP opportunity 
for 2017 will be over the same number of shares granted under the 2016 LTIP award, for Simon Townsend 829,285 
shares and for Neil Smith 676,822 shares. For clarity, the vesting schedule has therefore been shown as a proportion of 
the overall award rather than as a percentage of salary (which is how it has been disclosed for the 2016 award).
Vesting will be determined as a 
proportion of shares awarded

Relative TSR, ROCE and FCF remain relevant performance metrics for the Company bringing a combined focus 
on internal and external performance which will be improved by the successful delivery of the 2020 strategy. The 
Committee considers that disclosing the forward looking three year ROCE budget is commercially sensitive and has 
therefore chosen not to disclose it in advance but will provide full details if the award vests.
There will be straight line vesting between the points, no reward below threshold performance and the Remuneration 
Committee will require that awards will only be earned if underlying financial performance supports it. 
Performance is measured over three years; however, awards vest after three, four and five years in equal tranches. 
Approval 
This directors’ remuneration report has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. 
On behalf of the Board

Governance
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities
in relation to the Group and  
Company financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the directors’ remuneration report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and Company financial 
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the EU. Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Company for 
that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the EU have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the 
Company’s and the Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration 
report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’ report (including the corporate governance report), 
directors’ remuneration report in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable regulations, including the 
Listing Rules and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are disclosed on pages 44 and 45, confirms that, to the best of their 
knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a 
true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and result of the Group; and 
• the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report in accordance with applicable law and regulations.  Having 
taken advice from the Audit Committee, the Board considers the report and accounts, taken as a whole, to be fair, 
balanced and understandable and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Notes to the accounts
at 30 September 2016
1.  General information
The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2016 were authorised 
for issue by the Board on 14 November 2016. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and 
registered in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
2.  Presentation of financial statements
Statement of compliance
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU).
Basis of preparation
The financial information for the year ending 30 September 2016 has been prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out in note 3 and is presented in pounds sterling. Amounts are shown in millions, unless 
stated otherwise.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc and its 
subsidiaries. Consolidated financial statements are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made 
to the financial statements of the subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with 
those used by the Group.
Subsidiaries are those controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has the rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power 
over the entity taking into account any potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which 
control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of 
the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s 
equity in those subsidiaries. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the 
equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests.
Result of the Parent Company
The directors have taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to 
publish the Parent Company individual income statement, statement of comprehensive income and related notes.
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, including a description of its financial position, cash flows, debt and borrowing 
facilities, are set out in the strategic report on pages 1 to 39, along with a summary of factors likely to affect the 
Group’s future development and performance.
Further details on the Group’s financial instruments and risks can be found in note 23 of the accounts on  
pages 107 to 114.
The directors have considered the Group’s financial resources including a review of the medium-term financial plan, 
which includes a review of the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the period of at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of these financial statements along with the principal risks and uncertainties as described on  
pages 34 to 38.
Based on the outcome of the above considerations the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period under review. For this reason the directors 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
income statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or 
nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.
Exceptional items are explained further in notes 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.

New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
As at 30 September 2016 there are a number of standards, amendments and interpretations in issue (some of 
which have not yet been adopted by the EU) with an effective date for financial years beginning on or after the 
dates disclosed below and which have not been early adopted by the Parent Company or Group. 
• IAS 1: Presentation of Financial Statements 1 January 2016
Disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 1
• IAS 27: Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2016
Equity method in separate financial statements – amendments to IAS 27
• IAS 7: Statement of Cash Flows 1 January 2017
Disclosure initiative – amendments to IAS 7
• IAS 12: Income Taxes 1 January 2017
Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses – amendments to IAS 12
• IFRS 2: Share-based Payments 1 January 2018
Classification and measurement of share-based payment transactions – amendments to IFRS 2
• IFRS 9: Financial Instruments 1 January 2018
• IFRS 15: Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16: Leases 1 January 2019
IFRS 15 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The standard should be 
applied in full for the year of adoption, including retrospective application to all contracts that were not yet complete 
at the beginning of that period. IFRS 16 should be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2019. It can be adopted earlier, as long as IFRS 15 has also been adopted. The standard can be applied 
with full retrospective effect or the cumulative impact of initially applying IFRS 16 can be adjusted into opening 
equity at the date of initial application. Implementation of both of these standards may have an impact on the 
financial statements of the Group and Parent Company and an assessment of the impact of them is being carried 
out. The Group and Parent Company are presently unable to quantify the potential impact until this assessment has 
been concluded.
The other new standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
3. Accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in 
a business combination. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Goodwill is stated at cost less 
any impairment. On disposal of a property, an attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of 
profit or loss on sale. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units that are 
consistent with the Group’s operating segments. As pubs move between segments the associated goodwill will 
also be transferred.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been 
subsequently reversed. Any such goodwill is not included in determining the profit or loss on disposal. 
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in the Parent Company balance sheet are initially recognised at fair value and then held at 
this value subject to an annual impairment test.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings, comprising of pub assets and non-pub assets, are held at their fair value, and landlord’s 
fixtures and fittings and other assets are held at cost. 
‘Pub’ refers to land and buildings held for operation as a licensed public house, excluding movable landlords’ fixtures 
and fittings. ‘Non-pub’ refers to land and buildings previously held as a pub but are now leased for another use e.g. 
as a convenience store.
The Group’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued each year by 
external valuers or employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such valuations.
Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken through other comprehensive income to the revaluation 
reserve except where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset previously recognised as 
an expense in the income statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken through other 
comprehensive income to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same 
asset. Any further decrease in value is recognised in the income statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their 
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at 
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlord’s fixtures and fittings are split into two categories; long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings and short-life 
landlord’s fixtures and fittings. Both are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of 
additions in the form of long-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years and additions to 
short-life landlord’s fixtures and fittings have been calculated at 5 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight line 
basis to write off the total cost less residual value over the useful economic life. 
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease 
term and their useful economic life of 50 years. 
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight line 
basis to residual value.
Property, plant and equipment is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment. Where any indicators are identified, 
assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset is less 
than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to dispose and value 
in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the same 
asset, and thereafter as an expense in the income statement. 
Non-current assets held for sale
Properties identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets held for sale 
are held at the lower of carrying value on transfer to non-current assets held for sale, as assessed at the time of 
transfer, and fair value less costs to dispose. The fair value less costs to dispose is based on the net estimated 
realisable disposal proceeds which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to sell the 
properties. Licensed land and buildings and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they 
have been identified for disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition 
and the sale should be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the 
property or lease is actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Licensed land and buildings 
held for sale are not depreciated and operating lease intangible assets held for sale are not amortised. 
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net 
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset within non-current assets held for sale at the date of disposal. 
Inventories
Inventories which comprise products held for resale in managed houses are stated at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the 
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

for the year ended 30 September 2016
Accounts
Leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Properties acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value 
of future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease 
payable. Properties held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease 
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant 
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are taken as an expense to the income 
statement. 
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight line basis to the income statement 
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to properties acquired as part of business combinations that are held 
as operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as intangible assets: operating lease premiums within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term. 
The Group has previously entered into sale and leaseback transactions where licensed land and buildings have been 
sold and the Group has immediately entered into a lease agreement with the acquiree. These land and buildings 
have been classified as operating leases. They are no longer included within property, plant and equipment and the 
rentals paid are charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over the lease term.
Repairs and maintenance
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Assignment premiums
Where an amount is paid to a publican in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point 
other than at renewal, the payment made is expensed through administrative costs. During the period of our 
strategic change, this will be treated as exceptional.
Where an amount is paid to a publican in order to regain control of the property at the point of lease renewal in 
order that the Group can operate the site as a directly managed outlet, the amount is linked to a capital investment 
project in order to reposition the property for the managed offering, and the premium paid is capitalised and 
depreciated in line with the project spend.
Financial instruments
a) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months 
or less are classified as cash equivalents. 
b) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are measured at amortised 
cost.  This method is used to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the 
amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings 
across the life of the instrument based on the estimated cash flows and the contractual terms of the agreement. 
When borrowings are refinanced the Group reviews whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment 
of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability or a modification of the terms of 
the existing financial liability. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as an extinguishment of the original 
financial liability, any costs or fees incurred are recognised as part of the gain or loss on the extinguishment and 
written off through exceptional finance costs. If the refinanced borrowings are accounted for as a modification, any 
costs or fees incurred adjust the carrying amount of the liability and are amortised over the remaining life of the 
modified loan.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
c) Convertible financial instruments
The gross proceeds received from the issue of a convertible bond are split between a liability element and an equity 
component at the date of issue. The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market 
interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bond 
and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing any embedded option to convert the liability 
into equity of the Group, is included in equity and is not remeasured. The liability component is carried at amortised 
cost using the effective interest method until extinguished upon conversion or the instrument’s maturity date. Issue 
costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bond based on their relative 
carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against 
equity.
The difference between the interest expense calculated under the effective interest rate method and interest paid 
to bondholders is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bond.
d) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Parent Company, are recorded at the fair value of the 
proceeds received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in called up share 
capital and the balance of the net proceeds is recorded in share premium. 
The Group has returned surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks. Consideration paid or payable for 
shares purchased for cancellation is deducted from equity. The Company uses contingent share purchase contracts 
and the obligation to purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract. Any subsequent 
reduction in the obligation caused by the expiry or termination of a contract is credited back to equity at that time.
e) Trade receivables and trade payables
Trade receivables and trade payables are held at amortised cost.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures licensed land and buildings, within property, plant and equipment and non-current assets held 
for sale, at fair value and provides disclosure information in respect of the financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption 
that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset 
or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The 
principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group.
The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate 
economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that 
would use the asset in its highest and best use provided that use was physically possible, legally permissible and 
financially feasible to access. The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and 
for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and 
minimising the use of unobservable inputs.
IFRS 13 requires that all assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial 
statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that 
is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Other techniques whereby the inputs are either directly or indirectly derived from market data.
Level 3 – Inputs used in the valuation are not based on observable market data.
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines 
whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the 
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Accounts
Net debt
Net debt is the total book value of all financial assets and liabilities (not including trade receivables, trade payables 
and the equity component of the convertible bond) less cash. Underlying net debt is the nominal value of all 
financial assets and liabilities (not including trade receivables, trade payables and the equity component of the 
convertible bond) less cash.
Taxation
The tax expense comprises both the tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred tax. Deferred 
tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between the carrying 
value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that 
it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. No deferred tax is 
recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in 
a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised 
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to be 
settled net or simultaneously. 
Tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to 
other comprehensive income. Similarly tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity. Otherwise tax is charged in the income statement. Tax is calculated using tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, 
it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably 
estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the 
provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the 
obligation. 
Pension obligations
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. 
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the income 
statement as incurred. 
As described in note 28, the Group entered into a bulk annuity policy that is a qualifying insurance policy in respect 
of the defined benefit section of the pension scheme. 
Having entered into this policy, the scheme liabilities continue to be valued on the projected unit credit method 
and then the value of the annuity policy is stated as equal to the amount ascribed to the plan liabilities covered by 
the policy. Actuarial movements in the value of the scheme liabilities and the interest costs on scheme liabilities 
are matched by equivalent movements in the scheme asset. To the extent that the Group is committed to deferred 
premiums or future administration costs in respect of the annuity policy or the scheme these are recorded as an 
additional liability within the pension deficit at the net present value of future premiums. The interest paid on the bulk 
annuity policy is charged as a finance cost. The plan obligations will be derecognised on final settlement of the plan.
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until 
the shares are cancelled, re-issued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No 
gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.

3. Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is the fair value of consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal 
course of business, net of discounts, volume rebates and VAT . Revenue from drink and food is recognised at the 
point at which the goods are provided. Property rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of 
the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period to which the income relates. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based 
payments are measured at fair value at the date of the award. This value is subsequently updated at each balance 
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of 
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service 
and performance (vesting conditions), other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the 
Parent Company (market conditions). Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to 
become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, 
non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value is recognised 
as an expense over the vesting period by calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the 
cumulative expense in the income statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional 
upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or 
non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied. 
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit
Operating profit as referred to in the income statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading 
activities before net profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment, movements in valuation of the estate and 
related assets, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the 
income statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or 
nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following:
a) Exceptional items recognised in operating profit
Exceptional costs relating to regulatory matters and reorganisational costs have been recognised in the 
administrative costs line.
In addition, during the period of our strategic change, assignment premiums where an amount is paid to a publican 
in order to take the assignment of a lease or to break a lease at any point other than at renewal would be treated as 
exceptional.
b) Net profit/(loss) on sale of property, plant and equipment
Net profit/(loss) arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment less goodwill allocated to disposals.
c) Movements in valuation of the estate and related assets
Any revaluation that causes the book value of a property to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in the 
income statement. If that same property later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the 
increase in value is credited to the income statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised. Where 
properties identified for disposal are revalued immediately prior to transfer to non-current assets held for sale, the 
revaluation movement is recognised on the same basis. The remaining impact of the annual revaluation exercise or 
the identification of properties for disposal is accounted for in other comprehensive income.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts

d) Net finance costs
The gain or loss on purchase of own debt is calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the debt 
purchased less the aggregate of the consideration and related transaction costs paid. The Group has elected to take 
the gain or loss on the settlement date.
Exceptional finance costs are recognised in relation to fees written off following the commitment to extinguish or 
restructure borrowings or where incurred as part of debt restructuring projects.
e) Taxation
A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the estate. On transition to IFRS, 
the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999. This led to an increase in 
goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief 
and changes in the rate of UK tax, a debit or a credit is recognised in the income statement. This has been classified 
as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the 
income statement in the same period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for 
in the same performance statement as the gross item to which it relates.
The effect of changes in the substantively enacted rate of tax used to calculate deferred tax is reflected in other 
comprehensive income to the extent it relates to revaluation surpluses therein and in exceptional profit/loss for all 
other elements of deferred tax.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the income 
statement. 
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have 
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, plant and equipment (PPE)
Licensed land and buildings are revalued annually to fair value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation 
Manual published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and IFRS 13. The valuation is based on 
an assessment of the income generating potential of the properties, and applying an appropriate multiple. The 
highest and best use for the licensed land and buildings is assumed to be their current use by the Group, principally 
due to the legal restrictions imposed by the agreement with the publican, planning regulations and the financial 
implications of a change of use given those restrictions and the Group’s business model. However, consideration 
is given to an alternative highest and best use if there are factors that indicate that such an alternative use exists 
which is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.
Further information about the valuation of the estate is provided in note 17 of these financial statements.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of PPE and these estimates influence the 
depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting policy for PPE. 
b) Testing goodwill for impairment
The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. Management makes judgements to allocate 
goodwill to individual operating segments and in calculating the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of the 
operating segments that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value in use calculations which 
require estimating future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. 
Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are shown in note 15.

Notes to the accounts

3. Accounting policies (continued)
c) Taxation 
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot 
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not 
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a 
liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting 
treatment.
d) Finance costs
When borrowings are refinanced with substantially the same lender, the Group uses judgement when reviewing 
whether the arrangement constitutes an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a 
new financial liability or a modification of the terms of the existing financial liability. As described in note 12, the 
Group conducted a strategic review of its capital structure during the year to better enable its future direction. This 
culminated in a consent solicitation exercise for the Unique securitisation and modified a number of terms within 
the documentation. Of the total cost incurred, £7 million has been assessed as being the cost of the strategic 
review, and has been charged to exceptional finance costs, whilst the remaining £7 million is the cost of modifying 
the terms of the securitisation and has therefore been capitalised, and amortised over the remaining life of the 
bonds.
e) Materiality of operating segments
The Group uses judgement when concluding that the commercial property segment and managed segments are 
not material, either individually or in aggregate, to be required to be disclosed as an other operating segment.
f) Related party transactions
The Group uses judgement when concluding that transactions with related parties of minority interests are not 
material for disclosure.
4. Segmental analysis
Following the announcement of the outcome of the Group’s strategic review during the prior year the Group 
now has five (2015: five) distinguishable operating segments being leased and tenanted, commercial property, 
Bermondsey Pub Company, The Craft Union Pub Company and managed investments which reflect the different 
nature of income earned, types of property and profile of customers. The Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) 
is represented by the Board of Directors of the Parent Company and the five segments have been identified as the 
CODM regularly reviews discrete financial information relating to them with regard to gross margin. Group assets 
are not segmented.
Operating segments are aggregated when they have similar economic characteristics and therefore Bermondsey 
Pub Company, The Craft Union Pub Company and the managed investments have been combined as they represent 
income earned from the direct operation of pubs albeit through differing trading styles.
This results in three reportable segments being:
1) Leased and tenanted Rental income and revenue from drinks supplies and gaming machines
2) Commercial property Rental income
3) Managed Revenue from the sale of food, drink and accommodation and gaming machine income
The Group has concluded that its commercial property segment and managed segment do not meet, either 
individually or collectively, the quantitative thresholds to constitute reportable segments as defined by IFRS 8.  
Rather than being shown as ‘all other segments’ they have been combined within the leased and tenanted 
segment as the Group is currently in the early stages of estate segmentation and therefore the results are not 
currently material. The following notes 5 and 6 disclose this combined information down to operating profit which 
forms the basis of the information reviewed by the CODM.

after taking account of disposal costs resulted in an overall profit of £5 million (2015: £5 million).
Of the £10 million (2015: £8 million) of profits on sale of property, plant and equipment in the year, £7 million (2015: 
£2 million) related to 17 properties (2015: 11 properties) and various plots of land with a ‘special interest’ value to 
particular buyers and £3 million (2015: £4 million) arose on the remaining 107 properties (2015: 174 properties) sold 
at an average profit of £32,000 (2015: £23,000) per property. In the prior year a further £2 million of profit arose on 
the sale of 5 properties classified as operating leases.
The remaining 102 properties (2015: 70 properties) sold during the year made a loss.
In accordance with IAS 36 purchased goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of. Accordingly, goodwill of £9 
million (2015: £8 million) has been allocated to the 226 properties (2015: 260 properties) disposed of during the year.

During the year the Group completed a full strategic and legal review of its capital structure to ensure that it did 
not constrain its ability to execute its operational strategy. A significant output of this review was the consent 
solicitation approved by the noteholders of the Unique securitisation voting in favour of proposals to amend certain 
aspects of the documentation to permit the increased operation of managed houses within the securitisation.
Of the total fees incurred in this strategic review, £7 million has been recognised as an exceptional item in the 
income statement and £7 million has been deferred over the remaining life of the Unique securitised bonds.

12. Net finance costs (continued)
The exceptional finance cost of £26 million recognised in the prior year related to the partial refinancing of the 2018 
corporate bonds and the replacement of the bank facility. The total cash outflow arising from this refinancing was 
£28 million, being £22 million in respect of the repurchase premium on the extinguished bond, which was charged 
as an exceptional item, and total fees and disbursements of £6 million, of which £4 million was charged as an 
exceptional item and £2 million arising on the new bond was deferred over the life of the new debt instruments.
The total interest charge under the effective interest rate method (which excludes the exceptional finance costs 
relating to the bank and bond refinancing) is £154 million (2015: £158 million).
A tax credit of £1 million (2015: £5 million) has been recognised on the exceptional finance costs.

*  On transition to IFRS under IAS 12, a deferred tax liability was recognised on the balance sheet relating to the revaluation of the estate and gains 
previously rolled over, or due to be rolled over into other assets. The deferred tax liability that would have been in place at the time of business 
combinations that have occurred since 1 January 1999 resulted in the recognition of additional goodwill of £330 million as the fair value of the net 
assets acquired had been reduced. As this pre-acquisition liability changes due to capital gains indexation relief and disposals, the movement has 
been recognised in the income statement. The exceptional indexation credit for the year ended 30 September 2016 is £1 million (2015: charge of 
£7 million). This has been classed as an exceptional tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in 
the income statement in the same period. In addition there is a £9 million exceptional tax credit relating to the effect of changes in the UK tax rate 
from 20% to 17% which has been enacted during the year.

14. Earnings per share
The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for the year 
divided by the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by 
trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is based 
on earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax divided by 
the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating 
to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
The dilution adjustments for share options and the convertible bonds are reviewed independently and where they 
are dilutive to the calculation of basic diluted earnings per share they are included in the calculation of both basic 
diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share.

period of 7 .3 million shares (2015: nil).
For the year ended 30 September 2016, the adjustment for the convertible bonds is assessed as being dilutive 
(2015: anti-dilutive) which has resulted in an adjustment to profit in the calculation of diluted earnings per share of 
£5.2 million (2015: £nil) for the post tax interest cost associated with the convertible bonds and an adjustment to 
the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during the period of 50.8 million shares (2015: nil).

Allocation to disposals
In accordance with IAS 36 goodwill is allocated to operations disposed of and accordingly, goodwill of £9 million 
(2015: £8 million) has been allocated to the 226 pubs (2015: 260 pubs) disposed of during the year.
Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. At 30 September 2016 the goodwill 
has been allocated to the operating segments described in note 4. Within these segments the goodwill is tested 
for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount of each segment to the carrying amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the leased and tenanted operating segment was £296 million (2015: 
£315 million) with the balance allocated to the commercial property of £18 million (2015: £13 million) and managed 
segments of £7 million (2015: £2 million). The following disclosures have therefore been made in relation to the 
goodwill allocated to the leased and tenanted operating segment because the remaining balance is not material to 
the total value of goodwill.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Accounts
Value in use is calculated using budgeted EBITDA and forecasts of cash flows over a three year period, as prepared 
for the Board, adjusted to reflect the current segmentation of the estate. The three year cash flows continue 
to be risk adjusted to reflect a conservative outlook, adjusted to reflect the forecast level of disposals. The key 
assumptions in these estimates are trading margin, rent projections and levels of working capital required to 
support trading. Key assumptions have been assigned values by management using estimates based on past 
experience and expectations of future changes in the market. These assumptions have been reviewed by the Board 
and are believed to be reasonable. Cash flows beyond three years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate in 
operating income (2015: 2%) which was selected as prudently below the Group’s estimate of the long-term average 
growth rate. The key driver to maintaining the growth rate is management’s focus on selecting and supporting the 
best publicans, whilst meeting the challenges of changing consumer demand. The forecast cash flows are then 
discounted to give a value in use.
The discount rate used is based on the Group weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which has been risk 
adjusted to reflect current market factors which have not already been captured within the cash flows. In making 
this adjustment to the Group WACC, management have risk adjusted the cost of debt and the cost of equity by 
using an average of the highest four market risk premiums and Company betas obtained from five advisers at 
the year end date. The cost of equity has been further inflated by using a theoretical share price derived from 
peer group data. The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used in the testing at 30 September 2016 was 8.0% 
(2015: 8.0%). 
As at 30 September 2016, the total headroom on the impairment test is £845 million (2015: £718 million), the 
pre-tax adjusted discount rate could increase to 9.3% (2015: 9.2%) before any impairment would be required. 
Management have considered the volatility in the current economic climate within the risk adjusted cash flows and 
the growth rate of any cash flows beyond the budget period would need to fall to 0.6% (2015: 0.5%) before any 
impairment would be required. There is no impairment to goodwill in the current or prior period.

17. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Fair value measurement of property, plant and equipment
In determining the appropriate classes of asset to present for fair value purposes, the Group has considered the 
nature, characteristics and risks of the assets. This has resulted in determining two separate classes of assets, 
‘pub’ and ‘non-pub’ as described in note 3.
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment 
Valuations are carried out on an annual basis at each year end date. With the exception of properties identified for 
disposal and transferred to non-current assets held for sale, the Group’s pub and non-pub assets were revalued 
as at 30 September 2016 by GVA Grimley Limited or Colliers International Property Advisers UK LLP , independent 
Chartered Surveyors, or by the internal Asset and Valuation Director, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor. For 
further analysis of the pubs valued by valuer see table on page 102.
All valuations of assets have been assessed as being level 3 valuations, as there are no directly comparable market 
observable inputs. 
Leased and tenanted pub assets were valued using fair maintainable trade income (FMT) capitalised at an 
appropriate rate of return (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards ‘Red Book’) or an equivalent 
multiple. This method of valuation involves making an assessment of the fair maintainable rent, wholesale and 
machine income that can be generated from the property assuming they are run by a reasonably efficient operator, 
taking into account future trading potential. This assessment of profit is then capitalised at an appropriate multiple 
to reflect the risks and rewards of the property. In determining the multiple to use, the valuers consider evidence of 
comparable market transactions. The resulting fair value of the pub represents the land and buildings and any fixed 
landlords fixtures and fittings. The valuation of the managed pub assets is prepared using a consistent approach that 
effectively capitalises the net income attributable to the Group from operating the pub, at an appropriate multiple. 
Commercial properties include free-of-tie pubs let to the operators at open market rents and non-pub assets, 
which are predominantly blue-chip let convenience stores. These assets have been valued adopting the investment 
method of valuation. By reference to the lease terms of each agreement and market conditions, an appropriate 
multiple based on comparable market transactions is applied, discounting future rental receipts back to present value.
All classes of asset are, under IFRS 13, required to be valued at highest and best use. IFRS 13 prescribes that the 
Group’s current use is presumed to be its highest and best value, unless market or other factors suggest that a 
different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset. In doing their valuations, the valuers 
consider whether the asset may have a higher or better feasible use which would be reflected in the fair value 
where applicable. This is on an asset by asset basis if there are circumstances to indicate that there may be a 
higher and better use. In the current year the highest and best use of all the property assets in property, plant and 
equipment has been assessed as their existing use.

Accounts
The table below presents, by class of property, the income and multiple bandings within which the properties 
have been valued, and the number of properties that have been valued in each of the bandings. In determining 
the bandings to use, the Group has considered a variety of options including size and location of property, but 
has concluded that the value of the property is principally driven by FMT and multiple, so this forms the most 
appropriate disclosure.

Sensitivity analysis table
The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement categorised within level 3 of the fair value 
hierarchy of the Group’s estate are FMT and a multiple. There is a limited amount of interrelation between the 
variation in these inputs.
A change in either of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the overall valuation of the estate. 
Sensitivities around these assumptions that are deemed to be reasonably likely based on the experience of the 
valuers are illustrated below:

At 30 September 1,790 1,835
During the year the Company carried out a reorganisation of intercompany balances which included the 
capitalisation of a balance of £250 million due from a subsidiary undertaking. Following the reorganisation, which 
included the receipt from this subsidiary of a £271 million dividend, this subsidiary had no assets and therefore the 
Company recognised an impairment of the same value. 
In addition, at the year end, the Company has carried out an impairment review of its investment in the Unique 
sub-group which involved calculating a value in use using forecast cash flows discounted at 8% based on the 
Group’s pre-tax risk adjusted WACC and a long-term growth rate appropriate to the Unique sub-group of 2.5%. The 
recoverable amount of the Unique sub-group has been assessed as £1,716 million, resulting in an impairment of 
£45 million, which has been recorded in the period. As an assessment of theoretical sensitivities to this impairment 
review calculation, an increase of 0.25% in the discount rate used would result in a further impairment of £121 
million or a decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used would remove the impairment and result in £89 million of 
total headroom. Similarly an increase of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would remove the impairment 
and result in £104 million of total headroom or a decrease of 0.25% in the long-term growth rate used would result 
in a further impairment of £136 million.
During the prior year the Company subscribed at par for a further 1 million non-voting cell shares of £1 each in 
a Harlequin Insurance PCC Limited Cell, being a Guernsey based captive insurance cell created on behalf of the 
Company for the conduct of insurance or reinsurance business. 
The Parent Company’s subsidiaries are listed in note 33.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount of 
credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to minimise 
this risk by carrying out credit checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the 
balance sheet are net of a bad debt provision which has been determined by management following a review of 
individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after 
taking into account collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt 
provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
At 30 September 2016 the value of deposits held by the Group is £33 million (2015: £32 million) and by the Parent 
Company is £21 million (2015: £21 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in other payables.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade 
receivables which are primarily owed by publicans.

There are no indications as at 30 September 2016 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect 
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The 
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk on 
liquid funds is limited because the Group only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

‘Bank borrowings’ refers to the revolving credit facility.
‘Corporate bonds’ refers to secured bonds and an unsecured convertible bond (see table on page 108).  
‘Securitised bonds’ refers to secured bonds (see table on page 108).  
Fair values  
The corporate bonds and securitised bonds were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone, 
independent valuers. The fair value of the corporate bonds and securitised bonds is measured at market price and 
are therefore evaluated to be level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 3. 
Management assessed that cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current 
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial liabilities, obligations under finance 
leases, as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates 
currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
The fair value of the Group’s bank borrowings, evaluated to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 
3, is not deemed to be materially different to the nominal value if it had been determined by using the discounted 
cash flow method using a discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting 
period. The own non-performance risk as at 30 September 2016 was also assessed to be insignificant.

The bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are held at amortised cost. Finance lease payables 
represent the present value of future minimum lease payments. Other categories of financial instruments include 
trade receivables and trade payables. However, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of 
these items.
Bank borrowings  
At the year end the Group had a £138 million non-amortising revolving credit facility (RCF) in place which was 
available through to September 2018 at an interest rate of 3% over LIBOR. 
On 24 October 2016 the Group replaced this existing £138 million RCF with a new £120 million RCF , which is non-
amortising, attracts interest at 3% and expires in August 2020. 
Corporate bonds  
On 10 September 2013 Enterprise Funding Limited (the Issuer) issued a £97 million 3.5% guaranteed convertible 
bond due 2020 (the bond) at par. The Parent Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due 
and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations (including payments) in respect of the bond. The 
obligations of the Parent Company, as guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated, unconditional and unsecured 
obligations of the Parent Company.

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Subject to the terms, the bond is convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically 
transferred to the Parent Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Parent Company. The bond converts at 
a premium of 35% to the share price on 10 September 2013 of 141 .5p, which means that the bond is convertible 
based on an exchange share price of 191 .0p into 50.8 million ordinary shares. The exchange share price is adjusted 
on the happening of certain events, including the payment of a dividend. 
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policy for convertible financial instruments, the proceeds received from 
the convertible bond issue were split, with an initial £75 million recorded as a liability and £22 million recorded 
within equity, stated net of costs of £2 million and £1 million respectively. The difference between the effective 
interest charged and the actual interest paid is added to the liability element over the life of the convertible bonds.
In the prior year the Group completed a partial refinancing of the secured bond - issued 3 March 2003 due for 
repayment in 2018 (£600 million 2018 corporate bonds). The Group received and accepted tender instructions for 
£250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 108.75% of their principal amount. In connection with this 
partial refinancing the Group issued new £250 million secured corporate bonds due in October 2023 at a coupon 
of 6.0%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds due in 2018 to £350 million. The new issue benefits from a 
security package on substantially the same terms as the original £600 million 2018 bonds, but lower interest costs 
and extended debt maturity.
Subsequent to the year end, on 4 November 2016 the Group completed a further partial refinancing of the 2018 
corporate bond. The partial refinancing will result in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior 
to the refinancing £350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The 
Group received and accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% 
of their principal amount resulting in a £28 million repurchase premium. In connection with this partial refinancing 
the Group issued new £250 million secured corporate bonds, due in February 2022, at a coupon of 6.375%, 
resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds maturing in 2018 to £100.5 million. The new issue benefits from a 
security package on substantially the same terms as the 2018 bonds.
Securitised bonds
During the year the Group has made scheduled repayments on the Unique A3 and A4 securitised bonds, which 
together with £10 million of bonds purchased and cancelled, leaves £1,066 million outstanding at the year end. At 
30 September 2016 the Group was £80 million ahead of the amortisation schedule through early repayment and 
market purchases.
Commitment for share buybacks
The Group has entered into a contingent agreement with a third party which requires the Group to purchase shares. 
This has resulted in a financial liability of £5 million at 30 September 2016 (2015: £nil).
Intercompany
The amount owed to subsidiary undertakings relates to the issue of the convertible bonds in Enterprise Funding 
Limited. These proceeds have been on-loaned to Enterprise Inns plc on the same terms with an amount recorded in 
equity and an amount recorded as a liability.
Financial instruments and risk
The Group’s financial instruments comprise bank borrowings, corporate bonds, securitised bonds and cash. The 
main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no 
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of 
these risks and they are summarised as follows:

Liquidity risk
The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The 
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank 
borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
• regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function;
• regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile; and
• maintenance of undrawn bank facilities.

as the book value of debt includes unamortised fees, fair value adjustments made on acquisition and excludes 
the value ascribed to the equity element of the convertible loan note. The contractual maturity of trade and other 
payables and the share buyback commitment is within one year.

The liquidity facility is in respect of the Unique securitisation and is a renewable committed facility of £190 million 
for a term of 364 days. The liquidity facility is available to meet certain payment obligations falling due in the Unique 
securitisation to the extent that insufficient funds are received to meet such payments. The liquidity facility is 
due for renewal on 24 September 2017 . The facility relates to the bonds that amortise over a period to 2032 and 
therefore the facility has been disclosed as expiring in more than five years.
Interest rate risk
The Group borrows its corporate bonds and securitised bonds at a fixed rate. Bank borrowings and cash balances 
attract interest at a floating rate. The Group’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. This 
exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates on the majority of its debt. At 30 September 2016, the Group’s 
borrowings were 98% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.3% for 7 years (2015: 97% fixed at an average rate of 
6.3% for 8 years). The Parent Company’s borrowings were 95% fixed with an average interest rate of 6.4% for 
7 years (2015: 94% fixed at an average rate of 6.3% for 8 years).

Interest rate sensitivity
In estimating the sensitivity of the financial instruments we have assumed a reasonable potential change in interest 
rates. The method used assumes that all other variables are held constant to determine the impact on profit before 
tax. The analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice market rates rarely change in isolation.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to the movements in the underlying 
transactions, actions taken to mitigate any potential losses, the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring, 
and further developments in global financial markets. As such the below should not be considered as a projection of 
likely future gains and losses in these financial instruments.
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would increase by £1 
million (2015: £1 million) and the interest payable would increase by £1 million (2015: £1 million). If interest rates 
were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest receivable in the Group would decrease by £1 million (2015: £1 
million) and the interest payable would decrease by £1 million (2015: £1 million).
If interest rates were to increase by 50 basis points the interest payable in the Parent Company would increase by 
£1 million (2015: £1 million). If interest rates were to decrease by 50 basis points the interest payable in the Parent 
Company would decrease by £1 million (2015: £1 million). Following a group reorganisation during the year there 
are no floating rate receivables remaining in the Parent Company and therefore there is no exposure within interest 
receivable to movements in interest rates.
Security
The bank borrowings are secured by a security deed entered into by the companies which comprise the Group, 
excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries, Unique Pubs Limited and its subsidiaries 
and Enterprise Funding Limited. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such 
Group companies. The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the corporate bonds.
The total value of assets within the Group secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2016 is 
property, plant and equipment £3,605 million (2015: £3,638 million), operating lease premiums £9 million (2015: £10 
million) and non-current assets held for sale £21 million (2015: £33 million). The value of assets within the Parent 
Company secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2016 is property, plant and equipment 
£1,869 million (2015: £1,877 million), operating lease premiums £4 million (2015: £4 million) and non-current assets 
held for sale £10 million (2015: £13 million).
The security pledged for the Group’s debt is summarised below:
Debt instrument Security
Bank borrowings – 1st floating charge over the balance of properties in the Parent Company not already 
secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the corporate bonds.
– 2nd floating charge over the properties secured by a 1st fixed charge created by the 
corporate bonds.
– Share pledge over Unique Pubs Limited.
Corporate bonds (excluding the 
unsecured convertible bond)
– 1st fixed charge over the 2,018 properties in the Parent Company valued by GVA Grimley 
Limited (see note 17).
– 2nd floating charge over the balance of properties in the Parent Company.
Securitised bonds – Collectively over the whole securitisation the security incorporates a 1st fixed charge in 
favour of the Trustee over the Issuer’s right, title, interest and benefit, present and future to 
all properties, cash, eligible investments and income generated by Unique Pub Properties 
Limited.

23. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Covenants
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities. There are three covenants that 
relate to the bank borrowings, which are tested quarterly. There is one leverage covenant and two asset valuation 
covenants. There is sufficient headroom on all three of these covenants. The covenants are unchanged under the 
new revolving credit facility.
There are two covenants that relate to the corporate bonds (excluding the unsecured convertible bond); an asset 
value covenant and a net annual income covenant. At the year end there is an annual valuation of the estate and 
a review of the annual income for the properties secured under each of the corporate bonds. The valuation is 
undertaken by a firm of independent chartered surveyors. The directors certify the net annual income as part of an 
annual compliance exercise. In the event that property values or incomes have fallen, there may be a requirement 
to add more properties to the security of the corporate bonds and any addition of new properties must be 
completed within 90 days of the year end. There is sufficient headroom on both of these covenants. The covenants 
are unchanged in the new corporate bond.
There are two covenants that relate to the securitised bonds which are tested at each quarter end. These covenants 
are based solely on the assets held within the securitised bonds and comprise a net asset covenant and a debt 
service cover covenant. There is sufficient headroom in both of these covenants.
The Group tests all of the above covenants on a regular basis and forecasts are prepared during the budgeting 
process. These are reviewed at Board level.
Change of control
All of the agreements in relation to bank borrowings and corporate bonds to which the Group is party, contain 
provisions that allow the counterparties to terminate funding in certain circumstances where there has been a 
change of control of the Parent Company. These are detailed below:
Agreement Summary of change of control clause
Revolving credit facility agreement dated  
22 September 2014 (which commenced on  
7 October 2014)
If any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the 
Company then the Company shall promptly notify the agents and lenders. If 
any lender so requires, it may cancel its commitments to the Company and 
require the Company to repay all loans outstanding to it.
£125 million 6.875% secured bonds due 2025
£125 million 6.875% secured bonds due 2021
£275 million 6.375% secured bonds due 2031
£350.5 million 6.5% secured bonds due 2018
£249.5 million 6% secured bond due 2023
The terms and conditions of each of the secured bonds provide that 
following the occurrence of a restructuring event, which is defined in the 
terms and conditions to include:
(i)   any person or persons acting in concert becoming interested in more 
than 50% of the shares of the Company; or
(ii)   any person or group of connected persons acquiring control of the 
Company; or
(iii)   any person or persons acquiring the right to appoint more than 50% of 
the directors of the Company,
the secured bonds must:
(a)  if they are not rated, after a written resolution of the bondholders, either 
be redeemed by the Company or the Company must successfully seek 
an investment grade rating for the secured bonds; or
(b)  if they are rated and such rating is below investment grade or later falls 
below investment grade, be redeemed by the Company.
Unsecured convertible bond due 2020 If any person or persons, acting together, acquire(s) or becomes entitled to 
control more than 50% of the votes that may ordinarily be cast on a poll at 
a general meeting of the Parent Company, the holder of each bond will have 
the right to require the Issuer to redeem that bond on the change of control 
put date at its principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest 
up to (but excluding) such date.
The new revolving credit facility and new corporate bonds include change of control provisions consistent with the 
above.

24. Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt  
The capital structure is managed to support the Group’s objective of maximising long-term shareholder value 
through ready access to debt and capital markets, cost effective borrowing and flexibility to fund business and 
acquisition opportunities whilst maintaining appropriate leverage to optimise the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group is based upon management’s judgement of the appropriate balancing of all key 
elements of its financial strategy in order to meet the Group’s operational and strategic requirements. This includes 
a strategy on dividends, share buybacks and monitoring liquidity risk. The overall financing strategy of the Group is 
presented to the Board annually as part of the budgeting exercise.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of a net debt ratio, being net debt divided by net debt plus equity. Net debt 
is defined as the book value of the Group’s debt less cash. Equity is defined as total shareholders’ funds.

27. Deferred tax (continued)
The deferred tax provision for the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of fixed assets in the Group has moved 
during the year as follows:
£m
Opening provision at 1 October 2015 177 
Reduction in deferred tax liability due to indexation credited to the income statement (1)
Reduction in deferred tax liability due to movements from revaluation of the estate and disposals recognised in the 
income statement (4)
Increase in deferred tax liability recognised in other comprehensive income –
Adjustment for rate change (26)
Closing provision at 30 September 2016 146 
The Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings 
of subsidiaries on the basis that under current enacted law, no tax is payable on dividends payable and receivable 
within the Group. 
The amount of deferred tax provided by the Parent Company at the year end has been reduced by £10 million as a 
result of a reassessment of how indexation relief and declines in carrying value are applied to assets impacted by 
initial recognition exemption rules. Of this adjustment, £21 million has been credited through other comprehensive 
income to the revaluation reserve and £11 million charged to the Parent Company income statement in arriving at 
the profit for the year.
28. Pension
The Group and the Parent Company make defined contribution payments to employees’ own pension plans and 
these payments are charged to the income statement as incurred.
RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary company that has now been liquidated as part of a Group 
reorganisation) established a pension plan for its employees in January 1999. The plan has a defined contribution 
and defined benefit scheme. The plan is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits.
The plan is governed by the employment laws of the United Kingdom which require final salary payments to be 
adjusted for the consumer price index upon payment during retirement. The level of benefits provided depends on a 
member’s length of service and salary at retirement age. The fund has a legal form of foundation and is governed by 
the Board of Pension Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the administration of the plan assets and for 
the definition of the investment strategy.
In April 2014, the Trustees of the RetailLink Management Limited pension plan and the Company committed to a 
bulk annuity buyout of the defined benefit section of the plan, crystallising a liability of £10 million payable through 
a deferred payment schedule over a four year period. The initial stage of this process involved the Trustees using 
the plan’s defined benefit section assets to purchase a bulk annuity policy from Legal & General Assurance Society 
Limited (LGAS). The policies commenced with effect from 30 April 2014 and will be held for the time being as 
investments of the plan. Once the deferred premiums have been paid, the Trustees intend to ask LGAS to issue 
individual annuity policies to defined benefit section members and then wind-up the plan, after which the Company 
will no longer retain any responsibilities or obligations to the members of the plan. The deferred payment plan 
attracts interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%.
In view of the relative insignificance of the pension scheme, both on a gross and net basis, the Group has elected 
to only present summarised disclosures to one decimal place in respect of the scheme.

to a minimum annual long-term improvement of 1 .25% p.a. for current pensioners and for future retirees (with a -1 
year age adjustment for females). These tables give a life expectancy as set out above.
Due to the nature of the pension deficit being the deferred payment plan outstanding for the bulk annuity policy 
sensitivity analysis is not relevant and has therefore not been disclosed.
The Company will not be making any contributions to the defined benefit plan in future years following the bulk 
annuity buy out.

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote at meetings.
At 30 September 2016, the Group owned 50 million (2015: 50 million) of its own shares as treasury shares with a 
nominal value of £1 million (2015: £1 million) and a market value of £47 million (2015: £54 million). In addition, at 
30 September 2016 the Group held 6,851,312 shares with a nominal value of £0.2 million and a market value of £6 
million (2015: 6,568,286 shares, nominal value £0.2 million, market value £7 million). These shares are held by the 
Employee Benefit Trust and are shares used to satisfy awards made under the Enterprise Inns incentive plans and 
other share option schemes (note 30).
During the year the Group made on market purchases in respect of 11 million (2015: nil) of its own ordinary shares 
for an aggregate consideration of £10 million (2015: nil) (excluding costs) as part of its share buyback programme. 
These shares were cancelled. Transaction costs of £0.1 million (2015: nil) have been accounted for directly in equity 
in the profit and loss reserve.
30. Share-based payments
The Group operates share-based payment schemes for both directors and other employees. Details of the Deferred 
Share Award and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which form part of the remuneration of the executive directors are 
given in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 58 to 72. 
The Group also operates a Share Incentive Plan (SIP), an Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS), and a Save As 
You Earn Scheme (SAYE).
A total expense of £2 million (2015: £2 million) has been incurred in the year in relation to share-based payments. 
This expense relates wholly to the equity-settled schemes described above.
Share Incentive Plan
The SIP is open to all employees. At times determined by the Parent Company, employees may allocate the lower 
of £1,800 or 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary. The Board may also decide to award 
matching shares. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee. If shares are removed from trust within 
three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost. Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after a 
period of five years. Matching shares were awarded every year from 2005 to 2016.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme. 
Details of the number of matching shares held in trust during the year are as follows:

SAYE scheme
The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board. Participants contract 
to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five years (previously a seven year 
scheme has also been offered). At the end of the savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares 
at a price set before the savings began. The option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on 
the date that participants are invited to take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share, if higher. Options 
will usually be settled using ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust and will usually be exercisable for 
six months after the fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

The share price at which the number of shares granted under the Deferred Share Award scheme is calculated, is 
not confirmed until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of Deferred Share Award 
shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2016. The 
number of shares granted in 2015 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2015.
Where the conditions are not met the shares are released in the forfeited line.
Directors and other members of the management team eligible to participate in the Deferred Share Award pay £1 
to exercise awards granted under the Deferred Share Award and the LTIP , this is a one-off charge. All of the shares 
outstanding at 30 September 2016 are not yet exercisable.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Accounts
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the Deferred Share Award was £0.94 
(2015: £1 .04 restated for actual number of shares granted in 2015) and under the LTIP was £0.56 (2015: £0.47).
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was 
£1 .02 (2015: £1 .07).
Fair value of share schemes
The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using share 
option valuation models. The SAYE and Deferred Share Award schemes are valued using the Black-Scholes model. 
The element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes model. The 
element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte-Carlo Simulation Model. 
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year:

  The share price at which the number of shares granted under the Deferred Share Award scheme is calculated is not confirmed until after the date 
of the approval of the accounts. The maximum number of Deferred Share Award shares granted during the year is therefore estimated using the 
closing share price on 30 September 2016. The 2015 weighted averages have been amended to reflect the actual number of shares granted in 2016.
‡
  The Deferred Share Award for the executive directors vests in 4 years (2015: 4 years), the Deferred Share Award for the executive management 
vests in two equal tranches after 2 and 3 years (2015: 2 and 3 years) and the Deferred Share Award for the other members of the senior team vests 
after 4 years (2015: 3 years).
* The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.
Expected share-price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of 
the option. For the LTIP the expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria 
has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP . These 
conditions have been incorporated into the Monte-Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR 
element of the scheme. 
31. Reserves
Share premium account
This reserve represents the amount of proceeds received for shares in excess of their nominal value of 2.5 pence 
per share.
Revaluation reserve
This reserve shows the surplus generated on revaluation of the estate. It represents the amount by which the fair 
value of the estate exceeds its historic cost net of related tax. During the year the Group has transferred a charge of

Parent Company transactions with subsidiary undertakings
The Parent Company enters into loans with its subsidiary undertakings which attract interest at varying levels. Net 
interest on these loans was £35 million (2015: £33 million).
During the year the Parent Company waived its right to receive a loan due from a subsidiary undertaking and 
capitalised the balance as disclosed in note 18.
The following loans were outstanding at the year end:

The Parent Company entered into other trading transactions with its subsidiary undertakings of £47 million (2015: 
£56 million) which includes an asset management fee, a procurement fee, drink revenue and rent revenue. During 
the year the Parent Company purchased property, plant and equipment at book value for consideration of £30 
million from a subsidiary, Unique Pub Properties Limited and sold property, plant and equipment at book value for 
consideration of £2 million to a subsidiary, Hippo Inns Limited. 
Dividends of £284 million (2015: £10 million) were received in the Parent Company from its subsidiary undertakings.

34. Post balance sheet events
On 24 October 2016 the Group and Parent Company replaced its existing £138 million RCF that expired in 
September 2018 with a new £120 million RCF , which is non-amortising, attracts interest at 3% and expires in 
August 2020. 
On 4 November 2016 the Group and Parent Company completed a partial refinancing of the 2018 corporate bond. 
The partial refinancing will result in a lower interest coupon and an extended debt maturity. Prior to the refinancing 
£350.5 million of 2018 secured corporate bonds were outstanding with a coupon of 6.5%. The Group received and 
accepted tender instructions for £250 million of these bonds at a cash purchase price of 111% of their principal 
amount resulting in a £27 .5 million repurchase premium which will be charged as an exceptional item in the year 
ending 30 September 2017 . In connection with this partial refinancing the Group issued new £250 million secured 
corporate bonds, due in February 2022, at a coupon of 6.375%, resulting in a reduction of the corporate bonds 
maturing in 2018 to £100.5 million. The new issue benefits from a security package on substantially the same terms 
as the 2018 bonds.
Subsequent to the year end the Parent Company has purchased 3 million shares at an average price of 92p per 
share which, when combined with the 11 million shares purchased during the year to 30 September 2016, totals 14 
million shares purchased as part of its ongoing share buyback programme, at an average price of 91p per share.

35. Alternative performance measures
Like-for-like leased and tenanted net income
Leased and tenanted like-for-like net income of £338 million (2015: £331 million) represents pre-exceptional EBITDA 
of £292 million (2015: £296 million), stated before property costs of £29 million (2015: £29 million), unallocated 
central costs of £44 million (2015: £41 million) and excluding £23 million (2015: £23 million) of net operating profit 
relating to commercial properties and managed houses and £4 million (2015: £12 million) of income in respect of 
disposals.
Like-for-like commercial properties net income
Commercial properties will increasingly become an important element of our business and we believe it is 
appropriate to assess the financial performance of these assets by measurement of their like-for-like net income. 
Commercial properties achieved like-for-like net income growth of 3.8% in the year to 30 September 2016 and 
relates to £7 .1 million (2015: £6.8 million) of net income from the 138 commercial properties that traded as 
commercial properties throughout the financial years ended 30 September 2015 and 2016. 
Total commercial properties net income in the year to 30 September 2016 was £17 million (2015: £17 million) which 
includes income derived from properties that converted to commercial properties during the financial years ended 
30 September 2015 and 2016. The commercial properties net income in the year represents pre-exceptional EBITDA 
of £292 million (2015: £296 million), stated before property costs of £29 million (2015: £29 million), unallocated 
central costs of £44 million (2015: £41 million) and excluding £344 million (2015: £337 million) of net operating profit 
relating to leased and tenanted properties and managed houses and £4 million (2015: £12 million) of income in 
respect of disposals.
Excess cash flow
In the year we have introduced a capital allocation framework to help us optimise the use of excess cash flow. We 
therefore believe that the measurement of excess cash flow is an important new metric. Excess cash flow in the 
year was £48 million (2015: £15 million) and is derived from net cash flows from operating activities of £269 million 
(2015: £265 million) plus net cash flows from investing activities of £24 million (2015: £6 million) less net interest 
paid of £154 million (2015: £157 million) less debt restructuring and extinguishment costs of £7 million (2015: £28 
million) less payments to acquire own debt of £10 million (2015: nil) less scheduled debt amortisation of £74 million 
(2015: £71 million).

Our opinion on the financial statements 
In our opinion: 
• Enterprise Inns plc’s Group financial statements and Parent Company financial statements (the “financial 
statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 30 
September 2016 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2016 which comprise:
Group Parent Company
Group balance sheet Company balance sheet 
Group income statement 
Group statement of comprehensive income 
Group statement of changes in equity Company statement of changes in equity 
Group cash flow statement Company cash flow statement 
Related notes 1 to 35 to the financial statements Related notes to the financial statements
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. 
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality • Overall Group materiality of £5.9m (2015: £6.0m) which represents 5% (2015: 5%) of pre-
exceptional profit before tax after including the net loss on sale of property, plant and 
equipment.
Audit scope • We performed an audit of the complete financial information of four (2015: four) full scope 
components, performed specific scope procedures in respect of seven components (2015: nil), 
and performed specified procedures in respect of eight components (2015: ten). 
• The components where we performed full scope audit procedures accounted for over 97% of 
pre-exceptional profit before tax (including loss on sale of property, plant and equipment), 96% 
of revenue and 99% of total assets. 
• The components subject to specific scope procedures or specified procedures covered the 
remainder of pre-exceptional profit before tax (including loss on sale of property, plant and 
equipment) (3%), revenue (4%) and total assets (1%).
Risks of material 
misstatement 
• Over valuation of the property estate (£3.6 billion (2015: £3.7 billion)); 
• Failure to impair goodwill when required; and
• Deferred tax on the revaluation of the estate.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Enterprise Inns plc
The scope of an audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud 
or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the 
Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially 
incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our 
report. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing the audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 
Materiality
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining 
the nature and extent of our audit procedures. (ISA 320)
 
 
 
 
Proﬁt before tax – £75m
 
 
Starting 
basis
Adjustments
Materiality
Exceptional items – £43m (before tax, 
and excluding net loss on sale of
property, plant and equipment)
Pre-exceptional proﬁt before tax (including
the net loss of sale of property, plant
and equipment – £118m
Materiality of £5.9m (5% of £118m)
We determined materiality for the Group to be £5.9m (2015: 
£6m), which is 5% (2015: 5%) of pre-exceptional profit before tax 
including the net loss on sale of property, plant and equipment. 
We use pre-exceptional profit before tax as reported by the Group 
to exclude the impact of exceptional items which do not reflect 
the underlying trading performance of the Group. For 2016, we 
included the impact of the net loss on sale of property, plant and 
equipment as we consider the ongoing disposal of property, plant 
and equipment to be recurring in nature and reflective of the 
ongoing asset optimisation strategy of the Group. This approach 
avoids inappropriate variations in our materiality as a result of 
non-recurring items and fluctuations in the carrying value of the 
estate which can be significant compared to underlying trading 
performance. 
Performance materiality
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an 
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds 
materiality. (ISA 320)
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement was that performance materiality should be set at 75% (2015: 75%) of materiality, namely £4.4m (2015: 
£4.5m). In the prior year, we reduced our testing threshold in areas of significant risk to reflect our assessment of risk 
of material misstatement and focus on the key judgements and estimates. In the current year, as a result of limited 
historical audit findings we have used a consistent testing threshold for each significant account balance.

Reporting threshold
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. (ISA 450)
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £0.3m 
(2015: £0.3m), which is set at 5% of materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and 
in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.
Scope of our audit for the year ended 30 September 2016
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine the 
audit scope for each component within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the financial 
statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of group-wide 
controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing 
the level of work to be performed at each component. 
The Group has common financial systems, processes and controls covering the majority of its operations. Six of the 
Group’s managed house operations are managed on stand-alone systems maintained by third party managers.
In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate coverage of 
significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 19 (2015:14) reporting components of the Group, our scoping was 
as set out below:
Number of components
Group pre-exceptional 
profit before tax (including 
loss on disposal of 
property, plant and 
equipment) Group revenue Group total assets

8 10 In the current year, these components contain no transactions or balances external 
to the Group (2015: less than 1%). We have performed specified procedures to 
ensure that such transactions and balances eliminate on consolidation.
19 14
The audits of the entities subject to full scope audits (which represent the principal business units within the Group, one 
being the Parent Company itself) are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group 
materiality appropriate to the relevant scale of the business concerned. In the current year, the range of performance 
materiality allocated to these components was £1 .8m (2015: £1 .7m) to £3.1m (2015: £3.0m).
The audit of the components within the Group is undertaken by one audit team, with the exception of four (2015: nil) 
managed house operations. Due to the nature of the significant risk areas noted below, the audit team includes tax 
specialists and is supported by specialists in property valuations and the evaluation of the weighted average cost of 
capital.
Our assessment of the risks of material misstatement
We identified the risks of material misstatement described below as those that had the greatest effect on our overall 
audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the efforts of the audit team. In addressing 
these risks, we have performed the procedures below which were designed in the context of the financial statements 
as a whole and, consequently, we do not express any opinion on these individual areas.

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Over valuation of the property estate 
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(pages 51 to 56); accounting policies 
(pages 81 to 88); and note 17 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
(pages 96 to 103).
This is the largest estimate within 
the financial statements, prepared 
on an asset by asset basis for 4,603 
individual assets. The valuation is 
performed by a combination of 
internal and external appropriately 
qualified valuers (as described in note 
17). The valuation has been performed 
by third party independent valuers for 
94% of the valuation (by value) (2015: 
92%). 
The recently enacted legislation 
surrounding MRO (see page 18) 
and the potential macro-economic 
impact of Brexit, has increased the 
estimation uncertainty over the year 
end valuation.
There remains a risk that, as a result 
of individual assets being over 
valued, there is a material error in the 
valuation of the overall estate.
Valuation of the property estate 
was included wholly within that part 
of the audit subject to full scope 
procedures.
Our approach was to understand the valuation process 
and perform detailed testing.
We identified, documented and confirmed our 
understanding of the controls operated by the Group 
surrounding the valuation process.
We considered the trading and valuation trends in 
the UK pub market, together with the specific factors 
affecting the Group as noted in column 1, to develop our 
expectations.
We checked that the data provided to the internal and 
external valuers agreed to the underlying financial 
records. 
Together with our internal property valuation specialists, 
we met with the Group’s internal and external valuers to 
challenge the method adopted, the derivation of the key 
inputs of fair maintainable trade and earnings multiple 
(as described in note 17) and the nature and extent of 
the work they performed in preparing the valuations. 
We assessed the valuers conclusions regarding the 
potential impact of MRO and Brexit on the valuation of 
the property estate.
We sought explanations for the movement in the 
value of the estate as a whole, movement in the 
value of appropriate sub divisions of the estate, and 
where necessary, movement in the value of individual 
assets, satisfying ourselves that the explanations were 
consistent with our expectations.
In addition, these enquiries sought to ensure that 
for assets moving across operating segments, such 
properties continued to be valued on the basis of 
highest and best use, and where appropriate, reflect the 
changing income streams.
In order to select a sample focused on those asset 
valuations we considered to be most at risk of 
misstatement, we analysed features including the trading 
performance of the individual asset and the nature of 
the rent agreement. Utilising bespoke analytics over 
the whole estate, sorted by valuer, we highlighted 
those classes of assets, or individual assets, where 
the movement in value was inconsistent with our 
expectations. From this analysis, we selected a sample 
of 91 asset valuations which were representative of the 
movements in value that were inconsistent with our 
expectations. For our sample, we obtained explanations 
for movements identified from the internal and external 
valuers. We agreed changes in factual circumstances to 
relevant documentation.
The valuers had 
adopted an approach 
to the valuation of 
the estate which 
was appropriate, 
consistent, and in 
accordance with 
applicable guidance. 
The result of the 
estate valuation was 
suitable for inclusion 
in the financial 
statements.

Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Failure to impair goodwill when 
required
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(pages 51 to 56); accounting policies 
(pages 81 to 88); and note 15 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
(pages 94 to 95).
As discussed in note 15 the Group 
has five operating segments 
(2015: five). There continues to be 
a requirement for the Group to 
allocate goodwill between operating 
segments and test impairment for 
each segment.
The Group has goodwill with a total 
carrying value of £321m (2015: 
£330m) of which £296m relates to 
the leased and tenanted estate (2015: 
£315m). This is considered to be a 
risk area due to the sensitivity of the 
review to the key assumptions of 
discount rate and long term growth 
rate as described in note 15. 
As a result of the uncertainty over 
the potential impact of MRO and 
Brexit, we consider this risk to have 
increased compared to the prior year. 
Goodwill was included wholly within 
that part of the audit subject to full 
scope procedures.
  
We identified, documented and confirmed our 
understanding of the controls operated by the Group 
surrounding the goodwill allocation and impairment 
process.
We challenged the basis on which goodwill had been 
allocated to operating segments on a segment by 
segment basis.
We examined the reasonableness of the cash flow 
forecasts by testing the underlying models, including 
analysis of the underlying assumptions, and by reference 
to the accuracy of previous forecasts and underlying 
assumptions. 
The reasonableness of the key assumptions of 
discount rate and long term growth rate underlying the 
goodwill impairment review were challenged through a 
combination of testing the Group’s detailed calculations, 
benchmarking the output against comparator companies 
and, in respect of the discount rate assumption, an 
independent assessment by our specialists based on 
general market indicators. 
  
The allocation of 
goodwill to operating 
segments was 
appropriate and 
in line with the 
requirements of 
IAS 36.
The discount rate 
assumption for the 
leased and tenanted 
estate, although 
at the low end of 
our range, was 
acceptable.
The assumption for 
long-term growth

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Enterprise Inns plc
Risk Our response to the risk
Key observations 
communicated to the 
Audit Committee
Deferred tax on the revaluation  
of the estate
Refer to the Audit Committee report 
(pages 51 to 56); accounting policies 
(pages 81 to 88); and note 27 of the 
consolidated financial statements 
(pages 117 to 118).
The calculation of the deferred tax 
liability associated with the valuation 
of the estate is complex, involving the 
interaction of accounting standards 
and multiple elements of tax 
legislation. 
This element of the deferred tax 
provision, which totals £146m 
(2015: £177m), has to be calculated 
in respect of circa 4,600 individual 
assets using a bespoke tax model.
The deferred tax is wholly within the 
components subject to full scope 
audits.
We consider the risk to remain 
consistent with the prior period 
given there have been no changes in 
accounting and tax regulations. 
  
We identified, documented and confirmed our 
understanding of the controls operated by the Group 
surrounding the recognition of the deferred tax liability 
arising on the valuation of the estate.
We selected a sample of 72 assets across the estate.
With support from our tax specialists, we re-performed 
the calculation of deferred tax to validate the integrity of 
the model utilised by the Group to calculate deferred tax 
on the estate valuation. 
We reperformed the overall proof of tax prepared by 
management on a performance statement basis and 
compared movements in the year with our expectations. 
We investigated representative assets to validate the 
movement.
 
 
The process for 
deriving the deferred 
tax liability in 
respect of the estate 
held at valuation 
has resulted in 
provisions which are 
fairly stated.
In the prior year, we also included going concern as a risk of material misstatement. Since the prior year, the Group has 
amended key terms of its securitised debt and has refinanced £250m of its 2018 corporate bond. We consider the risk 
of material misstatement in respect of the going concern assumption to be reduced such that it is no longer an area 
that has the greatest effect on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and the direction of the 
efforts of the audit team. 
Revenue recognition and the risk of fraud arising from management override in internal controls, being significant risks 
prescribed by ISAs, are not included above, as they were not areas of greatest audit effort. In addition, failure to correctly 
account for the terms of new contractual arrangements for wet products entered into during the current year, being 
identified as a new significant risk for the year, is not included in the above as this too was not an area of greatest audit 
effort.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Independent Auditor’s Report
to the members of Enterprise Inns plc
Statement on the directors’ assessment of the principal risks that would threaten 
the solvency or liquidity of the Group
In accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) we are required to give a statement as to 
whether we have anything material to add or to draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation in the Annual Report and Accounts that they have carried out a robust assessment of the 
principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity;
• the disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed 
or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the 
going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the 
Group’s ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial 
statements; and
• the directors’ explanation in the Annual Report and Accounts as to how they have assessed the prospects of the 
Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement 
as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to 
any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 73, the directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted 
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Notes to the Notice of  
Annual General Meeting
1. A member who is an individual is entitled to attend, speak and vote at the meeting or to appoint one or more other 
persons as his proxy to exercise all or any of his rights on his behalf. Further details of how to appoint a proxy, and 
the rights of proxies, are given in the paragraphs below. A member that is a company can appoint one or more 
corporate representatives (such as a director or employee of the company) whose attendance at the meeting is 
treated as if the company were attending in person, or it can appoint one or more persons as its proxy to exercise 
all or any of its rights on its behalf. In each case, a person attending the meeting will need to provide the Company 
or its Registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, with evidence of their identity and, if applicable, their 
appointment as a proxy or corporate representative with authority to vote on behalf of a member. 
2. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy 
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not 
be a shareholder of the Company. To appoint a proxy or proxies, shareholders must complete: (a) a form of proxy, 
sign it and return it, together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a 
notarially certified copy of such authority, to the Company’s Registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The 
Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY; or (b) a CREST Proxy Instruction (as set out in paragraph 11 below); 
or (c) an online proxy appointment at www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy (you will need to enter the Control Number, 
together with your unique PIN and Shareholder Reference Number printed on your personalised form of proxy), in 
each case so that it is received no later than 11 .00 a.m. on 7 February 2017 . To appoint more than one proxy, you will 
need to complete a separate proxy form in relation to each appointment. A personalised form of proxy for use in 
connection with the Annual General Meeting is enclosed with this document. If you do not have a personalised form 
of proxy and believe that you should, please contact the Company’s Registrars, Computershare Investor Services 
PLC, on 0370 889 4080 or at Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, 
BS99 6ZY . 
3. You will need to state clearly on each proxy form the number of shares in relation to which the proxy is appointed. 
A failure to specify the number of shares each proxy appointment relates to, or specifying a number of shares in 
excess of those held by the member, will result in the proxy appointment being invalid.
4. The return of a completed proxy form, other such instrument or any CREST Proxy Instruction (as described in 
paragraph 11 below) will not prevent a shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting and voting in person if he/
she wishes to do so. 
5. In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which 
the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
6. Any person to whom this Notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
to enjoy information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder 
by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy 
for the Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to 
exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the 
exercise of voting rights. 
7. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 
above does not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by 
shareholders of the Company.
8. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives notice that only 
those shareholders included in the register of members of the Company at 6.30 p.m. on 7 February 2017 or, if the 
meeting is adjourned, in the register of members at 6.30 p.m. on the day which is two days before the day of any 
adjourned meeting, will be entitled to attend and to vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of 
shares registered in their names at that time. Changes to entries on the share register after 6.30 p.m. on 7 February 
2017 , or, if the meeting is adjourned, in the register of members at 6.30 p.m. on the day which is two days before 
the day of any adjourned meeting, will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at 
the Annual General Meeting.
9. As at 9.00 a.m. on 6 December 2016, the Company’s issued share capital comprised 539,776,557 ordinary shares 
of 2½ pence each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company and, 
therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 9.00 a.m. on 6 December 2016 is 539,776,557 . 
After excluding treasury shares, which cannot be voted, the total number of voting rights in the Company as at 
9.00 a.m. on 6 December 2016 is 489,776,557 .

Notes to the Notice of  
Annual General Meeting
10. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the meeting by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com/CREST). CREST personal members or other 
CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to 
their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
11. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications, and must contain the information required for such instruction, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received 
by the Company’s agent (ID 3RA50), by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments set out in paragraph 2 
above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied 
to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time, any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
12. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers, should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. 
Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is 
the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, 
or sponsored member, or has appointed any voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of 
the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
13. Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that 
section have the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating 
to: (i) the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to 
be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company 
ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance 
with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such 
website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where 
the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must 
forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on 
the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.
14. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if: (a) to do so would 
interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the 
answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the 
interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
15. If you have sold or otherwise transferred all your ordinary shares in the Company, please forward this Annual Report 
and Accounts to the purchaser or transferee or to the stockbroker, bank or other person through whom the sale or 
transfer was effected for transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
16. The service agreements of the executive directors and copies of the letters of appointment of the non-executive 
directors are available for inspection during normal business hours on any weekday (excluding Saturdays, Sundays 
and public holidays) at the registered office of the Company and will be available for inspection for fifteen minutes

to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Shareholder information
Explanatory Notes to the Notice of 
Annual General Meeting
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 9 February 2017 is set out on pages 138 to 140 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. The following notes provide an explanation as to why the resolutions set out in the 
Notice are to be put to shareholders.
Resolutions 1 to 12 are ordinary resolutions. These resolutions will be passed if more than 50% of the votes cast for or 
against are in favour.
Resolution 1 — Laying of accounts
The directors are required by the Companies Act 2006 to present to the shareholders of the Company at a general meeting the reports 
of the directors and auditor, and the audited accounts of the Company, for the year ended 30 September 2016. The reports of the 
directors and the audited accounts have been approved by the directors, and the report of the auditor has been approved by the auditor, 
and a copy of each of these documents may be found in the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Resolution 2 — Directors’ remuneration report 
The Companies Act 2006 requires the Company to seek shareholder approval of the annual remuneration report on an annual basis. This 
is sought in resolution 2.
The Companies Act 2006 also now requires the Company to have received shareholder approval of a remuneration policy for its 
directors. This is a binding policy and, after it takes effect, the directors will not be entitled to remuneration unless such remuneration 
is consistent with the approved policy from time to time or shareholders otherwise approve the remuneration. The Company obtained 
shareholder approval for a policy at its AGM in February 2016 and do not expect to seek fresh approval from its shareholders for its 
policy until its AGM in 2019.
Resolutions 3–9 — Re-election of directors
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all of the directors of the Company will stand for re-election. Biographical 
information for the directors is shown on pages 44 and 45 of the Annual Report and Accounts. Details of why the Board believes that 
the relevant directors should be re-elected are included in the governance report in the Annual Report and Accounts, starting at  
page 46.
Resolution 10 — Auditor’s re-appointment 
The Companies Act 2006 requires that an auditor is appointed at each general meeting at which accounts are laid, to hold office until 
the next such meeting. The resolution seeks shareholder approval for the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP . The Audit Committee 
keeps under review the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, further information on which can be found in the Annual 
Report and Accounts on pages 51 to 56. After considering relevant information, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that 
Ernst & Young LLP be re-appointed.
Resolution 11 — Auditor’s remuneration
This resolution gives the directors the authority to determine the remuneration of the auditor for the audit work to be carried out by 
them in the next financial year. The amount of the remuneration paid to the auditor for the next financial year will be disclosed in the 
next audited accounts of the Company.
Resolution 12 — Authority to the directors to allot shares
The Companies Act 2006 provides that the directors may only allot shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. Resolution 12 will, if 
passed, authorise the directors to allot shares and to grant rights to subscribe for, or convert securities into, shares up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £8,162,942.62 which represents an amount which is approximately equal to two-thirds of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company as at 6 December 2016 (excluding treasury shares), the latest practicable date prior to the publication 
of the Notice. The Company did not issue any shares during the period under review but, pursuant to the terms of convertible bonds 
previously issued by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, it has agreed to issue up to 50,800,000 shares on conversion of the 
bonds.
As provided in paragraph (a) of the resolution, up to half of this authority (equal to one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of 
the Company) will enable the directors to allot and issue new shares in whatever manner (subject to pre-emption rights) they see fit. 
Paragraph (b) of the resolution provides that the remainder of the authority (equal to a further one-third of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company) may only be used in connection with a rights issue in favour of ordinary shareholders. As paragraph (a) imposes 
no restrictions on the way the authority may be exercised, it could be used in conjunction with paragraph (b) so as to enable the whole 
two-thirds authority to be used in connection with a rights issue.
The authority will expire at the earlier of the date that is fifteen months after the date of the passing of the resolution and the conclusion 
of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Passing resolution 12 will ensure that the directors continue to have the flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders, when 
opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. There are no current plans to issue new shares except in connection with employee share 
schemes and on conversion of the bonds.

Explanatory Notes to the Notice of 
Annual General Meeting
As at 6 December 2016, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice, the Company had 539,776,557 ordinary shares 
of 2½ pence each in issue and held 50,000,000 treasury shares, which is equal to approximately 10.21% of the issued share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at that date.
Resolutions 13–16 are special resolutions. These resolutions will be passed if not less than 75% of the votes cast for or against are in 
favour.
Resolutions 13 and 14 — Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights
The Companies Act 2006 prescribes certain pre-emption rights under which, if the Company issues new shares, or grants rights 
to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares, for cash or sells any treasury shares, it must first offer them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their current holdings. 
Under Resolution 13, it is proposed that the directors be authorised to issue shares for cash and/or sell shares from treasury without 
offering them first to existing shareholders in proportion to their current holdings:
i. up to an aggregate nominal value of £612,220.70 (up to 24,488,827 new ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each). This amount 
represents approximately 5% of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) as at 6 December 2016, 
the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice. This part of the authority is designed to provide the directors with 
flexibility to raise further equity funding and to pursue acquisition opportunities as and when they may arise; or
ii. in respect of a rights issue, open offer or other offer that generally provides existing shareholders with the opportunity to subscribe 
for new shares pro rata to their existing holdings. This part of the authority is designed to give the Directors flexibility to exclude 
certain shareholders from such an offer where the directors consider it necessary or desirable to do so in order to avoid legal, 
regulatory or practical problems that would otherwise arise. 
Under Resolution 14, it is proposed that the directors be authorised to disapply statutory pre-emption rights in respect of an additional 
5% of the Company’s issued share capital (as at 6 December 2016, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice, and 
excluding shares held in treasury). In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s Principles, the directors confirm that this authority will 
be used only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment that is announced contemporaneously with the issue, or 
that has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.
If passed, the authorities in Resolution 13 and Resolution 14 will expire at the same time as the authority to allot shares given pursuant 
to Resolution 12.
Excluding any shares issued in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment as described above, the directors do not 
intend to issue more than 7 .5% of the issued share capital on a non-pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period.
Resolution 15 — Purchase of own shares by the Company
If passed, this resolution will grant the Company authority for a period of up to fifteen months after the date of passing of the resolution 
to buy its own shares in the market. The resolution limits the number of shares that may be purchased to 14.99% of the Company’s 
issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 6 December 2016, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice. 
The price per ordinary share that the Company may pay is set at a minimum amount (excluding expenses) of 2½ pence per ordinary 
share and a maximum amount (excluding expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5% over the average of the previous five business days’ middle 
market prices; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venue 
where the purchase is carried out. This authority will only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous to do so.
The directors’ present intention is that shares purchased pursuant to this authority will be cancelled immediately on purchase. 
Alternatively, the shares may be held in treasury, sold for cash or (provided Listing Rule requirements are met) transferred to an 
employees’ share scheme. The effect of any cancellation would be to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most purposes, 
while held in treasury, shares are treated as if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry no voting rights and do not rank for 
dividends). The directors will only make purchases under this authority if they believe that the effect of such purchases (where such 
shares are purchased for cancellation) would result in increased earnings per share, and would be in the interests of the shareholders 
generally.
As at 6 December 2016, the latest practicable date prior to the publication of the Notice, the total number of options to subscribe for 
ordinary shares of 2½ pence each in the Company was 6,628,470, representing approximately 1 .35% of the issued share capital of 
the Company (excluding treasury shares) at that date. If the proposed market purchase authority were to be used in full and all of the 
repurchased ordinary shares were cancelled (but the Company’s issued share capital otherwise remained unaltered), the total number 
of options to subscribe for ordinary shares at that date would represent approximately 1 .59% of the Company’s issued share capital 
(excluding treasury shares).
Resolution 16 — Approving the notice period for General Meetings
In order to maintain its ability to call general meetings (other than an Annual General Meeting) on 14 clear days’ notice, the Company 
must offer all shareholders the ability to appoint a proxy electronically (via the website of the Company or its Registrars) and must 
obtain the approval of its shareholders by means of a special resolution passed each year. Resolution 16 seeks such approval. It is 
intended that a similar resolution will be proposed at future Annual General Meetings.

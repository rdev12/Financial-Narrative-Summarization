The year’s results are satisfactory and have been delivered 
against a background of challenging conditions and subdued 
equity markets.  Despite this, I am pleased to have seen the 
Group deliver an underlying profit and positive operating cash 
flows before changes in working capital.  These results should 
also be read in the context of the trading update which the 
Board released on 10 September 2010 then advising that the 
Group was unlikely to meet market expectations.  At that stage 
there was no clarity that certain transactions in the pipeline 
would be delivered by the year end so it was deemed prudent 
to issue the update.  Subsequently two large transactions 
occurred by the year end as announced on 2 November 2010.
Arden operates in a highly competitive market place and 
to succeed a broking business needs to have either scale 
or specialist products.  The Board has considered potential 
acquisitions and merger opportunities but none were 
considered suitable.  In the latter months of 2010 Arden has 
sought to reorganise and position itself to compete in what 
could be continued difficult markets.  To this end the Group 
has made changes at both Board and operating levels.
On 22 December 2010 we announced a number of Board 
changes with the appointment of two new independent Non 
Executive Directors with expertise in the Group’s two main 
revenue generating areas, Mark Ansell and Peter Moon.  At 
the same time the Group also announced the appointment 
of its Chief Operating Officer, Steve Wassell, as an Executive 
Director.  This appointment was designed to assist our Chief 
Executive Officer, Jonathan Keeling, to continue to focus on 
our growing Indian franchise.
At an operational level, the Board is overseeing changes 
designed to focus coverage and resource on core UK sectors 
and those with reach into India.  Following the departure of a 
number of staff earlier in the year, and with tight management 
of fixed overhead costs, the Board believes the Group is well 
placed to deliver profitability in the current financial year.  
Our closing balance sheet is strong with a healthy regulatory 
capital position.
On behalf of all of Arden’s stakeholders I would like to thank 
both Sir David Rowe-Ham and Tony Bartlett following their 
retirement from the Board at the end of December 2010.  Sir 
David has been Chairman since Arden’s admission to AIM in 
July 2006 and Tony has carried out various roles, including 
that of CEO, having been involved with Arden almost since its 
inception in 2002.
Finally, I would like to thank all staff and clients for their 
commitment to the business.

Interim Chairman

Chairman’s Statement Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

Introduction
I am pleased to report that the Group has had a satisfactory 
year in a challenging market.  The Group made an underlying 
profit of £1.3m before charging £1.8m for both share-based 
payments (IFRS 2) and one-off reorganisation costs giving 
rise to a loss before taxation of £0.5m (2009: profit £1.5m).  
The Group also generated cash from operations, before 
adjustment for movements in working capital, of £0.6m 
(2009: £2.3m).
Total revenues at £13.0m are on a par with the previous year 
(£13.1m) but based on a different mix with 53% derived from 
corporate finance fees and retainers (2009: 34%).  In the 
last few weeks of the financial year the Group secured two 
large corporate placings which raised some £98m for clients.  
Revenues generated by our Equities Division were down by 
29% to £6.1m from £8.6m.  This statistic was the result of a 
number of factors including reduced trading volumes in the 
London markets, lower returns from Institutions and increased 
competition from other exchange venues.
During the year the Group carried out a reorganisation which 
involved a number of staff leaving giving rise to costs for the 
Group of £0.7m.  We also revisited other overheads and some 
of these have also been rationalised.  This leaves the Group 
with a lower fixed overhead going forward and a refocused 
strategy at both Group and operating levels which is designed 
to deliver higher revenue per head. 
Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 October 2010 was £13.0m 
compared to £13.1m in 2009.  The underlying profit before 
tax was £1.3m compared to £2.2m.  The loss before taxation, 
which is stated after charging share-based payments and 
reorganisation costs, was £0.5m and compares to a profit 
before taxation in 2009 of £1.5m.  Cash generation was 
strong with balances at the year end of £9.0m (2009: £10.5m) 
together with long market making positions of £3.0m (2009: 
£2.5m).  During the year the Company migrated settlement 
services from Pershing to BNP Paribas Securities Services and 
this necessitated a deposit of £0.6m to cover base collateral 
requirements.  Cash balances at the year end represented 
some 283% of our regulatory capital requirement.
The underlying earnings per share (before charging share 
based payments and reorganisation costs) was 2.4p compared 
to 8.0p in 2009.  The basic loss per share was 4.2p compared 
to earnings per share of 5.1p in 2009.
During the period between 5 November and 9 November 
2010 the Company purchased 1,933,521 ordinary shares of 
10p each at a price of 49p per share.  All of these shares will 
be held in Treasury.
Equities Division
Our Equities Division revenue decreased by 29% to £6.1m 
from £8.6m.  Whilst underlying commission levels fell by only 
4%, income from share placings and market making returns 
were lower than anticipated.
Corporate Finance
During the year we completed fifteen corporate finance 
transactions (2009: twelve) including ten M&A mandates, 
four secondary fundraisings and one IPO.  Including retainer 
income, total corporate finance revenues increased by some 
57% to £6.9m from £4.4m.
Outlook
The current year has started satisfactorily and Arden has 
completed one fundraising to date.  The Equities Division 
continues to see pressure on margins, as in the previous year, 
and the corporate finance pipeline whilst satisfactory, remains 
market dependent.  With tight cost control and a strong 
balance sheet a positive result for the full year is anticipated.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff 
for their commitment through challenging conditions.

Re-election of Directors
In accordance with the Company’s Articles, and to ensure 
compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, certain 
of the Directors are required to be re-elected at Annual General 
Meetings of the Company.   Since their appointment occurred 
following the last Annual General Meeting, each of Lord 
Flight, Mark Ansell, Peter Moon and Steve Wassell are required 
to retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, 
being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.  In addition, 
the Articles require any Director who has not been re-elected 
at either of the last two Annual General Meetings to retire by 
rotation and, on that basis, Grahame Whateley is required to 
retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and, being 
eligible, offers himself for re-election.  The Board supports all 
of these re-appointments having assessed their performance 
and value to the Board.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors, is chaired by Peter 
Moon and has responsibility for determining remuneration of 
Executive Directors and key members of staff.  This Committee 
makes decisions in consultation with the Chief Executive 
Officer and no Director plays a part in any decision about 
their own remuneration.  This Committee also reviews bonus 
and equity arrangements for the Group’s senior employees 
and in addition has responsibility for supervising the Arden 
Partners Share Option Scheme and the grant of options under 
its terms.  
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is fixed by the 
Board.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, which comprises the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors, is chaired by Mark Ansell and has 
responsibilities including the monitoring and review of:
 ● the Group’s internal control environment; 
 ● financial risks (including market risk in relation to the 
Group’s market making activities); 
 ● financial statements, reports and announcements; 
 ● independence of auditors; 
 ● ensuring the Group has a policy which allows any member 
of staff to raise, in confidence, any concern about possible 
impropriety in matters of financial reporting or other 
matters, and to ensure that suitable arrangements are in 
place for a proportionate independent investigation of 
such matters including any follow-up action required.
Nominations Committee
Given a number of changes to the Board in recent months, the 
Corporate Governance
Notes:
1 Lord Flight attended all but one Board meeting subsequent to his appointment on 29/6/2010. There were no Audit Committee or Remuneration meetings in the 
period from 29/6/2010 to 31/10/2010.
2 Appointments were effected after the year end therefore attendance was not applicable.
3 Philip Dayer was not required to attend meetings following his resignation.
4 Jeremy Grime was appointed Chief Executive Officer designate in June 2010 and was formally appointed a Director on 22/9/2010. He left the Company during 
October 2010 and was therefore only required to attend one meeting as a Director. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

Corporate Governance continued
Board has decided to implement a Nominations Committee.  
This Committee’s responsibilities will include; ensuring that 
the size and composition of the Board is appropriate for the 
needs of the Group, selecting the most suitable candidate or 
candidates for the Board and to oversee succession planning 
aspects for the Board.  This Committee will be chaired by 
Peter Moon.
Operations Structure
The Group is managed by an Operations Committee which has 
responsibility for implementation of strategy and monitoring 
progress of delivery against key objectives.  The Committee 
also reviews financial performance against budgets and key 
performance indicators.  This Committee is chaired by Steve 
Wassell in his role as Chief Operating Officer and has both 
Jonathan Keeling and Trevor Norris as permanent members.  
Other members of staff, including the Director of Compliance, 
are co-opted as required.
Risk
The Risk Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director 
and has both the Chief Operating Officer and the Director 
of Compliance as permanent members.  This Committee is 
charged with monitoring risk exposures including those which 
arise through trading and holding financial instruments, 
regulatory and compliance, capital adequacy and financial 
reporting risk.  This Committee also has responsibility for 
internal audit reviews.
A further explanation of risks which are faced by the Group, is 
set out in note 23 to the Financial Statements.
Internal Control
The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks 
faced by the Group, which complies with the guidance 
“Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code”.  This has been in place throughout the year and up to 
the date of approval of the Financial Statements.  The process 
is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of 
internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.  However, 
such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to believe it is appropriate to 
adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial 
Statements. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

Principal Activities
Arden Partners plc is an established stockbroker which 
provides a range of financial services to corporate and 
institutional clients.  Based in the United Kingdom and with 
strong international links, Arden’s shares trade on London’s 
AIM market, part of the London Stock Exchange.
Business Review and Future Developments
A review of the Group’s operations and performance during 
the financial year, setting out the position at the year end, 
significant changes during the year and an indication of the 
outlook for the future, is contained in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
By far the major risk the business faces is stock market 
conditions.  Adverse market conditions may have a significant 
negative effect on revenues and profitability.  The Group 
mitigates some of this risk by targeting revenues across a 
number of sectors of the market and by careful control of 
overheads.
Other risks include liquidity risk, credit risk and operational 
risk, and an explanation of these is set out in note 23.
Results and Dividends
The Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the year is set out on page 14.
The Directors are not proposing to pay a final ordinary dividend 
(2009: Nil) and did not pay an interim dividend (2009: Nil).

Introduction
Whilst the Group is not obliged to comply with The Large and 
Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) 
Regulations 2008, the Directors have agreed to adopt the 
ethos of those regulations and to disclose information relating 
to the current Directors.  The Directors are not intending to 
comply fully with Schedule VIII of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008, but are providing the following disclosures on a 
voluntary basis.  The Report also describes how the Board 
has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to 
Directors’ remuneration.  This Report is not subject to audit 
and a resolution to approve it will be proposed at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Company at which the Financial 
Statements are to be approved.
Remuneration Policy
Arden Partners plc has a policy to attract, motivate and 
reward individuals of the highest calibre who are committed 
to grow the value of the business and to maximise returns to 
shareholders.
This policy is as relevant to Executive Directors as it is to 
employees and the rewards of Executive Directors are aligned 
with those of shareholders in reflecting the performance of 
the Group.  
The Group operates in a business environment where it is 
common practice to pay bonuses.  This compensates for basic 
salaries which are capped and for the risk of little or no bonus 
in the event of difficult market conditions.
Directors’ Service Contracts
No Director has a service contract for longer than twelve 
months and no contract contains provisions for sums to be 
paid on termination.  Copies of Directors’ service contracts 
will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Pension Arrangements
The Group does not operate a final salary pension scheme.  
Executive Directors who are entitled to receive pension 
contributions may nominate a defined contribution pension 
scheme into which the Company makes payments on their 
behalf.
Share Options
Details of the Arden Partners plc Share Option Scheme 
are given in note 18 to the Financial Statements.  The 
Remuneration Committee has responsibility for supervising 
the scheme and the grant of options under its terms.
The Company’s policy is to use the Share Option Scheme to 
attract and retain key senior employees including the Executive 
Directors.  Any grant of options is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee and will take into account individual 
performance and responsibilities.  Where appropriate, a grant 
of options will incorporate performance criteria and for 
Executive Directors may incorporate earnings per share, total 
shareholder return and return on capital employed.  Some of 
these aspects will be bench-marked against a pool of similar 
competitors.

Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have 
elected to prepare the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. The Directors are also required to prepare financial statements in accordance with the rules of the 
London Stock Exchange for companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
 ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ● make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ● state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 ● prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’ s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland).  Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
A description of the scope of an audit of ﬁnancial statements is provided on the APB’s website at www.frc.org.uk/apb/scope/
private.cfm. 
Opinion on financial statements

   the group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union;

Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the directors’ report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the ﬁnancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion:
   adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
   the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
   certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or
   we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
1) Accounting policies
Arden Partners plc is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act. The address 
of the Company’s registered office is set out on page 41. 
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.  The policies 
have been consistently applied to the Group and Company to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
These policies are in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards 
and Interpretations (collectively, “IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board as endorsed for use 
in the European Union.  The Group and Company Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.  
These financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are 
applicable to companies preparing their financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Consolidated and Company Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified 
by the revaluation of certain financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative instruments to fair value.
Basis of consolidation
Where the Company has the power, either directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of another 
entity or business so as to obtain benefits from its activities, it is classified as a subsidiary.  The consolidated financial 
statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) as if they formed a single entity.  
Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full. 
The Company has taken advantage of Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, and the Statement of Comprehensive 
Income of the parent company is not presented.  The parent company’s loss after taxation for the financial year amounted 
to £1,031,000 (2009: profit after taxation £1,246,000).
New standards and amendments to existing standards that have been adopted by the Group in the year ended 
31 October 2010:
During the year ended 31 October 2010, the Group adopted the following new standards and amendments to standards:
— IAS 1 (revised) ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. Whilst the adoption of the revised standard has no effect on 
the results reported in the Group’s consolidated and Company financial statements, the Group has elected to report 
its financial performance in a single Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
— IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’. This standard requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as that 
used for internal management reporting, regarding components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief 
operating decision maker to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.  The chief operating 
decision maker is the Group’s Chief Executive.
The Group’s operating segments are considered to be the Equities and Corporate Finance divisions. Although these 
operations generate different revenue streams, additional discrete divisional information is not prepared or reviewed by 
the chief operating decision maker. Resources are allocated and performance assessed as a single business unit.
— IFRS 7 (revised) ‘Financial Instruments’: The amendment requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement 
and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of hierarchy and 
further details can be found in note 23.
Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards not yet effective
Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for 
the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2010 or later periods and which the Group has decided 
not to adopt early. These are:
— Improvements to IFRSs (2009) effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2010.  The improvements 
in this amendment clarify the requirements of IFRSs and eliminate inconsistencies within and between standards. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010
22
1) Accounting policies (continued)
The changes include the clarification that: The disclosure requirements of other IFRSs do not generally apply to non-current 
assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale; total assets for each reportable segment need only be disclosed when 
such information is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker; that the terms of a liability that could, at the 
option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification; and, 
that only expenditures which result in a recognised asset can be classified as a cash flow from investing activities. It also 
confirms that the combination of entities or businesses under common control and the contribution of a business on the 
formation of a joint venture are outside of the scope of IFRS 2 and that IFRIC 9 also does not apply to embedded derivatives 
in contracts acquired in such transactions.
The Amendment changes IAS 38 to bring the guidance on the treatment of intangible assets acquired as part of a business 
combination in line with the requirements of IFRS 3(R) and to clarify the description of valuation techniques used in the 
absence of an active market. It removes the restriction in IFRIC 16 on the entity that can hold a hedging instrument 
used in the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation and also introduces changes to IAS 17 that eliminate the 
inconsistencies between the general lease classification guidance and the guidance applicable to the classification of the 
land element in long-term leases of land and buildings. The latter changes may lead to an increased number of instances 
when the land element of a lease of land and buildings is classified as a finance lease.
Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions (Amendments to IFRS 2) (effective for accounting periods 
on or after 1 January 2010). This Amendment clarifies that, where a parent (or another group entity) has an obligation to 
make a cash-settled share-based payment to another group entity’s employees or suppliers, the entity receiving the goods 
or services should account for the transaction as equity-settled. The Amendment also moves the IFRIC 11 requirements in 
respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions among group entities and the clarification of the scope of IFRS 
2 contained within IFRIC 8 into IFRS 2 itself. The Board are assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group; this is 
not expected to be significant.
Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011). The 
revision to IAS 24 is in response to concerns that the previous disclosure requirements and the definition of a related party

Board are assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group; this is not expected to be significant.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013). IFRS 9 will eventually 
replace IAS 39 in its entirety. However, the process has been divided into three main components: Classification and 
measurement; impairment; and, hedge accounting. As each phase is completed, it will delete the relevant portions of IAS 
39 and create new chapters in IFRS 9. The Board are assessing the impact of this amendment on the Group; this is not 
expected to be significant.
The following are also standards, interpretations and amendments to published statements not yet effective, but which are 
not considered to be relevant to the Group:
— Classification of Rights Issues (Amendment to IAS 32) (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after
 1 February 2010).
— IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments (effective for accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 July 2010).
— Amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (effective for 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010).
— Amendment to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 – Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and 
their Interaction (effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011).

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
1) Accounting policies (continued)
Revenue
Revenue comprises the net trading gains or losses of shares traded on a principal basis, commissions and fees earned 
from trading shares on an agency basis, together with fees derived from corporate finance activities, broking services and 
retainers.
Revenue is recognised at the fair value of the consideration receivable, to the extent that it is probable that the economic 
benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.  Where consideration includes financial instruments or 
other non cash items, revenue is measured at fair value using an appropriate valuation method. 
Corporate Finance Division
The Group recognises revenue at the point of completing an assignment to the extent that it has obtained the right to 
consideration through performance of its services to clients.
Deal fees and placing commissions are only recognised once there is an absolute contractual entitlement for the Group to 
receive them.
Corporate retainers are recognised on an accruals basis.
Equities Division
Institutional commissions are recognised on trade dates.  Net trading gains or losses are the realised and unrealised profits 
and losses from market making long and short positions on a trade date basis.
Interest receivable
Financial income, which comprises principally interest received, is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of depreciation and impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all tangible fixed assets evenly over their 
expected useful lives on a straight line basis.  It is calculated at the following rates:
Improvements to leasehold buildings — 33.33% per annum
Fixtures, fittings and computer equipment — 33.33% per annum 
  
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment.
Financial assets
Financial assets comprise trading investments, trade receivables, other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.  The 
Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which the 
asset was acquired.  The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
 ● Trading investments: Trading investments comprise available for sale investments and held for trading investments:
 ● Available for sale: This category comprises the Group’s investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, 
associates or jointly controlled entities.  They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly 
in a separate component of equity, the available for sale reserve.  Where there is a significant or prolonged decline 
in the fair value of an available for sale financial asset (which constitutes objective evidence of impairment), the full 
amount of the impairment, including any amount previously charged to equity, is recognised in the Statement of 
Comprehensive Income.  Purchases and sales of available for sale financial assets are recognised on contract date 
with any change in fair value between trade date and the balance sheet date being recognised in the available for 
sale reserve.  On sale, the amount held in the available for sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from 
equity and recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010
24
1) Accounting policies (continued)
 ● Held for trading: Held for trading investments represent long market making positions and other investments 
held for resale in the near term and are stated at fair value with gains and losses from changes in fair value being 
taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  For trading investments which are quoted in active markets, fair 
values are determined by reference to the current quoted bid price.  Other trading investments may include options 
and warrants which are valued using the Black-Scholes model.   
 ● Loans and receivables: These assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are 
not quoted in an active market.  They arise principally through the provision of goods and services to customers (e.g. 
trade receivables), but also incorporate other types of contractual monetary asset.  They are initially recognised at fair 
value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.  
Impairment provisions are recognised when there is objective evidence (such as significant financial difficulties on the part 
of the counterparty or default or significant delay in payment) that the Group will be unable to collect all of the amounts 
due under the terms receivable, the amount of such a provision being the difference between the net carrying amount 
and the present value of the future expected cash flows associated with the impaired receivable.  For trade receivables, 
which are reported net, such provisions are recorded in a separate allowance account with the loss being recognised within 
administrative expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  On confirmation that the trade receivable will not be 
collectable, the gross carrying value of the asset is written off against the associated provision.
The Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
 ● Market receivables: comprise sold security transactions awaiting settlement at the year end.  These balances are 
shown gross and are recognised by trade date.
 ● Cash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank balances and call deposits that are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are not subject to a significant risk of changes in value.  Cash and 
cash equivalents all have original dates to maturity of three months or less.
Financial liabilities 
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories discussed below, depending on the purpose for which 
the liability was acquired.  The Group’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:
 ● Held for trading: Held for trading liabilities represent short market-making positions and are stated at fair value.  Gains 
and losses from changes in fair value are taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For trading liabilities which are quoted in active markets, fair values are determined by reference to the current quoted 
offer price. 
 
 ● Fair value through profit or loss: The Group does not have any financial liabilities designated as being at fair value 
through profit or loss.  
 ● Other financial liabilities: These comprise market payables, trade payables, other payables and accruals.  They are 
initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
 ● Market payables: These comprise purchased security transactions awaiting settlement at the year end.  These balances 
are shown gross and are recognised by trade date.
 
Pledged assets
The Group may enter into stock borrowing arrangements with certain institutions which are entered into on a collateralised 
basis with securities or cash advances received as collateral.
Under such arrangements a security is purchased with a commitment to return it at a future date at a future agreed price.  
The securities purchased are not recognised on the balance sheet and the transaction is treated as a secured loan made for 
the purchase price.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
1) Accounting policies (continued)
Where cash has been used to effect the purchase, the cash collateral amount is recorded as a pledged asset on the 
balance sheet.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at 
the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.  Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Taxation
Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.  Income tax is recognised 
in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in 
which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.  
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount 
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised.  
Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.  Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.  
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by shareholders at an Annual General Meeting.  Dividends unpaid 
at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised 
and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.  
Leased assets
Assets acquired under finance leases where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are 
capitalised.  The outstanding future lease obligations are shown in trade and other payables.  Operating lease rentals are 
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.   
Pension costs
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the 
period in which they become payable.
Employee Benefit Trust
Arden Partners Employee Benefit Trust is a trust established by Trust deed in 2006 and the assets and liabilities are held 
separately from the Company.  Its assets and liabilities are fully consolidated in the consolidated and company balance 
sheets, and holdings of Arden Partners plc shares by the Arden Partners Employee Benefit Trust are shown as a deduction 
from company and consolidated equity under the heading “Employee Benefit Trust reserve”.
 
Share-based payments — equity settled
All options granted are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.  The fair value is 
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the 
options.  The fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the options were granted. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010
26
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
1) Accounting policies (continued)
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at 
each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the 
number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. 
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market conditions are 
satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Critical accounting estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense.  The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities.  Actual results may differ from those amounts. 
Judgements made by management that may have a significant effect on the financial statements relate principally 
to the Group’s equity-settled share-based remuneration schemes for employees. Employee services received, and the 
corresponding increase in equity, are measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant. 
The fair value of share options is estimated by using valuation models, such as Black-Scholes, on the date of grant based 
on certain assumptions. Those assumptions are described in note 18 and include, among others, the dividend growth rate 
and expected volatility. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

Included within revenue of the Equities Division is an amount of £37,000 (2009: £157,000) relating to the fair value 
adjustment of derivatives held within trading investments that are fair valued through profit or loss.
The Directors are of the opinion that there are only two operating segments and while segment revenues are reviewed 
internally business resources are not allocated to segments for the purposes of deriving either profit or assets. In 2010 two 
of the Group’s customers each contributed more than 10% of the Group’s revenue. The amounts were £2,395,000 and 
£1,400,000 and are reflected in the above segment revenues. In 2009 one of the Group’s customers contributed more than 
10% of the Group’s revenue. The amount was £1,445,000 and is reflected in the above segment revenues.

Share-based payments
The share options granted during the year under the Arden Partners Share Plan 2007 are equity settled options. The vesting 
condition for all options requires the option holders to still be in the employment of the Company at the exercise date; 
for certain options, performance conditions must also be satisfied. These include both market and non-market conditions.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. During the year the weighted average fair value of options granted was 97p (2009: 96p).
The total expense recognised for the year arising from share based payments is as follows:
  2010 2009
  £’000 £’000
Expensed during the year (equity-settled)
(included within employee costs as set out in note 5)  1,079 702
19) Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those 
of the Company in an independently administered fund. Where members of staff do not join the Company scheme, 
contributions are made to their own nominated schemes all of which are defined contribution. The pension charge for the 
year amounted to £474,000 (2009: £419,000). Contributions amounting to £216,000 (2009: £167,000) were payable to 
schemes and are included in payables.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Notes:
1   The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes model. The contractual life is the life of the option in question 
and growth in dividend yield is based on the best current estimate of future yields over the contractual period.
2 The Arden Partners Old Scheme was established in April 2006 with the stock price having been agreed with the Inland Revenue Share Valuation Office.
3 Expected volatility is based on historic information adjusted to take effect of future trends in economic conditions, behavioural considerations and exercise 
restrictions. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

23.1 Equity price risk
The Group and Company face risk arising from holding trading investments in markets that fluctuate. The Group 
and Company manage equity price risk by establishing individual stock limits and overall investment criteria, and 
management reports are prepared daily in support of a review regime. The Board reviews trading investments on a 
monthly basis.
23.2 Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and Company are unable to raise sufficient funding to enable them to meet 
their obligations and is managed as follows:
● maintaining a strong capital base
● forecasting future cash-flow requirements
● monitoring of cash positions on a daily basis
● monitoring of market making positions on a daily basis

its obligations. Credit risk is managed as follows:
● robust client account opening and vetting procedures
● general policy to deal only with FSA registered counterparties
● general policy on limiting exposure to concentration risk
● control over timely settlement of market receivables
● review of daily settlement reports by the Risk Committee

Capital management
The Group and Company’s policy in respect of capital adequacy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to retain 
investor, creditor and market confidence. During the years ended 31 October 2009 and 2010 capital has been 
maintained at a level above minimum FSA requirements. Such levels have been established by reference to an internal 
ICAAP assessment. The Group and Company’s capital resources consist of Tier 1 equity capital and Tier 3 retained 
earnings.
The Group and Company hold their cash with a number of reputable financial institutions. All cash and cash equivalents 
are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Arden Partners plc Annual Report 2010

23.4 Operational risk
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, staff or systems, or from 
external causes whether deliberate, accidental or natural. This would also include risk from changes in legislation, 
regulation, currency or interest rate risk.
Operational risk is managed by the Operations Committee with day-to-day control exercised by the Chief Operating 
Officer. The Group and Company also has contingency plans in place to cover loss of systems, property and other 
eventualities.
The Group and Company had an aggregate currency exposure at 31 October 2010 in respect of US$119,000 
(£75,000). There was a currency exposure for the Group and the Company at 31 October 2009 of US$127,000 
(£77,000). The effect of a 10% movement in the US$/£ exchange rate from the rate ruling at the balance sheet date 
would be to impact (loss)/profit and net assets by approximately £7,000 (2009: £8,000).
Fixed rate cash financial assets of £2,786,000 (2009: £3,677,000) comprise sterling cash deposits on money markets 
at an average rate of 0.60% (2009: 0.25%). Remaining cash was held on current accounts attracting interest based 
on LIBID. Other financial assets do not have maturity dates and do not currently attract interest.
If the average level of interest received on cash deposits had been 0.5% higher or lower than the level actually 
received in the year ended 31 October 2010, the loss before taxation would have been decreased or increased 
by approximately £21,000. In the year ended 31 October 2009 a 1% movement in rates would have increased or 
decreased profit before taxation by approximately £50,000.

23.5 Fair value estimation
The Company has adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments which are measured at fair value 
at the balance sheet date. This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value 
measurement hierarchy:
● Level 1: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
● Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  
 observed either directly as prices or indirectly from prices; and
● Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The following table presents the Group’s and Company’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at 
31 October 2010:

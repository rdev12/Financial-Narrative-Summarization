01 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
2014 HIGHLIGHTS We entered 2014 clear on the 
operational milestones needed to 
allow us to improve our competitive 
offer , deliver a successful World Cup 
and ensure our retail estate 
remained an attractive proposition 
for customers and a major source 
of cash flow for the business.
MAKING RETAIL
COMPETITIVE
ON TRACK...
9,000
We rolled out 9,000 new Clarity gaming 
machines across our estate in the first half 
of  the year ahead of  the World Cup. 
The  new  machines give customers an 
enhanced gaming experience and more 
choice of  games. They also allow us to make 
the  changes needed for our responsible 
gambling standards. Customers responded 
with gross win growth of 3.6% in the year .
02 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 03 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 2014 WAS A YEAR IN WHICH THE 
STRENGTH OF THE LADBROKES 
BRAND BEGAN TO BE FULLY 
MATCHED BY A COMPETITIVE OFFER. 
WE ENTERED THE YEAR BELIEVING 
THAT THE FIRST HALF WOULD ALL 
BE ABOUT OPERATIONAL DELIVERY 
AND THE SECOND HALF WOULD 
BE ABOUT GROWTH. 
OUTLINE
Our belief in the shape of the year was correct. We ended the year with 
all our operational targets met and with the evidence emerging that our 
structural improvements are driving improved customer metrics and 
financial performance. We enter 201 5 confident but not complacent.
WORLD CUP CHALLENGE
The World Cup was the acid test for the business after four years of 
substantive rebuilding and the Ladbrokes team rose to the challenge. 
In what was a fiercely competitive market we competed hard and 
across all the key metrics we regarded as important, the business 
delivered. Overall staking was up 22.4 % with the key area of Digital 
seeing net revenue up 25.9%. It was the mobile World Cup as 
customers chose their mobiles to be the portal of choice and our offer 
more than met their expectations. Mobile staking growth was up over 
1 , 100% and accounted for 63% of all Sportsbook staking. Retail, while 
impacted by the switch to mobile, still delivered with staking up 7 .9%.
While the tournament did not start with the bang we hoped, with 
results initially weak, we held our nerve, we backed our judgement 
on  the teams to take on and the teams to avoid and we traded hard. 
This resulted in a gross win margin of 24.3% and an overall gross 
win  of  £28.0m for the tournament.
CORE BUSINESS ON TRACK
Aside from the World Cup the litmus test for our competitiveness 
has  been the performance of our Digital business. We entered 201 4 
with a  new management team and the Playtech partnership still 
being  implemented as we exited previous contractual commitments. 
We  recognised that the pace of progress caused frustration in the 
short-term but we remained confident that these were obstacles not 
barriers to our long-term opportunities and progress.
Our Sportsbook offer and the performance of Mobile are encouraging 
signs that where we have the product and platform in place the brand 
can deliver . The early signs are that Gaming is beginning to reap the 
benefits of the changes we have put in place. We enter 201 5 with the 
foundations in place to allow the business to deliver the full potential 
of  the Playtech deal.
The retail environment continues to remain challenging but our Retail 
offer continues to be an engine for the wider Ladbrokes business. 
However , we cannot afford to stand still as our market continues to 
evolve. We continued to invest in the offer to keep it relevant for the 
modern customer and in the year we introduced Self Service Betting 
T erminals (SSBT s), a wider and more attractive football offer and more 
modern gaming machines, all to meet growing customer expectation 
on service and experience.
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
04 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic report We are not blind to the challenges retail faces in a rapidly changing 
consumer world. Customers have more choice on how they want to 
consume, more expectations on convenience and greater awareness 
of value. Y et like all retailers, we know that if we can be the customer’s 
number one choice on the High Street and online, we will get a higher 
return on that customer . That is why we believe we have to keep 
investing in our Retail and Digital offer in unison and win the multi- 
channel customer over to Ladbrokes.
A key part of the future of Ladbrokes is the need to build income 
streams outside of the UK. As we have seen over the year , the 
regulatory and political uncertainty of the UK can hinder a fair 
reflection of the value of the business.
That is why it is pleasing to report on the positive steps taken by 
our  international business this year . In Spain and Belgium we have 
established an online presence to complement our retail offer . In 
Australia we entered the market with a small acquisition at the end 
of  201 3 and have doubled its size through acquisition and organic 
growth. Opportunities overseas can take a long time to come to 
fruition and are often hard fought but we remain alive to the power 
of  our brand to either translate to new countries or to be a credible 
force in  establishing a new brand. Our positions in China and 
USA  evidence this belief and while currently small, offer potential 
long-term opportunities.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Responsible gambling has always been at the heart of the business, 
but the greater scrutiny we now have as an industry has led us to 
dig  deeper into the organisation to ensure we can not only say it with 
complete confidence but evidence it.
We have established a Board Social Responsibility Committee chaired 
by Senior Independent Director , John Kelly , and  issues such as our 
new Responsible Gambling Policy , our commitment to advertise the 
benefits of taking a responsible approach to gambling and the link 
between executive remuneration and responsible gambling targets 
have all been considered. The foundation of the Senet Group to drive 
greater responsible gambling messaging across the industry has 
been welcomed widely and we are  proud to be a founder member .
However , some in the industry have been slow to react to this agenda 
and are blind to the threat posed by public discontent at their actions. 
We are not here to give moral lectures to industry partners but there 
remains a threat at all levels that the actions of the slowest will hurt us 
all. That is why I am proud that we continue to take  a  stance as an 
industry leader and live the measures throughout the business.
BOARD FOCUS
Following the travails of 201 3 much of the Board focus has been on 
ensuring the key operational targets for 201 4 outlined by the executive 
team have been delivered. We were confident in the ability of the 
business to deliver and that underwrote our commitment to at least 
maintaining the dividend for the year .
However , we have not just focused on the here and now, we realise 
that shareholder value is created over the longer term and we 
challenged the executive and senior team to look ahead. In the year 
we  looked at the rise of the multi-channel customer and what that 
meant for both our Digital and Retail businesses and our reliance on 
the UK market. We examined the international opportunities and our 
ability to exploit them. We looked at our core strengths and the power 
of our trading and liability management teams and technology to drive 
new business opportunities and efficiencies.
Perhaps the biggest decision we faced this year was over the 
leadership of the business. Richard Glynn joined us as Chief Executive 
in 2010 with a clear remit to engineer a turnaround in the business and 
make us competitive once again. I think in hindsight, none of us 
realised just how big a task this was. Richard worked tirelessly in his 
quest to deliver a stronger Ladbrokes. The journey has not always 
been smooth and shareholder patience has been tested, but as a 
Board we strongly believe that we are fundamentally more resilient 
and  competitive than we were and that the foundations have been 
laid  to build a stronger more successful Ladbrokes.
That naturally led us to consider the composition of the team going 
forward and in discussing it with Richard, we came to the mutual 
conclusion that it was time to let someone new take over the reins. 
Richard leaves with the Board’s gratitude and my personal thanks for 
the determination, commitment and passion he brought to the role. 
No one has fought harder for Ladbrokes than Richard in the last five 
years and I wish him all the success in the future.
LOOKING AHEAD
Building on the foundations laid over the last few years is the key task 
facing the new Ladbrokes management team. As part of that task, we 
have also looked at the right incentives to have in place. The Ladbrokes 
Growth Plan was specifically aimed at incentivising a turnaround and 
ends this summer . We have consulted on a replacement which looks 
at having the right incentives in place to meet modern best practice but 
also to act as a catalyst for management out performance. We believe 
we have achieved this and look forward to reporting on it successfully 
rewarding management for shareholder performance in the future.
As the Group implemented its operational turnaround, the Board 
committed to pay dividends of 8.9p per share for 201 3 and 201 4, 
outside our historic dividend policy which is based on earnings cover 
whilst remaining within our target leverage policy of net debt being in 
the range of 1 .5/2.0 times EBITDA (before exceptional items).
The Board currently intends to continue to pay a dividend of 8.9p per 
share for the 201 5 financial year .
We enter 201 5 conscious that it will be another challenging year , 
earnings are forecast to be down reflecting regulatory and tax 
headwinds and we will have to run very hard just to stand still with 
circa  £50m of extra tax to be borne. All this on top of the regulatory 
uncertainty the General Election will cause.
However , the progress made in the business in 201 4 has been through 
a focus on the matters that are within our control and this will continue 
to be the mantra for the year ahead. The business is beginning to see 
the benefits of its strategy in key customer metrics which lead to 
financial performance. The trends are encouraging but we are not 
getting carried away .

Ladbrokes is a familiar 
name on British high 
streets. Revenue is driven 
by traditional Over the 
Counter (OTC) betting  
on football, horse and 
greyhound racing as  
well as other sports  
and by machines.
Our Digital business is 
aimed at giving 
customers a great user 
experience whenever 
and however they choose 
to bet. With Mobile now 
accounting for circa 60% 
of our Sportsbook 
our  focus has been to 
evolve our product in line 
with the ever changing 
customer preferences.
We operate successful 
retail businesses in 
Ireland, Belgium and 
Spain where our joint 
venture enjoys increasing 
brand recognition and 
is  growing strongly .
Despite a growing 
customer preference  
for betting online, 
traditional telephone 
betting remains popular 
with a number of 
customers. We also 
operate a telephone

11 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 TOP BEATS BOTTOM
The weekend of 1 1 th and 1 2th 
of  January sees the top half of 
the  Premiership table beat the 
bottom half combined with only 
one draw in 20 fixtures of the top 
two English leagues. It starts a 
bad run of football results and 
three weekends alone see us 
lose £10.5m as customers 
benefit from the most backed 
teams all delivering. 
January
A GOOD GOLD CUP
As ever the Cheltenham Festival 
saw good business with over 
£40m being staked. A good 
Gold  Cup day rescued the 
overall  result of the Festival with 
Lord Windemere at 20/1 being 
the stand out surprise result 
in  the  main race. The most 
profitable race of the week 
went  to the Champion Hurdle 
with Jezki seeing us profit to 
the  tune  of £1 .4m.
March
OVER 4M BETS PLACED  
ON GRAND NATIONAL
The Nation’s race saw over four 
million bets struck on the Grand 
National. Luckily not too many 
customers had seen Pineau De 
Re at 25/1 on the race card and 
it  was another year when the 
Grand National delivered a result 
that favoured the bookmakers.
April
OVER 250,000 BETS PLACED  
ON WORLD CUP FINAL
The World Cup kicks off and the 
tournament starts in a bad way 
for the bookies as favourite after 
favourite triumphs. But once the 
knock-out stages start, fortunes 
change. The World Cup Final 
brings an end to the World Cup 
tournament which saw over eight 
million bets staked. A nil-nil draw 
after 90 minutes and the winning 
goal by a substitute means 
that  Ladbrokes finishes the 
tournament off with a very good 
result. The match itself was 
unsurprisingly the highest 
turnover match of the year with 
over 250,000 bets placed and 
£2.75m staked.

Strategic report SUMMER OF PAIN
Rory McIlroy inflicts a summer 
of  pain for bookmakers by adding 
the Open to his BMW PGA win. 
It  makes the Open the worst result 
of any golf tournament in recent 
history . His golden summer saw 
a  WGC title and the USPGA added 
in five weeks and saw us pay out 
circa £4m. Smiling along with Rory 
was his Dad, who had bet £200 
at  500/1 ten years ago that his 
son  would win the Open within 
ten years.
July
ST LEGER RESUL T  
FAVOURS CUSTOMERS
Favourite, Kingston Hill wins 
the  Ladbrokes St Leger at 9/ 4 
and once again a flat festival 
ends  up favouring the customer . 
Ladbrokes loses £500,000 
over  the festival, primarily 
driven  by a  £400,000 loss on 
the St Leger itself.
Scotland votes ‘No’ and the 
Scottish referendum enters 
history as the most bet on 
political event in our history with 
£2.5m staked. For many it was a 
case of the heart ruling the head 
with ‘Y es’ attracting the most 
money meaning the ‘No’ vote 
was  a profitable result for us.
September
THE RACE THAT STOPS A NATION
The race that stops a Nation, 
The  Melbourne Cup, does  not 
work out too well for Ladbrokes 
Australia with the pre-race 
favourite winning at 8/1  and the 
ever popular Red Cadeaux 
finishing second for the  third time. 
However the Spring Carnival, 
with  95 group and listed races 
across 109 meetings and 63  race 
days, sees our Australian business 
come out on top overall. 
November
CHRISTMAS BONANZA
The Boxing Day football fixtures 
prove a Christmas Bonanza for 
customers as just three draws 
from the top three English 
divisions (none of which are in 
the  premiership) and 1 7 of the 
most-backed teams winning 
meant we  lost over £8m. The day 
is reported as  the worst in living 
memory.

15 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 IN H2 2013 WE COMMITTED TO 
UNDERTAKE AND COMPLETE A MAJOR 
OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING IN 
TIME FOR THE 2014 WORLD CUP 
IN ORDER TO ENSURE LADBROKES 
WAS COMPETITIVE AND COULD 
RETURN TO GROWTH IN H2 2014. 
Although operating profit
(1)
 was down on 2013 with weak,  
industry-wide football results in January and December a key factor , 
our results for 201 4 are beginning to show the financial benefits of 
this  restructuring. Despite an exceptionally high loss of £8. 1 m on 
Boxing Day football we achieved our target of delivering headline 
operating profit
(1)
 growth
 
in H2, with H2 operating profit
(1)
 up 30.4%, 
a  considerable improvement on H1 201 4 which was down 33.7% 
year  on year . We are confident that Ladbrokes is competitive with clear 
plans to improve further our business and positioned to deliver a  good 
result in 201 5.
DELIVERING ON OUR DIGITAL POTENTIAL
201 4 was a pivotal year for our Digital business during which we 
completed the key operational steps envisaged in the Playtech 
agreement of May 201 3. In December 201 3, we launched Mobile 
sports betting onto the Mobenga platform and completed the launch  
of Playtech Casino products followed by the transfer of all our Digital 
products on the Playtech IMS system by the end of April 201 4. The 
integration of our products, prices and data into IMS allowed our 
marketing and data teams in Ladbrokes Israel to begin in H2 201 4 to 
market effectively to our Digital customers. More importantly , it gives 
our customers the benefits associated with single wallet capability 
across all our Digital products.
In addition, we maintained our drive to offer the best betting and 
gaming experience on mobile devices, the key market battleground. 
Our partnership with the Chelsea Apps Factory has produced a 
highly  competitive offering throughout 201 4, delivering a wide 
range  of  application upgrades, tournament modules and unique 
functions. Customers responded positively to our improved offer 
with  c.  80- 1 60% growth in Mobile Sportsbook staking in every month 
of 201 4 and 1 10% for the year . Overall Sportsbook trends were also 
strong with staking increasing by 32% for the year . We had a good 
World Cup with Sportsbook staking increasing by 30% on a 
comparable market basis. Building on the success of our Mobile 
product in 201 4, we launched new tablet based products in 
December and in H2 201 5 we intend to launch an improved desktop 
product also on Mobenga. As a result Ladbrokes will offer customers 
a competitive and innovative sports-betting product on a stable and 
standardised platform across all digital channels.
The marketing intelligence provided by Ladbrokes Israel is key to 
maximising the return we get from our marketing expenditure. In the 
second half of 201 4 following expiry of our previous on-line casino 
supplier arrangements and the launch of IMS, Ladbrokes Israel 
was  able to apply its full marketing expertise to Casino. In Q3 we 
returned the Gaming business to growth, the first time for six quarters. 
In Q4, trends improved further with our cross-selling rates growing by 
around 30% during 201 4 and casino actives growing by 57%.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
16 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic report Overall in 201 4, despite weaker margins driven by industry-wide 
customer friendly results, Digital net revenue increased by 22.9% 
to  £21 5. 1 m and operating profit (before exceptional items) by 
70.7%  to  £1 4.0m with strong performances in Mobile Sportsbook, 
our  Australian operation and the  return to growth in Gaming the 
key drivers.
The good growth in customer numbers and Sportsbook stakes 
already delivered in 201 4 and the return to Gaming growth should 
translate into continued Digital revenue growth during 201 5.
A SUSTAINABLE UK RETAIL BUSINESS
In 201 4 we demonstrated, once again, that retail betting continues 
to  be an attractive entertainment proposition for customers and a 
major source of cash flow to support dividends and investment 
across  the Group.
In UK Retail, we enhanced our product offering and made progress 
in growing our football business. This is central to delivering better 
margins in the medium-term as well as off-setting the decline in 
traditional over the counter horse race and greyhound betting which 
is  less relevant to younger customers.
We deployed more SSBT s across the  estate bringing the total to 1 , 730. 
SSBT s are popular with football customers allowing them to build 
customised coupons and bet across a range of other sports and 
events. Around 80% of SSBT staking is on football, supporting 
this  important area of growth. SSBT staking grew throughout 201 4 
with  weekly staking levels at the end of the year above the peaks we 
saw during the World Cup. We also improved our coupon offer for 
traditional football customers and increased in-store and in-window 
visibility of the latest football offers, pricing and results. As a result, 
combined with a strong World Cup, OTC football staking increased 
by  29.4 % and gross win by 9.5%. Building on the strong customer 
response, we will deploy more than 2,000 additional SSBT s  in 201 5 
across the estate with at least one SSBT per shop.
In H1 we rolled out over 9,000 new Clarity gaming machines in time 
for  the World Cup. Clarity gives our customers an enhanced gaming 
experience in both roulette (B2) and the faster growing £2 stake slots 
(B3). In parallel with this roll-out, we introduced the changes required 
to  comply with the ABB Code and our internal responsible gambling 
standards. Customers have responded well to the new machines and 
revenues grew by 6.4 % in H2, ahead of our expectations. In Q2 201 5, 
new regulations on £50+ staking are being introduced. We are already 
preparing our shop teams to meet the new requirements whilst 
continuing to deliver a good customer experience.
The UK Retail team also kept cost increases to a level well below our 
initial cost guidance for 201 4 and generated free cash flow before 
exceptional items of £1 38.0m during the year .
Retail net revenue increased by 0.7% to £81 1 .5m whilst operating 
profit  before exceptional items declined by 10.9% to £1 1 9.3m. 
A  strong  performance in the World Cup and growth from improved 
machines performances was offset primarily by the impact of 
well  reported customer friendly football results in January and in 
December , and continued weaker staking trends, particularly for 
racing, across the year .
We stated in April that regulatory changes and our continued drive 
to  optimise the estate would inevitably lead to shop closures and 
we  closed 89 loss or near loss making shops this year . I am 
pleased  to  say that we achieved these closures without making 
compulsory redundancies, although this is becoming increasingly 
difficult to achieve.
The increase in Machine Games Duty from 1 March 201 5 and the 
anticipated impact of the new UK regulations in 201 5 means that 
further shop closures will be inevitable. We continue to optimise the 
performance of our estate and expect to close a further 60 shops 
during 201 5. We will again try to limit the impact of these closures 
on  our shop teams.
In 201 5, we will continue our focus on improving retail performance 
and on targeted growth, driven in particular by football staking, wider 
deployment of SSBT s and our 201 4 investment in the Clarity machine 
estate. We also remain focused on cost efficiency across the division.
DIVERSIFYING OUR PROFITS INTO EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA
We continued to expand and grow our international operations in 
regulated jurisdictions in a capital efficient manner . In 201 4, across 
the  whole Group, net revenue derived from non UK customers has 
increased to c. 1 4 % up 1 percentage point on 201 3.
We firmly established our exciting digital challenger brand in Australia 
and further developed our European Retail businesses in 201 4.
After acquiring Bookmaker Pty Ltd in 201 3, we acquired Betstar Pty 
Ltd for £1 2. 1 m (AUD 21 .4m) in April. Betstar was integrated in only 
six  weeks and we have delivered our cost synergy targets on plan. 
On  a pro forma basis, including the relevant results of both businesses 
in each period, 201 4 staking increased by 25%, actives by 88% and 
net revenue by 1 5 1 %. Our Australian business is well positioned for 
continued growth in 201 5.

17 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 In Belgium we made further investment in our retail estate and 
established a Ladbrokes branded digital presence. In Belgium retail, 
where we remain the market leader , we introduced virtual products 
and SSBT s. Belgian customers have responded well to these new 
products and retail net revenue increased by 10.3% and operating 
profit (before exceptional items) by 21 .4 % in 201 4 on a constant 
currency basis.
Our Spanish joint venture, Sportium, expanded into Catalunya, 
Castilla  La Mancha, Rioja and Extremadura. Spanish retail gross win 
grew by 54 %
(2)
. We also pushed ahead with Sportium.es, our digital 
sportsbetting joint venture with Cirsa, launched in December 201 3. 
Overall, the Spanish business, united under one brand, is growing 
steadily , with a target of reaching break-even profit point during 201 5 
and becoming profitable thereafter .
In 201 5, we expect to benefit further from growth in Australia and 
from  even further geographical expansion in Spain. In Belgium we will 
continue to generate benefits from our investment in new products 
and SSBT s.
In Ireland, trading in Northern Ireland which was profitable, showed 
similar top-line trends and cost performance to UK Retail. However , 
our business in the Republic of Ireland was loss-making and did 
not  deliver on its plan. Overall revenue in Ireland declined as a 
consequence by 10.9% and operating profit by 56.9%. We have 
tasked our International team to undertake a fundamental review 
of  our Republic of Ireland business during Q1 201 5 to establish 
options  to take this business forward.
2014 WORLD CUP – A COMPETITIVE LADBROKES
We set ourselves the objective of being truly competitive in time for 
the  201 4 World Cup across all channels, with enhanced products, 
stronger marketing capability , targeted campaigns, all supported 
by  a  newly launched marketing campaign ‘The Ladbrokes Life’ . 
Our  customers responded well. In particular our enhanced Mobile 
offer saw the strongest response in what became labelled the 
‘Mobile  World Cup’ .
Mobile actives increased by nearly 700% over the 2010 tournament 
and mobile staking by over 1 , 100%, albeit from a small base, resulting 
in overall growth in Digital sports staking of over 40% and actives 
increasing by 28% on a comparable market basis. 
In UK Retail, we outperformed the market with staking up 7 .9% 
and  recorded significant increase in slippage as customers took 
advantage of a wider range of multiples and coupon offers.
In Spain and Belgium we generated over 100% increases in staking 
and good online activity .
Overall margins were strong at 24.3%
(3)
 and we generated an overall 
gross win of £28m
(3)
 for the tournament well ahead of 2010. 
The 201 4 World Cup showed what we can achieve by offering 
customers attractive opportunities to bet alongside competitive 
products across all channels supported by effective and efficient 
marketing of the Ladbrokes brand. It provided the best evidence that 
Ladbrokes was back on track.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY , TAXATION AND SELF-REGULATION
The Betting Industry has been subject to a number of publicly 
announced taxation and regulatory changes – many of which will 
impact during 201 5. These include taxation of remote revenues, 
extension of UK licensing and regulation to remote operations, 
changes to regulations around gaming machine staking above 
£50  and a review of the voluntary codes relating to gambling 
advertising. While the industry entered 201 5 with many of the 
substantive issues surrounding it having been addressed, significant 
challenges remain in terms of public and stakeholder perception. 
Ladbrokes has over the last couple of years played a lead role in 
driving  social responsibility across the industry . We demonstrated 
our  commitment to social responsibility by establishing a committee 
of  the PLC board to set targets in social responsibility and to link 
these  targets to executive remuneration. Key to this has been the 
appointment of a Head of Responsible Gambling who has reviewed 
our approach and policies on responsible gambling and will ensure 
these are applied across all our channels and evolved over time. 
Ladbrokes played a leading role in establishing the first gambling 
industry responsible gambling standards body – The Senet Group – 
with other leading betting operators. The Group, which has already 
developed the first multi-operator responsible gambling advertising 
campaign, will continue to evolve in the years to come and is an 
important commitment by the industry to submit to independent 
oversight of its approach to responsible gambling. Other sectors 
of  the  wider industry must now endorse similar approaches.
Informing both Ladbrokes and the industry’s approach has been the 
extensive research carried out by The Responsible Gambling T rust. 
This ground breaking work has identified that incremental, targeted 
interventions are key to helping individuals exhibiting problematic 
behaviour to help themselves. Customer data provided by our unique 
‘Odds On’ card has enabled Ladbrokes to develop an algorithm to 
identify players exhibiting ‘at risk’ behaviour . We are currently testing 
the  algorithm in one region and we plan to roll it out more widely 
before  the end of the year .

Strategic report
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED Q4 RESUL TS
Operating profit
(1)
 for the Group in Q4 at £35.6m was flat on Q4 201 3 
(£35.6m), driven largely by the poor football results on Boxing Day . 
Across all of our platforms we recorded a loss on Boxing Day of 
c.£8. 1 m, Ladbrokes’ worst ever football daily loss on record. 
Notwithstanding this loss, Ladbrokes showed signs of further 
improved operational strength, notably in machines, Mobile 
Sportsbook, Digital Gaming and Australia, providing evidence that 
operational investment of the past 1 8 months is now delivering 
financial returns. 
In UK Retail, Q4 OTC amounts staked were down 6.8% with gross 
win  margins at 1 5.6% down by 1 .5 percentage points on Q4 201 3 
driven by customer friendly football and horse results. Football 
staking  improved by 1 . 1 % as we benefitted from our focus on coupon 
products and our investment in SSBT s where staking per terminal 
increased. Staking on traditional products declined by c.8.5% 
improving on the trends seen in Q3 benefitting from new products 
introduced during Q4.
Machine revenue increased by 7 .0%, gross win per shop per week 
was up 9.8% and on a per terminal per week basis was £996. 
Overall  net revenue declined by 2.4 %.
Digital net revenue increased by 20.1%. In Ladbrokes.com, we 
saw  another strong quarter of growth with Sportsbook actives 
up  1 4 %, staking up 30% and Mobile staking up again over 1 1 4 %, 
the  highest rate of growth in 201 4. Weaker results at the end on the 
quarter however meant that the Ladbrokes.com Sportsbook 
margin  was down 1 .7 percentage points to 6.5% and, although 
staking and customer metrics were strong, Sportsbook net 
revenue  declined by 7 .0%.
Ladbrokes.com Gaming net revenue grew by 9.3% reflecting strong 
increases in actives with Games up 31 % and Casino up 57% and 
the  impact on revenues of losses to some higher value customers 
in Casino.
Australia performed well and, with normalised results across 
the  Spring Carnival, delivered a Q4 gross win margin of 9.6% 
(Q4  201 3:  5.2%). Net revenue increased by 239% with strong 
growth  in  actives and staking increased by 32.8% strongly 
benefitting  from the Betstar acquisition.
In Belgium, staking increased in Q4 by 35.9%
(2)
 but, with margins 
impacted significantly by poor European football results net revenue 
only increased by 8.4 %
(2)
. In Ireland, trends in the Republic remain poor 
and with Boxing Day impacting margins, overall Irish revenue declined 
by 18.4 %
(2)
.
OUTLOOK AND CURRENT TRADING 
For the period 1 January to 24 February 201 5, net revenue for the 
Group (excluding High Rollers) increased by 1.5% despite the impact 
of losses to a small number of larger customers in the period and the 
adverse industry-wide football results in weeks 3 and 8.
In UK Retail we have seen similar OTC staking trends to Q4 and 
continued strong machine revenue growth. OTC gross win  margins 
were slightly ahead of last year and, overall, net revenue in UK Retail is 
ahead. In Digital, Ladbrokes.com Sportsbook and Gaming customer 
KPIs remain good and Australia is generating strong growth both 
organic and from Betstar . T rading elsewhere is in line with our 
expectations.
In H2 2014, our financial results are now showing benefits from the 
major operational restructuring undertaken over the past 1 8 months. 
In 201 5, Ladbrokes faces significant headwinds from the increases 
in  Machine Games Duty in March and the Point of Consumption T ax. 
However , we have clear plans to improve further our business. Barring 
the imposition of material unforeseen adverse regulation and/or 
taxation and assuming normalised sporting results, we are confident 
in our plans for 201 5 and in generating continued underlying growth.
DIVIDEND
As the Group implemented its operational turnaround, the Board 
committed to pay dividends of 8.9p per share for 201 3 and 201 4, 
outside our historic dividend policy which is based on earnings cover 
whilst remaining within our target leverage policy of net debt being in 
the range of 1 .5/2.0 times EBITDA (before exceptional items).
The Board currently intends to continue to pay a dividend of 8.9p per 
share for the 201 5 financial year .

RETAIL INVESTMENT DELIVERING REVENUE  
GROWTH IN MACHINES AND FOOTBALL
We had a good World Cup performance where we generated staking 
growth of 7 .9% on the 2010 tournament. Overall OTC staking was 
broadly stable at − 1 .4 %. Within staking we generated good growth in 
football, with stakes up 29.4 % on 201 3 (1 2.4 % excluding the World 
Cup). This has helped off-set the ongoing decline in traditional 
products, in particular horse racing where we saw a continued 
reduction in customer interest throughout the year .
Gross win margin was 1 6.4 % (201 3: 1 6.9%) reflecting the large 
industry-wide football losses recorded in January and on Boxing Day 
and weaker horse-racing margins driven by the higher incidence of 
winning favourites.
SSBT s generated stakes of £48. 1 m, included in OTC, with around 
80% coming from football and we have seen a growing staking per 
terminal throughout the year .
Machine revenue growth was 4.4 %
(4)
 during the year . In the first half, 
machine revenue growth was held back by our implementation of the 
ABB Code and by the short-term effect of the roll-out of over 9,000 
new Clarity gaming machines across the UK Retail estate between 
February and June. In H2, machine revenue growth accelerated to 
6.4 % reflecting the success of the new machines which is driving 
growth notably in lower stakes slots and other games. In Q4, roulette 
only accounted for 62% of gross win (Q4 201 3: 66%). In 201 4 there 
were an  average of 8,966 gaming machines in the estate (201 3: 8,87 4). 
At  31  December 201 4 there were 8,789 machines (201 3: 9,091 ).

22 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic report On 1 March 201 5 the rate of Machines Games Duty will rise from 
20%  to 25%. Using machines revenue generated in 201 4 as a base, 
this change would result in an additional cost of c.£1 7 m in 201 5 after 
adjusting for revenue related contract payments.
STRONG COST PERFORMANCE
Operating costs increased by 2.7% in 201 4 or 2.3% on a like-for -like 
basis. This was significantly lower than the cost guidance for 201 4 of 
+c.5.0% issued in February as we have benefitted from a sustained 
focus on cost efficiency notably delivering lower cost rent renewals, 
further improvements in staff scheduling and higher central 
procurement savings than we planned.
ESTATE OPTIMISATION
In the past five years we have steadily increased the size of the 
UK  Retail estate improving the size and quality of our shop portfolio 
whilst delivering attractive returns on our investment. In 201 4, we 
continued our focus on improving the quality of the estate and we 
closed 89 shops.
The annualised loss for the closed shops was approximately 
£1.5m  and the closures have generated an exceptional charge of 
£26.9m (cash cost £1 2. 1 m). 
We plan to make a further 60 closures in 201 5 as we continue to 
optimise the portfolio and prepare for the impact of regulatory and 
tax  changes. At December 201 4 there were 2,209 shops in Great 
Britain (201 3: 2,297).
FOCUS IN 2015
In 201 5 we have four key areas of focus to move UK Retail forward and 
to keep our product competitive. 
We will continue to drive growth in football betting in our shops building 
on the 201 4 World Cup. We will do this by continuing to promote OTC 
football offers and by increasing the visibility of football products within 
our shops and in advertising. We will deploy at least a further 2,000 
SSBT s across our estate during 201 5 to build on their customer 
appeal. Generating growth in higher margin football staking is key 
to  reducing the impact of the industry-wide decline in traditional 
betting products. 
We also expect revenue growth from our enhanced Clarity machine 
estate, driven in particular from lower stake B3 products to be around 
5% for FY 201 5 excluding any impact from the new DCMS regulations 
in relation to £50 and above machine staking. We will implement the 
changes required by these regulations in a manner consistent with 
our  stance on delivering social responsibility while continuing to 
provide our customers with an enjoyable experience. We expect 
these  measures to have some impact on machine revenue growth 
as  customers adapt to the new environment.
Finally we will maintain our disciplined approach to cost. We expect 
UK Retail costs to decline by c. 1 -2% in 201 5 reflecting the impact 
of shop closures and the benefit of cost efficiency programmes 
particularly around rental renewals, energy costs and UK Retail 
central costs.
ON TRACK...
WELL PLACED IN OUR MARKETPLACE
High Street betting continues to be an attractive 
proposition for customers. The myth is that retail is dying 
when the truth is that it is evolving. Customers are used 
to having more choice, greater convenience and a sense 
of theatre in their daily retail experience and expect our 
shops to do so as well.
That is why we are constantly seeking to optimise our 
retail estate in size and location while ensuring that our 
offer keeps up with customer expectations. Take Self 
Service Betting Terminals, they offer the customer a quick 
and easy to use experience and give a wide range of 
sports and events to bet on. From having no terminals at 
the start of 2013 we ended 2014 with 1,730 and have 
plans for 2,000 more. Customers like them, particularly to 
place bets on football, an important area of growth for us. 
A customer using a self service terminal is also likely to 
pick more teams in an accumulator giving us a higher 
margin opportunity.

OPERATIONAL PROGRESS
During 201 4 we have made major operational changes to increase 
the  competitiveness of our products in the market place. 
In Gaming, we migrated casino products to Playtech Casino in 
March,  completing our portfolio of Playtech products across our 
Gaming segment.
In April, we completed our last major platform transition by moving 
all  Digital products to the Playtech IMS digital marketing system. 
This  provides customers with single-wallet capability across all of our 
Digital products and enables our Digital marketing team in Ladbrokes 
Israel to optimise marketing and retention strategies. It also ensures 
that our customers can be properly rewarded for their activity across 
all of our Digital products. Ladbrokes Israel delivered significant 
improvements to our Gaming performance in H2.
In Sportsbetting we have improved our Mobile product continuously 
throughout the year improving ease of use features by adding 
functions like PayPal to enable quick deposit and launching high 
quality tournament modules for the 201 4 World Cup and Ryder Cup.
In December we launched our enhanced tablet product and 
apps  across the Mobenga platform which have met with good 
customer response. 
We have also continued to invest in ensuring our underlying IT 
systems  are robust and that down time is minimised. Digital cash 
capital expenditure was £29.4m (201 3: £35.8m).
We also undertook a review of the markets from which we take 
business and, based on our assessment of relevant local legal 
requirements and commercial considerations, we ceased taking 
bets  from a number of locations. This resulted in us withdrawing 
from  countries which generated £6m annualised net revenue and 
£3m  of operating profit
(1)
. 
Looking at Q4 201 4, UK based revenue now accounts for around 
90-95% of revenue in Ladbrokes.com with Ireland, Sweden and 
Germany , where we were recently awarded a digital sportsbetting 
licence being the next largest jurisdictions. Ladbrokes’ Digital business 
is now derived very substantially from customers based in regulated 
jurisdictions which should be more sustainable for the long-term.

Strategic report SPORTSBOOK
Sportsbook net revenue increased by 21 .0% driven by an increase in 
amounts staked of 31 .7%. Mobile sportsbetting has been particularly 
strong since the launch of our new platform in December 201 3 on the 
Mobenga platform which we have continually enhanced through the 
introduction of new product features throughout 201 4. This intense 
product focus has enabled us to deliver increases in Mobile sports 
staking of 1 10% over 201 3 with increases in staking of c.80- 1 60% 
recorded in each month of 201 4.
Our new products enabled us to compete well in the World Cup 
and  we delivered a good performance with staking up almost 30% 
on  the 2010 tournament and gross win by 1 9% on a comparable 
markets basis.
By the end of 201 4, Mobile Sportsbetting represented over 60% of 
customer staking. Our Desktop staking declined reflecting rapid 
customer migration to Mobile products. Customer acquisition has 
also  been strong with an increase of actives in the year of around 25% 
in sports betting and 62% on our Mobile platform.
Sportsbook gross win margin was 7 .8%, 0.3 percentage points 
down  on last year , reflecting the impact of exceptional industry-wide 
football results in January and on Boxing Day .
GAMING
In 201 4, Gaming net revenue decreased 6.7% to £80.5m reflecting 
the  transitional nature of the year as we completed our transition to 
Playtech casino products and the IMS platform in H1 . This transition 
was completed in April 201 4 in time for the World Cup.
In H1 , when we could not benefit from a fully enabled product and 
marketing capability , revenues declined significantly and it was 
pleasing to see that with competitive products and Ladbrokes Israel’s 
marketing skills fully engaged, we stabilised Gaming revenue in Q3 
and, in Q4, returned to growth. Looking at our two largest Gaming 
products in Q4, net revenue from Casino was up 7 . 1 % on actives 
growth of 57% and Games was up 43.5% on a 31 % increase in 
actives. Casino net revenue growth in Q4 was lower than active 
growth  due to the impact of losses to some larger customers.
ON TRACK...
WELL PLACED IN OUR MARKETPLACE
Our Digital business has seen a huge amount of 
change in the last 18 months. Since we embarked 
on our partnership with Playtech we have been on a 
constant journey of operational improvements. All aimed 
at giving our customers an improved betting and gaming 
experience and the ability for us to attract more 
customers and keep them playing for longer.
In the time together, we have relaunched our Mobile offer, 
moved to Playtech Casino and Bingo products, integrated 
a new Exchange feature, given the customer a single 
wallet facility across the digital offer and introduced a 
consistent back office to aid our marketing team. All done 
and delivered on time. The customer is responding and 
the improving customer metrics give us encouragement 
and confidence going forward. But we are not stopping 
there, we will keep improving the offer and in 2015 our 
desktop product will dramatically change in line with 
the customer demand for a single experience whatever 
device they choose to play with.

REVENUE GROWTH AND COST EFFICIENCY DELIVERS  
OPERATING PROFIT

 GROWTH
Operating costs increased by 5.0% driven by increases in 
depreciation   arising from our investment in new products and 
platforms. Other costs were broadly stable despite much higher 
underlying activity . Marketing expense for 201 4 was 27% 
(Ladbrokes.com) of net revenue (201 3: 26%) in line with our guidance 
target of 25-30% for 201 4. Depreciation and amortisation increased 
to  £27 .2m  (201 3: £1 7 .7 m) reflecting the investment in our new systems 
and product enhancements during the year .
As a result of this strong cost performance, operating profit

 for 
Ladbrokes.com and Exchanges increased by 1 7 .7% to £1 7 .3m

launched Ladbrokes.be, which now allows us to offer multi-channel 
services in Belgium. Following the launch, we have invested heavily in 
marketing and incurred start up losses of £2.8m. 
We also transferred our independent Spanish operation LBapuestas.es 
to our Sportium.es joint venture (which was itself launched in 
December 201 3) during the first quarter and after further investment to 
drive revenue growth in Spain, Ladbrokes recorded a start-up loss of 
£1 .7 m. In 201 5 we expect to record further start-up losses in Belgium 
and Spain but we expect such losses to be materially lower than in 
201 4 as we build market share in both territories and drive towards 
profit in 201 6.
The overall revenue decline reflects the impact of our agreement 
with  Cirsa to combine all of our Spanish digital businesses into the 
Sportium.es joint venture which was completed during Q1 201 4 
and  which are not consolidated in Ladbrokes’ statutory results.
DIGITAL FOCUS IN 2015
In 201 5 we will build on the momentum we have developed in 201 4 
across all our Digital businesses to drive revenue growth in particular in 
Mobile sportsbetting and in Gaming where we still have the opportunity 
to achieve higher rates of growth.
We will evolve our Digital platform in 201 5 by transitioning to a new 
desktop sportsbook platform, harmonised with our mobile and tablet 
offer in H2. There will be further improvements to IMS and continued 
product innovation.
We expect marketing expense to be a lower percentage of net revenue 
in Ladbokes.com than in 201 4 as we expect to benefit from more 
rational marketing behaviour following the introduction of the Point of 
Consumption tax in the UK from 1 December 201 4 which has created 
a sizeable headwind for the industry in 201 5. We are focused on 
mitigating some of the impact of this tax through cost measures but it 
is  not possible to offset a substantial proportion of this tax. Therefore, 
although we expect to deliver continued strong organic revenue growth 
in 201 5, it is unlikely we will deliver a result ahead of 201 4 for this division.

In Belgium, where we are the largest retail betting operator , 201 4 was 
a  year of investment in enhancing the quality of offer in our retail estate 
for customers with the introduction of virtual betting product and 
SSBT s. Shortly before the World Cup, we launched a new digital 
service, Ladbrokes.be positioning us to establish Belgium’s leading 
multi-channel operator .
A strong performance in the World Cup and good growth in sports 
betting, notably in football, delivered an increase in retail amounts 
staked of 1 4.5% on a constant currency basis. Looking at 
performance on a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 
by  10.3%. Amounts staked on the World Cup increased by 1 57% 
and  net revenue by 83% against 2010. Operating costs were up 
7 .3%   and operating profit was up 21 .4 % to £9.6m. Results for 
Ladbrokes.be which incurred a start up loss of £2.8m on net revenue 
of £1 .6m are recorded within the (‘other regulated operations’) 
Digital  segment. We remain on track to deliver an operating profit for 
Ladbrokes.be in 201 6 and expect investment led losses to be lower 
in  201 5 as we build scale.
As at 31 December 201 4 there were a total of 361 outlets including 
both Ladbrokes shops and newsagent outlets compared with 359 
at  31 December 201 3.
In 201 5, we will continue to improve the quality of our retail  estate both 
in terms of service and product. Our digital growth will  focus heavily on 
the further development of our mobile and tablet  offering. Overall we 
will continue to focus on maintaining our leadership  in multi-channel 
retailing in Belgium.

In 201 4 our Sportium joint venture with Cirsa was awarded retail 
betting licences in a further four regions – Catalunya, Castilla La 
Mancha, La Rioja and Extremadura and we have moved rapidly to 
establish a strong retail presence in these regions. We now operate in 
ten  regions in Spain and are hopeful that further regions will formally 
approve the provision of retail betting services in 201 5 enabling us to 
expand our retail network and increase operational scale as we drive 
towards generating a meaningful profit from our Spanish operation.
Although the Spanish economic environment remains challenging, 
our retail joint venture recorded another record year . On a constant 
currency basis, amounts staked increased by 47% to €223m and net 
revenue by 54 % to €42.6m. We also produced a strong World Cup 
performance with stakes up 1 60% and retail net revenue up 1 83% 
on  the 2010 tournament. 
EUROPEAN RETAIL CONTINUED
We have also pushed ahead with our jointly owned digital brand 
Sportium.es which we launched in December last year on Playtech 
technology creating the largest multi-channel betting offering in Spain, 
(results of which are recorded in our ‘Other regulated operations’ 
Digital segment). Our ongoing investment and necessary start up 
costs in both the retail and digital business means we expect to 
generate a further start up loss in 201 5 but we remain on track to 
deliver profitability in 201 6. 
As at 31 December 201 4 there were a total of 1 , 1 92 outlets where 
Sportium services are available up from 753 on 31 December 201 3.
In 201 5, Sportium will continue to expand its Spanish retail presence 
within new and existing regions during 201 4. Digital channels in Spain 
also expect to continue to see good growth in 201 5 with the regulatory

WELL PLACED IN OUR MARKETPLACE
Our international businesses are part of us building 
a stronger Ladbrokes through giving us sustainable 
income from regulated jurisdictions outside of the UK. 
Belgium and Spain are good examples. In Belgium 
we are the market leader in retail and in 2014 built on 
our position through innovation. We have introduced 
SSBTs to our shops alongside virtual products in a first 
for the market and we have rolled out a multi-channel 
offer. The reaction has been good and gives us belief 
that there is much more to come.
Spain is another example of gradually building a 
significant presence and profitable business. In Spain, 
our partnership with Cirsa has created Sportium and 
as the market has gradually opened up we have been 
rolling out our retail and digital offer. In 2014 we entered 
Catalunya in the number one position, building on the 
back of our leading position in Madrid. We are seeing 
good growth in retail and digital, the business is strong 
and with smaller regions to regulate in 2015, further 
opportunities await.

Although Ireland’s economy continues to improve we have seen 
a  decline in profitability reflecting continuing highly competitive 
conditions in the Republic of Ireland. Northern Ireland showed similar 
revenue trends to the UK Retail business and performed somewhat 
better on costs.
On a constant currency basis, amounts staked declined 5.6% 
reflecting challenging market conditions in the Republic of Ireland and 
the continuing decline in traditional products we have seen in the UK. 
Football staking however , was up over 1 6%. Overall net revenue 
decreased by 7 .4 %. 
We have continued to invest in the customer offer within our Irish 
business and have increased the number of SSBT s and range of 
virtual product. A further drive for efficiency , principally from shop 
scheduling improvements and a reduction in head office and 
property  costs, meant that operating costs were broadly flat on 201 3.
Operating profit
(1)
 in Ireland at £4.4m was 56.8% lower than in 201 4 
on  a constant currency basis.
At 31 December 201 4 there were 79 shops in Northern Ireland 
(31  December 201 3: 79) and 1 96 shops (31 December 201 3: 21 6) 
in  the Republic of Ireland.
We have tasked our International team to undertake a fundamental 
review of our Republic of Ireland business during Q1 201 5 to establish 
options to take this business forward.

TRADING SUMMARY
Revenue recognition – reconciliation to gross win
The Group reports the gains and losses on all betting and gaming 
activities as revenue, which is measured at  the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable from customers less fair value 
adjustment for free bets, promotions and bonuses. Gross win includes 
free bets, promotions and bonuses, as  well as VA T payable on 
machine income. 
A reconciliation of gross win to revenue for continuing operations is 
shown below.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
30 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Strategic report Group revenue increased by £56.9m (5. 1 %) to £1 , 1 7 4.6m 
(201 3:  £1 , 1 1 7 .7 m). Excluding High Rollers, revenue increased 
by  £47 .7 m (4.3%) to £1 , 1 58.9m (201 3: £1 , 1 1 1 .2m). The  increase is 
attributable to the World Cup which contributed additional £23.7 m, 
full  year effect of Bookmaker and the Betstar acquisition during 
the  year in Australia added £30.6m and continued strength of 
machines within the UK Retail estate with net revenue increasing 
£23.6m. This  was partially offset by customer friendly results 
across  all  divisions, weakness in the horse product in UK Retail 
and  a  decline in Gaming within Digital.
Operating profit
(1)
Operating profit decreased by £4.6m or 3.2% to £1 39.6m 
(2013: £144.2m). 
Excluding High Rollers, operating profit decreased by £1 2.9m or  9.3% 
to £1 25.4m (201 3: £1 38.3m) with reduced profits from UK  Retail and 
European Retail, partially offset by increased profit in Digital  and Core 
T elephone Betting. There was  also an increase in corporate costs.
Corporate costs
Before exceptional items, total corporate costs increased by 
£5. 1 m  to  £22.9m (201 3: £1 7 .8m). The increase is primarily due to a 
higher share based payments charge and the 201 3  comparative 
benefitting from a £2.7 m credit from Hilton hotel guarantees. 
Finance expense 
Before exceptional items, net finance expense of £27 .4m was £2.4m 
higher than last year (201 3: £25.0m) mainly due to an  increase in the 
net debt.
Profit before tax 
The reduction in trading profits has resulted in a 5.9% decrease in 
profit  from continuing operations before taxation and exceptional 
items  to £1 1 2.2m (201 3: £1 1 9.2m).
Exceptional items before tax
T otal exceptional items before tax of £7 4.5m (201 3: £5 1 .6m) comprises 
the following:
 – £44.5m of asset impairments comprises £20.8m of shop 
impairment and £23.7m impairment of IT assets principally 
arising as a result of the decision to decommission a platform 
for desktop Sportsbook;
 – £30.7m loss on closure of shops in UK and European Retail;
 – £3.8m relating to early termination of contractual commitments 
within jurisdictions where we have closed our Digital operations 
in the year;
 – £0.5m of corporate transaction costs associated with the 
acquisition of Betstar Pty;
 – A credit of £(4.8)m in relation to the net curtailment gain on 
closure of the defined benefit pension plan to future accrual;
 – A credit of £(3. 1)m relating to the re-measurement of the contingent 
considerations in relation to business combinations from 2013; 
 – A profit on the sale and leaseback of freehold shops in the UK 
Retail estate of £(3.9)m;
 – A provision for potential European indirect tax liabilities of £5.7m; and
 – £1. 1m within exceptional finance expense including £0.6m relating 
to the write off of arrangement fees asset following the re-financing 
of the Group’s committed facilities and £0.5m interest on the 
repayment of output VAT on amusement machines to the HMRC.
T axation
The Group taxation charge before exceptional items was £5.6m. 
This  represents an effective tax charge of 5.0% (201 3: 5. 1 %). There 
was a tax credit of £8.9m in relation to exceptional items in 201 4 
(201 3:  £5.5m credit).
Dividend
The Board announces a final dividend of 4.60 pence per share 
(201 3:  4.60 pence per share) taking the full year dividend to 8.90 pence 
per share (201 3: 8.90 pence per share).
The dividend will be payable on 1 4 May 201 5 to shareholders on the 
register on 27 March 201 5.
Earnings per share (EPS) – Group
Underlying
EPS (before exceptional items and High Rollers) decreased by 1 3. 7% to 
1 0. 1 pence (201 3: 1 1 . 7 pence), reflecting the decreased profit before tax.
T otal
EPS (before exceptional items) decreased by 5.7% to 1 1 .6 pence 
(201 3: 1 2.3 pence), reflecting the decreased profit before tax. 
EPS  (including the impact of exceptional items) was 4.4 pence 
(201 3:  7 .3 pence). Fully diluted EPS (including the impact of 
exceptional  items) was 4.4 pence (201 3: 7 .2 pence) after adjustment 
for outstanding share options and other potentially issuable shares. 
Cash flow, capital expenditure, borrowings and 
banking facilities
Cash generated by operations was £1 59.0m. After net finance 
expense paid of £26.4m, income taxes paid of £2. 1 m, £59.9m 
on  capital expenditure and intangible additions, £10.4m spent 
on  business combinations and £5.2m cash inflow from sale and 
leaseback of freehold properties; cash inflow was  £65.4m. After 
dividend payment of £81 .4m and other net cash outflow of £4.6m, 
net  debt at the end of the period increased by £20.6m. The Group 
expects to invest c.£60m in  capital expenditures in 201 5 and for 
depreciation and amortisation to be between £80m and £82m.
At 31 December 201 4, gross borrowings of £439.3m less the net of 
cash and short term deposits of £21 . 1 m and bank overdraft of £(1 .0)m 
resulted in a net debt of £4 1 9.2m (31  December 201 3: £398.6m).
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors considered 
the  Group’s business activities, the financial position of the Group 
and  the  Group’s financial risk management objectives and policies. 
The  directors consider that the Group has adequate resources 
to  continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and 
that  it  is  therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing its financial statements.

The risks outlined here are those principal risks that are material to the 
Group. They do not include all those associated with Group activities 
and are not set out in any order of priority . Additional risks not presently 
known to management, or currently deemed less material may also 
have an adverse effect on the business including
 – Marketplace and Operational – changes in the economic 
environment, changes in consumer leisure spend and 
international expansion.
 –Financial – availability of debt financing and costs of borrowing,

BETTING AND GAMING INDUSTRY
T axes, laws, regulations and licensing, regulatory compliance Regulatory 
Leadership
Regulatory, legislative and fiscal regimes for betting and 
gaming in key markets around the world can change, 
sometimes at short notice. Such changes could benefit 
or have an adverse effect on Ladbrokes and additional 
costs might be incurred in order to comply with any new 
laws or regulations.
Regulatory, legislative and fiscal developments in key 
markets are monitored closely, allowing Ladbrokes to 
assess and adapt quickly to changes in the environment 
and minimise risks to the business. Ladbrokes engages 
with its regulators and the relevant trade organisations with 
regard to the betting and gaming regulatory framework and 
other issues of shared concern, such as problem gambling. 
Ladbrokes has entered into a voluntary code of practice and 
has established a Social Responsibility Committee. 
Increased cost of product Digital Capability  
and Retail  
Excellence
Ladbrokes is subject to certain financing arrangements 
intended to support industries from which it profits. 
Examples are the horseracing and the voluntary 
greyhound racing levies which respectively support the 
British horseracing and greyhound industries. In addition, 
Ladbrokes enters into contracts for the distribution of 
television pictures, audio and other data that are 
broadcast into Ladbrokes’ betting shops. A number 
of these are under negotiation at any one time.
Ladbrokes engages with the relevant trade associations 
and the principal bodies of sport and event industries with 
regard to sports rights payments, including the statutory 
horseracing levy, animal welfare and other issues.
OPERATIONAL AND BOOKMAKING
Trading, liability management and pricing Pricing, Trading  
and Liability 
Management
Ladbrokes may experience significant losses as a result 
of a failure to determine accurately the odds in relation 
to any particular event and/or any failure of its risk 
management processes.
Ladbrokes’ core expertise is risk management and it has 
developed the skills and systems to be able to offer a wide 
range of betting opportunities and accept large bets. There 
is in place a highly experienced trading team and risks are 
spread across a wide range of events. A bookmaker’s odds 
are determined so as to provide an average return to the 
bookmaker over a large number of events and therefore, 
over the long-term, Ladbrokes’ gross win percentage has 
remained fairly constant.
Loss of key locations All
Ladbrokes has a number of key sites, in particular 
Imperial House at Rayners Lane in London, its head 
office and main operations centre, its premises at 
Europort in Gibraltar from where online betting and 
gaming operations are based, and in Tel Aviv, Israel 
from where our Digital marketing operates.
Existing business continuity plans and arrangements 
for offsite data storage, alternate system availability and 
remote working for key operational and senior management 
continue to be developed and refined as part of an 
ongoing review process.

and we need a high level of competence across the 
business to meet our objectives and respond to  
changing market needs.
Performance Management, Development, Reward and 
Recognition systems are all constantly reviewed and 
updated to marry business needs with best practice. 
An increasingly important part is being played by formal, 
biannual Talent Management and Succession Plan reviews.
Ladbrokes undertook its latest Colleague Engagement 
Survey in 2014 and will implement action plans throughout 
2015/16 to address areas for improvement.
A process is under way to identify a successor for the 
Chief Executive following the announcement on succession 
planning. The search will evaluate both internal and external 
candidates. 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND COMMUNICATIONS
T echnology failure Digital Capability and 
Retail Excellence 
Ladbrokes’ operations are highly dependent on 
technology and advanced information systems and 
there is a risk that such technology or systems could fail. 
In particular, any damage to, or failure of online systems 
and servers, electronic point of sale systems and 
electronic display systems could result in interruptions 
to financial controls and customer service systems.
Ladbrokes has a level of resilience in place which 
seeks to eliminate single points of failure within key 
technology locations.
Data management Digital Capability, 
Retail Excellence, 
Customer and Brand
Ladbrokes process sensitive personal customer data 
(including name, address, age, bank details and betting 
and gaming history) as part of its business and therefore 
must comply with strict data protection and privacy laws 
in all jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Ladbrokes 
is exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully 
appropriated, lost or disclosed, or processed in breach 
of data protection regulation. This could also result in 
prosecutions and the loss of the goodwill of its 
customers and deter new customers.
Security systems are deployed to protect transactional data. 
Sophisticated hardware and security mechanisms are used 
to ensure all sensitive and confidential data is fully encrypted.
To provide fail-safe integrity of all data, a series of storage 
systems are used to replicate all data processed by online 
services. In respect of fraud protection, an extensive 
programme of data monitoring is in place with both 
prevention and detection audit controls.
An independent review was undertaken on our cyber 
resilience and supporting our approach, a steering 
group has been formed to drive through changes to 
ensure we have sufficient maturity.

technologies effectively, develop its technological 
expertise, enhance its products and services and improve 
the performance, features and reliability of its technology 
and advanced information systems, could have a 
material adverse effect on its competitive position.
Ladbrokes has invested and committed considerable 
resources into upgrading its existing technology, IT 
infrastructure, communication systems and application 
systems, as well as developing and acquiring new platforms. 
Rigorous testing regimes are utilised to ensure that a

Ladbrokes is dependent on a number of third parties 
for the operation of its business. The withdrawal or 
removal from the market of one or more of these major 
third party suppliers, or failure of third party suppliers to 
comply with contractual obligations could adversely 
affect Ladbrokes’ operations.
Infrastructure suppliers, network and telecommunication 
suppliers and application service providers are long-term 
partners in providing an infrastructure which seeks to 
ensure the delivery of sophisticated and high performance 
transaction processing systems. There is continual 
communication with these suppliers and providers at an 
operating level and service level agreements have been 
established to maintain high service levels. The ongoing 
review of business continuity plans includes key supplier 
alternatives and the introduction of a new SRM platform.
MARKETPLACE
Competition Digital Capability and
Retail Excellence
Ladbrokes faces competition primarily from other 
land-based bookmakers, online betting exchanges 
and other online gambling operators. In particular, the 
online gambling market is characterised by intense and 
substantial competition and by relatively low barriers to 
entry for new participants. In addition, Ladbrokes faces 
competition from market participants who benefit from 
greater liquidity as a result of accepting bets and wagers 
from jurisdictions in which Ladbrokes chooses not to 
operate (because of legal reasons or otherwise).
Ladbrokes’ performance and competitive position 
are continuously monitored and, where appropriate, 
changes are instituted, including in relation to marketing, 
product development, yield management, cost 
control and investment. Acquisition opportunities, 
with a view to taking advantage of market consolidation, 
are continuously evaluated.

ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND 
OPERATING WITH INTEGRITY. 
FAIR PLAY
LEADING THE WAY IN RESPONSIBLE BETTING AND GAMING
At Ladbrokes, we have always placed great emphasis on being a 
responsible company , pushing for high standards within our sector . 
In  an industry undergoing rapid change, our view is that trust never 
goes out of fashion. The continued scrutiny of the role of betting 
companies in society has prompted us, and the sector as a whole, 
to  raise the game further . We have embraced the regulatory and 
voluntary changes at the sector -level while also progressing our own 
initiatives, over and above the expectations of our stakeholders.
Research suggests that problem gambling is a complex issue and 
the  number of problem gamblers will not decrease by focusing on 
one  element alone. That is why we have put in place a multi-faceted 
strategy which we will evolve in the years to come. We are fully 
aligned  with the GB Gambling Commission’s objectives to ensure 
that gambling:
 – is crime free;
 – fair and open; and
 – children and vulnerable people are protected.
Our activities are coordinated by a Head of Responsible Gambling, 
appointed in 201 3, whose work is supported by colleagues across 
the  business. In 201 4, we created several new roles within our 
customer and integrity teams to help us maintain our leading position 
as a responsible company .
T aking our responsibilities seriously
In July 201 4 we established a new Board Committee to oversee 
our  delivery against our responsible gambling objectives. The Social 
Responsibility (SR) Committee comprises of Senior Independent 
Director , John Kelly (Chair), and non-executive director , Christine 
Hodgson, with Chairman, Peter Erskine, and the Chief Executive, in 
attendance. The Committee brings responsible gambling firmly into 
the Boardroom and has produced a set of KPIs that will help us link 
executive remuneration with responsible gambling performance from 
201 5 onwards. This is a major step for us and a first within the sector .
Advertising responsibly
During 201 4 we publicly committed to a set of voluntary measures 
to  make our advertising more responsible. The initiative includes 
a  ban  on  advertising sign-up offers on TV before 9pm, dedicating 
20%  of our shop window advertising space to responsible gambling 
messages and to the removal of gaming machine advertising 
from  shop windows. We also launched the UK’s first dedicated 
TV  ad  to  promote responsible gambling with no promotional or 
sales  messages. This formed part of our new ‘Ladbrokes Life’ 
campaign, which adopted a  markedly less aggressive tone than 
other betting advertising.

Strategic report ON TRACK...
WITH RESPONSIBLE GAMING
Using algorithms to detect problem gambling 
In December 2014 we embarked on a pilot study to 
track customer behaviour and intervene when we 
suspect problem gambling might be occurring. Using 
data from Odds On cards, we systematically assess the 
gambling habits of approximately 8,000 shop customers 
on a weekly basis. We defined a set of rules that may 
indicate a player showing signs of problem gambling 
and monitor individual players’ behaviour against these. 
If a customer’s gambling patterns trigger the algorithm, 
we message the person about their status and how to 
stay in control. At the same time, we have tested the 
effectiveness of the intervention against a control group 
of customers in a different region. We still have a lot to 
learn, but we believe this type of player protection 
arrangement is promising. During 2015, we will dedicate 
more resources to the trial, expanding the coverage, 
experimenting with different ways of intervening and 
teaming up with external partners for greater insights.
We were founding members of the Senet Group, a new self-regulatory 
body dedicated to promoting responsible gambling standards and 
to  ensure that the marketing of gambling is socially responsible. 
Fully  operational from January 201 5, the Senet Group will be able to 
‘name and shame’ or impose fines on operators in breach of industry 
standards. It will also launch the first cross-operator campaign to 
promote responsible gambling in early 201 5.
Minimising harm
We helped develop the Association of British Bookmakers (ABB) 
Code on Responsible Gambling and Player Protection in 201 3, 
the  first  of its kind worldwide. This year we invested much effort in 
implementing it across our business. This will also be a key priority 
for  201 5. The Code highlights four areas for improved performance:
 – Providing adequate information on how to gamble responsibly;
 – Providing tools to help customers better control their activity;
 – Training staff to detect signs of potential problems; and
 – Undertaking central analysis of data to spot signs of 
abnormal activity.
We have stepped up the promotion of responsible gambling 
messages. As part of this, we have introduced more prominent, 
more  frequent and clearer messages on staying in control in our 
shops, on our machines and across our digital estate.
During 201 4 all employees in the UK shop estate completed our 
‘Positive Interaction’ programme. This training helps colleagues 
understand player behaviour , interact on the shop floor and 
intervene  if  they spot any signs of problem gambling. In addition, 
‘Positive Interaction’ covers aspects such as dealing with anti-social 
behaviour , managing voluntary spend limits and completing self-
exclusion agreements.
We provide tools to help customers stay in control of their gambling 
experience. For example, customers using our gaming machines can 
set their own voluntary spend or time limits and will receive mandatory 
time- and money-based alerts. Notifications also appear behind the 
shop counter , prompting colleagues to interact with customers and to 
identify any potential problem gamblers. 
Over the past year , we have invested significant resources in 
developing digital insights into problem gambling patterns. Using data 
from our Odds On loyalty cards and working with external partners, 
we aim not only to detect and intervene when problem gambling 
occurs, but to identify the trajectories that lead to such behaviour . 
If  we  believe a customer is on a trajectory towards harm, then we will 
interact with them to try and prevent this from happening.
Supporting research, education and treatment
During 201 3 and 201 4, together with our four largest peers within 
the  industry , we made our gaming machine data available for analysis 
by  independent researchers. In analysing data from 6.7 billion bets 
across  8,297 shops, this was the first time an independent, large scale 
research project into problem gambling had been undertaken in 
Great  Britain. The findings were published in late 201 4 and will be 
used  to inform our responsible gambling strategy and our discussions 
with key stakeholders. 
We also promote multiple harm minimisation initiatives through our 
support of the Responsible Gambling T rust (RGT). Organisations that 
benefitted from RGT funding in 201 4 included GamCare, the National 
Problem Gambling Clinic (CNWL) and the Gordon Moody Association. 
Our total contribution to RGT amounted to £682,500 in 201 4.
39 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Keeping our data safe
As an increasingly digital business, we hold large amounts of data on 
our customers, business partners and employees. Safeguarding this 
data and ensuring data privacy remain a high priority to us. During 
201 4, we stepped up our efforts using the UK Government’s ‘10 Steps 
to Cyber Security’ framework. Following an independent assessment 
of our systems and processes, we have a programme in place to 
manage cyber risks, now and in the future.
Measuring our performance
External benchmarking is an important means of comparing our 
performance with that of our peers. For the 1 2
th
 consecutive year 
we  remain a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), 
an elite index for responsible companies. We are the only European 
betting company included in the prestigious World Index, achieving 
maximum scores of 100% for our approach to responsible gambling 
and our anti-crime measures. Since 2002 we have also been a 
member of FTSE4Good. This year we were ranked in the 99th 
percentile of companies in our industry segment, achieving maximum 
scores for customer responsibility and corporate governance.
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES
Being a good employer
We are an inclusive, people-driven business. As our international 
operations grow, we recognise the need to spot, retain and promote 
talent from a variety of backgrounds. In 201 4, we launched our 
‘Females in Leadership’ programme to increase the number of 
women in senior positions. Having completed a survey and a 
benchmarking exercise, we are setting up a mentoring scheme to 
nurture talent and are working to increase the visibility of female role 
models. During 201 5, we also developed a consistent grading, talent 
and performance and reward framework to help us achieve our global 
ambitions. Our policies remain consistent with the requirements of the 
Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the spirit of the 
International Labour Organization core labour standards.
Providing meaningful employment
Now in its second year , Ladbrokes’ UK-wide apprenticeship 
scheme  has gone from strength to strength. We received over 
1 4,500  applications to join the scheme in 201 4, with a selection 
of  467  eventually joining us. We lifted the maximum age-restriction 
of  24  years so that any talented candidate can secure a place. 
The  1 2-month, fully  supported development programme provides 
candidates with accredited training in customer service, literacy and 
numeracy and responsible gambling. Upon completion, successful 
apprentices obtain an NVQ Level 2 in Customer Service and a position 
in one of our  shops.

Strategic report Partnering against crime and anti-social behaviour
Reducing crime and anti-social behaviour remains a key priority for us. 
Where possible, we work in partnership with local authorities and other 
bodies to make this happen. Our partners include Crimestoppers, 
the  Association of Business Crime Partnerships and the Safe Bet 
Alliance (SBA). We continue to support the SBA ’s Voluntary Code 
of  Safety & Security – National Standards for Bookmakers, which 
we  helped review and update in 201 4. In recognition of the results 
achieved in reducing violent crime, the SBA was formally endorsed 
by  the Association of Chief Police Officers in June 201 4. Police figures 
obtained by the Association of British Bookmakers show that 
betting  shops now have some of the lowest levels of crime among 
high  street retailers.
Valuing safety and well-being in the workplace
We place great emphasis on health and safety (H&S) across our 
operations and monitor our performance on a monthly basis. 
During  201 4, we reviewed our approach to supporting colleagues 
involved in  critical incidents at work, ensuring they receive the correct 
level of  support, rapidly and consistently . We  have pioneered Primary 
Authority relationships in this area, working closely with Liverpool City 
Council on general H&S and fire safety . Such partnerships ensure 
consistency in enforcement and regulation while bringing cost benefits 
to both regulators and ourselves.
A major contributor
According to research from 201 3, the UK betting industry directly 
accounts for £2.3 billion toward GDP and 38,800 full-time equivalent 
jobs. The broader economic footprint of the sector amounts to 
£5  billion and around 100,000 full-time equivalent jobs in total. 
Ladbrokes employs over  1 4,400 people across 1 4 countries, 
contributing substantially to  the communities in which we do business. 
In  201 4, we paid £258.2m in  wages and salaries, of which £230m 
was  in the UK. We spent an  additional £2.7 m on sponsorships, 
creating benefits for  the wider  economy .
Paying our taxes
At Ladbrokes, we recognise the importance of taxes as a major 
revenue stream for governments and the vital services they perform. 
In  this respect, we are committed to:
 – Complying with and following the law in all countries of operation;
 – Being transparent in our reporting of tax affairs to all our 
stakeholders, meeting all regulatory requirements and reflecting 
best practice;
 – Engaging proactively and openly with local and national tax 
authorities; 
 – Driving sustainable returns for our shareholders.
During the year we paid over £21 m in taxes to local councils in the  UK 
and generated a further £233m in taxes to the UK T reasury and the 
greyhound and horseracing industries. We paid an additional £27 m in 
taxes throughout the world. In summary , our effective tax-rate on 
profits amounts to 7 1 .5%, which is far higher than for other non-betting 
retail companies.
Ladbrokes participates in the T otal T ax Contribution survey by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , a  benchmarking exercise comparing 
the total tax contribution of the biggest companies in the UK. 
The  201 4  survey ranked Ladbrokes 32
nd
  for its taxes borne in the 
UK  out of 103  companies taking part in  the assessment.
OPERATING WITH INTEGRITY
As with any major business, our activities have an impact on the 
environment. Our main impact is caused by the electricity and gas 
used on our premises. Fossil fuel consumption emits greenhouse 
gases  (GHG) which contribute to climate change. Climate change 
in  turn poses a risk to our business, especially as we expand into 
overseas markets.
Our carbon footprint
Unfortunately our GHG emissions increased by 1 1 % in 201 4. This 
is  primarily because of the adjusted emission factor for the UK Grid 
Electricity , which is beyond our control. The energy usage of our GB 
shop estate increased by 4 %, mainly due to 201 4 being the UK’s 
warmest year since records began in 1 910. Despite the increase, since 
initiating our ambitious energy-reduction programme in 2008, we have 
reduced our GB GHG emissions by 20%. Our plans to convert all our 
UK shops to LED lighting, replacing over 98,000 fittings, regrettably 
had to  be postponed. This will now take place in 201 5 and we fully 
expect our energy consumption to decrease in the years to come.

Our CR Report contains further details on Fair Play at Ladbrokes. 
Our  full disclosure and supporting documents are available at  
http://www.ladbrokesplc.com/corporate-responsibility.
Ladbrokes is a proud constituent of the following indices
(1) Based on 2014 UK Defra GHG reporting guidance and conversion factors and includes 
Scope 1: direct emissions from the combustion of fuel and Scope 2: indirect emissions from 
the purchase of electricity. 2013 data restated due to better data.
(2) Emissions from our global operations include those arising from our businesses in the UK, 
Ireland, Belgium, Gibraltar and Spain. Data for our recently acquired businesses in Australia, 
Israel and the Philippines is not included. It is estimated (based pro-rata on headcount) that 
this will increase our global GHG emissions by no more than an additional 0.5%.
(3) Excluding fugitive emissions from refrigerants, which represent less than 2% of GHG emissions 
from our business operations.
(4) Excluding High Rollers.

43 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
In 201 4 the Company complied with all of the provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’) published in 201 2 by the 
Financial Reporting Council which is available at www.frc.org.uk. In 
September 201 4 the Financial Reporting Council published a revised 
version of the Code effective for accounting periods beginning on 
or  after 1 October 201 4. The Company will report formally under the 
Code’s new requirements in its 201 5 Annual Report. 
BOARD
Role
The Board provides strategic leadership and oversight. It is 
responsible for the Company’s culture, values and ethical standards 
and is committed to high standards of corporate governance 
throughout the Group’s operations. 
Each director brings experience, independence of character and 
judgement to their role. The independent non-executive directors 
bring a broad perspective to the deliberations of the Board. They 
support the development of the Group’s strategic direction, provide 
critical and constructive challenge to the executive directors and 
exercise oversight through their participation in the work of the 
Board’s  principal committees on matters such as remuneration, 
risk  management systems, financial controls and financial reporting. 
Composition
The Board’s composition includes the Chairman, two executive 
directors and six independent non-executive directors.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the Chief 
Executive has been clearly established, set out in writing and agreed 
by the Board.
 – The Chairman has a primary responsibility for the running of the 
Board and for relations with shareholders.
 – The Chief Executive is responsible for operations and for the 
development of strategic plans and initiatives for consideration 
by the Board.
The significant commitments of the Chairman are contained in his 
biography on page 42. There were no significant changes to those 
commitments during 201 4.
John Kelly acts as Senior Independent Director . The role of Senior 
Independent Director is to provide a sounding board to the Chairman 
and to serve as an intermediary for the other directors where 
necessary . The Senior Independent Director is also available to 
shareholders if they have concerns, where contact through the 
usual  channels of Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial 
Officer has failed to solve, or for which such contact is inappropriate.
DIVERSITY
The Company recognises the value that diversity brings to its 
Boardroom and believes that the Board performs better and supports 
its overall objectives within the business strategy when it includes 
the  best people representing a range of capabilities, experience and 
perspectives. In line with this, the Company aims to foster a diverse 
Board, including a mix of gender , ethnicity and backgrounds. The 
report of the Nomination Committee on pages 48 and 49 contains 
further information on Board composition and diversity .

BOARD SUPPORT
The Company has systems in place to ensure that the Board is supplied 
with appropriate and timely information to enable it to discharge its 
duties. A fully encrypted electronic Board Portal is used to distribute 
Board and Committee papers and to provide efficient distribution of 
business updates and other resources to the Board. Board members 
request additional information or variations to regular reporting as 
required. A procedure exists for directors to seek independent 
professional advice in the furtherance of their duties, if necessary .
The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board through 
the Chairman on all governance matters.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary . All directors receive an induction on joining the Board. 
A  combination of tailored Board and committee agenda items and 
other Board activities, including briefing sessions, assist the directors 
in continually updating their skills and the knowledge and familiarity 
with the Company required to fulfil their role both on the Board and on 
Board committees. In addition, external seminars, workshops and 
presentations are made available to directors. The Company provides 
the necessary resources for developing and updating directors’ 
knowledge and capabilities.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
44 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Governance BOARD EVALUATION
An annual formal Board evaluation is undertaken focusing on the 
performance of the Board and of its committees and individual 
directors. In 201 4 the evaluation was externally facilitated by Lintstock 
Limited. Lintstock has no other connection with the Company . The 
evaluation exercise used questionnaires tailored to the requirements 
and specific circumstances of the Company . The questionnaires were 
completed by each director in relation to their own performance and 
on the effectiveness of the Board and its committees.
The evaluation is thematic and considers:
 – Board composition, expertise and dynamics; 
 – Board support and time management; 
 – Board committees;
 – Strategic oversight;
 – Risk management and internal control;
 – Succession planning and human resources management; and
 – Priorities for change.
The Chairman conducts an appraisal of each director . The Senior 
Independent Director , having consulted with each of the other 
directors, conducts an appraisal interview with the Chairman. The 
results of the evaluation are considered by the Board and the individual 
committees and actions arising are agreed.
The Board’s 201 4 evaluation highlighted a number of areas of focus, 
including:
 – Reviewing the structure and content of papers presented to 
the Board;
 – Increasing the proportion of time at meetings devoted to 
discussions on strategic issues and a range of specific topics;
 – Increased focus on the Group’s risk management process, 
principal risks and key dependencies; 
 – Greater exposure to senior management and more engagement 
in the evaluation of the Group’s talent pool.
An update on progress in these areas will be provided in the 201 5 
Annual Report.

standing committees which manage routine operating and regulatory 
matters. These committees generally comprise any two of the 
Chairman and executive directors. 
The Finance Committee meets as required to deal with all routine 
business (excluding matters that are specifically reserved to the Board 
or to another committee) and specific matters delegated to it by the 
Board requiring attention between scheduled Board meetings. 
The Disclosure Committee meets on an ad hoc basis to consider 
and  make decisions relating to the handling of inside information 
concerning the Company and the Group. 
The Disclosure Committee is responsible for ensuring the timely and 
accurate disclosure of inside information to the market in accordance 
with the Company’s obligations under the FCA ’s Disclosure and 
T ransparency Rules and for monitoring compliance with the 
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures.
Attendance at meetings of the Finance Committee and Disclosure

In addition, the Executive Committee, Risk Committee, Investment 
Committee, and Compliance Committee referred to elsewhere are not 
formal Board committees.
FINANCIAL REPORTING, INTERNAL CONTROL AND  
RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the internal control and risk 
management systems operating throughout the Group and for 
reviewing their effectiveness. No such systems can provide absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Group’s 
systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives and to provide the Board with 
reasonable assurance that potential problems will normally be 
prevented or will be detected in a timely manner for appropriate action.
The Board as a whole is responsible for ensuring that the annual report 
is fair , balanced and understandable. The Board has reviewed the 
annual report 201 4 and, taken as a whole, considers it to be fair , 
balanced and understandable and provides shareholders with 
information necessary to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy . In arriving at this conclusion, the Board’s 
review draws on its collective knowledge of the business, which is 
regularly updated by management reports and presentations at 
scheduled Board and Committee meetings and other business 
updates provided between meetings.
45 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The Company had procedures in place throughout the year and up to 
25 February 201 5, the date of approval of this Annual Report, which 
accord with the Internal Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the 
Combined Code published in October 2005.
The Board has delegated the detailed design of the systems of internal 
control and risk management to the executive directors.
Control framework
The control framework and key procedures during 201 4 in relation to 
the financial reporting process were as follows:
The Group operates through two primary Business Channels and 
four  Business Support Units:
Operations
Business Support
Information 
Technology
Trading, 
Pricing and 
Liability 
Management
Human 
Resources
Finance and 
Development
Retail Digital
There is an Executive Head responsible for each of these Business 
Channels and Business Support Units.
Business planning
Corporate strategy and Group-wide business objectives are reviewed 
annually by the Board and the Group profit plan is approved by the 
Board. The Business Support Unit management integrate Group-
wide objectives into business strategies for presentation to the Board 
with supporting financial objectives. Operating plans for each 
Business Support Unit comprise financial and operating targets, 
capital expenditure proposals and performance indicators and are 
reviewed by the Executive Committee.
Reporting and oversight
The Chief Executive and the Executive Heads comprise the Executive 
Committee and meet monthly to consider Group strategy , financial 
performance, business development and management issues. Other 
senior executives participate as appropriate. In addition, there are 
weekly and monthly financial and operational review meetings 
together with an annual programme of plan/reforecasting and strategy 
reviews attended by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer 
together with, as appropriate, other Executive Heads and executives.
The Board regularly receives reports from Executive Heads covering 
areas such as operations, forecasts, business development, strategic 
planning, human resources, legal and corporate matters, compliance, 
health and safety and corporate responsibility .
Investment
There is a Group-wide policy governing appraisal and approval 
of  investment expenditure and asset disposals. An Investment 
Committee comprising of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial 
Officer , consider all significant financial commitments, including past 
investment appraisals. Major projects are reported on at each 
scheduled Board meeting. Post-investment appraisals are 
undertaken on a systematic basis and are formally reviewed by 
the  Board twice yearly .
Risk
An ongoing process is in place for identifying, evaluating and 
managing the risks faced by the Group. Key risks and their financial 
implications are appraised by the Executive Committee which is 
assisted by a committee of Business Support Unit executives (the Risk 
Committee). This is an integral part of the strategic planning process. 
The appropriateness of controls is considered, having regard to cost/
benefit, materiality and the likelihood of risks crystallising. Key risks and 
actions to mitigate those risks are considered at Board meetings and 
are formally reviewed and approved by the Board twice yearly . Each 
key risk is assigned executive director/Executive Head ownership. A 
programme is underway to incorporate within the current control 
framework additional systems to establish and monitor risk appetite 
and tolerance, within the Group as a whole and at divisional/business 
unit level. The control framework will enhance the  Group’s existing risk 
management culture. 
Policies and controls
Key policies and control procedures (including treasury , compliance 
and information system controls) are documented and have Group-
wide application. There are also operating procedure manuals that 
are  integrated with Group-wide controls. High standards of business 
ethics and compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies are 
demanded from employees at all levels. T o underpin the effectiveness 
of controls, it is Group policy to recruit and develop management and 
other employees of high calibre, integrity and with appropriate 
disciplines. A system of annual self-certification of compliance with 
key  controls and procedures is operated throughout the Group.
The role of the Audit Committee in reviewing the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control and risk management is explained in the 
‘ Audit Committee’ section. The Group has an internal audit function, 
outsourced to Deloitte LLP , which reports to management and the 
Audit Committee on Group operations.
The Board also conducts an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
internal control and risk management systems. The assessment takes 
account of all significant aspects including: risk assessment; the 
control environment and control activities; information and 
communication; and monitoring.
ANTI-BRIBERY AND WHISTLEBLOWING POLICIES
The Board recognises that as a global betting and gaming business 
there is potential for exposure to bribery and corruption. Failure by 
employees, suppliers or agents to comply with anti-bribery and 
corruption legislation (including the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act), or any failure in policies and procedures to 
monitor and prevent non-compliance, anywhere in the world, could 
result in substantial penalties, criminal prosecution and significant 
damage to the reputation of the Company .
The Board ensures that there are a number of policies, procedures, 
management systems and internal controls in place across the 
business to prevent bribery and corruption occurring. This includes 
policies on whistleblowing, anti-bribery , gifts and hospitality , charitable 
donations and sponsorship. Supplementary audit, monitoring and 
review processes are designed to identify breaches of Group controls.
The whistleblowing policy enables and encourages employees to 
report in confidence any possible malpractice, impropriety or other 
matters of concern which may arise in the business. Any matters 
raised in accordance with the policy are investigated thoroughly and 
reports are provided at each meeting of the Audit Committee.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee monitors and reports to the Board on the 
integrity of the financial statements of the Company; reviews the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal financial control and risk 
management systems and internal audit function. It oversees the 
Company’s relationship with the external auditor , which includes 
assessing the auditor’s independence and making recommendations 
to the Board on the auditor’s appointment and remuneration. 
The members of the Committee that served during the year were:
Appointment date Committee role
Darren Shapland 16 February 2010 Chairman
John Kelly 1 September 2010 Member
Christine Hodgson 1 May 2012 Member
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive 
directors. Appointments to the Committee are made by the Board at

with the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
The Board has satisfied itself that the Committee’s membership 
includes directors with recent and relevant financial experience.
Meetings and attendance 2014

Committee meetings. The Committee met for private discussions with 
the external auditor , whose representatives attend all of its meetings, 
together with the internal auditor , Deloitte LLP .
Details of the number of Committee meetings held during the year and 
the attendance of Committee directors is shown below:

The Audit Committee has established a US sub-committee to oversee 
regulatory matters connected with the application for , and subsequent 
operation of, gaming licences in Nevada. The Committee would also 
have oversight of any additional licences arising from future 
opportunities in other US states with regulated (or looking to regulate) 
sports wagering or internet gaming activities. The membership of the 
sub-committee comprises Peter Erskine and Christine Hodgson. The 
Committee has met three times during 201 4 with both Peter Erskine 
and Christine Hodgson in attendance.
Committee support
The Committee is provided with sufficient resources to undertake its 
duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary (who 
acts as secretary to the Committee) and all other employees. The 
Committee is able to take independent legal or professional advice 
when it believes it necessary to do so.
The main activities of the Committee in 201 4 included:
 – oversight of the transition of external audit services from Ernst & 
Young LLP to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP: 
  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was appointed as auditor at the 
Annual General Meeting held on 7 May 2014 following a tender 
process conducted in October 2013. The Committee’s policy 
is to conduct a formal tender at least every ten years; 
 – the critical review of the significant financial reporting issues in 
connection with the preparation of the Company’s financial and 
related formal statements, with the assistance of reports received 
from management and the external auditor, including the process 
for assessing whether the going concern basis of accounting 
remains appropriate;
 – assessing the scope and effectiveness of the systems established 
to identify, assess, manage and monitor financial and non-financial 
risks;
 – monitoring the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
financial controls. The Committee does so by reference to:
(a) summaries of business risks and mitigating controls;
(b)  regular reports and presentations from the heads of key risk 
functions, internal audit and external audit; and
(c)  the results of the system of annual self-certification of compliance 
with key controls and procedures;
 – monitoring and reviewing the plans, work and effectiveness of the 
internal audit function, including any actions taken following any 
significant failures in internal controls;
 – reviewing, with the external auditor, its terms of engagement, the 
findings of its work, and at the end of the audit process reviewing 
its effectiveness; and
 – reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor.
47 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 The external auditor reports to the Committee on the actions taken 
to  comply with professional and regulatory requirements and with 
best  practice designed to ensure its independence. In addition, the 
Committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of external 
auditors for the provision of non-audit services which can be viewed 
at www.ladbrokesplc.com/investors. 
The policy sets out controls intended to ensure that the independence 
of the external auditor is not impaired and stipulates: 
 – the nature of non-audit services that are permitted to be performed 
by the external auditor;
 – levels of authority for management to engage the external auditor 
for approved non-audit services; and
 – that any non-audit services to be provided by the external auditor 
for a single project or specific services for fees in excess of 
£100,000 must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
Details of non-audit services are presented to the Committee for its 
review at each meeting. Fees for non-audit services provided by 
Ernst  & Y oung LLP in the year (up to the date it ceased to be auditor) 
amounted to £0. 1 m (201 3: £0.2m). Fees for non-audit services 
provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the year (from its 
appointment as Auditor on 7 May 201 4) amounted to £0.4m. The 
Committee is satisfied that the overall level of fees for non-audit services 
is not material in the context of the total fee income  received by the 
auditor and that the provision of approved non-audit services has not 
compromised the independence and objectivity of the external auditor .
The performance of the external auditor is reviewed by the 
Committee  on an annual basis through a qualitative assessment 
of  the  services provided against the agreed audit plan and taking 
account of feedback received from management. Following this 
review the Committee is satisfied that the external audit process 
operates effectively .
Accounting and key areas of judgement
The main areas considered by the Committee in relation to 201 4 are set out below:
Matter considered Action
T axation
Accounting for uncertain tax positions and the level of deferred tax 
asset recognition and disclosure in relation to accumulated tax losses 
are based on a series of judgements. These judgements have an 
impact on the corporation tax rate and recognition of deferred tax 
assets. In addition to the recognition, the Audit Committee also 
considered the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the 
Annual Report.
The Audit Committee received regular reports from management on the corporation tax rate 
as well as the judgements exercised in arriving at the corporation tax rate and the deferred tax 
recognised and disclosed. Assumptions underlying the positions taken on significant deferred 
tax assets were supported by reports from other tax, advisory and legal firms. The Committee 
discussed the key judgements in relation to both the uncertain tax positions and understood 
the basis on which deferred tax was recognised or disclosed. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
also reported on the tax position to management and the Audit Committee.
Accounting for acquisitions 
During the year, the Group has acquired the Betstar business 
in Australia. The recognition of goodwill, other assets and liabilities 
and estimates of the fair value of contingent consideration, 
are all based on a number of assumptions. The Audit Committee 
considered the valuation of the assets and liabilities, and challenged 
management’s assumptions that underpinned these.
Management is required to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration and to 
estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired, including any separate intangible 
assets. Management engaged Ernst & Young LLP to support this process.
The Committee has reviewed the valuation reports prepared by Ernst & Young LLP and 
management’s accounting papers on the acquisition. The accounting for the acquisition 
was also reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
Carrying value of long-lived assets 
In addition to the licences in the Retail estate, as a result of recent 
acquisitions and the significant level of investment in technology 
over the past three years, the Group has significant goodwill and 
other intangible assets which needed to be reviewed for impairment. 
The carrying value of all long-lived assets are tested for impairment annually.
The Audit Committee reviewed the methodology and the outcome of the various impairment 
review papers presented by management and reviewed the key assumptions in respect of 
each of the Retail and Digital businesses, understanding how these related to Board approved 
plans and forecasts. The Committee also reviewed analysis and support for the Group’s 
software assets and debated the basis for the impairments recorded. These have also been 
reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
Exceptional items 
The Group classifies certain items in the income statement 
as exceptional, to allow a clearer understanding of the trading 
performance on a consistent and comparable basis together 
with an understanding of the effect of non-recurring or large 
individual transactions upon the overall profitability of the Group.
The Committee has reviewed the items considered exceptional by management which have 
been discussed at each of the past four Audit Committee meetings. The Committee has 
challenged the appropriateness and classification of these items of costs as well as income as 
exceptional. Exceptional items have also been reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The Nomination Committee reviews and makes recommendations to 
the Board on: the composition of the Board, taking account of the 
balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity; succession 
planning for the directors and other senior executives; the search and 
nomination of candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they 
arise; candidates for the role of Senior Independent Director and for 
membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Social Responsibility 
Committees, in consultation with the Chairmen of those Committees; 
and makes recommendations to the Board concerning the directors 
standing for re-election by shareholders.

its  duties. It has access to the services of the Company Secretary 
(who  acts as secretary to the Committee) and all other employees. 
The  Committee is able to take independent legal and professional 
advice when it believes it necessary to do so.
Diversity
The Company has a well established and published equal 
opportunities policy that guides all colleagues in how they fairly deal 
with all colleagues and customers irrespective of age, gender , sexual 
orientation, religion, disability or ethnic origin. That policy applies on 
how people are selected to work at the Company and applies at all 
levels. The Company has a succession policy that ensures all key 
roles  including director positions are considered and the Company 
considers candidates for roles from the widest possible field. The 
Board regularly reviews succession arrangements for all key roles 
and  the Nomination Committee reviews succession arrangements 
for  directors. The Board’s Strategic report includes details of wider 
workforce gender diversity which are shown on page 40.
The Board endorses the aims of the Davies Report entitled ‘Women 
on Boards’ and when considering future appointments, with the 
support of the Nomination Committee, will aim to build on its current 
position. The Company currently has two women on the Board 
(Christine Hodgson and Sly Bailey) and therefore over 20% of the 
Board is  made up of women. The Company’s current aspiration is 
to  increase the percentage of women on the Board to 25% by 201 6 
and to continue to ensure appropriate representation by women, 
both  on the  Board and throughout the business, whilst at all times 
ensuring the  Company selects on merit. 
Committee activities
During 201 4 the Committee started a search to find a successor to 
Richard Glynn who is due to stand-down as Chief Executive Officer 
in  201 5. The Committee has appointed JCA Group and Korn Ferry 
to  assist with the Executive search process.
As part of the Committee’s support for fostering and developing talent 
and increasing diversity in the talent pool, members of the Committee 
have been involved with the Company’s newly established Females in 
Leadership Group. Committee members provide advice and support 
to this Group and the Chairman addressed the Group during the year 
on the topic of leadership. In addition, a programme of informal 
meetings and dinners has been arranged so that members of the 
Committee are able to meet and engage with the Group’s rising stars 
within the talent pool, providing opportunities for giving feedback, 
coaching and mentoring. 
The Committee considered the make-up of the Board Committees 
and recommended to the Board that David Martin would replace 
John  Jarvis as a member of the Nomination Committee on John 
Jarvis’ retirement from the Board at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting on 7 May 201 4. It also considered the composition 
of  the newly established Social Responsibility Committee and made 
recommendations to the Board on the Committee’s initial members. 
On 23 February 201 5, the Committee met to consider the output of the 
201 4 Board evaluation and in terms of candidates for re-election at the 
201 4 Annual General Meeting and the Board’s composition in terms 
of  size, experience and diversity . The Committee concluded that each 
of the current directors is devoting sufficient time to their duties and 
responsibilities and brings relevant skills and judgement to the work 
of  the Board. Each of the current directors, with the exception of 
Richard Glynn, will stand for election at the 201 5 Annual 
General Meeting.
SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY COMMITTEE
The Social Responsibility Committee reviews and advises the Board 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s strategy and policies for ensuring 
that the Group operates a socially responsible and sustainable 
business that protects the young, protects the vulnerable, and 
ensures  the business is not associated with crime and disorder 
and  that the Group’s reputational standing is maintained.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT The processes described in the section ‘Financial reporting, internal 
control and risk management systems’ on pages 45 and 46 applied to 
CR (including Human Rights issues as appropriate), as did the 
practices described on page 44 for ensuring the Board is supplied with 
appropriate and timely information and training and for assisting the 
directors to update their knowledge. In addition to business 
presentations regularly made to the Board at which CR was considered 
as appropriate, the Board conducts an annual CR review and Board 
members regularly receive CR updates. CR performance is included in 
business unit accountability systems and remuneration arrangements. 
The Remuneration Committee in determining executive remuneration 
takes  into account CR matters as described in the Directors’ 
remuneration report.
The risks and opportunities relating to CR in 201 4 and going forward 
primarily revolve around the reputation of the Group and the quality of 
its brands.
Of particular importance was the promotion of responsible gambling 
and the protection of children and the vulnerable. CR also impacted: a) 
the performance of the Group’ s employees on whom the Group relies 
for the provision of high quality services to customers; and b) the health 
and safety of these employees and the customers they serve. 
Performance indicators continued to be developed in accordance with 
Group-wide CR. No breaches of CR policies and procedures material 
to the Group were identified by the Board in 201 4.
The identification and management of CR issues, the CR reporting 
framework and any associated data has been reviewed by the 
Company’ s CR adviser , Carnstone Partners LLP .
Details of the Group’ s disclosure of its greenhouse gas emissions are 
set out in the Group’ s strategic report on page 40.
Employee policies
The Board values two-way communication between senior 
management and employees on all aspects of the Company’ s strategy , 
Company performance, management effectiveness and approach 
to wellbeing.
There is a rolling three-year internal communications strategy and 
delivery plan which includes interventions such as regular 
management roadshows, virtual strategy briefings, visits to operating 
units, responses to the annual colleague opinion survey and updates 
on performance against the Company’ s Vision and Values.
The internal communications channels include a mobile device 
platform, face to face events, a corporate intranet, phone broadcasting, 
SMS alerts, a Company magazine, leadership and line manager 
briefing packs.
The UK Retail Colleague Forum, which was launched in 201 2 as an 
evolution of our Staff Council, provides a further mechanism for 
employee dialogue and engagement.
In addition, those employees who are eligible are also encouraged to 
become involved in the Group’ s performance through participation in 
share schemes.
Throughout the Group, the principles of equal opportunities are 
recognised in the formulation and development of employment policies.
It is the Company’s policy to give full and fair consideration to 
applications from people with disabilities, having regard to their 
particular aptitudes and abilities. If an employee becomes disabled, 
the  Company’s objective is the continued provision of suitable 
employment, either in the same or an alternative position, with 
appropriate adjustments being made if necessary . Employees with 
disabilities share equally in the opportunities for training, career 
development and promotion.
In late 201 3 the ‘Females In Leadership Group’ was formed to 
investigate why females were not progressing to senior grades in 
the  business. A  project team was created within Human Resources, 
we  then joined ‘Opportunity Now’ (being the only betting and gaming 
company that are members), and co-wrote our survey with ‘Opportunity 
Now’ . The survey received a good response and was  followed up by 
focus groups to clarify some of the areas raised. A  steering committee 
has been formed, representing all areas of the business and will review 
the feedback from the survey and create workable actions.
Significant agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control following a takeover bid
The agreements between Ladbrokes Group Finance plc (LGF), a  wholly 
owned subsidiary of the Company , and seven separate banks for the 
provision by the banks of revolving credit facilities of up to £405m  on a 
committed basis provide that the banks may give notice of cancellation 
if a change of control occurs. On cancellation the amounts drawn 
would be immediately repayable. In the context of a takeover bid, 
the  acquirer would normally arrange substitute facilities. In  addition, 
LGF issued bonds in March 201 0 and June 201 4. The bonds have a 
‘Put Event’ that allows bondholders to exercise put options when a 
change of control occurs. The put options allow the  bondholders to 
require LGF to purchase the bonds at a price of 1 01  pence.
Amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association
The Company’ s Articles may be amended by the members of the 
Company by special resolution (requiring a majority of at least 75% 
of  the persons voting on the relevant resolution).
Financial risk management
A description of the Group’ s financial risk management objectives and 
policies and its exposure to price, credit liquidity and cash flow risk is 
contained in note 23 to the consolidated financial statements and forms 
part of this report. 
Going concern
In assessing the going concern basis, the directors considered the 
Group’s business activities, the financial position of the Group as 
described in pages 1 6 to 31 and the Group’s financial risk 
management objectives and policies as included in note 23 to the 
consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and that it is 
therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
financial statements.
Annual General Meeting
This year’ s Annual General Meeting will be held at Deutsche Bank AG, 
Winchester House, 1 Great Winchester Street, London EC2N 2DB on 
7 May 201 5 at 1 1 .00am.

51 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 STATEMENT FROM DAVID MARTIN, 
CHAIRMAN OF THE 
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
Dear shareholder
As the Chairman of the Ladbrokes Remuneration Committee, I am 
pleased to present the 201 4 Directors’ Remuneration Report, which 
has been prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
Listing Rules, section 421 of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 
of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Account 
and  Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended). The Report is set out 
in  two parts:
 – our remuneration policy (Policy Report) which was approved by 
shareholders on 7 May 2014. For clarity we have updated the 
Policy Report to reflect the 2015 figures where relevant and made 
minor changes and clarifications to improve the report. As the 
underlying policy is unchanged, there will be no vote on this section 
at the 2015 Annual General Meeting (AGM); and
 – our annual report on remuneration detailing how our policy was 
implemented in the year ending 31 December 2014 and how it will 
be implemented in the year ending 31 December 2015, which is 
subject to an advisory vote.
Summary of Ladbrokes remuneration principles
The principles underlying the Ladbrokes remuneration policy remain 
broadly unchanged. Our total remuneration packages should 
therefore:
 – be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation;
 – support the achievement of organisational goals and be aligned 
with long-term business strategy;
 – enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key individuals; 
and
 – be positioned competitively against best market practice, while 
paying no more than necessary.
During 201 4, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the 
remuneration arrangements across the business assessing all 
elements of remuneration, including base salary , benefits and short 
and long-term incentive arrangements. The results from the review 
showed that broadly the existing remuneration framework was clear 
and transparent throughout the Company , remaining appropriately 
linked to personal performance, to business achievement and 
shareholder value.
However , the review highlighted that the current implementation of 
the  approved Performance Share Plan (PSP) was no longer fit for 
purpose. The implementation of the PSP could be improved to ensure 
ongoing alignment to future strategic objectives and continue to 
support sustainable value creation in the business. 
The Remuneration Committee consulted with our main shareholders 
on a number of revisions in the operation of our PSP which were 
positively received. The revisions are within the scope of our approved 
policy and will be implemented from 201 5 onwards. 
In light of recent changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the  Committee intends to review its policy regarding clawback 
provisions, with the intention of including any changes in a revised 
remuneration policy at the next formal approval of policy .

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT  2014 PERFORMANCE
In 201 4, we delivered our operational improvements despite 
challenging external market conditions. The profit target for 201 4 
used  for  bonus purposes was affected by strong results in favour 
of our customers.
For the 201 4 annual bonus, up to 60% of the maximum bonus 
opportunity was dependent on stretching Group profit targets with 
the  remainder dependent on individual objectives, which for the 
Chief  Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer included a number 
of financial and strategic measures. 201 4 operating profit
(1)
 excluding 
High Rollers was £1 25.4m which is below the required base level of 
profit. Therefore, executive directors did not receive a bonus in respect 
of 2014.
For the 201 2 Performance Share Plan (PSP), 50% is payable on 
three-year Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance with the remaining 
50% payable for three-year T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance until the end of 201 4. Neither the EPS or  TSR threshold 
targets were met. As a result no part of the 201 2 PSP  will vest.
In 2010, shareholders approved the Ladbrokes Growth Plan (LGP), 
a  one-off share plan, to incentivise the turnaround of the business. 
The  second performance test under this plan occurred at the end of 
June 201 4. The executive directors and key senior executives did not 
earn any additional shares as the share price did not exceed the share 
price required during the performance measurement period for 
additional shares to vest. However , as per the rules of the plan, a third 
of shares earned from the first performance test at the end of June 
201 3, by the executive directors, vested in August 201 4. Both Richard 
Glynn and Ian Bull voluntarily agreed not to exercise their share rights 
until after July 201 4. 
PROPOSED REVISIONS TO 2015 PSP
 – a move from two to four measures including a strategic measure 
based on responsible gambling and a second financial measure 
of Free Cash Flow (FCF);
 – the TSR element of the award will now be assessed as a 
percentage of outperformance of a refined, highly relevant group 
of gaming and leisure competitors; 
 – the EPS element will be assessed as a three-year cumulative target 
rather than being based on three-year point-to-point growth; and
 – introduction of a mandatory two-year holding period for the 
executive directors and executive committee members.
Further detail on the rationale for the proposed revisions can be found 
on page 68.
OTHER 2015 PROPOSALS 
In December last year , the Board announced that Richard Glynn will 
be leaving in 201 5. During the last five years, Richard has worked hard 
to build a stronger Ladbrokes and the foundations have now been laid. 
The Board is grateful and we wish him success in the future. 
We are in the process of discussing his leaving arrangements and 
looking for his successor . We will provide updates to shareholders in 
due course.
No changes have been proposed to the base salaries or benefits for 
the Executive Directors. The annual bonus plan will still be based on 
profit, strategic and individual objectives. The strategic and individual 
objectives will remain subject to a discretionary profit underpin.
Ian Bull will be taking on additional operational responsibilities from 
March 201 5 until the new Chief Executive Officer is fully on-board. T o 
recognise Ian Bull for these additional responsibilities the Board will 
pay him a temporary allowance of £10,000 per month from 1 March 
201 5 through to 30 November 201 5 (9 months). This allowance will be 
used in the calculation of the 201 5 cash in lieu of pension payment and 
in any bonus calculation should a bonus be payable based on 201 5 
performance. The Performance Share Plan will remain unchanged 
and will be awarded based on up to 1 50% of base salary . The 
temporary allowance will not be included in any award calculation. 
Further details are provided on page 67 . 
During the coming year , unless already identified, we have no intention 
to further review the remuneration framework unless unforeseen 
changes in circumstances make this necessary . 
The Remuneration Committee values all feedback from shareholders, 
and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.

POLICY REPORT
The following sections set out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the Policy). The Policy was approved by shareholders at the 201 4 AGM.
For avoidance of doubt, it is the Company’s policy to honour in full any pre-existing obligations that have been entered into prior to the effective 
date of this Policy . Therefore, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of 
office notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy , where the terms of that payments were agreed:
(i) before the Policy came into effect; or
(ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the payment 
was  not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company .
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award 
over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted. 
Further details regarding the operation of the Policy can be found on pages 63 to 69 of this report.

intended to enhance 
shareholder alignment 
and reinforce retention.
 – Performance is measured over one year; 
bonus is payable after the year-end.
 – Measures and targets are reviewed and

Committee annually. The Remuneration 
Committee reviews the performance 
against these targets after the year-end to 
determine the level of bonus pay-out.
 – A portion of any bonus earned (currently 
one-third) is compulsorily deferred into an 
award of shares (or equivalents in nil-cost 
options or cash) under the deferred bonus 
plan (DBP). These shares are not subject to 
any further performance conditions, will not 
normally vest for a period of at least three 
years and are forfeitable if the participant 
leaves employment before the vesting date 
(unless the Remuneration Committee 
decides otherwise).
 – Participants may receive the value (in cash 
or shares) of dividends paid on shares 
that vest in respect of the period between 
the grant and satisfaction of a deferred 
bonus award.
 – In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, malus provisions apply under which

or reduce vesting of unvested awards or 
impose further conditions on those awards 
in the event of a material misstatement of 
the Group’s financial results or gross 
misconduct.

for the Remuneration Committee to adjust 
or amend the terms of the awards.

Executive Officer, 130% of salary 
for other executive directors.
 – Performance is measured against 
a combination of financial measures 
(currently profit-based) and strategic 
and/or individual objectives. At least 
60% of the bonus will be based on 
financial measures and the remainder 
on strategic and/or individual objectives. 
No bonus will be awarded if a base 
level of profit is not achieved in the 
bonus year.
 – Strategic and individual measures 
selected may vary each year 
depending on business context 
and strategy, and will be weighted 
accordingly to business priorities. 
These objectives are reviewed 
and approved by the Remuneration 
Committee at the start of the 
financial year.
 – Between 0% and 100% of the 
maximum award applies for 
achievement between base level 
of profit and a personal rating of 3 
(which is considered to be good 
performance measured against the 
Company’s high standards) and 
stretch performance targets and 
a personal rating of 5 (which is 
considered to be truly exceptional).
55 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
Minor text changes have been made to the policy table to improve its 
readability and clarify its operation. The most significant is  the addition 
of a mandatory two year holding period under the PSP which was 
included to improve alignment with shareholder’s views and is 
consistent with developing market practice.
Performance measures – annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are chosen to provide an 
appropriate balance between incentivising executive directors to meet 
financial targets for the year and to deliver specific strategic, operational 
and individual goals. This balance allows the Remuneration Committee 
to reward performance effectively against the key elements of our 
strategy.
The precise bonus targets are set by the Remuneration Committee 
each year to ensure that executive directors are appropriately 
focused  on the key objectives for the next 1 2 months. In doing so, 
the  Remuneration Committee intends to take into account a number 
of internal and external reference points, including the Company’s 
business plan.
Performance measures – PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term sustainable 
returns to shareholders. The Remuneration Committee strives to 
achieve this by aligning the performance measures under the PSP 
with the long-term strategy and priorities of the Company and 
considers that strong performance under these metrics should 
result  in sustainable long-term growth.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a combination of 
financial and strategic measures and a measure of value delivered 
to  shareholders is most appropriate when measuring long-term 
sustainable performance at Ladbrokes. The use of a scorecard of 
measures recognises and rewards performance against a wide range 
of relevant measures and helps ensure awards are less ‘all or nothing’ , 
and therefore more motivational. 
Additional disclosure – legacy arrangements LGP
The LGP was approved by shareholders on 1 4 May 2010. Full details 
of  the LGP are set out in the circular sent to shareholders seeking 
approval for the LGP at the time of implementation. As a legacy 
arrangement, the LGP is not included within the Policy table above. 
However , we have chosen to voluntarily disclose summary details 
of  the LGP here for ease of reference. 
 – Purpose and link to strategy – The LGP was a one-off 
long-term incentive plan which was designed to incentivise over 
140 key senior executives to support revitalisation of the business 
and create significant, sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
The plan rewards value creation of between £400m to £1.3bn for 
shareholders.
Variable remuneration continued
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
 – Promotes the 
long-term success of 
the business.
 – Incentivises executives 
(and the broader senior 
management team) to 
deliver performance 
over the long-term. 
 – Helps retain executives.
 – Share based to provide 
greater alignment with 
shareholder interests. 
 – Awards will be structured in the form of 
conditional share awards (or equivalents 
in nil-cost options or cash) with vesting 
dependent on the achievement of 
stretching performance measures over 
at least three years.
 – For awards granted in 2015 onwards 
vested shares will be mandatorily 
held for an additional two years by 
executive directors.
 – Dividends (or equivalents) may accrue 
during the vesting period only on shares 
that vest.
 – In line with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, malus provisions apply under which 
the Remuneration Committee may cancel 
or reduce vesting of unvested awards or 
impose further conditions on those awards 
in the event of a material misstatement of 
the Group’s financial results or gross 
misconduct.
 – The PSP is operated in accordance with 
the terms of the PSP rules which was 
approved by shareholders on 18 May 2007 
and include the Remuneration Committee’s 
capacity to adjust or amend the terms of 
the awards.
 – The normal award levels as a 
percentage of base salary will 
be 175% for the Chief Executive 
Officer and 150% for other 
executive directors. 
 – The Remuneration Committee 
will have the discretion to make 
higher awards in exceptional 
circumstances subject to the 
individual plan limit of 250% of 
base salary.
 – Awards vest based on performance 
against a combination of performance 
measures.
 – At least 50% of the award will be based 
on financial measures and a further 
portion of no more than 50% will be 
based on TSR performance. Any 
balance would be linked to performance 
against specific strategic objectives.
 – For ‘threshold’ levels of performance 
up to 25% of the award vests, 
increasing on a straight line basis to 
100% of the award for maximum 
performance. 
 – In line with the rules of the PSP , the 
performance condition may be 
replaced or varied if an event occurs or 
circumstances arise, e.g. a significant 
regulatory change, which causes the 
Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, 
to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would 
be appropriate (taking into account the 
interests of the shareholders of the 
Company) provided that the amended 
performance condition would continue 
to achieve its original purpose.

Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for our executive directors is designed to be aligned with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin 
remuneration for the wider Group.
Although there are differences in pay between the executive directors and the wider colleague population, all reward arrangements are built 
around the common objectives and principles outlined below:
Remuneration objectives Arrangement(s) used for wider Group
Be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation – Key personnel participate in PSP with the same performance metrics as 
for executive directors.
 – Two all-employee share incentive schemes are in operation (the Share 
Incentive Plan and the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme) to 
encourage share ownership.
 – Key Group financial measures under colleague bonus arrangements are 
aligned with those for executive directors to ensure consistency across the 
organisation and delivery of strategic goals. Colleagues also have relevant 
(and therefore motivational) team and individual targets to focus the team 
on key deliverables in their area of business.
 – Use of survey data to ensure all elements of remuneration are aligned with 
market as appropriate.
Support the achievement of organisational goals and be aligned with  
long-term business goals
Enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key individuals
Be positioned competitively against market practice, whilst paying no more 
than necessary
 –Operation – One-off awards were made under this plan in 2010 
to the Chief Executive Officer and in 201 1 to other participants. 
No further awards will be made under the plan, which ends in 
June 2015. The performance period for all awards is five years, 
which began in June 2010 and ends in June 2015. A portion of 
the award was eligible for vesting at the end of year three of the 
performance period (June 2013). No further vesting occurred at 
the end of year four (June 2014). The remainder of the award may 
vest at the end of year five (June 2015), subject to the achievement 
of the performance targets. Participants may receive the value of 
dividends paid on any vested shares.
 – Maximum opportunity – Executive directors were required to 
invest up to 150% of base salary in shares and can potentially 
receive up to a four times matching award in respect of that 
investment. The matching award will normally only vest to the 
extent this investment is retained. In the case of the Chief Executive 
Officer, he was required to invest in circa 1 million Ladbrokes 
shares and received a four times matching award.
 – Performance measures – Awards are subject to share price 
performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained 
throughout a period of 30 consecutive dealing days. 25% of the 
award will vest if a share price of £2.00 is achieved. 100% of the 
award will vest if a share price of £2.97 is achieved. Vesting will be 
on a straight line basis between the minimum and maximum share 
price targets (i.e. between £2.00 and £2.97).
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to amend the targets 
if it is necessary to take account of exceptional factors including, for 
example, corporate events or exceptional market or industry factors 
which would otherwise render the targets inappropriate.

Chairman receives a basic annual fee.
 – NEDs receive a basic annual fee in 
respect of their Board duties. Further 
fees are paid to NEDs in respect of 
chairmanship and membership of

once annually.
 – The Board is responsible for 
determining fees for other NEDs, 
although the NEDs are not involved

provisions in place to enable recovery 
of sums paid.
 – Fees are normally paid in cash, 
although the Company retains the 
right to settle all/part of the fees as

 – Whilst there is no maximum individual 
fee level, fees are set at a level which is 
considered appropriate to attract and 
retain the calibre of individual required 
by the Company, but the Company 
avoids paying more than necessary for 
this purpose. The Board may determine 
fee increases at any point as it 
considers appropriate in line with 
market movements and to take into 
account the time commitment and 
duties involved.
 – Fees are paid for the following roles/
duties:
 – Non-Executive Chairman;
 – Senior Independent Director;
 – other NEDs;
 – supplementary fee for chair 
of the Audit or Remuneration 
Committee*; and 
 – supplementary fee for membership 
of the Audit and/or Remuneration 
Committees.*
 – The Chairman and NEDs will not be 
eligible for annual bonus, share 
incentives and pensions.
 – Reasonable expenses (e.g. travel, 
accommodation and subsistence) 
associated with Chairman and NEDs’ 
duties will be reimbursed, including 
any tax due on the benefits.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED RECRUITMENT POLICY
Principles and approach
In determining remuneration arrangements for new appointments 
to  the Board (including internal promotions), the Remuneration 
Committee applies the following principles:
 – The Remuneration Committee is at all times conscious that any 
arrangements should be in the best interests of Ladbrokes and 
our shareholders, without paying more than is necessary.
 – The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration all relevant 
factors, including the calibre of the individual, the nature of the role, 
local market practice, the individual’s current remuneration 
package, Ladbrokes’ remuneration policy, internal relativities 
and existing arrangements for other executive directors.
 – Salaries will reflect the skills and experience of the individual, and 
may be set at a level to allow future salary progression to reflect 
performance in the role. The Committee also retains the right to 
determine that in the first year of appointment any annual bonus 
award will be subject to such conditions as it may determine.
 – Typically, the remuneration package for a new appointment will 
be based on (or be transitioned onto) the same elements of the 
remuneration package as the other executive directors, in line 
with the policy table presented above.
It would be expected that the structure and quantum of the variable 
pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table above. 
However , at recruitment, the Committee would retain the discretion 
to  flex the balance between annual and long-term incentives and the 
measures used to assess performance for these elements, with the 
intention that a significant portion would be delivered in shares.
At recruitment, variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, 
be  delivered via alternative structures, again with the intention that 
a  significant portion would be share-based, but in all circumstances 
subject to the overriding cap of 420% of salary .
The Committee retains discretion to make appropriate remuneration 
decisions outside the standard policy to meet the individual 
circumstances when an interim executive director is required to fill 
a  role on a short-term basis or if exceptional circumstances require 
that  the Chairman or a non-executive director takes on an executive 
function on a short-term basis.
Buy-outs
T o facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may make 
compensatory payments and/or awards for any remuneration 
arrangements subject to forfeiture on leaving a previous employer . 
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will take account of any 
terms attached to the forfeited arrangements. Awards will take such 
form as the Committee considers appropriate taking into account 
all  relevant factors such as the nature of the award, any performance 
conditions attached to those awards, the likelihood of those conditions 
being met, and the proportion of vesting/performance period 
remaining. The Committee’s intention is that the value awarded 
would  be equivalent to the value forfeited.
Recruitment of the Chairman and non-executive directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive 
director , remuneration arrangements will normally be in line with those 
detailed in the relevant table above.
Disclosure
The remuneration structure of any new director will be disclosed in 
a  timely manner and, as far as possible, in the relevant RNS notification 
at the time of appointment. In the next remuneration report, the 
Remuneration Committee will explain to shareholders the rationale 
for  the relevant arrangements.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SERVICE CONTRACTS
The key employment terms and conditions of the current executive directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, are set out below:
Notice Period (months) T ermination payment Treatment of remuneration
Company policy:
No fixed term contracts
Six months by executive and 12 months 
by Company.
In a recruitment scenario, an executive 
director may initially be hired on a contract 
requiring the Company to provide 24 
months’ notice which then reduces, 
pro-rata over the course of the first year of 
the contract, to requiring 12 months’ notice 
to terminate the contract.
May terminate employment by making 
a Payment in Lieu Of Notice (PILON) 
equivalent to value of base salary and 
benefits (including pension allowance) 
in respect of the notice period.
Participation in all incentive plans, 
including the annual bonus and the 
PSP , is non-contractual.
Outstanding awards will be treated in 
accordance with the relevant plan rules.
Richard Glynn 
Effective date of  
contract is 22 April 2010
Contract pre-dates  
current policy
12 months by both sides. Does not contain PILON clause.
If the Company terminates his employment, 
the termination payment would be 
calculated on a damages basis which 
would reflect Richard Glynn’s loss as a 
result of termination and his legal obligation 
to mitigate loss.
The Company would seek to keep the cost 
of any departure to a minimum, taking into 
account contractual obligations and the 
circumstances of his departure.
In line with Company policy.
Ian Bull
Effective date of  
contract is 4 July 201 1
In line with Company policy. In line with Company policy.
Also contains additional specific provisions 
requiring a reduction in PILON payment in 
the event he finds alternative employment 
during the 12-month notice period.
In line with Company policy.
59 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
The Remuneration Committee takes a number of factors into account when determining leaving arrangements for an executive director .
 – The Remuneration Committee must satisfy any contractual obligations: (a) being consistent with the Policy set out in this report; or (b) if they 
are inconsistent having been entered into on a date on or before 27 June 2012 in accordance with relevant legislation.
 – The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises the leaver 
provisions of share plans under which executive directors may currently hold awards.
 – Other payments which may be made as a result of loss of office include legal fees within an agreed maximum limit, outplacement 
counselling within an agreed maximum limit, payment for any outstanding accrued holiday and any other payments required by statute.
 – The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that there should be no reward for failure. When exercising any discretion under the plans 
referred to below, the Committee will take into account the circumstances of the individual’s departure and his performance in the role.
Plan Good leaver categories Treatment for a good leaver Treatment for any other leaver
Annual  
Bonus Plan
 – Ill health and disability.
 – Death.
 – Redundancy.
 – Any other scenario in which the Remuneration 
Committee determines good leaver treatment 
is justified.
Where a participant has a minimum of nine 
months’ full service in the relevant year a cash 
bonus will be paid. This amount will normally be 
subject to the achievement of the financial and 
individual objectives set at the beginning of the 
plan year. Any payment will be following the end 
of the relevant financial year and will normally 
be pro-rated for time served during the year, 
unless the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise.
Any amounts which would have ordinarily been 
deferred into the deferred bonus plan may be paid 
in cash at the same time.
The Remuneration Committee, however, has the 
ability to exercise its discretion to pay a bonus as 
it considers appropriate.
No bonus.

the Remuneration Committee determines that 
awards should vest early.
In either case, awards will vest to the extent 
that performance conditions have been

the Remuneration Committee determines 
otherwise.

period, unless the Remuneration Committee 
determines otherwise.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT
The non-executive directors, including the Chairman of the Company , have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. 
They do not have service contracts with either the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below:
Provision Policy
Period – After the initial term, non-executive directors are typically expected to serve a further three-year term.
 – Whilst appointed for a three-year term, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Chairman and all non-executive 
directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at each AGM.
T ermination – The appointment of a Chairman or a non-executive director is terminable without notice by either the Company or the director.
 – Non-executive directors and the Chairman are not entitled to any compensation upon leaving office.
AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTATION
All executive directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment for non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal hours of business, and at the place of the Company’s 201 5 Annual General Meeting on 7 May 201 5 from 10.45am 
until the close of the meeting.
ILLUSTRATION OF OUR FORWARD-LOOKING REMUNERATION POLICY
In support of the remuneration philosophy , Ladbrokes’ remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion 
of pay is dependent on the delivery of stretching short-term and long-term performance targets, aligned with the creation of sustainable 
shareholder value. 
The Remuneration Committee considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that 
this is appropriate in the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders.
The following charts provide illustrative values of the remuneration package for executive directors under three assumed performance scenarios.
In line with the regulations, the illustrations show the potential remuneration levels under Ladbrokes’ forward-looking remuneration policy . These 
charts are for illustrative purposes only and actual outcomes may differ from that shown.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPANY
The Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the pay and 
conditions of colleagues throughout the Group when determining 
remuneration arrangements for executive directors. Information 
relating to wider workforce remuneration is provided in regular updates 
to the Remuneration Committee. This takes the form of a comparison 
of reward elements across all main workforce groups, updates on total 
reward communications and details of business wide reviews such as 
annual bonus awards and salary increases.
In particular , the Remuneration Committee pays specific attention to 
the general level of salary increases and bonus outcomes within the 
wider population.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee does not directly consult with our 
colleagues as part of the process of determining executive pay , the 
Committee does receive feedback from colleague surveys and takes 
this into account when reviewing executive pay . In addition, a significant 
number of our colleagues are shareholders and so are able to express 
their views in the same way as other shareholders.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder 
views when evaluating and setting on-going remuneration strategy , 
and we commit to consulting with shareholders prior to any significant 
changes to our remuneration policy . For example, at the end of 201 4 
and start of 201 5, we consulted our major shareholders on the 
proposed revisions to the PSP in 201 5.
The Remuneration Committee also considers shareholder feedback 
received in relation to an AGM at its next meeting following the AGM. 
MINOR AMENDMENTS TO POLICY
The Remuneration Committee may make minor changes to this Policy , 
which do not have a material advantage to directors, to aid in its 
operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approval 
for  a revised version of this Policy .

Methodology
(a) Salary and fees – this represents the base salary or fees paid in respect of the relevant financial year. No sums were paid to third parties in respect of any executive director’s services (2013: nil).
(b) Benefits – this represents the taxable value of all benefits paid in respect of the relevant financial year. Executive director benefits include private healthcare (for the executive and his family), critical illness, 
disability and life assurance, injury in service benefits, allowance for tax advice and a cash allowance in lieu of a company car.
(c) Cash allowance in lieu of pension – executive directors receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions equivalent to 22.5% of salary.
(d) Annual bonus – this reflects the nil bonus awarded in respect of the performance year for 2013 and 2014. Consequently there is no deferred bonus awarded for either 2013 or 2014. Further details are 
provided on page 64.
(e) Long-term incentives – this figure represents the value of long-term incentive plans with a performance period ending in the relevant year. 
 PSP: The 2014 figure reflects that no shares vested under the 2014 awards under the PSP . The 2013 values in this column (relating to awards with the performance period from 1 January 2011 to 
31 December 2013) have been revised from last year’s report, based on the actual share price of 151.61p at the date of vesting on 25 February 2014 and inclusive of the supplementary shares delivered 
in respect of dividend equivalents (Richard Glynn: 192,080, Ian Bull: 139,635) 
 LGP: The 2014 figure reflects that there was no additional vesting under the second performance test ending on 29 June 2014. The 2013 figure includes the 40.7% of maximum opportunity earned by 
executive directors including proportions of awards deferred and released in 2014 and 2015. Further details in respect of the achievement of performance conditions are provided on page 65. Due to a 
clerical error, Ian Bull was awarded 7 ,044 more dividend equivalent shares in 2013. This was rectified by reducing the number of dividend equivalent shares he received in 2014 by 7 ,044. The 2013 single 
figure number has been modified accordingly to reflect this reduction.
(f) The Chairman receives a fee of £250,000 per annum. Other non-executive directors receive a basic fee of £43,000 per annum. The senior independent director receives a basic fee of £60,000 per 
annum. Additional fees are payable for the role of Chairman of the Audit or Remuneration Committee at a rate of £17 ,000 per annum and for membership of the Audit and/or Remuneration Committee 
at a rate of £7 ,000 per annum (if not Chairman). David Martin was appointed as a non-executive director on 31 October 2013. His fee is paid to Arriva plc by mutual agreement.
63 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN RESPECT OF THE SINGLE FIGURE TABLE
Annual bonus
The table below sets out the annual bonus awards made to executive 
directors in respect of 201 4:
2014 annual bonus As % of 2014 salary
Richard Glynn £0 0%
Ian Bull £0 0%
60% of the 201 4 annual bonus was based on profit for the year 
(excluding profit from High Rollers and exceptional items). 40% of the 
201 4 annual bonus was based on individual objectives, which are 
primarily financial in nature. Furthermore, the individual objectives 
element of the bonus remains subject to a profit underpin. 
201 4 profit before tax and net finance expense and excluding High 
Rollers and exceptional items was £1 25.4m. This meant that the profit 
underpin was not met, therefore bonus payout was nil despite positive 
individual performance ratings for both the Chief Executive Officer 
and  the Chief Financial Officer . 
Performance Share Plan
The PSP value shown in the single figure table relates to the 201 2 
award, for which the performance period was 1 January 201 2 to

Governance
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Ladbrokes Growth Plan
The LGP is a one-off long-term incentive plan where awards were 
made under this plan in 2010 to the Chief Executive Officer and in 
201 1  to other participants. The performance period for all awards 
is  five years which began in June 2010 and ends in June 201 5. 
A  portion of the award was eligible for vesting after three years in 
201 3  (first performance test) with a further portion eligible for vesting 
at  the end of year four (June 201 4, second performance test) and year 
five (June 201 5, third performance test) if performance targets have 
not  been fully met at previous performance tests. The performance 
conditions for this award are set out below: 
Share price maintained for a period of  
30 consecutive dealing days
Percentage of the 
award vesting
200 pence 25%
Between 200 pence and 297 pence Pro rata
297 pence 100%
Straight line vesting operates between these points.
The first performance test on 29 June 201 3 resulted in 40.7% vesting 
of the maximum opportunity as a share price of 220.7 pence was 
maintained for a period of 30 consecutive dealing days. Therefore, at 
the second performance test on 29 June 201 4, a share price of above 
220.7 pence had to be maintained for a period of 30 consecutive 
dealing days since 29 June 201 3 for any additional vesting to occur . 
Performance out-turn
A share price above 220.7 pence was not maintained at any point 
between 29 June 201 3 and 29 June 201 4, therefore there was no 
vesting under the second performance test in 201 4. 
SCHEME INTERESTS AWARDED DURING THE FINANCIAL YEAR
Performance Share Plan awards
For 201 4, PSP awards are granted over Ladbrokes shares with 
the  number of shares under award determined by reference to 
a  percentage of base salary .
Performance for these awards is measured over the three financial 
years from 1 January 201 4 to 31 December 201 6. They are subject 
to  the same performance conditions as the 201 3 PSP awards which 
are detailed on page 64.

Share Incentive Plan awards
Executive directors are eligible to participate in HMRC-approved 
all-employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible colleagues. 
During 201 4, Richard Glynn and Ian Bull participated in the Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP). Under the plan during 201 4, Richard Glynn 
purchased 646 shares and 475 bonus shares were awarded to him 
along with 1 75 shares in respect of the dividends paid by the Company 
on 1 5 May 201 4 and 1 3 November 201 4, Ian Bull purchased 
647  shares and 475 bonus shares were awarded to him along with 
94  shares in respect of the dividends paid by the Company on 
1 5  May  201 4 and 1 3 November 201 4. 
PA YMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS
There were no payments to past directors in 201 4.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE
There were no payments to directors for loss of office in 201 4.
65 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ SHAREHOLDINGS AND SHARE INTERESTS
Directors’ shareholdings and share ownership guidelines
The Company’s shareholding guidelines require executive directors to  build up over time a personal shareholding equivalent in value to at  least 
one year’s base salary . Executives are encouraged to retain vested shares earned under the Company’s incentive plans until the shareholding 
guidelines have been met. 
Shares which the executive directors hold outright and/or vested shares under the Company’s share plans count towards the requirement. 
Unvested share awards only count towards the requirement if vesting is not subject to any further performance conditions or other conditions 
such as continued employment. 
On this basis, both Richard Glynn and Ian Bull have met the Company’s shareholding requirement in full.

HISTORICAL TSR PERFORMANCE AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE250, the FTSE250 index 
provides an appropriate indication of market movements against 
which to benchmark the Company’s performance. The chart on 
the  right summarises the Company’s TSR performance against the 
FTSE250 index over the six-year period to 31 December 201 4.
The table below the chart summarises the Chief Executive Officer’s 
single figure for total remuneration, annual bonus pay-outs and 
long-term incentive vesting levels as a percentage of maximum 
opportunity over the six-year period to 31 December 201 4.

(1) The above number for Christopher Bell in 2010 reflects his remuneration including in respect of his notice period and excludes any payments associated with his departure. Richard Glynn was appointed 
as Chief Executive Officer on 22 April 2010 and the above number reflects his remuneration from that time to the year end.
(2) Increases in total compensation in 2012 and 2013 have been as a result of increased pay-outs under the Company’s long-term incentive plans, as a result of meeting the relevant performance targets, 
e.g. PSP and LGP . Richard Glynn has not received any changes to salary or cash allowance in lieu of pension since his appointment in April 2010.

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY IN 2015
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing 
to implement the remuneration policy in 201 5.
Although Richard Glynn will be leaving in 201 5, the Committee is 
proposing to pay him as detailed below until his departure date. 
Leaver  arrangements are yet to be decided. The proposed package 
for the incoming Chief Executive Officer will be developed during 
the  recruitment process. Both sets of arrangements will be disclosed 
to shareholders in due course.
Base salary
In determining salary increases for 201 5, the Remuneration Committee 
took into consideration business performance, affordability and pay 
and conditions across the Group and determined that there will be no 
increase in 201 5.
The table below shows base salaries for 201 5:
Base salary from 1 March 2015
Richard Glynn £580,000
Ian Bull £400,000
Ian Bull will also receive a temporary allowance of £10,000 per month 
from 1 March 201 5 to 30 November 201 5 for additional operational 
responsibilities which he will undertake relating to Richard Glynn’s 
departure and until the new Chief Executive Officer is fully on-boarded. 
This allowance will cease with immediate effect if Ian Bull resigns 
during this period.
Benefits
Benefits are generally set at an appropriate market competitive level, 
taking into account a number of factors including market practice for 
comparable roles within appropriate pay comparators.
There will be no changes to the benefits package received by 
executive directors in 201 5.
Cash allowance in lieu of pension
The executive directors have elected to receive a cash allowance of 
22.5% of salary in lieu of pension, and there will be no change to cash 
allowance levels for 201 5.
The table below shows cash allowances for 201 5: 
2015 cash allowance in lieu of pension £ (% of salary)
Richard Glynn £130,500 (22.5%) 
Ian Bull £110,250 (22.5%) 
Ian Bull’s 201 5 cash allowance in lieu of pension will be based on his 
salary and the temporary allowance and will be applied from 1 March 
201 5 to 30 November 201 5. 
67 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 25% of the award will be based on three-year  
Free Cash Flow performance: 
FCF performance Percentage of the award vesting
Less than £273.9m 0%
£273.9m 25%
£345.3m 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points.
Free Cash Flow for the purposes of the Plan is defined as the net 
cash  flow from operating activities plus dividends received from 
joint  ventures and associates, less income taxes paid, net capital 
expenditure and net interest payments (including bond coupons). 
FCF  excludes distribution of dividends, repayment of debt and 
merger  and acquisition  activity .
25% of the award will be based on performance against 
responsible gambling measures.
The measures in relation to this element of the award will be 
determined and independently measured and assessed by the 
Social  Responsibility Committee through a set of KPIs. These 
KPIs  will  reflect the GB Gambling Commission’s objectives and 
regulatory and voluntary sector -level changes and our own initiatives. 
For example Senet implementation and developing the use of data 
to  minimise harm. 
These KPIs will be assessed over the three-year performance period 
using three annual scorecards and the cumulative impact over the 
same period. 
The Remuneration Committee and the Social Responsibility 
Committee intend to disclose targets and the performance level 
at  the  end of the performance period. As with all the measures under 
the 201 5 PSP the threshold performance will result in 25% of this 
element of the PSP vesting.
The main differences between the 2014 PSP and 2015 PSP 
are as follows:
 – a move from two measures to four measures. This helps 
ensure the awards recognise achievement against a broad 
range of transparent and stretching measures which is linked 
to the Company’s strategy including responsible gambling; 
 – TSR will be assessed on outperformance of a refined, highly 
relevant group of gaming and leisure companies which are facing 
the same specific sector issues and changes as Ladbrokes;
 – EPS will be based on a three-year cumulative target rather than 
point-to-point CAGR growth. This has the advantage of not 
rewarding volatility, reducing vesting sensitivity to final year 
performance, and facilitating mid-term tracking of performance 
which is more motivational and retentive to participants;
 – inclusion of a second financial measure which will be Free 
Cash Flow in 2015 which reinforces the importance of capital 
management.
 – inclusion of a strategic measure which will be measurement 
against responsible gambling KPIs in 2015 which reflects the 
continued importance of these activities to the Company.
Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity will remain at 1 70% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 1 30% of base salary and 
the  temporary allowance which will be paid between 1 March and 
30  November for the Chief Financial Officer in  201 5.
The table below provides further information on the performance 
measures against which performance will be measured:
Relative weighting (% of maximum bonus opportunity)
Financial – operating profit 
(1)
60% 
Individual – mainly specific financial targets 40% 
Profit is the key financial measure. Profit attributed to High Rollers is 
excluded from the profit performance calculations for annual bonus 
purposes. The individual objective element of the bonus remain 
subject to a profit underpin.
At this stage, the Committee considers that the annual bonus targets 
remain commercially sensitive. This is because of the close link 
between the selected performance measures and strategy . However , 
in next year’s Annual Report, we commit to providing shareholders 
with  as much context as possible on performance against those 
targets and the resulting bonus out-turn rationale, within commercial 
constraints.
Performance Share Plan
Awards under the 201 5 Performance Share Plan will be made in 
accordance with the approved policy , as detailed on page 56.
25% of the award will be based on TSR percentage 
outperformance of six sector peers: 
TSR % outperformance of six sector 
comparators Percentage of the award vesting
Less than median 0%
Median 25%
Median + 10% p.a. 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points.
The peer group for the 201 5 award is set out below:
888 Holdings Paddy Power
Betfair Sportech
Bwin PartyGaming William Hill
If the peer group for 201 5 was to fall below five companies (i.e. in the 
event of takeovers), a peer will be selected from a ‘reserve list’ of 
companies (which includes for 201 5, GT ech, Betsson, International 
Game T echnology , Rank Group and Playtech) to raise the peer group 
back to a minimum of five companies. The  replacement company will 
be effective over the entire performance period.
25% of the award will be based on three-year cumulative 
EPS performance:
EPS performance Percentage of the award vesting
Less than 29.0 pence 0%
29.0 pence 25%
37.0 pence 100%
Straight-line vesting operates between these points. Cumulative EPS 
performance excludes exceptional items and High Rollers.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the consolidated financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union, and the Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the directors are required to: 
— 
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
— 
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
— 
state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
consolidated and Company financial statements respectively; 
— 
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in 
business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
consolidated financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess a company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed in  
pages 42 to 43 of this Annual Report confirm that, to the best of  
their knowledge: 
— 
the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and 
— 
the Strategic report and Directors’ report contained in the Annual 
Report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces. 
Each director in office at the date the directors’ report is approved, 
that: 
(a)  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
(b)  he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a 
director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

Ladbrokes plc’s Consolidated financial statements and Company 
financial statements (the ‘financial statements’) give a true and fair 
view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for 
the year then ended; 
— 
the Consolidated financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRSs’) as adopted by the European Union; 
— 
the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
— 
the Consolidated and Company financial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Consolidated financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited 
Ladbrokes plc’s financial statements comprise: 
— 
the Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2014; 
— 
the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income for the year then ended;

the Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; 
— 
the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then 
ended; and 
— 
the Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2014;

Certain required disclosures have been presented elsewhere in the 
Annual Report and Accounts 2014 (the ‘Annual Report’), rather than 
in the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced 
from the financial statements and are identified as audited.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the 
preparation of the Consolidated financial statements is applicable 
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice).

The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’). 
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we 
looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified 
as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order to provide an 
opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be read in this context. 
This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  
 Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Impairment assessments for: goodwill and Company 
investments in subsidiaries; retail licences and property, 
plant and equipment (‘PPE’); and software assets  
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee Report), note 4 (Significant 
accounting policies), note 14 (Impairment testing of goodwill and 
indefinite life intangible assets) and note 6 of the Company financial 
statements (Fixed asset investments)  
Retail licence intangible assets and PPE 
The Group has retail licence intangibles of £447.1 million, primarily  
in UK Retail, which have an indefinite life. An impairment assessment 
is performed on an annual basis to assess whether the carrying 
value of these assets and the related PPE exceed the recoverable 
amount. Following this assessment, the directors determined 
that an impairment charge of £20.8 million was required. 
Our focus is on the sufficiency of this impairment charge, we 
focused on UK Retail given the industry regulatory developments 
in Machine Games Duty and in player protection measures. This 
meant considering the impact of these developments on future cash 
flow forecasts and whether the directors have made appropriate 
assumptions for these in their cash flow models, or if any additional 
impairment charge is needed. 
Software assets  
The Group has software assets of £96.6 million. As a result of the 
impairment assessment, the directors determined that an 
impairment charge of £23.1 million was required reflecting the 
decision to decommission a platform for desktop sportsbook. 
As with the retail licences and related PPE, our focus is on the 
sufficiency of this impairment charge. 
Goodwill and Company investment in subsidiaries 
The Group has goodwill of £159.2 million including amounts relating 
to the business combinations of Playtech (£34.9 million), Betdaq 
(£31.5 million) and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd (£23.0 million). 
An annual impairment assessment is performed by the directors 
to determine whether the value of these investments is less than 
the carrying value and, as such, goodwill is impaired.  
The Company (Ladbrokes plc) has investments in subsidiaries 
of £3,883.7 million, which when considered net of intercompany 
creditors totals £2,113.8 million. An impairment charge of £92.4 
million was recorded at 31 December 2014 in respect of certain 
investments in subsidiaries for which the carrying amount exceeded 
the recoverable amount. Our focus is on the sufficiency of this 
impairment charge. 
We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts supporting 
the impairment assessments for goodwill, retail licence intangibles, 
PPE and Company investment in subsidiaries.  
We compared the forecasts with the latest Board approved 
budgets. We also compared the actual results for 2014 against 
forecast to verify their reliability. We found that actual performance 
was lower than originally forecast. We obtained evidence to support 
the directors’ explanations for this and evaluated the potential 
impact of these variances on forecasts for 2015 and subsequent 
years. We determined that through a combination of the directors’ 
explanations and external sports results data that these were 
reasonable and that the forecasts to be appropriate for the 
purposes of the impairment assessments. 
We evaluated the appropriateness of the key assumptions in the 
forecasts – in particular the short term and long term growth rates 
and the impact of regulatory changes to Machine Games Duty and 
player protection measures.  
We verified that forecasts for Digital, UK Retail and European Retail 
appropriately reflected these items in each business.  
We challenged the discount rates applied by comparing to the cost 
of capital for the Group. We found this to be consistent and in line 
with our expectations. 
Retail licence impairment assessment 
We obtained evidence that corroborated the directors’ grouping 
for those shops that they had determined do not operate 
independently. 
Where we considered management’s assumptions to be less 
conservative than we would expect we performed sensitivity 
analysis to satisfy ourselves that any difference would not be 
material. 
Software assets 
We tested the appropriateness of costs capitalised in the year, and 
challenged the continued utilisation for a sample of assets and 
considered the support for asset impairment charges. We did not 
identify any further assets for impairment. 
Goodwill and investment in subsidiaries 
We performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions to 
ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions that either 
individually or collectively would be required for an additional 
impairment change. We were satisfied that a material change in 
those assumptions would be required to trigger an impairment.

 Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Compliance with laws and regulations given the developing 
nature of the digital gaming sector 
The international legal and licencing framework for digital gaming 
is territory specific. Regulations are developing and this evolving 
environment makes compliance an increasingly complex area. 
Given the potential for litigation and licence withdrawal, the risk of 
non-compliance with digital gaming laws and licence regulations 
could give rise to material fines, penalties, legal claims or market 
exclusion. 
We evaluated the controls and risk management process in 
operation in respect of compliance with digital licencing regulations 
covering player registration controls customer deposits and 
withdrawals.  
We assessed how the Group monitors legal and regulatory 
developments and their assessment of the potential impact on 
the business. 
We read the summary of litigation matters provided by management 
and discussed each of the material cases noted in the report to 
determine the Group’s assessment of the likelihood and magnitude 
of any liability that may arise. We also read, where required, external 
legal or regulatory advice sought by the Group. 
No significant issues were noted from our work. 
Accounting for the acquisition of Betstar and the fair value 
of the contingent consideration relating to the business 
combinations made in 2013 (Playtech, Betdaq and Gaming 
Investments Pty Ltd) 
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee Report), note 4 (Significant 
Accounting Policies), notes 24 (Financial instruments and fair value 
disclosures) and 33 (Business combinations) 
During the year, the Group acquired the Betstar business in 
Australia. The accounting for the Betstar business combination 
resulted in the recognition of £3.2 million of customer relationships 
and brand of £1.4 million and goodwill of £8.0 million which are 
collectively material and subject to judgement regarding the 
identification and recognition of intangible assets, namely customer 
relationships and the brand name. 
The Group is required to fair value the contingent consideration 
associated with the business combinations of Playtech and Betdaq 
made in 2013 at each balance sheet date. At 31 December 2014 
the total contingent consideration was £32.1 million with a fair value 
movement of £3.1 million recognised in the income statement for 
the year. 
This is determined through a cash flow forecast model. The 
inputs to these models are subject to judgement regarding the 
determination of cashflow forecasts, discount rates and the 
Ladbrokes multiple. 
The contingent consideration associated with Gaming Investments 
Pty Ltd has been settled during the year and therefore the fair value 
equals the agreed settlement of £18.4 million. 
We obtained the directors’ assessment of the identification and 
valuation of the intangible assets acquired as part of the Betstar 
acquisition. We considered whether there were any other identifiable 
assets acquired by using our knowledge of the industry and 
reviewing the terms of the acquisition and did not identify any further 
material identifiable assets. 
We performed sensitivity analysis over key drivers within the cash 
flow forecasts, including amounts staked and churn rates as well 
as the key assumptions around discount rates. We then considered 
the likelihood of such movement in these key assumptions arising 
in assessing the appropriateness of the overall valuations. No 
significant issues were noted from our work. 
For the contingent consideration on Playtech and Betdaq, we 
obtained the directors’ models. We assessed the appropriateness 
of the models by testing the integrity, comparing the data in the 
models to the relevant agreements and testing key inputs to third 
party sources and publically available information where appropriate. 
The key inputs we focused on were the forecast results for each 
business, the probability range associated with future EBITDA 
forecasts and the discount rate.  
We compared the forecast results with the latest Board approved 
budgets and considered the results of the testing performed on the 
same forecasts for the impairment area of focus above. 
The nature of the valuation of the contingent consideration results 
in a number of scenarios where a reasonably probable change in 
the assumptions may materially impact the fair value. We therefore 
considered directors’ proposed disclosures and found them to be 
reasonable in light of our procedures. 
The provision for uncertain tax positions and the 
recognition and disclosure of tax losses 
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee Report), note 4 (Significant 
Accounting Policies) and note 10 (Income tax expense) 
The Group has unresolved tax positions in the UK, the valuation 
of which is a judgemental area. 
There is significant judgement applied in determining the Group’s 
deferred tax assets relating to tax losses, in terms of both 
recognition and disclosure. 
We assessed the key judgements with respect to open positions 
and settlements and read correspondence with the taxation 
authorities. We obtained evidence to support the provisions and 
consider these to reflect the directors’ best estimates. 
We assessed whether there was evidence to determine that 
additional deferred tax assets should be recognised or disclosed, 
taking into account forecast profits and the Board’s approved 
tax strategy. 
We concluded that the position adopted in the financial statements 
was reasonable.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF

 Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Nature and presentation of exceptional items 
Refer to page 47 (Audit Committee Report), note 2 (Basis of 
Preparation) and note 6 (Exceptional items) 
The financial statements include certain items which are disclosed 
as ‘exceptional’. The most significant of these exceptional charges 
are: 
— 
Impairment loss of £44.5 million; 
— 
Loss on shop closures of £30.7 million; and 
— 
A provision for indirect tax liabilities of £5.7 million 
Total exceptional items amounted to £74.5 million. 
We focused on this area because exceptional items are not defined 
by IFRSs and it therefore requires judgement regarding their size 
and nature by the directors to identify such items. Consistency in 
identifying and disclosing items as exceptional is important to 
maintain comparability of the results year on year.  
We assessed the appropriateness and application of the Group’s 
accounting policy in respect of those items classified as exceptional 
in nature.  
We tested the presentation of the exceptional items in the financial 
statements by assessing whether the classification was in line with 
the Group’s accounting policy on exceptional items set out in note 2 
of the financial statements and whether, in our view it was 
reasonable for these items to be separately disclosed as 
exceptional. We found that the Group’s accounting policy had been 
followed. 
 
 
How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure 
of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the Group operates.  
The Group is structured into five reportable segments being UK 
Retail, European Retail, Digital, Core Telephone Betting and High 
Rollers. The Consolidated financial statements are a consolidation 
of reporting units that make up the five reportable segments and 
Corporate costs. 
We identified four of the Group’s reporting units (UK Retail, UK Digital 
and two reporting units included within Corporate costs) to require an 
audit of their complete financial information, due to their size or risk 
characteristics. In addition we performed specified procedures on 
revenue and receivables in the High Rollers reportable segment due 
to risk of fraud in revenue recognition. 
All work was undertaken by the Group engagement team. The 
Group consolidation and a number of complex areas were audited 
centrally. This included tax, share based payments and pensions. 
Our audit scope addressed over 80% of the Group’s revenue and 
profit before tax and exceptional items. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent 
of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, 
both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £5.6 million 
How we determined it 5% of profit before tax and exceptional 
items 
Rationale for  
benchmark applied 
We applied this benchmark because, in 
our view, this is the metric against which 
the performance of the Group is most 
commonly measured and because in our 
view this is the most relevant measure of 
recurring performance. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £0.3 million as well 
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted 
reporting for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ 
statement, set out on page 31, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded 
that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using the 
going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources to 
remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for 
at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. 
As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the 
going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our responsibilities and those of the directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of directors’ responsibilities 
set out on page 71, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true 
and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. 
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of:  
— 
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed;  
— 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the directors; and 
— 
the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the 
directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our 
own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial 
statements.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 8 
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
1 CORPORATE INFORMATION 
Ladbrokes plc (the Company) is a public limited company 
incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom whose shares are 
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The address of its 
registered office and principal place of business is disclosed in the 
corporate information section of the Annual Report. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its 
subsidiaries (together, ‘the Group’) for the year ended 31 December 
2014 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the 
directors on 25 February 2015.  
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 5. 
2 BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been 
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) and International Financial Reporting 
Interpretations Committee (IFRICs) pronouncements as adopted for 
use in the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable 
to companies reporting under IFRSs.  
The Group financial statements are prepared under the historical cost 
convention unless otherwise stated. The statements are also 
prepared on a going concern basis. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Pounds 
Sterling (£), which is the Group’s functional and presentational 
currency. All values are in millions (£m) rounded to one decimal place 
except where otherwise indicated. 
To assist in understanding its underlying performance, the Group has 
defined the following items of pre-tax income and expense as 
exceptional in nature: 
— 
profits or losses on disposal, closure or impairment of non-current 
assets or businesses; 
— 
unrealised gains and losses on derivative financial instruments;  
— 
corporate transaction costs; and 
— 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration 
— 
the related tax effect of these items. 
Any other non-recurring items are considered individually for 
classification as exceptional by virtue of their nature and size. 
The separate disclosure of these items allows a clearer 
understanding of the trading performance on a consistent and 
comparable basis, together with an understanding of the effect 
of non-recurring or large individual transactions upon the overall 
profitability of the Group. 
The exceptional items have been included within the appropriate 
classifications in the consolidated income statement.  
3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
From 1 January 2014 the Group has applied, for the first time, certain 
standards, interpretations and amendments. These include IFRS 10 
Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and 
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities.  
The Group has applied IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in other 
entities. The disclosures relate to an entity's interests in subsidiaries, 
joint arrangements, associates and structured entities. The Group 
has included additional disclosures to reflect the requirements of the 
standard (see notes 16 and 17). 
The Group has applied IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. This standard 
removes the option to account for jointly controlled entities using 
proportionate consolidation. The Group has historically used the 
equity method of accounting and therefore this update has had no 
impact on the financial position or results. 
The Group has applied IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements. 
The changes require management to exercise significant judgement 
to determine which entities are controlled (see basis of consolidation 
for definition of control) and therefore, are required to be consolidated 
by the parent, compared with the requirements that were in IAS 27. 
This change has had no impact on the financial position or results. 
4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Group at 31 December each year. The underlying 
financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same 
reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. 
Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to 
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect these returns through its power over the investee. 
All intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are 
eliminated on consolidation. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated, using the acquisition method of 
accounting, from the date on which control is transferred to the 
Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control 
is transferred from the Group.  
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a 
subsidiary are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Any 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the separately 
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where 
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of 
subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those 
used by the Group. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
The preparation of financial information requires the use of 
assumptions, estimates and judgements about future conditions. 
Use of available information and application of judgement are 
inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future may 
differ from those reported. In this regard, management believes that 
the accounting policies where judgement is necessarily applied are 
those that relate to: the measurement and impairment of goodwill 
and indefinite life intangible assets; the measurement and accounting 
for business combinations; the measurement of pension and other 
post-employment benefit obligations; the determination of the initial 
fair value of betting and gaming transactions; the recoverable amount 
of trade receivables; income tax and the valuation of financial 
guarantee contracts.The estimates and underlying assumptions 
are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates 
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. 
Further information about key assumptions concerning the future and 
other key sources of estimation uncertainty are set out below. 
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
The Group has determined that betting shop licences have indefinite 
lives (see note 13 for further details). 
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite life intangible 
assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an 
estimation of the ‘value in use’ of the cash generating units to which 
the goodwill and intangible assets are allocated. Estimating a value 
in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the 
expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit and also to 
choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value 
of those cash flows. Further details are given in notes 13 and 14.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  9 
 
 
Business combinations 
The Group applies judgement in determining whether a transaction is 
a business combination, which includes consideration as to whether 
the Group has acquired a business or a group of assets. 
For business combinations, the Group estimates the fair value of the 
consideration transferred, which includes assumptions about the 
future business performance of the business acquired and an 
appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of any 
contingent consideration. Judgement is also applied in determining 
whether any future payments should be classified as contingent 
consideration or as remuneration for future services. 
The Group then estimates the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed in the business combination, including any 
separately identifiable intangible assets. These estimates also require 
inputs and assumptions including future earnings, customer attrition 
rates and discount rates. The Group engages external experts to 
support the valuation process, where appropriate. 
The fair value of contingent consideration recognised in business 
combinations is reassessed at each reporting date, using updated 
inputs and assumptions based on the latest financial forecasts for 
the relevant business. Judgement is applied as to whether changes 
should be applied at the acquisition date or as post-acquisition 
changes. Further details of these judgements are given in note 33. 
Fair value movements and the unwinding of the discounting is 
recognised within operating expenses. 
Pension and other post-employment benefit obligations 
The cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post-
employment benefits is determined using actuarial valuations. The 
actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount 
rates, expected rates of return on assets, future salary increases, 
mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term 
nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant 
uncertainty. Further details are given in note 29. 
Betting and gaming transactions 
Betting and gaming transactions are measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable from customers. This is normally 
the nominal amount of the consideration but on certain occasions, 
the fair value is estimated using valuation techniques, taking into 
account the credit profile of customers in determining the 
collectability of the consideration. In addition, where there are 
indicators that any trade receivable is impaired at the balance sheet 
date, management makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable 
amount. Further details are given in note 18. 
Income tax 
The Group is subject to tax in a number of jurisdictions.  
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for 
income taxes due to uncertainty of the amount of income tax that 
may be payable, and in respect of determining the level of the 
future taxable profits of the Group that support the recognition 
and recoverability of deferred tax assets. Further details are given 
in note 10. 
Provisions in relation to uncertain tax positions are established on an 
individual rather than portfolio basis, considering whether, in each 
circumstance, the Group considers it more likely than not that the 
uncertainty will crystalise. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The valuation of financial guarantee contracts and related indemnities 
requires use of assumptions of the risks of default of the guaranteed 
entities and the credit profiles of the counterparties. Further details 
are given in note 24. 
Investments in joint ventures  
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on 
a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and 
one or more other venturers under a contractual agreement.  
Management has assessed whether it has joint control of the 
arrangement. Joint control exists only when decisions about the 
relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that 
collectively control the arrangement. In assessing this joint control no 
significant judgements have been necessary. 
The Group’s share of results of joint ventures is included in the 
Group consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in joint ventures are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment 
in value. The carrying value of investments in joint ventures includes 
acquired goodwill. 
If the Group’s share of losses in the joint venture equals or exceeds 
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has incurred obligations to do so or made 
payments on behalf of the joint venture.  
Investments in associates 
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term 
interest and is able to exercise significant influence over the financial 
and operational policies but does not have control or joint control 
over those policies. 
The Group’s share of results of associates is included in the Group 
consolidated income statement using the equity method of 
accounting. Investments in associates are carried in the Group 
consolidated balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of net assets of the entity less any impairment in 
value. The carrying value of investments in associates includes 
acquired goodwill. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess 
of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in 
the net fair value of the separately identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of 
acquisition. In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, 
goodwill is not amortised but reviewed annually for impairment and 
as such, is stated at cost less any provision for impairment of value. 
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. On acquisition, 
any goodwill acquired is allocated to cash generating units for the 
purpose of impairment testing. Where goodwill forms part of a cash 
generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed 
of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included 
in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or 
loss on disposal of the operation.  
Intangible assets 
Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and 
those acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised 
separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on 
initial recognition. The costs relating to internally generated intangible 
assets, principally software costs, are capitalised if the criteria for 
recognition as assets are met. Other expenditure is charged in the 
year in which the expenditure is incurred. Following initial recognition, 
intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated 
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.

The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either 
finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite 
lives, this expense is taken to the consolidated income statement 
through the ‘depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off non-
current assets’ line item. Useful lives are reviewed on an annual 
basis.  
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment 
annually at the cash generating unit level.

An intangible asset is derecognised upon disposal, with any gain or 
loss arising (calculated as the difference between the net disposal 
proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) included in the 
consolidated income statement in the year of disposal. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Land is stated at cost less any impairment in value. Buildings, plant 
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
any impairment in value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight 
line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value 
over its useful economic life as follows: Buildings – 50 years or 
estimated useful life of the building, or lease, whichever is less, to 
estimated residual value. 
Fixtures, fittings and equipment – four to 10 years as considered 
appropriate to write down cost to estimated residual value. 
The carrying values of plant and equipment are reviewed for 
impairment annually as to whether there are events or changes 
in circumstances indicating that the carrying values may not be 
recoverable. If any such indication exists and where the carrying 
values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets or cash 
generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount of plant and equipment is the greater of fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to 
the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent 
cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash 
generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement in the ‘depreciation and amounts written off non-current 
assets’ line item. 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon 
disposal, with any gain or loss arising (calculated as the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
item) included in the consolidated income statement in the year 
of disposal. 
Leases 
Leases that transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and 
benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item are capitalised 
at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased item or, 
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. 
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges 
and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are charged directly against income. 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term. 
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the benefits and 
risks of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. 
Operating lease payments, other than contingent rentals, are 
recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement 
on a straight line basis over the lease term. 
Recoverable amount of non-current assets 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any 
indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of 
impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the 
recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds 
its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is 
written down to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is 
the higher of an asset’s or cash generating unit’s fair value less costs 
to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, 
unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely 
independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in 
hand, short-term deposits with an original maturity of less than three 
months and customer balances, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised when the Group becomes party 
to the contracts that give rise to them. 
The Group classifies financial assets at inception as loans and 
receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or 
available-for-sale financial assets. 
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed 
or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. 
On initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value 
net of transaction costs. Subsequently, the fair values are measured 
at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any 
allowance for impairment. 
Trade receivables are generally accounted for at amortised cost. 
The Group reviews indicators of impairment on an ongoing basis 
and where such indicators exist, the Group makes an estimate of 
the asset’s recoverable amount. 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative 
financial instruments. Financial assets through profit or loss are 
measured initially at fair value with transaction costs taken directly to 
the consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured, and gains and losses are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement. 
Available for sale financial assets comprise equity investments that 
are neither classified as held for trading nor designated at fair value 
through profit or loss. Available for sale financial assets are measured 
initially at fair value. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured, 
and gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income.  
85 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 11 
 
 
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables, interest 
bearing loans and borrowings, contingent consideration, ante-post 
bets, guarantees and derivative financial instruments. On initial 
recognition, financial liabilities are measured at fair value plus 
transaction costs where they are not categorised as financial liabilities 
at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss include contingent consideration, derivative 
financial instruments, ante-post bets and guarantees. 
Trade and other payables are held at amortised cost and include 
amounts due to clients representing customer deposits and 
winnings, which is offset by an equal and opposite amount within 
cash and cash equivalents  
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the 
consolidated income statement. Subsequently, the fair values 
are remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
All interest bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair 
value net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial 
recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. 
The Group has provided financial guarantees to third parties in 
respect of lease obligations of certain of the Group’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. Financial guarantee 
contracts are classified as financial liabilities and are measured at fair 
value by estimating the probability of the guarantees being called 
upon and the related cash outflows from the Group. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities  
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash 
flows from the assets has expired or when the Group has transferred 
its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the financial assets 
or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full 
without material delay to a third party, and either: 
— 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or 
— 
substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained 
nor transferred but control is not retained. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Derivative financial instruments 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross 
currency swaps, foreign exchange swaps and interest rate swaps, 
to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency 
fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially 
and subsequently at fair value. The gains or losses on 
remeasurement are taken to the consolidated income statement. 
Derivative financial instruments are classified as assets where their 
fair value is positive, or as liabilities where their fair value is negative. 
Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are 
only offset if the transactions are with the same counterparty, a legal 
right of offset exists and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on 
a net basis. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an 
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the 
amount of the obligation. 
Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate of the 
expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material 
using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of 
the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance expense. 
Foreign currency translation 
The presentation and functional currency of Ladbrokes plc and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries are Pounds Sterling (£). 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in sterling 
at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the foreign currency rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the 
consolidated income statement. Non-monetary items that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial 
transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign 
currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the 
fair value was determined. 
The main functional currencies of overseas subsidiaries is the Euro (€) 
and the Australian Dollar ($). At the reporting date, the assets and 
liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into Pounds 
Sterling (£) at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
and their income statements are translated at the average exchange 
rates for the year. The post-tax exchange differences arising on the 
retranslation are taken directly to a separate component of equity. 
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount 
recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign entity is 
recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Income tax 
Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary 
differences at the balance sheet date, between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting 
purposes. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences: 
— 
except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a 
business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor the tax profit; and 
— 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can 
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary 
differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused 
tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will 
be available against which the deductible temporary differences 
and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses 
can be utilised: 
— 
except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible 
temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, 
at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit 
nor the tax profit; and 
— 
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the deductible 
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and 
taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or 
part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the 
liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax balances are not discounted. 
Interest or penalties payable and receivable in relation to income 
tax are recognised as an income tax expense or credit in the 
consolidated income statement. The impact of the change in the 
current year is described in note 10. 
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is 
recognised in equity and not in the consolidated income statement. 
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of 
sales tax except: 
— 
where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services 
is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the 
sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the 
asset or as  
— 
part of the expense item as applicable; and 
— 
receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales 
tax included. 
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the 
taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the 
consolidated balance sheet. 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits 
The Group’s defined benefit pension plan, the Ladbrokes 
Pension Plan holds assets separately from the Group. The 
pension cost relating to this plan is assessed in accordance with 
the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method.  
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. 
Any past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that 
the benefits have already vested and otherwise is amortised on a 
straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest. 
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet 
represents the fair value of scheme assets less the value of the 
defined benefit obligations as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost. 
The Group’s contributions to defined contribution schemes are 
charged to the consolidated income statement in the period to 
which the contributions relate. 
In accounting for the Group’s defined benefit pension plan, it is 
necessary for management to make a number of estimates and 
assumptions each year. These include the discount rates, future 
changes to salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life 
expectancy. In making these estimates and assumptions, 
management considers advice provided by external advisers, such 
as actuaries. Where actual experience differs to these estimates, 
actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. Refer 
to note 29 for details of the values of assets and obligations and 
key assumptions used. 
Although the Group anticipates that plan surpluses will be utilised 
during the life of the plan to address member benefits, the Group 
recognises its pension surplus in full on the basis that it does not 
consider there to be substantive restrictions on the return of residual 
plan assets in the event of a winding up of the plan after all member 
obligations have been met. The related tax is accounted on an 
income basis. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own 
equity instruments. 
ESOP trusts 
Where the Group holds its own equity shares through ESOP trusts 
these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any consideration 
paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in 
the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and no gain 
or loss is recognised within the consolidated income statement or the 
statement of comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or 
cancellation of these shares. 
Dividends 
Final dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the 
year end are not recognised in the financial statements until they 
have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. 
Revenue 
The Group reports the gains and losses on all betting and gaming 
activities as revenue, which is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable from customers less free bets, 
promotions, bonuses and other fair value adjustments. Gross win 
includes free bets, promotions and bonuses, as well as VAT payable 
on machine income. 
For licensed betting offices, on course betting, Core Telephone 
Betting, mobile betting, High Rollers, Digital businesses (including 
sportsbook, betting exchange, casino, games, other number bets), 
revenue represents gains and losses, being the amounts staked and 
fees received, less total payouts and the fair value of reward points 
issued from betting activity in the period. Open betting positions are 
carried at fair value and gains and losses arising on these positions 
are recognised in revenue. 
When a bet is placed and reward points are issued under the Odds 
On loyalty card scheme, the fair value of the reward points is deferred 
and recorded as a liability. The deferred revenue is recognised when 
the reward points are used or when they expire. 
Revenue from the online poker business reflects the net income 
(rake) earned from poker games completed by the period end. 
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income 
arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, 
including sales of refreshments. 
Finance expense and income 
Finance expense and income arising on interest bearing financial 
instruments carried at amortised cost are recognised in the 
consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate 
method. Finance expense includes the amortisation of fees that are 
an integral part of the effective finance cost of a financial instrument, 
including issue costs, and the amortisation of any other differences 
between the amount initially recognised and the redemption price. 
Net gains and losses in respect of mark-to-market adjustments on 
financial instruments carried at fair value, foreign exchange 
adjustments and net gains and losses on financial guarantees are 
included in exceptional items in the consolidated income statement. 
Share-based payment transactions 
Certain employees (including directors) of the Group receive 
remuneration in the form of equity settled share-based payment 
87 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 13 
 
 
transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for 
shares or rights over shares (equity settled transactions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is measured by reference to 
the fair value at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is 
determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given 
in note 30. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken 
of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the 
price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the 
opinion of the directors of the Group at that date, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately 
vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional 
share dilution in the computation of earnings per share as shown 
in note 12. 
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee 
share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives 
and senior employees.  
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as 
treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction 
from equity. Refer to consolidated statement of changes in equity. 
Future accounting developments 
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet 
effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial 
statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these 
standards, if applicable, when they become effective. None of these 
is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial 
statements of the Group, except the following set out below: 
IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, addresses the classification, 
measurement and recognition of financial assets and liabilities was 
issued in July 2014. IFRS 9 retains and establishes three primary 
measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair 
value through OCI and fair value through P&L. The basis of the 
classification depends on the business model and the contractual 
cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity 
instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit 
or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in 
fair value in OCI not recycling. There is now a new expected credit 
losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model 
used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to 
classification and measurement except for the recognition of 
changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for 
liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. The standard 
is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group is yet to assess 
IFRS 9’s full impact. 
IFRS 15, ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ deals with 
revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, 
amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising 
from an entity's contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised 
when a customer obtains control of a good or service and thus has 
the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good 
or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 
‘Construction contracts’ and related interpretations. The standard is 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and 
earlier adoption is permitted. The Group is assessing the impact of 
IFRS 15. 
Both IFRS 15 and 9 are yet to be EU endorsed. 
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not 
yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact 
on the Group.  
Comparative information  
The 2013 consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement 
of cash flows has been represented to present customer deposits 
gross between trade payables and cash (£39.3 million). Trade and 
other payables due within one year now include amounts due to 
customers, representing deposits received. This is a change in the 
presentation on the balance sheet where previously the customer 
deposits were netted off against customer liabilities.  
There has also been a representation of the comparative amounts 
for deferred and corporation tax. Deferred tax and corporation 
tax are now shown net by jurisdiction in accordance with IAS 12. 
Deferred tax assets of £17.0 million have been shown net within 
deferred tax liabilities in 2013. Corporation tax assets (£5.8 million) 
have been presented gross in 2013. 
There is no impact on the financial position or the cash flow 
statement of the Group at 31 December 2014 and 2013 due to this 
change in presentation.

5 SEGMENT INFORMATION 
Management has determined the Group’s operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of directors to make 
strategic decisions and allocate resources. 
The performance of the Group is assessed and measured according to the nature of the services provided. IFRS 8 requires segment 
information to be presented on the same basis as that used by the Board for assessing performance and allocating resources, and the 
Group’s operating segments are aggregated into the five reportable segments detailed below: 
— 
UK Retail: comprises betting activities in the shop estate in Great Britain. 
— 
European Retail: comprises all activities connected with the Ireland (Northern and Republic of), Belgium and Spain shop estates. 
— 
Digital: comprises betting and gaming activities from online and mobile operations which includes Ladbrokes Israel, Ladbrokes Australia 
and Betdaq. 
— 
Core Telephone Betting: comprises activities relating to bets taken on the telephone, excluding High Rollers. 
— 
High Rollers: comprises activities primarily relating to bets taken on the telephone by High Rollers.  
The Board continues to assess the performance of operating segments based on a measure of net revenue, profit before tax and net finance 
expense. This measurement basis excludes the effect of exceptional items from the operating segments.

(1) Impairment loss of £44.5 million comprises a £18.7 million impairment of Retail shop licences, impairment of £2.1 million of shop assets and a £23.7 million asset 
impairment of which £23.1 million relates to software. The total £20.8 million shop impairment has arisen as a result of the annual licence impairment review and includes 
a £17.7 million charge in UK Retail and a £3.1 million charge in European Retail (Ireland). The £23.7 million asset impairment is primarily as a result of a decision to 
decommission a platform for desktop sportsbook (£23.0 million) and other IT assets impaired within UK Retail (£0.7 million) as no longer in use. 
(2) The £30.7 million loss on closure includes a £26.9 million loss on closure of UK Retail shops and a £3.8 million loss on closure of European Retail shops. These include a 
loss on disposal of intangible assets of £12.8 million, a loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment of £3.8 million and cost accruals of £14.1 million. 
(3) The Group incurred corporate transaction costs of £0.5 million in relation to the acquisition of Betstar Pty Ltd.  
(4) The fair value of the contingent consideration in respect of the business combinations with Playtech, Betdaq and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd in Australia has been re-
measured at 31 December 2014. This resulted in a credit to the income statement of £3.1 million. The net credit includes £3.1 million charge in respect of the contingent 
consideration for Gaming Investments Pty Ltd which was settled in the year for A$33.4 million (£18.4 million). 
(5) The Group closed its online operations in a number of jurisdictions following a review of regulatory requirements of operating in those jurisdictions, incurring costs of  
£3.8 million. These represent termination of contractual commitments in these jurisdictions. 
(6) The Group announced the closure of the defined benefit pension plan to future accruals from 31 August 2015. This resulted in a one-off non cash curtailment gain of  
£7.1 million partly offset by £2.3 million of associated costs. 
(7) The Group realised a profit of £3.9 million on the sale and leaseback of shops within the UK Retail estate. These assets had a net book value of £1.4 million. 
(8) The Group made a provision for a indirect tax liability arising from European market indirect tax changes. 
(9) During the period, the Group cancelled £135.0 million of committed loan facilities. The arrangement fees associated with these facilities of £0.6 million have been charged 
to exceptional finance expense in the period. In addition, the Group paid £0.5 million of interest to the HMRC in respect of the repayment of VAT in amusement machines.  
Operating expenses include corporate transaction costs, the fair value adjustment to contingent consideration, the net pension curtailment 
gain, the provision for gaming European indirect tax liability and £14.1 million of costs relating to the shop closures.  
In addition to the defined exceptional items set out in note 2 the Group considered the credits arising on the pension curtailment, profit on  
sale and leaseback, the charges in relation to grey markets exit, provision for European indirect tax liability and exceptional interest to be  
of sufficient materiality to be separately identified and of a nature unrelated to the underlying trading performance of the Group in the year.  
The cash flow effect of the exceptional items was an outflow of £4.9 million in the year.

In addition to salary, employees may qualify for various benefit schemes operated by the Group. Eligibility for benefits is normally determined 
primarily according to an employee’s length of service and level of responsibility. The amounts of some benefits are proportionate to individual 
salary. 
Benefits may include paid leave for holidays, maternity and illness, as well as insured benefits. The latter can cover private healthcare for the 
employee and their immediate family, long-term disability, personal accident and death in service cover. Company cars, including fuel 
benefits, are provided predominantly to meet job requirements but also to certain executives. 
The principal benefit schemes are: 
(i) Pensions 
Ladbrokes Pension Scheme (LPS) 
Under the auto-enrolment legislation, employees meeting the statutory eligibility requirements are automatically enrolled in the LPS, a 
defined contribution scheme. The contributions paid by the Group and employees meet those statutorily required. Subject to meeting 
certain eligibility and employment grade criteria, employees can choose for the Group to match their contributions up to specified limits. 
For the majority of employees the maximum match is 6% of broadly base salary. The maximum match is higher for some employees, 
depending upon grade.  
(ii) Ladbrokes Pension Plan (LPP) 
This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007. Members contribute on average six per cent of pensionable salary per annum. 
Benefit generally accrues to provide a target pension of half (for joiners before June 2002: two thirds) of final pensionable salary for an 
employee attaining age 65 with at least 40 years’ membership. A spouse’s pension is payable following death. See note 29 for further 
details. 
LPP – Executive Section 
Members contribute on average seven per cent of pensionable salary per annum. Benefit accrues to provide a target pension from all 
sources of two thirds of final pensionable salary for an executive attaining age 65 with at least 26.7 years’ membership (for joiners 
before June 2002, employees attaining age 60 with at least 20 years’ service). A spouse’s and children’s pensions are payable 
following death. 
LPP incorporates an Earnings Cap on Pensionable Salary. Executive directors and senior executives, for whom this applies, have a 
choice between: 
(i) membership of the Executive Section of the LPP plus a cash supplement of up to 22.5 per cent of base salary in excess of the 
Earnings Cap; or 
(ii) a cash supplement of up to 22.5 per cent of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP. 
(ii) Share-based payments 
Details of employee share schemes operated by the Group are shown in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 52 to 69 that forms 
part of the Annual Report 2014. 
Details of options granted in 2014 and outstanding at 31 December 2014 are shown in note 30. Details of directors’ remuneration and the 
policies adopted in determining it can be found in the Directors’ remuneration report on pages 52 to 69.

Deferred tax assets of £15.9 million are to be recovered after more than 12 months. Deferred tax liabilities of £82.7 million are to be recovered 
after more than 12 months.  
The Group has further tax losses at 31 December 2014 of £76.5 million (2013: £78.6 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against 
future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as 
there is insufficient certainty that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of temporary differences may be deducted. 
There are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures. 
The standard rate of UK Corporation Tax was reduced from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014. This will be further reduced to 20% from 
April 2015. 
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 20%. The reduction 
to 20%, effective 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. Neither the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to crystallise 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date

12 EARNINGS PER SHARE 
Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company of £41.0 million 
(2013: £67.0 million) by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 921.4 million (2013: 917.1 million). 
At 31 December 2014, there were 922.9 million 28
1
/3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares (954.6 million including 
treasury shares). At 31 December 2013, there were 919.4 million 28
1
/3 pence ordinary shares in issue excluding treasury shares (951.2 million 
including treasury shares). 
At 31 December 2014, 5.8 million (2013: 2.4 million) shares were deemed anti-dilutive for the purpose of calculating adjusted earnings 
per share. 
The calculation of adjusted earnings per share before exceptional items is included as it provides a better understanding of the underlying 
performance of the Group. Exceptional items are defined in note 2 and disclosed in note 6.

Goodwill relates to the consideration exceeding the fair value of net assets of business combinations including the deferred tax liability arising 
on statutory licence acquisitions.  
During the current year, goodwill has been recognised on the business combination of Betstar (£8.0 million). In the prior year, goodwill 
additions related to the following acquisitions; Playtech (£34.9 million), Betdaq (£31.5 million) and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd (£23.0 million). 
Goodwill additions in the year relate to the recognition of a deferred tax liability on customer relationships relating to the acquisition of the 
Group’s former partner in the Nordic region. 
Licences comprises the cost of acquired betting shop licences. The acquired betting shop licences are not amortised as they are considered 
to have an indefinite life for a combination of reasons: 
— 
Ladbrokes is a leading operator in well-established markets; 
— 
there is a proven, sustained demand for bookmaking services; 
— 
existing law acts to restrict entry; and 
— 
Ladbrokes has a very strong track record of renewing its betting permits and licences at minimal cost. 
Software relates to the cost of software acquisition and the capitalised costs in respect of internally generated software together with software 
acquired as part of business combinations.  
The customer relationships intangible assets relate to the Group’s acquisition of its former partner in the Nordic region, acquisitions in the prior 
year of Betdaq and Gaming Gaming Investments Pty and the current year acquisition of Betstar Pty.  
Brand and domain names intangible assets relate to the Group’s acquisitions in the prior year of Betdaq and Gaming Investments Pty Ltd and 
the current year acquisition of Betstar Pty.

14 IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually for impairment at each reporting date by comparing the carrying amounts of 
these assets with their recoverable amounts (being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). 
Goodwill 
Goodwill is tested for impairment by allocating its carrying amount to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a group of CGUs exceeds its carrying amount, the Group and any goodwill 
allocated to that Group would be regarded as not impaired. The carrying amounts of goodwill by segment are as follows: 
 
2014 
£m 
2013 
£m 
Goodwill   
UK Retail 35.4 35.4 
European Retail 12.7 12.7 
Digital 111.1 90.5 
 159.2 138.6 
No impairments were identified in both years. 
Licences 
Licences have been allocated to the individual UK and European Retail CGUs that are expected to benefit from the assets. Each CGU 
represents the lowest level within the Group at which the licences are monitored for internal management purposes which in the majority of 
instances is an individual shop. Where the cash flows of one or more shops are not entirely independent, these are grouped to form a CGU. 
The carrying value of licences at 31 December 2014 was £447.1 million (2013: £486.1 million) allocated as £284.5 million to UK Retail (2013: 
£311.7 million) and £162.6 million to European Retail (2013: £174.4 million). 
Basis on which recoverable amount has been determined 
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. These are based on budgets approved by 
management for the next three years extrapolated thereafter using a 1% growth rate (2013: 2.5%). This rate does not exceed the average 
long-term growth rate for the relevant markets. 
Key assumptions used in value in use calculations 
The key assumptions taken into account by management are the amounts staked, the gross win margin and the discount rate applied. 
The estimated amounts staked and gross win margin are based upon historic experience, management’s best estimate of future trends and 
performance taking account of industry sources. The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections for CGUs in UK Retail is 10.8% 
(2013: 12.4%), in European Retail is between 9.4% and 10.4% (2013: between 9.6% and 9.9%) and in Digital is 9.6% (2013: 11.0%). 
The recoverable amounts of certain individual UK Retail CGUs were below their carrying amounts at 31 December 2014 and accordingly 
an impairment loss of £26.8 million has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: 
£13.7 million) offset by impairment reversals of £9.1 million within the ‘Depreciation, amortisation and amounts written off non-current assets’ 
line as an exceptional item. In respect of European Retail shop licences there has been a charge of £13.1 million at 31 December 2014 offset 
by impairment reversals of £10.0 million (2013: £2.3 million).  
The recoverable amount of individual CGUs is sensitive to changes in cash flows or discount rate. Change in the cash flow projections or the 
discount rate would trigger a further impairment loss. For example, an increase of 0.5% in the pre-tax discount rate would have resulted in an 
additional impairment loss of approximately £7.9 million (2013: £2.5 million) for UK Retail and £3.2 million (2013: £2.2 million) for European 
Retail, or a reduction in projected cash flows of 5% would have resulted in an additional impairment loss of approximately £4 million (2013: 
£8.8 million) for UK Retail and £3.3 million (2013: £10.1 million) for European Retail. An assumption of no growth after 2019 would have 
resulted in an increase in impairment loss of approximately £9.9 million for UK Retail and £4.8 million for European Retail. For Digital, no 
reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in an impairment.

£23.0 million expires on 1 December 2016, £94.0 million expires on 13 June 2019. 
The Group issued a £100.0 million retail eligible bond at par on 16 June 2014 that matures in September 2022. The bond carries a coupon of 
5.125%, paid semi annually in arrears, the first interest period being a short period to 16 September 2014. Proceeds from the bond were 
used to pay down drawings under the bank facilities. 
The Group also extended the maturity on £350.0 million of its committed bank facilities on 13 June 2014 to 13 June 2019 at floating interest 
rates. At the same time £135.0 million of committed bank facilities were cancelled, leaving a total of £405.0 million of committed bank facilities. 
As at 31 December 2014, the committed bank facilities maturities are £350.0 million (2013: nil) on 13 June 2019 and £55.0 million (2013: 
£540.0 million) on 1 December 2016. 
The Group has undrawn committed bank facilities of £283.0 million at 31 December 2014 (2013: £333.7 million). 
The Group had £nil (2013: £0.5 million) overdraft denominated in Australian dollars and a £0.4 million (2013: £0.1 million) overdraft 
denominated in Euros at 31 December 2014. All of the Group’s remaining borrowings in 2014 and 2013 were denominated in pounds 
sterling.

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES 
The Group’s treasury function provides a centralised service for the provision of finance and the management and control of liquidity, foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Group’s treasury exposures to reduce risk in 
accordance with policies approved by the Board. 
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, and cash and 
short-term deposits, together with certain derivative financial instruments. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables, trade payables and accruals that 
arise directly from its operations. At 31 December 2014 and at 31 December 2013 the Group had no significant derivatives. 
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken other than 
betting and gaming transactions. The Group’s exposure to ante-post betting and gaming transactions is not significant. 
The main financial risks for the Group are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Board reviews and agrees 
policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all 
financial instruments. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents. 
The Group’s policy for the year ended 31 December 2014 was to maintain a minimum of 25% (2013: 25%) of total borrowings at fixed 
interest rates to reduce its sensitivity to movements in variable short-term interest rates. At 31 December 2014, £322.3 million or 73.4% 
(2013: £223.0 million or 52.8%) of the Group’s gross borrowings were at fixed rates. 
Interest on financial instruments at floating rates is re-priced at intervals of less than six months. Interest on financial instruments at fixed rates 
is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. 
Interest rate sensitivity 
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this 
movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.

2013 
£m 
100 basis points increase  0.1 (0.2)  – – 
200 basis points increase 0.2 –  – – 
The sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities, subject 
to interest at floating rates, held by the Group at the year end. Due to current low interest rates, any further decline would not have a material 
impact on income and equity for the year. As such, sensitivity to a decrease in interest rates has not been presented. 
Foreign currency risk 
Other than the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries, there is no significant foreign currency exposure. 
The total carrying value of the Group’s foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2014 was £0.4 million (2013: £0.6 million). This consisted 
of a £nil (2013: £0.5 million) overdraft denominated in Australian dollars and a £0.4 million (2013: £0.1 million) overdraft denominated in Euros. 
The Group had no other foreign currency borrowings at 31 December 2014 (2013: £nil).

23 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED 
Credit risk 
The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties 
and customers. 
It is the Group’s policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable 
balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an 
individual basis. 
The Group’s High Rollers division consists of individuals who place sizeable stakes. The Group manages this activity and the associated 
risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise to manage the levels of stakes placed. Of the £7.5 million (2013: £2.4 million) trade 
receivables balance, £3.2 million (2013: £2.2 million) relates to the Group’s Core Telephone Betting and High Rollers divisions. 
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and a loan to a joint 
venture, the Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount 
of these instruments. Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a 
defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank. 
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group. This risk is partly mitigated 
by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees. For further detail of these 
guarantees refer to note 24. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of borrowings with a range of 
maturities. The Group’s policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium-term and long-term committed borrowing facilities to 
meet the medium-term funding requirements. At 31 December 2014, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £283.0 million 
(2013: £333.7 million). Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 4.1 years (2013: 2.9 years). 
The total gross contractual undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities, including interest payments, fall due as follows. Cash flows in 
respect of financial guarantee contracts reflect the probability weighted cash flows. The maximum exposure is described in note 24.

Capital risk management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a credit quality that enables the Group to raise  
funds at an economic interest rate and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.  
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the 
capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. 
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio (before exceptional items). The target range is less than 2.0 (2013: less than 2.0) 
times net debt to EBITDA ratio. The ratio at 31 December 2014 was 1.9 (2.1 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers) and at  
31 December 2013 was 1.9 (2.0 adjusted to remove profit from High Rollers). 
The Group’s funding policy is to raise funds centrally to meet the Group’s anticipated requirements. These are planned so as to mature at 
different stages in order to reduce refinancing risk. The Board reviews the Group’s capital structure and liquidity periodically.

Fair value of financial instruments 
Assets and liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss and available for sale financial assets are carried at fair value. The fair 
value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity. The fair value of the £225 million 7.625% bond 
at 31 December 2014 was £244.3 million (2013: £252.9 million) and is classified as a level 1 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes, 
as the fair value is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities. The fair value of the £100 million 5.125% bond 
at 31 December 2014 was £100.2 million and is classified as a level 1 fair value measurement for disclosure purposes, as the fair value is 
determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities. The amortised cost of interest bearing loans and borrowings, 
with the exception of the £225 million 7.625% bond and the £100 million 5.125% bond, and the carrying value of all other assets and liabilities 
approximates to fair value.

Included within other financial assets is the Group’s investment in TBHG, a financial asset measured at initial fair value of £3.4 million on 
28 February 2013 which was acquired in connection with the business combination with Betdaq. There have been no changes in the fair 
value of the investment at 31 December 2014. 
Included in trade and other payables are £5.3 million of ante-post liabilities (2013: £5.9 million). Ante post liabilities are valued using methods 
and inputs that are not based upon observable market data. There are no reasonably probable changes to assumptions or inputs that would 
lead to material changes in the fair value determined, although the final value will be determined by future sporting results. The principal 
assumptions relate to anticipated gross win margins on unsettled bets. Other current financial liabilities are deferred revenues associated  
with the fair value of reward points issued. 
Included within other non-current financial liabilities is contingent consideration associated with business combinations of £32.1 million (2013: 
£53.6 million), classified as level 3 financial instruments, as its fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not 
based on observable market data. The fair values are remeasured at each reporting date and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recorded in the consolidated income statement within exceptional items (note 6).  
Betdaq 
Betdaq contingent consideration is linked to the performance of the business over a four year period and is capped at €535.0 million.  
The fair value of the contingent consideration has been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the balance sheet date. The key 
assumptions in estimating the fair value are the EBITDA projections of the Betdaq business for 2016, the predicted Ladbrokes plc EBITDA 
multiple in 2016 (7.6x) and the discount rate applied (15%). All of these assumptions have been applied on a probability-weighted basis.  
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, an increase of 10% in EBITDA projections would 
result in an increase in contingent consideration of £1.4 million and a decrease of 2% in the discount rate would result in an increase in 
contingent consideration of £0.1 million. A decrease in the EBITDA multiple of 2x would result in a decrease in contingent consideration 
of £0.7 million. 
Playtech 
The fair value of the contingent consideration in relation to Playtech has been estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis at the balance 
sheet date. The key assumptions in estimating the fair value are a range of EBITDA projections of the Digital business for 2017, which are 
based on the projections in place at the time of the acquisition and then updated with an estimated uplift for the benefits of the transaction, 
the predicted Ladbrokes plc EBITDA multiple in 2017 (7.6x); and the discount rate applied (a range of 13.6% to 26.6%, depending on the 
year). All of these assumptions have been applied on a probability-weighted basis. 
The contingent consideration is sensitive to changes in these assumptions. For example, an increase of 10% in EBITDA projections would 
result in an increase in contingent consideration of £10.4 million and a decrease of 2% in the discount rate would result in an increase in 
contingent consideration of £1.7 million. An increase of 1x in the EBITDA multiple would increase the contingent consideration by £4.2 million. 
Gaming Investments Pty 
On 28 October 2014, Ladbrokes agreed an early settlement of the Gaming Investments Pty Ltd total contingent consideration for 
A$33.4 million (£18.4 million) in cash. This compares to a recorded contingent consideration of A$28.3 million (£15.2 million) at 
31 December 2013. Ladbrokes had acquired Gaming Investments Pty Ltd in September 2013 for A$23.9 million (£13.9 million)  
plus the contingent consideration, now settled, of up to a cap of A$125.0 million (undiscounted estimate at date of acquisition). 
Other 
Also included within other non-current financial liabilities are financial guarantee contracts of £4.8 million (2013: £5.0 million), classified as 
level 3 financial instruments as their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market 
data. Further information about financial guarantee contracts, including sensitivities, and a reconciliation of changes in fair value in the year, 
is included below.

24 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES CONTINUED 
The intangible assets recognised on the acquisition of Betstar were measured at fair value on acquisition (as level 3 financial instruments as 
their fair value is measured using techniques where the significant inputs are not based on observable market data). However, these have not 
been included in the table above as they are not remeasured at fair value after initial recognition. A description of the valuation techniques, 
significant inputs and assumptions is described in note 33. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. The 
Group received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may 
subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a 
combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.  
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all years up to 2042 is £679.6 million (2013: £707.6 million), 
with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £434.8 million (2013: £449.5 million) 
in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £244.8 million (2013: £258.1 million) in relation to the minimum contractual 
based element. The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the 
Group has entered. 
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2014 is £258.7 million (2013: £303.9 million). Included in the net present 
value of the maximum exposure is £149.1 million (2013: £175.5 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 
£109.6 million (2013: £128.4 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.  
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations. 
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable 
in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.  
At 31 December 2014 the Group has recognised a financial liability of £4.8 million (2013: £5.0 million) in respect of these guarantees. 
In addition to the passage of time, the liability has reduced in 2014 due to a number of factors. The key assumption in the probability model 
is the hotels default rate. A rate of 1.5% has been used at 31 December 2014 (2013: 1.7%). The default rate has been reduced as the 
remaining hotels under guarantee are considered to be in prime locations and furthermore have not suffered financially through the recent UK 
and European recession. The £0.2 million credit arising as a result of these factors has been included within the Group’s corporate costs. The 
table below provides a breakdown of the movement in the liability since 1 January 2014:

£m 
At 1 January 2014   5.0 
Reduction due to passage of time and a change in discount rate  (0.2) 
At 31 December 2014  4.8 
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.4 million. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the 
discount rate would reduce the financial liability by £0.4 million.

29 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES  
Defined contribution schemes 
The total cost charged to the consolidated income statement of £3.1 million (2013: £2.2 million) represents contributions payable to these 
schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the scheme. 
Defined benefit plans 
The Group’s only significant defined benefit retirement plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, which is a final salary pension plan for UK 
employees. This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007 and it has been agreed with the Members and Trustees, after completing 
appropriate constitution, that the scheme will close to the future accrual from 31 August 2015. 
At retirement each member’s pension is related to their pensionable service and final pensionable salary. The weighted average duration of 
the expected benefit payments from the Plan is around 16 years.  
The Plan’s assets are held separately from those of the Group. The Plan is approved by HMRC for tax purposes, and is managed by an 
independent set of Trustees. The Plan is subject to UK regulations, which require the Group and Trustees to agree a funding strategy and 
contribution schedule at least every three years. Under the current contribution schedule in place, the Group pays contributions to the Plan 
of 22.2% of Pensionable salary roll in relation to the future accrual of benefits plus £0.75 million each year to cover the expenses of running 
the Plan plus £5.3 million each year until 30 April 2019. 
The contribution schedule has yet to be revised. Under this the Group will pay contributions to the Plan of 27.1% of Pensionable salary roll in 
relation to the future accrual of benefits until the closure of the Plan on 31 August 2015. Additionally the Group will pay £0.75 million each year 
to cover the expenses of running the Plan plus £0.125 million each month from April 2016 to June 2017. 
There is a risk to the Group that adverse experience could lead to a requirement for the Group to make additional contributions to recover any 
deficit that arises.  
The results of the formal actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2013 were updated to 31 December 2014 by an independent qualified actuary 
in accordance with IAS 19 (Revised) Employee Benefits. The value of the defined benefit obligation and current service cost have been 
measured using the projected unit credit method, as required by IAS 19 (Revised). Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately 
through other comprehensive income. 
The Plan is due to close to accrual on 31 August 2015. Members were informed of this change in December 2014, following a consultation 
exercise and as such the impact of this change has been recognised within the 2014 income statement, resulting in a gain of £7.1 million.

The Plan assets are held exclusively within instruments with quoted market prices in an active market with the exception of the holdings in an 
insurance policy. At 31 December 2014 these represented circa 0.2% of the Plan’s total assets.  
The Plan does not invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group. Although, as the Plan holds 
pooled investment vehicles, there may at times be indirect employer related investment. At 31 December 2014 these represented less than 
0.1% of the Plan’s total assets. 
The investment strategy is set by the Trustees of the Plan in consultation with the Group. The current long-term strategy is to invest in a 
matching portfolio sufficient to meet the next 16 years of cash flows with the remaining assets invested in return seeking funds.

29 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED 
The post-retirement mortality assumed for most members is based on the standard SAPS mortality table with the CMI 2012 projections, 
which takes into account future improvements, adjusted to reflect plan specific experience. The assumption used implies that the expected 
lifetime of members aged 65 in 2014 is 86.9 (2013: 86.9) years for males and 89.1 (2013: 88.5) years for females. For members with large 
pensions a longer lifetime is assumed (90.1 (2013: 90.2) for males and 91.1 (2013: 90.5) for females).  
Changes to the assumptions will impact the amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated income statement 
in respect of the plan. For the significant assumptions, the following sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the defined 
benefit obligation for the year ended 31 December 2014: 
 
2014 
% 
2013 
% 
– 0.5% pa decrease in the discount rate    8.3 8.3 
– 0.5% pa increase in price inflation 5.2 5.0 
– One year increase in life expectancy 2.4 2.4 
These sensitivities have been calculated to show the movement in the defined benefit obligation in isolation, and assuming no other changes 
in market conditions at the accounting date. This is unlikely in practice, for example, a change in discount rate is unlikely to occur without any 
movement in the value of the assets held by the Plan. 
30 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group has the following share-based payment plans, all of which are settled by equity: the Restricted Share Plan; the Deferred Bonus 
Plan; the Performance Share Plan; the Ladbrokes Growth Plan; the 2010 Share Award Plan; the International Share Option Scheme; the 
1978 Share Option Scheme; Sharesave; the OWN Plan; and Freeshare. The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed 
in more detail below: 
(i) Restricted Share Plan 
Awards made under the Restricted Share Plan will vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. 
(ii) Deferred Bonus Plan 
For certain senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after three years. For other employees, 
one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest after two years. 
(iii) Performance Share Plan 
An award under the Performance Share Plan consists of a conditional allocation of shares that will vest, subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions, at the end of the three year performance period. The awards have two separate performance conditions; half of the 
award vests based on TSR and half of the award vests based on EPS growth. 
(iv) Ladbrokes Growth Plan 
Awards are subject to share price growth performance conditions. Any share price target must be attained throughout a period of 30 
consecutive dealing days and performance is assessed over a five year period. Up to one third of the award may vest at the end of year three 
if the performance targets have been achieved at that time. A further third may vest at the end of year four if the targets have been met at that 
time. The remainder of the award may vest at the end of year five, subject to the achievement of the performance targets. 
(v) 2010 Share Award Plan 
An award under the 2010 Share Award Plan consists of a one-off compensatory share award to the Chief Executive in the form of a nil cost 
option. The award is not subject to performance conditions and is exercisable after three years from grant. 
(vi) International Share Option Scheme and the 1978 Share Option Scheme 
The share options granted are all market value options with a three year vesting period. Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised 
within 10 years of the date of grant. All options have an EPS growth based performance condition. Options have not been granted since 
2009 and there is no present intention to grant options in the future. 
(vii) 1983 Savings Related Share Option Scheme (‘Sharesave’) 
Under Sharesave, options are granted at a 20% discount to market value. The scheme operates with a savings period of either three or five 
years, at the end of which the option may be exercised. 
(viii) OWN Plan 
Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to £75 per month to acquire shares. For every one share purchased, the Group provides 
a match of one additional share. 
(ix) Freeshare 
Under Freeshare, an award of up to £250 in value was made to participating employees on reaching one year’s service. Freeshares have not 
been awarded since 2010 and there is no present intention to make awards in the future.

pence (31 December 2013: 178.9 pence). The total value of these shares is £10.2 million (2013: £7.0 million). 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was £1.35 (2013: £2.15). The weighted 
average fair value of options granted during the year was 33.0 pence (2013: 36.0 pence). The weighted average remaining contractual life 
for the share options outstanding at 31 December 2014 is between two and three years (2013: between one and three years). The range of 
exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was £1.10 – £3.60 (2013: £1.10 – £3.60). 
At 31 December 2014, there were 3,994,227 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.10 and £2.00, 589,271 options 
outstanding with an exercise price between £2.01 and £3.00, and 1,190,863 options outstanding with an exercise price between 
£3.01 and £3.60. 
At 31 December 2013, there were 3,493,368 options outstanding with an exercise price between £1.10 and £2.00, 884,160 options 
outstanding with an exercise price between £2.01 and £3.00, and 1,252,403 options outstanding with an exercise price between £3.01 
and £3.60. 
The key inputs into the valuation models were as follows: 
 2014 2013 
Weighted average share price (£) 1.35 2.15 
Weighted average exercise price (£) 1.17 1.63 
Expected volatility (%) 32.0 27.0 
Expected life (years) 2.10 2.13 
Risk free rate (%) 1.10 0.40 
Expected dividends (%) 5.9 4.6 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. The expected 
life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions 
and behavioural considerations. 
The Group recognised total expenses before tax of £2.8 million (2013: £2.0 million) relating to equity settled share-based payment 
transactions.

31 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
Operating lease commitments – Group as lessee 
The Group has a number of lease agreements that, pursuant to their economic substance, qualify as non-cancellable operating lease 
agreements. These primarily relate to rents payable on land and buildings. The terms of the leases vary significantly but can broadly be 
summarised as follows: 
Lease terms 
Shop leases are typically agreed on five year exit cycles (either expiry or break), with a maximum term length of 15 years. Some leases are 
shorter in duration or with earlier exits, to reflect our assessment of risk. 
Determination of rent payments 
Rent payments are based on the amount specified in the agreement. 
Terms of renewal 
The agreements are not terminated automatically after expiry of the lease term and in the majority of cases, lease extension options have been 
agreed upon and in many other cases, there will be an opportunity to negotiate lease extensions with the lessor at market rates. 
Restrictions 
There are no restrictions imposed upon the Group concerning dividends, additional debt or further leasing under any of the existing lease 
arrangements. 
Subleases 
The Group does sublease areas of leased properties and receives sublease payments from third parties.

33 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
Betstar Pty Ltd 
On 14 April 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the business and assets of Betstar Pty Ltd, an online sports betting business based in 
Australia with a view to build the Group’s presence in Australia. This acquisition was for total cash consideration of AUD 21.4 million  
(£12.1 million).  
The Group has performed an assessment of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination, 
as follows: 
 £m 
Net assets acquired:   
Intangible asset – brand name 1.4 
Intangible asset – customer relationships 3.2 
Tangible assets – fixtures and fittings 0.1 
Trade and other receivables 0.8 
Trade and other payables (1.7) 
Cash and cash equivalents 1.7 
Deferred tax liabilities on fair value adjustments (1.4) 
Identifiable net assets 4.1 
Goodwill 8.0 
 12.1 
Satisfied by:  
Cash consideration 12.1 
Cash and cash equivalent balances acquired (1.7) 
Net cash flow on acquisition 10.4 
The fair value of the brand name has been estimated based on the present value of the after-tax royalty savings attributable to owning the 
brand over an estimated useful life of ten years. The key assumption in estimating the fair value is a royalty rate of 1%. The customer 
relationships were valued using the income approach method based on a three-year average life for the customer base. The key assumptions 
in estimating the fair value are future revenue and customer churn. Any reasonable change in these assumptions would not result in a material 
change to the fair value. 
The goodwill of £8.0 million, which includes £1.4 million arising as a result of deferred tax on fair value adjustments, arises primarily from the 
synergies resulting from the business combination. None of this goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
Since the date of acquisition, the Betstar business has contributed £3.5 million of revenue and an operating profit of £0.9 million. Had Betstar 
been included for the period from 1 January 2014, the impact would not have been material to these financial statements. 
Transaction related costs of £0.5 million have been charged to exceptional items in the consolidated income statement for the year  
ended 31 December 2014.

Financial statements
COMPANY BALANCE SHEET 46 
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 
1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical 
cost convention except as otherwise stated. They have been drawn 
up to comply with applicable UK accounting standards and have 
been prepared on a going concern basis. The parent Company loss 
for the year was £145.0 million (2013: loss of £745.0 million). 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing 
a cash flow statement under the provisions of FRS 1 (revised 1996) 
Cash flow statements. The Ladbrokes plc consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 contain a 
consolidated statement of cash flows. 
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 from disclosing 
related party transactions with entities that form part of the 
Ladbrokes plc group. Ladbrokes plc is the ultimate parent 
undertaking. 
2 CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The Financial Reporting Council issued changes to the UK financial 
reporting framework, which will result in companies reporting either 
under the principles of EU-adopted IFRSs or a new set of UK 
financial reporting standards. In certain cases companies will be able 
to report reduced disclosures. 
This new financial reporting framework is effective for the year ending 
31 December 2015, and is required to be applied retrospectively. 
The Company has taken the decision not to adopt the new 
requirements for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
Adoption of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 UK 
GAAP is changing 
Ladbrokes plc will adopt FRS 101 in the standalone entity financial 
statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015. 
No disclosure in the current UK GAAP financial statements would be 
omitted on adoption of FRS 101. A shareholder or shareholders 
holding in aggregate 5% or more of the total allotted shares in 
Ladbrokes plc may serve objections to the use of the disclosure 
exemptions on Ladbrokes plc, in writing, to its registered office 
Imperial House, Imperial Drive, Rayners Lane, Harrow, HA2 7JW 
no later than 7 May 2015. 
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
Investments  
Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision 
for impairment. 
The Company assesses these investments for impairment wherever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication 
of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of the 
recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the value 
of the investment, the investment is considered to be impaired and 
is written down to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
recognised immediately in the profit and loss account. 
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the 
Company has control over its operating and financial policies. 
An undertaking is regarded as an associate if the Company holds 
a participating interest and has significant influence, but not control, 
over its operating and financial policies. 
Financial assets 
Financial assets are recognised when the Company becomes party 
to the contracts that give rise to them. 
The Company classifies financial assets at inception as either 
financial assets at fair value or loans and receivables. On initial 
recognition, loans and receivables are measured at fair value. 
Financial assets at fair value comprise guarantees provided to the 
Company. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are 
measured initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly 
to the profit and loss account. Subsequently, the fair values are 
remeasured and gains and losses from changes therein are 
recognised in the profit and loss account. 
Financial guarantees provided to the Company are classified as 
financial assets and are measured at fair value by estimating the 
probability of the guarantees being called upon and the related 
cash inflows to the Company Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities comprise guarantees given to third parties and 
contingent consideration. On initial recognition, financial liabilities are 
measured at fair value plus transaction costs where they are not 
categorised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured 
initially at fair value, with transaction costs taken directly to the profit 
and loss account. Subsequently, the fair values are remeasured and 
gains and losses from changes therein are recognised in the profit 
and loss account. 
Financial guarantee contracts 
The Company has provided financial guarantees to third parties 
in respect of lease obligations of certain of the Company’s former 
subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. 
Financial guarantee contracts are classified as financial liabilities 
and are measured at fair value by estimating the probability of the 
guarantees being called upon and the related cash outflows from 
the Company. 
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities  
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash 
flows from the assets has expired or when the Company has 
transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the 
financial assets or has assumed an obligation to pay the received 
cash flows in full without material delay to a third party, and either: 
— 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred; or 
— 
substantially all the risks and rewards have neither been retained 
nor transferred but control is not retained. 
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is 
discharged, cancelled or expires. 
Deferred tax 
Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or liability, at appropriate 
rates, in respect of transactions and events recognised in the 
financial statements of the current and previous periods that give the 
entity a right to pay less, or an obligation to pay more, tax in future 
periods. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is 
probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they 
can be recovered. 
No provision is made for any taxation on capital gains that would 
arise from the future disposal of any fixed assets shown in the 
financial statements at valuation, except to the extent that at the 
balance sheet date there is a binding sale agreement. 
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.  
Foreign currency translation 
The presentation and functional currency of the Company and the 
functional currencies of its UK subsidiaries, is Pounds Sterling (£). 
  
121 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014
NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  47 
 
 
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in pounds 
sterling (£) at the foreign currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated into pounds sterling (£) at the rates of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date (the closing rate). 
All foreign currency translation differences are taken to the profit 
and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign 
currency borrowings that provide a post-tax hedge against a net 
investment in a foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity 
until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are 
recognised in the profit and loss account. Tax charges and credits 
attributable to exchange differences on those borrowings are also 
dealt with in equity. 
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in  
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value 
in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the 
date when the fair value was determined. 
Pensions 
The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension 
Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan. The pension cost relating 
to the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent 
qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
Any actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in 
which they arise. Any past service costs are recognised immediately 
to the extent that benefits have already vested and, otherwise, are 
amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the 
benefits vest. 
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents 
the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit 
obligations as adjusted for any unrecognised past service costs. If 
necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount 
that can be recovered through reduced Company contributions in 
the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the balance 
sheet date. 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs. 
Share-based payments 
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured 
by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted. 
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details 
of which are given in note 30 of the consolidated IFRSs financial 
statements. In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked 
to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc (market conditions). 
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with 
a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the 
performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the 
relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (vesting date). 
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at 
each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which 
the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the 
opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the 
best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will 
ultimately vest. 
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, 
except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not 
the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance 
conditions are satisfied. 
ESOP trusts 
Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an 
ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity. Any 
consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these 
shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ 
funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss 
account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on 
the purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares. 
Treasury shares 
Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are 
deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss 
on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own 
equity instruments. 
4 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT DISCLOSURES 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit 
and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and 
losses of the parent Company have not been separately presented 
in these financial statements.

Financial guarantee contracts 
The Company has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of former subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division. The 
Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation (HHC), at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company 
may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees. The guarantees expire between 2017 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise 
a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.  
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all years up to 2042 is £679.6 million (2013: £707.6 million), 
with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount. Included in the maximum liability exposure is £434.8 million (2013: £449.5 million) 
in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and £244.8 million (2013: £258.1 million) in relation to the minimum contractual 
based element. The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the 
Company has entered. 
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2014 is £258.7 million (2013: £303.9 million). Included in the net present 
value of the maximum exposure is £149.1 million (2013: £175.5 million) in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 
£109.6 million (2013: £128.4 million) in relation to the minimum contractual based element.  
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.  
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable 
in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.  
At 31 December 2014 the Company has recognised a financial liability of £4.8 million (2013: £5.0 million) in respect of these guarantees. 
In addition to the passage of time, the liability has reduced in 2014 due to a number of factors. The key assumption in the probability model is 
the hotels default rate. A rate of 1.5% has been used at 31 December 2014 (2013: 1.7%). The default rate has been reduced as the 
remaining hotels under guarantee are considered to be in prime locations and furthermore have not suffered financially through the recent UK 
and European recession. The £0.2 million credit arising as a result of these factors has been included within the Company’s operating costs. 
The table below provides a breakdown of the movement in the liability since 1 January 2014:

At 1 January 2014   5.0

A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by £1.4 million. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the 
discount rate would reduce the financial liability by £0.4 million.

15 PENSIONS 
The Company’s only significant defined benefit pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan. This was closed to new employees on 1 August 
2007 and will close to future accrual from 31 August 2015. 
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2013.  
The results of the 30 June 2013 actuarial valuation were updated to 31 December 2014 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance 
with FRS 17. The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method. 
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 assumptions used for the Plan. The table also sets out as at 31 December 2014, the fair value 
of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus (or deficit) of assets 
compared to the FRS17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability (or asset) and the net pension asset (or liability).

Net pension asset £1.3m £26.8m 
The pension asset recognised on the Company balance sheet has been restricted under FRS17. The asset has been restricted to the 
present value of the liability expected to arise from future service, being the amount that could be expected to be recovered from reduced 
contributions to the plan. The net pension asset for the company is lower than the net pension asset for the Group. This is a result of technical 
differences between IAS19 and FRS17 regarding the size of an asset that can be recognised on the balance sheet. 
The overall expected return on plan assets was derived as an average of the expected rates of return on each of the major asset classes 
invested in, weighted by the allocations of assets among the classes at the balance sheet date, using the figures shown above. The sources 
used to determine the expected rates of returns include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data 
and analysts’ or government’s expectations. 
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 22.2% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional £441,667 per month to remove 
the shortfall in the funding identified at 30 June 2010 and £62,500 a month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan. The 
contributions made by the employers in 2014, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were £8.9 million (2013: £9.5 million). 
The contribution schedule is due to be revised shortly. Under this the level of employer contributions will be 27.1% of pensionable payroll in 
relation to the future accrual of benefits until the closure of the Plan at 31 August 2015, plus an additional £125,000 per month from April 
2016 to June 2017 to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 June 2013 and £62,500 a month towards the regular expenses of 
maintaining the Plan. These lead to an expected contribution of £3.7 million in 2015. 
127 Ladbrokes PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2014 53 
 
 
The Plan is due to close to accrual on 31 August 2015. Members were informed of this change in December 2014, following a consultation 
exercise and as such the impact of this change has been recognised within the 2014 profit and loss account. The loss of £38.0 million 
recognised in the 2014 profit and loss account reflects the reduction in the pension asset that can be recognised as a result of the closure. 
The impact on the present value of liabilities is different to this, the net reduction being £7.3 million reflecting the changes made.

American depositary receipts (ADRs) 
An ADR is a receipt that is issued by a depositary bank representing 
ownership of the Company’s underlying ordinary shares. ADRs are 
quoted in US Dollars and trade just like any other US security. 
Ladbrokes has a sponsored level 1 ADR programme for which 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas acts as depositary. 
The ADRs are traded on the Over the Counter market in the US under 
the symbol LDBKY, where one ADR is equal to one ordinary share. 
When dividends are paid to shareholders, the depositary makes 
the equivalent payment in US Dollars to ADR holders. For enquiries, 
brokers may contact the Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas 
Broker Service Desk on +44 20 7547 6500 or +1 212 250 9100. 
Registered ADR holders may contact the Ladbrokes ADR 
shareholder services line on +1 866 249 2593. Further information, 
including an ADR share price quote, is available at www.adr.db.com 
Unsolicited calls 
The Company is aware of shareholders receiving unsolicited calls or 
correspondence concerning investment matters. Calls are typically 
from people stating they are ‘brokers’ based overseas and they offer 
to ‘buy’ the individual’s shares at inflated prices claiming that there is a 
‘secret’ takeover or merger. Shareholders are advised to be very wary 
of any unsolicited advice, offers to sell or buy their shares or offers of 
free company reports. Operations to buy shares at inflated prices or to 
sell what often turn out to be worthless, high risk or even non-existent 
shares are commonly known as ‘boiler room’ scams. 
More detailed information on boiler room scams is available at 
www.ladbrokesplc.com/investors. If you think you have been 
contacted by share fraudsters, you can report the matter to the FCA 
by calling 0800 111 6768 or by completing the online form available

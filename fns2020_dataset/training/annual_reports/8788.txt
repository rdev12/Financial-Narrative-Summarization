JKX has operated in Ukraine for over 14 years. This focus has resulted 
in JKX becoming, and retaining its position as the largest non-state
producer of oil and gas – supplying approximately 77 per cent of 
non-state produced oil and 42 per cent of non-state produced gas.

JKX’ s strong operational expertise stems from the robust knowledge
base of its employees. With a team of approximately 500 spread
between London and our other areas of interest, over 95 per cent of 
our staff are based in Ukraine and Russia and are operational in focus.
Our emphasis on knowledge sharing across the Company promotes 
a culture of connected thinking and operational efficiency . 6 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Expertise Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 7
With over 14 years’ operational experience in our core areas in and
around the states of the former Soviet Union, JKX is one of the longest
serving London listed companies operating in the region, having
produced in excess of 35 million barrels of oil equivalent over that time.
Our deep understanding and expertise of the area has seen the
Company expand its portfolio across the region. Our recent acquisition
of the Koshekhablskoye development field in Russia underlines our
operational know-how, as well as our expertise at leveraging upon 
the exciting gas markets in the region. Our  year

rise in revenue. Gross fixed assets
increased by $147.9m (2006: $43.4m),
with $64.8m expended in development 
of our Ukrainian assets and $67.8m
attributed to acquisition of our Russian
production company, Yuzhgazenergie,
and initiation of redevelopment. Cash
resources at year end totalled $68.1m
(2006: $81.1m). 
The pace of development on our existing
production licences in Ukraine increased
during the period with 13 new wells
drilled and/or completed for production.
The Company remains committed to
broadening its portfolio of both
development and exploration licences in
Ukraine and is actively seeking attractive
assets to acquire. I am pleased to report
that the business environment in Ukraine
continues to improve with little if any
impact on our operations from the
considerable level of political activity over
the period. I remain confident that our
stable working environment will continue
through 2008.
I am delighted that the Company has
successfully identified and acquired its
first gas development asset in Russia
during the period. The Company is
Oil and gas revenues and profits have
continued to grow in 2007 with average
daily production from our core Ukrainian
production licences rising by 13 per cent
to 12,579 boepd (2006: 11,137 boepd).
The Company acquired its first
development asset in Russia in the fourth
quarter of the period and is scheduled to
recommence gas production from the
field this year .
Oil and gas revenues rose by 39 per cent
in the period to $181.9m (2006: $130.5m),
reflecting: production increases, an 
11 per cent rise in average oil
realisations and a 40 per cent rise in
domestic Ukrainian gas prices over the
period. Profit before tax of $113.3m
(2006: $109.2m) represents a modest
increase of 4 per cent. However, this
figure for 2007 includes $17.7m of
impaired and written off exploration
costs, whilst the 2006 comparative figure
includes the net $13.5m beneficial effect
relating to impairment (2006: $15.2m
reversal and $1.7m charge). Excluding
the effect of the 2007 net impairment
charge and the 2006 reversal, the
underlying profit before tax for the period
is $131.0m (2006: $95.7m) an increase of
37 per cent and is consistent with the

Board is recommending a final dividend
of 2.4 pence which will be paid on 30 May
to shareholders who are on the
Company’s Register of Members at the
close of business on 11 April. This
payment will bring the total dividend for
2007 to 4.4 pence per share (2006: 2.2
pence per share), a 100 per cent increase
over 2006.
Outlook
The Company’s priorities for 2008 are the
accelerated development of its production
licences in Ukraine, and the initiation of
gas production from its new production
licence in Russia. The broadening of our
exploration portfolio is focused on
replacement of produced reserves. 
Notwithstanding the ongoing reserve
review of our Ukrainian production
licences, I anticipate further material
increase of reserves to result from
continuing acquisitions, utilising the
Company’s healthy balance sheet and
strong cash flow. I trust that I will be able
to announce progress on these fronts in
the coming year . 
The Company’s performance owes much
to the dedication of its professional staff
whose commitment to the Company’s
goals drive the implementation of our
corporate strategy. The vast majority 
of our workforce is located overseas,
mainly in Ukraine but also now in Russia. 
I would like to thank all members of 
staff for their contribution to the success
of the Company. Finally, I extend my
appreciation to the shareholders of the
Company for their continued interest 
and support.
HSEC
The Company is expanding its
programmes on Health, Safety,
Environmental Protection and
Community Liaison (HSEC) in all Group
companies, and is committed to achieving
OHSAS 18001 accreditation for the HSEC
management system, and ISO 14001
accreditation for the Environmental
Management System. The Company has
also introduced Benchmarking Initiatives
to provide assurance and to ensure
continuous improvement in its
operations. Jack Lee was appointed in
the first quarter of the reporting period as
Group HSEC Manager, reporting to the
Chief Executive, and I am conscious of the
benefit the Company is deriving from his
25 years of experience in the field. 
During the period, we have also set in
place a Carbon Management Plan which
has been lodged and approved by the
Carbon Trust.
Board changes
The Company announced the
appointment of Nigel Moore as Non-
executive Director, and Peter Dixon and
Martin Miller as Executive Directors in
the middle of the period. I am delighted
that we have been able to strengthen our
Board at a time of rapid growth in our
business and we intend to make further
Non-executive appointments in the
current period.
Dividend
The Company paid an interim dividend 
of 2.0 pence per share on 5 November
2007. I am pleased to report that the
currently in the process of upgrading 
the field facilities and mobilising a
drilling rig into Russia in order to
commence well workover operations.
First gas from the Koshekhablskoye Field
is scheduled for mid-2008. The Company
is seeking further acquisitions of gas
assets in southern Russia, subject to 
a continuation of the current domestic
investment climate.
The Company’s exploration activities in
the period comprised seismic acquisition
in Ukraine and Turkey, and drilling a
deep well on its Golitza licence in
Bulgaria (JKX: 50 per cent). Although 
our first Bulgarian well was dry, we are
proceeding with our partner to identify
shallower prospects on our extensive
exploration acreage in 2008.
The Company is broadening its
exploration portfolio in central and
eastern Europe, and Turkey. The
Company announced in December that 
it had: farmed into the two Hernád
exploration licences in Hungary (JKX: 
50 per cent) and, immediately following
the end of the reporting period, the farm-
in to the two South East Bismil licences
in south east Turkey (JKX: 20 per cent). 
I anticipate further exploration farm-ins
by the Company in central and eastern
Europe during 2008.
Since the end of the reporting period, the
Company has disposed of its non-core
Italian exploration portfolio (including the
Aglavizza gas discovery) to Mediterranean
Oil & Gas plc, and is continuing to seek
an exit from its remaining North America
exploration asset.

the domestic market at a price which
tracks international prices but at an
effective discount.
Average realisations for gas in the period
rose by 40 per cent to $3.95 per Mcf
($2.83 per Mcf), with all gas being sold
into the domestic market. Gas
realisations have again increased from
the beginning of 2008 to in excess of
$5.00 per Mcf, as a result of the year-end
negotiations between Russia and
Ukraine. We believe that gas prices could
rise again during 2008, with a further
increase anticipated at the beginning 
of 2009. PPC continued to sell
approximately 60 per cent of its gas
production to Shell throughout the period.
The ongoing drilling programme on 
our Poltava fields comprised both
development and appraisal in and around
our four production licences throughout
the reporting period. Most encouragingly,
50 per cent of our new wells in the period
targeted new productive structures to the
west and east of the Ignatovskoye and
Molchanovskoye fields respectively.
This year’s achievements have served to
underline the specialist knowledge, focus
and expertise that JKX has successfully
acquired during its years of activity in its
core region. The Company has increased
production from its core Ukrainian
production licences, acquired a second
operational hub in southern Russia, and
broadened its exploration portfolio in
eastern/central Europe and Turkey. The
Russian acquisition resulted in 36.5
million barrels of oil equivalent of proven
plus probable reserves being added to
the Group reserves, representing
approximately 50 per cent of the Group
reserves as at 31 December 2007.
Ukraine
The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’),
continues as the largest domestic non-
state producer of oil and gas, supplying
approximately 3 per cent of Ukraine’s oil
and gas production during the period.
Average daily oil production increased by
13 per cent to 5,539 bopd (4,889 bopd).
Average daily gas production rose by 
13 per cent to 42.3 MMcfd (37.5 MMcfd),
the maximum level possible under the
limitations of the current gas export
capacity from our Poltava fields.

Ignatovskoye Field
During the period, three new deviated
development wells (I127, I128, and I129)
were drilled and successfully brought 
on-stream. In addition, two new vertical
appraisal wells (I130, I131) were drilled
as part of the programme of evaluation
of the extent of the Tournasian carbonate
extension to the north of the
Molchanovskoye Field; both of these
wells are awaiting acid stimulation. 
A third deviated appraisal well (I133) 
was completed shortly after the end 
of the period and brought on-stream.
Molchanovskoye Field
During the period, two new vertical
development wells (M157, M158) and one
new vertical development well (M205)
were drilled and/or completed in the
northern and southern areas of the field
respectively and successfully brought on-
stream. In addition, two vertical and one
deviated appraisal wells (M160, M161
and M162) confirmed production in the
Tournasian carbonate extension in an
additional fault block to the north of 
the Molchanovskoye field and were
successfully brought on-stream. 
Novo-Nikolaevskoye Field
No additional drilling or workover activity
was undertaken on the field during the
period, although negotiations continue
with the state oil and gas company on
acquiring a shut-in well drilled in the
1980s on our licence area. The main
focus of activity in 2008 will be more
detailed examination of the Visean
sandstone channel sands along with 
a study of the potential in both the
underlying Tournasian and Devonian
reservoirs.
Rudenkovskoye Field
The second new Well R102 was drilled 
in the southern area of the field and
successfully tied back to the central
production facilities in the second
quarter of the period. An extensive data
set from the logging and coring
programme was gathered and is being
used in the ongoing evaluation of well
stimulation techniques to be utilised for
the full field development. In the third
quarter of the period, an initial hydraulic
fracture stimulation test was undertaken
on one of the gas-bearing sandstone
intervals of Well R101, the first new well
drilled in the northern part of the field 
in 2005. Although the results were
inconclusive, extended pressure tests 
on the well are feeding into the ongoing
fracture studies. We intend to apply a
range of fracturing techniques to all
three of the Rudenkovskoye wells (R12,
R101 and R102) during the third quarter
of this year .
Production facilities at Poltava have 
been upgraded and expanded during the
period; major items include a new low
pressure manifold, a new inlet separator
and upgraded flare controls. Delivery 
of additional facilities and construction
associated with the tie-in to the 56-inch
Soyuz pipeline has been ongoing
throughout the reporting period
including: execution of the hot tap into
the Soyuz line; construction of the spur
line to the PPC facilities; and delivery and
installation of both the additional dew
point control plant and the additional
2,220 hp compressor . Delays have been
experienced with the delivery of the
bespoke metering skid, due in part to 
the extended approval cycle of its final
specification by the regulatory authorities
and the lead times being experienced for
sophisticated oilfield control equipment.
Delivery of the metering skid is currently
scheduled for the second quarter of the
year, with tie-in and commissioning due
for completion in the third quarter .
Delivery of gas via the Soyuz tie-in will
remove any capacity constraint to gas
production from our Poltava licences.
The Company is committed to developing
and expanding its exploration and
appraisal licence portfolio in Ukraine.
Zaplavskoye
The first exploration Well Z1 on the
95.7sq.km Zaplavskoye exploration
licence was drilled in 2006 and
reprocessing and reinterpretation of the
92km of 2D seismic data, incorporating
the well data, showed the well was
drilled off-structure. An additional two
lines totalling 16km of 2D seismic were
shot in the first quarter of the period, 
and the processed data has been
assimilated into the data set to
determine the location for the second
exploration well which is planned to spud
in the second quarter of 2008. In addition,
a second lead, has been identified in the
western part of the exploration licence
and, depending on further seismic
reprocessing and evaluation, could lead
to an exploration well later this year .

continues with exploration now focusing
on gas-bearing structures in the coastal
Tertiary Basin and the definition of
prospects north west of the Well R1
location. Additional 3D seismic
acquisition is scheduled for the third
quarter of 2008 to supplement the
existing 2D seismic data over the Tertiary
Basin area. 
Turkey
The Company is participating in the three
Karakilise onshore exploration licences,
covering a total of 1,230sq.km in south-
eastern Turkey (JKX: 30 per cent). During
the period, 60km of 2D seismic was
acquired and processed over two leads 
in the southern part of the licence area.
An exploration well on one of the
prospects is scheduled for the second
quarter of 2008.
The Company participated in three
onshore exploration licences in Thrace
(JKX: 25 per cent) comprising an area 
of 980 sq km. During the period, an
additional 110km of 2D seismic was
acquired over a lead previously identified
by the Operator . Following processing
and interpretation, the Company
concluded that the prospect has limited
potential and decided to relinquish its
interest in the licences. 
The Company announced on  
10 January 2008 that it had farmed into
two exploration licences comprising
590sq.km in the South East Bismil area
of South East Turkey (JKX: 20 per cent).
The licences are situated immediately
workovers of shut-in wells; specification
and sourcing of replacement gas
treatment facilities; and implementation
of a corporate development plan for our
wholly-owned Russian subsidiary,
Yuzhgazenergie (‘YGE’). I anticipate our
Russian staff to grow from 20 personnel
today to approximately 90 personnel by
the end of the year . YGE remains on
schedule to return the field to production
in 2008. 
Georgia
Anadarko is the operator of the
consortium holding the 8,900sq.km
exploration licence, offshore Georgia
(JKX: 4 per cent net profit interest).
Following extensive seismic and
geological data acquisition, a preferred
location for the first exploration well has
been identified. This commitment well 
is dependent on Anadarko attracting
additional farm-in partners, following 
the recent withdrawal of BP and Chevron
from the consortium, and securing a
suitable drilling rig. We remain
committed to this frontier project but,
recognising the passage of time, we have
decided to make a full provision for all
our capitalised costs relating to the
project to date.
Bulgaria 
The Company operates the onshore
exploration permits, B Golitza and B1
Golitza (JKX: 50 per cent) covering a total
of 3,499sq.km. During the reporting
period, Well R1 was drilled to a depth 
of 4,522m on the B Golitza permit and
subsequently plugged and abandoned 
Elizavetovskoye
The Company continues to seek an
agreement with the state oil and gas
company to acquire the existing
infrastructure in order to re-commence
production. No exploration work will be
undertaken on the 70sq.km licence until
such an agreement has been achieved.
Chervonoyarske East
The Company was awarded this
5.5sq.km licence in 2006, following the
first open auction of licences in Ukraine.
The Company purchased and interpreted
110km of 2D seismic and data from the
six wells drilled on the licence to date,
and has shot and processed 12km of
additional 2D seismic during the period.
The Company is currently acquiring
42sq.km of 3D seismic data to aid
identification of prospects for possible
drilling in 2009.
Russia
In the fourth quarter of the period, the
Company completed its $50m acquisition
of the Koshekhablskoye Gas Field,
located in the southern Russian republic
of Adygea. The Company has added
approximately 36 million boe to its
booked 2P reserves, based on the
estimates of the independent
consultants, Miller and Lents. Since
acquisition, the Company has been
undertaking the necessary work required
to bring the Field back on-stream. Major
activities completed to date include:
initiation of a 105sq.km seismic
programme; specification and award of
required field refurbishment contracts;
award of the rig contract for up to 10

enhance further the productivity we enjoy
at our core production hub.
The recommencement of gas production
at our recently acquired Russian
Koshekhablskoye Field will establish a
second production hub for the Company
and is a key milestone for 2008. Plant
replacement and well workovers are the
major field activities throughout the year,
with a new deeper well to appraise the
underlying productive horizon scheduled
for the turn of the year . I anticipate that
gas realisations in Russia will follow the
trend set in Ukraine with gas prices
increasing annually at a rate of 15 per
cent to 25 per cent until a European
netback price is reached in 2011-2012.
Most encouragingly, we are continuing 
to receive expressions of interest from
additional industrial gas users in the
region to purchase our forthcoming
production. 
Acquisition of additional development
assets to increase our reserve base
remains our priority with Ukraine and
Russia being the two main areas of
evaluation. Exploration activity is
increasing in the current period as we
broaden our portfolio, and I am hopeful
that we will be able to add further farm-
ins in eastern/central Europe during the
coming months. 
The focus and commitment of the staff 
of the Company remain the key factor in
achieving our goals and delivering value
to our shareholders, and I am confident
that this will continue through 2008.
at the end of the reporting period that
Newfield Exploration has acquired the
interests of the previous operator,
Rosetta Energy, and is considering an
exploration well through the James Lime
(the primary target in the Unit) to the
underlying Travis Peak and Pettet
formations. The Company has for some
time indicated its preference for a vertical
well to be drilled to test all three
formations. The Company is evaluating
the merits of the new operator’s
proposals before moving forward with
disposal options.
Outlook
The Company is embarking on its busiest
year to date with significant development
drilling programmes scheduled for
Ukraine and Russia plus exploration
programmes in Ukraine, Hungary,
Bulgaria and Turkey.
The continuing development of our four
Poltava production licences will include
further appraisal and exploitation of the
encouraging Tournasian Carbonate field
extensions we are delineating over our
licence areas. We expect gas production
to increase in the second half of the year
with unrestricted gas delivery via the
Soyuz trunkline. The fracturing
programme scheduled for the third
quarter on our deep Rudenkovskoye
Field is targeted at identifying a well
stimulation technique which can facilitate
a full and cost-effective development of
the field. I am also hopeful that the wells
planned in the second half of the year on
our Zaplavskoye exploration licence will
south of the largest oilfield in Turkey, Bati
Raman. Currently, an additional 120km
of 2D seismic is being acquired over the
licences and drilling has commenced on
Well Koyunlu 2, an appraisal to the oil
discovery Well Koyunlu 1 drilled in 2006.
Hungary
The Company announced at the end of
the reporting period that it had farmed
into two exploration licences, Hernád I
and Hernád II, covering a total of
5,420sq.km in the north Pannonian Basin
(JKX: 50 per cent). A 350sq.km 3D
seismic acquisition programme has
recently been completed over the
licences, and is currently being
processed and interpreted to identify 
the first drilling prospect for spudding 
in the third quarter of this year .
Italy
In line with our stated strategy of
disposing of non-core assets the
Company agreed the sale of its Italian
portfolio of exploration assets, including
the Aglavizza gas discovery, to
Mediterranean Oil & Gas plc on 
22 February 2008. The agreed
consideration of two million euros 
was received at contract completion 
on 27 February 2008.
USA
The Company has been investigating
options for disposing of its interest in the
11,290-acre West Huxley (Deep) Unit
project in east Texas (JKX: 34.3 per cent),
its only remaining asset in the USA.

• Successful appraisal of the
Tournasian Carbonate in a structure
to the north of the Molchanovskoye
field;
• The continued development of the
Devonian Sandstone in the northern
area of the Molchanovskoye field;
• Further appraisal of the Devonian
Sandstone in the Molchanovskoye
field and promising results from the
overlying Visean Sandstone;
• First steps in evaluating the potential
for fracture stimulation of the tight
sandstone reservoir in the
Rudenkovskoye field;
• First steps in appraising the
Tournasian Carbonate reservoir 
in a structure to the west of the
Ignatovskoye field;
• Further upgrading of the Central
Production Facility at Poltava to
handle the additional wells at
different pressures and with varying
fluid content;
• Preparation for the tie-in to the Soyuz
pipeline in order to remove the
current constraint on gas production;
and
• Continued reinterpretation of the 
3D seismic database to generate
additional targets in and around the
producing areas.
In pursuit of the above objectives, the
N75 and Kremco 900 rigs operated in 
the PPC licences throughout 2007. The
Kremco 900 was used for workovers and
to drill vertical wells up to 2,500m and
the N75 was used for more complex and
deeper wells. Both rigs were contracted
from Poland. The Kremco 900 was
demobilised in late 2007 in preparation
for its move to JKX’s Russian operation 
in 2008.
Production licences
Ignatovskoye
The Ignatovskoye licence is located in 
the centre of the Novo-Nikolaevskoye
Complex. It contains the first field to 
be developed by PPC and accounted for
the majority of the Group’s production
until 2005 when it was overtaken by the
Molchanovskoye field. Two additional
structural trends are now being
evaluated, one to the southwest, and 
one to the west of the main field.
Poltava Petroleum Company (‘PPC’), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of JKX, holds
four production licences covering
271sq.km in the Poltava region of
Ukraine. Each production licence
contains a particular field: Ignatovskoye,
Molchanovskoye, Rudenkovskoye and
Novo-Nikolaevskoye, which together
form the Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex. 
The four production licences are located
on the southern edge of the Dnieper-
Donetsk basin which is the main
producing area in eastern Ukraine. The
reservoirs in the PPC fields are formed
by both clastic and carbonate formations
of Devonian and Carboniferous age.
In addition to its production licences,
PPC has three exploration licences in 
the area: Zaplavskoye (part of the Novo-
Nikolaevskoye complex), Elizavetovskoye
and Chervonoyarske East, representing 
a total licensed area of 171.2sq.km.

The main field is an uplifted fault block
containing Devonian sandstone and
overlying Carboniferous Tournasian
sandstone and limestone. On top of that
is a carbonate reef build up of Visean
age. There is also a series of thin
sandstone channels on the flank 
of the structure, also of Visean age. 
Black oil is found in the Devonian
sandstone and the lower parts of the
Tournasian and Visean reservoirs; these
are overlain by a rich condensate bearing
gas. The Visean channels can be oil or
gas bearing. Reservoir quality in the
Devonian sandstone and Visean reef is
generally good while the Tournasian
sandstone and limestone both are
variable and often dependent on local
depositional and tectonic influences.
Reservoir stimulation in these reservoirs
is often necessary and, although this can
give high initial flow rates, the rates often
decline to a more modest plateau
production. 
The main focus of appraisal in 2007 was
the Tournasian carbonate structure to
the west of the Ignatovskoye field, initially
discovered in well M155 and further
appraised in the Molchanovskoye
northern structures. In addition,
development drilling focused on the
Devonian and Tournasian sandstones
and the Visean carbonate of the main
Ignatovskoye field. 
Well I127 added another production point
to the Visean carbonate reservoir, which
is mostly gas bearing, with an initial flow
rate of 3.4 MMcfd and 26 bcpd. Wells I128
and I129 also encountered depleted
reservoirs in the Devonian and
Tournasian sandstones respectively, but
still managed flow rates of 1,000 bopd
(and 0.3 MMcfd gas) in I128 and 
4.6 MMcfd with 180 bcpd in I129. Two
further development wells to the north
and south of the main Ignatovskoye
structure are planned for 2008.
Wells I130, I131 and I133 all targeted the
Tournasian carbonate and encountered
substantial gas columns, some in excess
of 100m. However, indications are that
the reservoir here has low porosity and
permeability and will need stimulation. 
A detailed study is in process to ensure
the best possible procedure and work 
is started in the second quarter . In the
meantime, well I133, the most northerly
stepout, was completed in the
Tournasian sandstone with an initial 
flow rate of 3.7 MMcfd and 560 bcpd.
The main focus of 
appraisal in 2007 was the
Tournasian carbonate
Further appraisal/development drilling 
is contingent on the success of the
stimulation programme; however, the
structure is relatively large with more
than 2km separating wells I131 from 
I133 and the potential gas in place is
substantial. 
Molchanovskoye
The Molchanovskoye licence is located
approximately 8km from Ignatovskoye
and contains the southernmost field
within the complex. The licence contains
three distinct features: the southern area
which contains gas condensate in
Devonian sandstone, the northern area
which consists of a black oil reservoir
with a gas cap, again in Devonian
sandstone with overlying Tournasian
sandstone and, overlying that and
extending to the Ignatovskoye licence, the
newly developed Tournasian carbonate
and sandstone reservoirs which contain
gas condensate.
The main focus of activity in 2007 has
been on the Tournasian carbonate
following the success of the M155 and
M156 wells in 2006 which were drilled in
the northern area of the field concluding
with M157 which came on stream in early
2007 at 7.3 MMcfd with 620 bcpd. The
2007 drilling campaign began with
success in the Tournasian carbonate
extension to the field when well M160
tested at 7.4 MMcfd and 495 bcpd; this
was followed by the north-westerly step-
out M161 which flowed 1.0 MMcfd with
250 bcpd and the south-easterly step-out
well M162 which initially flowed at 
3.9 MMcfd and 120 bcpd. 
The final step-out on the structure, I130,
lies to the northwest of M161 and is
actually in the Ignatovskoye licence. This
well failed to flow from the Tournasian
carbonate despite gas shows drilling and
logging pay; it is currently suspended
awaiting the design of a comprehensive
stimulation treatment programme for
the Tournasian carbonate reservoir in 
the area.

date two productive areas have been
identified in this licence.
Well R12Z, which was re-drilled by PPC
in 2005, is located in the more southerly
of the two productive areas and continues
to produce from the main Devonian gas-
bearing interval; two deeper gas-bearing
intervals remain untested. 
The second well in the area, R102, was
drilled in early 2007 approximately 2.2km
to the southeast of R12Z. It found two
main gas-bearing zones in the Devonian
sandstone and the lower 45m interval
was tested at an average rate of 
7.7 million cubic feet of gas, 90 barrels of
condensate and 230 barrels of water per
day. A second shallower 138m interval
depth was identified as a suitable target
for fracture stimulation. The timing for
testing this interval will depend on the
performance of the lower interval and the
recommendations derived from the
stimulation in well R101.
R101, drilled in 2006 and the first new
well in the northern area, encountered
200m net of gas-bearing Tournasian
sandstone, the deeper zones at such
high pressure meant that they had to be
plugged back for safety reasons. The
shallower section was tested and a 110m
interval put into production at an initial
flow rate of 2 MMcfd. This interval was
considered suitable for a massive
hydraulic fracture stimulation.
The fracture stimulation took place
during 2007 and the results were
disappointing with flow rates not
exceeding the original unstimulated rate.
in-fill drilling in the Devonian sandstone
and another horizontal well is planned
for 2008 together with the workover of
the discovery well M28.
Novo-Nikolaevskoye
The Novo-Nikolaevskoye licence lies 3km
to the west of Ignatovskoye; previous
exploration of this area by Ukrainian
state companies targeted the Tournasian
carbonates although with little success
due to the variable nature of the reservoir .
These results will be re-examined in
2008 following the success of the 2007
drilling programme in the northern part
of the Molchanovskoye licence.
In addition, well N9 continues to produce
oil and gas from the shallower Visean
sandstone and this area has been the
subject of preliminary reprocessing of
the 3D seismic to enhance the
identification of the channel sands in the
area. These appear at a number of levels,
mostly running in an east west direction,
and vary considerably in thickness and
breadth. 
This work will be continued in 2008 with
the aim of both defining reserves in the
area and identifying further appraisal
drilling locations. 
Rudenkovskoye
The Rudenkovskoye licence is the most
northern of the four production licences.
The target reservoirs within the licence
are the Tournasian and Devonian sands,
which are found at depths between
3,000m and 5,000m. Based on data 
from old wells drilled by Ukrainian state
companies in the 1970s and 1980s, to
Also planned for 2008 are in-fill wells 
in the Tournasian carbonate structure 
in order to maximise recovery.
The long established southern area
remains an uncertain mix of good and
poor Devonian sandstone reservoir . After
the success of well M202 in 2002, the
subsequent wells M203 and M204 were
disappointing. In late 2007 well M205 was
targeted at the Devonian sandstone and
had an initial flow rate of 5.1 MMcfd and
2,700 bcpd from a 15m pay interval.
Although the low level of the Devonian
means that the potential for extension of
the Devonian field to the east is limited,
the well also logged 105m of pay in the
Tournasian carbonate and 22m in a
Visean sandstone. Potential productivity
from the Tournasian carbonate in this
area is uncertain but could add additional
reserves if productivity can be
established. The other wells in the field
are being re-examined and may be
candidates for recompletion in 2008. 
The Visean sandstone could also add
reserves, and new seismic processing
techniques are being applied to
investigate the distribution and thickness
of these channel sands.
Finally, one well, M158, was drilled to
define the downdip southern flank of the
northern sandstone structure during
2007 and achieved a flow rate of 
1.3 MMcfd and 45 bcpd from the
Tournasian sandstone with the main
Devonian sandstone reservoir below the
oil/water-contact. Reservoir modelling
has demonstrated the need for additional

improved fire protection systems and
upgrading of the oil metering and
monitoring system. 
Operationally, an additional well testing
facility will enable PPC to maintain its
regulatory reporting and provide better
reservoir monitoring and management
as the number of producing wells
increases. The large number of wells in
the Molchanovskoye field will increase
the demand for additional gas lift
capacity and a Molchanovskoye gas
distribution facility is due for
commissioning in the second quarter . 
Exploration licences 
PPC holds three exploration licences 
in Ukraine. 
Zaplavskoye
This licence is adjacent to the
Molchanovskoye production licence and
comprises an area of 95.7sq.km. The
permit is valid until 2010. During 2006, 
an exploration well was drilled targeting
a Devonian sandstone prospect to the
south of the Molchanovskoye field. 
evaluations of the Novo-Nikolaevskoye
seismic and the testing of the
Ignatovskoye west structures will enable
JKX to carry out volumetric estimates of
the potential in the reservoirs and the
fracture stimulation programme in the
Rudenkovskoye field may finally enable
us to make a better assessment of the
reserves. in that substantial area of the
field.
Production facilities
In late 2006, PPC was granted
permission to access the Soyuz gas
pipeline which carries gas from Russia
through Ukraine to western Europe.
Such access would permit PPC to
increase its gas production above the
capacity of the existing facility. The flow
line was laid in early 2007 and a hot tap
was carried out. 
The installation of an additional gas
compressor and second hydrocarbon
dewpoint are on schedule for completion
by the end of the first quarter of 2008, but
delays in receiving the revised regulatory
specifications for the metering system
has meant a considerable delay in being
able to place the order for this long-lead
item. Consequently, the revised delivery
of this critical part of the system will
enable PPC to start commissioning of
the Soyuz gas system by the end of the
second quarter .
Upgrading of the oil and gas systems
continues at the Central Production
Facility (formerly the ‘Early’ Production
Facility or EPF), both to give greater
flexibility in handling the various
Despite lengthy testing, opinions differ on
the exact mechanism for this failure, but
a common view is that the tested interval,
which was designed to maximise
unstimulated production, may have been
too great for the stimulation and led to
dissipation or misdirection of the frac
fluid. 
The addition of 13 new wells
in 2007 and the development
of reserves in the field has
added a wealth of new
information to our database
The positive outcome, however, is that
the reservoir is still amenable to
fracturing and plans are being drawn 
up for a new programme in all the
Rudenkovskoye wells which incorporate
production history from all three wells,
the outcome of the R101 stimulation and
the extensive data gathering from R102. 
Reserves
The addition of 13 new wells in 2007 and
the development of reserves in the fields
has added a wealth of new information to
our database. As these new reserves are
developed, additional production history
enables more accurate reservoir
modelling to be undertaken and each 
of the reservoirs in the Ignatovskoye
main, Molchanovskoye main and
Molchanovskoye north areas are being
modelled through 2008 to determine the
remaining reserves in the field. The new

establish conditions under which PPC
can initiate production from this licence.
Chervonoyarske East 
The Chervonoyarske East licence was
obtained in December 2005 from an 
open auction held by the Ministry of
Environmental Protection of Ukraine. The
licence covers a total area of 5.5sq.km
and is located about 75km from the PPC
production licences on the northern
margin of the Dneiper-Donetsk basin. 
It is adjacent to the Chervonoyarske field
and has produced gas condensate from
Carboniferous reservoirs. At least six
wells have previously been drilled by
other parties within the licence area, 
one of which produced small quantities
of hydrocarbons.
Evaluation of the data package
purchased with the licence, including a
100km 2D seismic survey, has revealed
the potential for trapping of
hydrocarbons against a substantial salt
wall in the block. However, resolution of
the 2D data beneath the salt is
insufficient to define any prospects and 
a 42sq.km 3D survey is planned for 2008.
No hydrocarbons were encountered and
the well was abandoned. However, the
data obtained, together with 16km of
additional seismic acquisition and
reprocessing of the initial seismic, has
led to the identification of a new prospect
which will be drilled in mid-2008.
Examination of the 3D seismic data
extending into the licence from south of
the Novo-Nikolaevskoye licence and west
of the Ignatovskoye licence has revealed
the presence of channel sands in the
Visean and a lead developed which may
also have secondary objectives in the
Tournasian and Devonian. Drilling will
depend on further seismic reprocessing
and evaluation.
Elizavetovskoye 
Located in the central part of the
Dnieper-Donetsk basin, the
Elizavetovskoye licence covers an area 
of 70sq.km and is approximately 45km
from PPC’s existing production licences.
The licence benefits from having a
structural feature that is associated with
the adjacent Mashivske field. A number
of wells have been drilled on this feature
and some have been placed on
production. PPC’s licence contains three
such producing wells. The producing
wells are owned by Ukrgasvydobuvannya,
a subsidiary of Naftogas of Ukraine, the
state oil and gas company, and are tied
into its production facility. Negotiations,
which slowed during the election season,
are progressing with
Ukrgasvydobuvannya to resolve the
issues related to these wells, and to Operations review Russia

Koshekhablskoye Field 
In November 2007 JKX completed the
purchase of 100 per cent of the shares 
in Yuzhgazenergie LLC (YGE). YGE holds
the licence for the redevelopment of 
the Koshekhablskoye gas field which 
is located in the southern Russian
autonomous Republic of Adygea. The
licence covers an area of 34.7sq.km.
The Field was discovered in 1972 and
produced a total 89 Bcf of gas before
operations were suspended in January
2006. In June 2006, YGE was granted a
new 20-year licence to rehabilitate and
further appraise and develop the Field.
Miller and Lents Ltd, independent oil and
gas consultants engaged by JKX, has
estimated that remaining proved gas
reserves in the Field are 114 Bcf and
proved plus probable gas reserves are
216 Bcf.
Field rehabilitation and development is
under way, consisting of the design and
sourcing of replacement processing
facilities, including a sour gas treatment
plant, testing of existing wellheads and

In 2007, Anadarko set up a new data
room and invited proposals from a
number of potential co-venturers to
expand the consortium of companies in
the licence area. We understand there
were a number of expressions of interest
but no additional partners have been
announced to date and there are no
plans for any drilling in the short term.
West Georgia offshore 
JKX holds a 4 per cent net profit interest
in the Georgian Black Sea Production
Sharing contract. The contract covers 
an area of 8,900sq.km offshore Georgia
(approximately 80 per cent of the
Georgian Black sea shelf) and is
operated by Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation.
In October 2004, Anadarko completed 
a 1,100sq.km 3D seismic survey in the
south of the block adjacent to BP/TPAO’s
Turkish licence from which it identified a
number of significant leads. The primary
target is deep-water turbiditic Miocene
sandstone at depths of between 3,000
and 4,000m below sea level. Water depth
in the prospective area varies from 1,000
to 1,500m.
In July 2005, BP, TPAO, and Chevron who
jointly held the licence in the adjoining
Turkish Black Sea area, spudded a well
very close to the edge of JKX’s contract
area. No results were released but all
indications are that it was unsuccessful
and BP and Chevron subsequently
notified their intention to withdraw from
both the block in Turkey and from
offshore Georgia.

Golitza R1 was drilled in 2007 to a total
depth of up to 4,517m encountering three
out of four of the main objectives in the
Jurassic and Triassic all within 50m of
prognosis. 
Several attractive leads are
now being covered by a 3D
seismic survey which should
lead to the identification of
one or more drillable
prospects during 2008
The well results supported the structural
model and confirmed the geological
sequence beneath the Miocene age
Balkan Thrust Front. However, the
absence of hydrocarbons in the structure
suggests that its relationship with the
regional source rock maturity and
migration model requires further study.
Exploration in the B Golitza permit will
now be focused on the definition of
prospects north west of the Golitza R1
well location.
B1 Golitza permit 
There are two distinct parts to the B1
Golitza permit: the northern area which
shares geological properties similar to
the B Golitza permit and the eastern area
which is comprised of much younger
(and shallower) Tertiary age rocks that
show geological characteristics similar
to the western Black Sea. The primary
reservoirs within the permit have been
identified as Eocene and Oligocene age
turbidite sandstones. Previously, several
gas fields have been discovered, both to
the north and east, as well as inside the
permit itself. 
The evaluation of the reprocessed pre-
2005 2D seismic data and the part of the
2005 seismic dataset that was acquired
over B1 Golitza confirmed the presence
of several attractive leads with prominent
amplitude anomalies. These are now
being covered by a 3D seismic survey
which should lead to the identification of
one or more drillable prospects during
2008.
JKX farmed into two onshore exploration
permits in Bulgaria B Golitza and B1
Golitza in March 2005. The blocks,
covering a total of 3,499sq.km, contained
well defined prospects and leads. JKX
has a 50 per cent interest and
operatorship in both permits. Balkan
Explorers Bulgaria Limited, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Aurelian Oil & Gas
Limited, has the balance of the interest 
in these permits.
Bulgaria became a member of the
European Union on 1 January 2007 and
offers excellent operating terms with an
open gas market and extensive
infrastructure.
B Golitza permit 
The Golitza prospect was a large tilted
fault block of Moesian Platform
sediments (Jurassic sands and shales
and Triassic limestones and shales) that
had been overridden by the thrusts
moving from the south. The 2D seismic
acquired in late 2005 firmed up the
location for an exploration well, Golitza
R1 to test the prospect which had the
potential to contain several hundred Bcf
of gas.

In October 2005, JKX farmed into two
onshore exploration licences in the
Thrace region in the west of Turkey
earning a 25 per cent interest in the

extensive stimulation and testing, the
well failed to flow commercial quantities
of oil and has been suspended.
In line with the work programme,
Karakilise 1 was re-entered and
deepened by approximately 2,000 ft in
October 2006. The purpose of this was 
to evaluate the Triassic, Hazro and
Ordovician Bedinan formations within 
a mapped four-way dip closure. The
deepened well failed to find hydrocarbon
in these horizons and was plugged 
in December 2006. The production
facilities have been mothballed.
Further interpretation work is being
carried out on the seismic data within the
block to the south of the Karakilise field
and in 2007 a further 60km of seismic
data was acquired in order to bring the
lead to ready-to-drill status in 2008. 
South East Turkey – South East Bismil
Just after the reporting period, JKX
announced that it was farming into two
adjacent licences covering 590sq.km
together known as the South East Bismil
licences. JKX earned a 20 per cent
interest in the licences from the operator,
JKX expanded its operations to include
Turkey in 2005. Currently JKX has five
exploration licences in south east
Turkey (three Karakilise and two South
East Bismil Licences).
South East Turkey – Karakilise
JKX holds a 30 per cent interest in three
exploration licences in south east Turkey
close to the city of Diyarbakir . This group
of three permits, together known as the
Karakilise Licence, is operated by
Aladdin Middle East Inc (AME) and covers
a total of 1,230sq.km and contains a

in the north Hungarian Pannonian Basin.
The licences are valid through 2013

an exit at an appropriate time.
Texas
JKX holds a 34.3 per cent working
interest in 11,290 acres in the West
Huxley (Deep) Unit in Shelby County, East
Texas. Newfield Exploration took over the
operatorship from Rosetta Energy
Partners LP in 2007.
The primary geological target in the unit
is the Lower Cretaceous James Lime
formation, which produces gas from 
a number of wells adjacent to the unit,
most notably in the Huxley field where a
number of wells with multiple horizontal
laterals have been drilled. Three wells
have been drilled but despite acidisation
and a number of other attempts to
improve their productivity, it has not 
been possible to maintain continuous
production. It has therefore been
concluded that the reservoir properties 
in this part of the unit are poor .
Currently, there remain a number of
areas on the unit where it is believed
commercial quantities of hydrocarbons
can be found below the unit’s initial

related to underlying cost of sales. The
$31.1m remainder of the increase relates
to the positive effects in the 2006
comparative figures, of the net
impairment movements (being the
reversal of a $15.2m offset by $1.8m
impairment charge). This reversal was
explained in more detail on page 20 of
the 2006 Annual Report and Accounts.
Whilst 2006 showed a net benefit from
the impairment reversals, a charge of
$17.7m is recognised in 2007 relating to
impairment/write off of exploration costs.
The impairment includes $3.3m relating
to the Group’s Italian asset portfolio
which has been disposed of post year
end; $5.9m relating to the West Georgia
offshore interest, as a result of the time
the asset has been held without an
exploration well having been drilled;
$0.9m relating to Ukrainian exploration;
and $0.5m relating to seismic acquired
on the Turkish Thrace licence. In addition
to these provisions for impairment,
$7.1m of costs relate to the dry Bulgarian
Golitza B1 well.
Of underlying cost of sales, the largest
increase both in quantum (up $4.8m to
$19.1m) and percentage wise (up 34 per
cent) was in respect of depreciation,
depletion and amortisation. This results
primarily from a combination of
increased overall production and further
increases in estimated capital costs to
produce booked reserves. As with 2006,
the $2.8m increase in operating costs
primarily results from a combination 
of increased production volumes and
price inflation.
The Group’s trading performance in 
2007 was driven by strong increases in
production of both oil and gas, coupled
with continuing material increases in
both oil and gas prices. This provided 
the platform to improve on last year’s
record levels of revenue profitability and
cash flow.
Revenue
Overall revenues increased 40 per cent 
to $184.5m (2006: $131.7m) driven by
increases across sales volumes and
realisations of both oil and gas. Excluding
other revenue (management charges,
and non-oil and gas sales), of the $51.4m
increase, $29.7m (58 per cent) results
from higher revenues from oil and
$21.7m (42 per cent) from gas. In the
case of oil revenues, the increase is an
approximate equal split between price
and volume function increases whereas
with gas, approximately two-thirds of 
the increase is price related reflecting
increased Ukrainian domestic gas 
prices. The average sales price for oil
rose 11 per cent to $60.37/bbl (2006:
$54.31/bbl) and production volumes 
were up 13 per cent at 2.02 mmbbl, 
an average 5,539 bopd (2006: 4,895
bopd). The average sales price for gas,
however, increased 40 per cent to
$3.95/Mcf (2006: $2.83/Mcf). Gas
production volumes were up 13 per cent
to 15.4 Bcf (2006: 13.7 Bcf), an average
42.3 MMcfd (2006: 37.5 MMcfd).

Financial instruments
The Group’s financial instruments
comprise of cash and liquid resources,
and various items such as trade and
other receivables, and trade and other
payables that arise directly from its
operations. The main purpose of these
financial instruments is to finance the
Group’s operations.
Financial risk factors 
The Group’s activities expose it to a
variety of financial risks: market risk
(including currency risk, interest rate risk
and price risk), credit risk and liquidity
risk. The Group’s overall risk
management programme focuses on the
unpredictability of financial markets in
which it operates and seeks to minimise
potential adverse effects on the Group’s
financial performance. 
Risk management is carried out by the
Finance Director under policies approved
by the Board of Directors. 
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally
and is exposed to foreign exchange
risk arising from various currency
exposures, primarily with respect to
Ukrainian hryvna and the Russian
rouble. Foreign exchange risk arises
Dividend
As with 2006, the Board proposes to
double the final dividend to 2.4 pence 
per share, resulting in a total dividend 
for the year of 4.4 pence per share (2006: 
2.2 pence per share). This proposed final
dividend will be recognised when paid in
the 2008 financial year . The dividend of
3.2 pence per share recognised in the
accounts relates to the dividends paid 
in the period.
Cash flow/Net cash
Net cash from operating activities (after
tax payments of $38.7m and net interest
received of $5.2m) was $119.9m, up 
59 per cent (2006: $75.6m). Net cash
used in investing activities increased 
173 per cent to $125.2m (2006: $45.9m).
This material increase is a combination
of increased development activity in
Ukraine which accounts for the majority
of increase in purchase of property plant
and equipment and intangible assets to
$80.7m (2006: $43.9m) and the net
$44.4m (2006: $nil) expended in
acquiring Yuzhgasenergie LLC, the
Group’s new Russian gas development
asset. Proceeds from the issue of shares
increased 91 per cent to $2.3m (2006:
$1.2m) as a result of share options
exercised in the period having on average
a higher exercise price compared to
2006. There was no expenditure or
income in the period in relation to
treasury shares (2006: net treasury 
share acquisition costs of $2.8m). At
period end a balance of 402,771 shares
(2006: 402,771) remained in treasury.
The significant $5.7m increase in general
and administrative expenses is mainly a
function of $0.2m in foreign exchange
loss in the period compared to a $3.9m 
in foreign exchange gain in 2006. As with
operating costs, the remaining $1.6m 
of the increase relates to general price
inflation and increased activity in the
period. A $5.0m impairment of
investment (2006: $nil) was recognised 
in the period in relation to an investment
in a Ukrainian oil and gas company.
Finance income rose 41 per cent ($1.4m)
to $4.8m (2006: $3.4m) as a result of an
increase in cash resources during the
period.
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate excluding
the effect of the impairment/write off
charges made in the period is essentially
unchanged at 28.2 per cent (2006: 
28.8 per cent).
Profit for the year: The profit after tax 
for 2007 was $74.4m (2006: $77.8m) or
down 4 per cent a net effect of the above
elements but particularly driven by the
net $36.1m movement in impairment/
write off charges between 2006 (a net
write back of $13.4m) and 2007 (a net
charge of $17.7m). The basic earnings
per share is down slightly by 
6 per cent to 47.97 cents per share 
(2006: 50.89 cents per share) as a result
of lower profits (for the reasons noted
above), and a higher weighted average
number of shares in issue in the period
(a function of exercised options).

remaining period at the balance sheet
to the contractual maturity date. The
amounts disclosed in the table are the
contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Balances due within 12 months equal
their carrying balances as the impact
of discounting is not significant. 
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing
capital are to safeguard the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern in
order to provide returns for shareholders
and benefits for other stakeholders and
to maintain an optimal capital structure
to reduce the cost of capital. 
In order to maintain or adjust the capital
structure, the Group may adjust the
amount of dividends paid to shareholders,
return capital to shareholders, issue new
shares or sell assets. 
The Group has no borrowings (2006:
$nil).
Fair value estimation
The carrying value less impairment
provision of trade receivables and
payables are assumed to approximate
their fair values. The fair value of
financial liabilities for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting 
the future contractual cash flows at 
the current market interest rate that 
is available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates
had increased 50 basis points with all
other variables held constant, post-tax
profit for the year would have increased
by $0.3m (2006: $0.4m).
The Group manages its cash flow interest
rate risk by using floating interest rates. 
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk arises from cash and cash
equivalents and deposits with banks
and financial institutions, as well 
as credit exposures to customers,
including outstanding receivables
and committed transactions. Credit
risk on cash and cash equivalents is
managed at a Group level. For banks
and financial institutions, only
independently rated parties with a
minimum rating of ‘A’ are accepted.
Local customers are managed at
local level and are evaluated if there
is no independent rating, taking
account of its financial position, 
past experience and other factors. 
Management does not expect any
losses from non-performance by 
any counterparties.
The Company does not have any
concentration of credit risk and the
management does not consider
there to be any exposure to loss.
(c) Liquidity risk
Management monitors rolling
forecasts of the Group’s liquidity 
on the basis of expected cash flow.
Table 1 below analyses the Group’s
financial liabilities into relevant
maturity groupings based on the
from future commercial
transactions, recognised assets and
liabilities and net investments in
foreign operations. 
The Group manages its exposure 
by matching, as far as is practical,
receipts and payments in the same
currency and by following a range 
of commercial policies to minimise
exposure to the hryvna denominated
sales. 
At 31 December 2007, if the hryvna
had strengthened/(weakened) by 
10 per cent against the US dollar
with all other variables held constant,
post-tax profit for the year would
have been $0.8m (2006: $0.6m)
lower/(higher), and if the Russian
rouble has strengthened/(weakened)
by 10 per cent against the US dollar
with all other variables held constant,
post-tax profit would have been
$1.3m (2006: $nil) lower/(higher),
mainly as a result of hryvna
denominated gas trade receivables.
(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to international
oil and gas price movements. The
Group is a price taker and does not
enter hedge agreements unless
required for borrowing purposes.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest 
rate risk
As the Group has no significant
interest-bearing assets, the Group’s
income and operating cash flows are
substantially independent of changes
in market interest rates.

30 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The Board considers the future
production profile of the Group’s
interests to underpin the value of its
asset portfolio. Accordingly, the level
of annual production is the measure
by which Management monitors
delivery of portfolio development.
The 13 per cent increase in 2007
resulted mainly from increased
activity on the northern area of
Molchanovskoye within PPC’s Novo-
Nikolaevskoye licence complex.
Capital expenditure is used by
Management to monitor investment, 
on both a country specific and
regional basis. The increase in 2007
reflects investment in each of the
countries in which the Group has
interests, primarily in Ukraine 
and Russia.
The Board believes a core skill 
of the Group to be the low-cost
development of onshore gas assets
in and around Ukraine. A key
measure used to monitor this is the
level of production costs. Increased
levels of production along with
inflationary factors in Ukraine were
responsible for a 5 per cent increase
in production costs. Nonetheless
these costs remained within the
budget for 2007.
Our strategy is to develop oil and gas interests in and around the
states of the former Soviet Union. Our specific focus is on Ukraine
and Russia and their exciting gas markets. We will continue to invest
in the region and further apply our knowledge to consolidate our
position as the most experienced western operator in Ukraine. JKX’s
deep understanding and expertise in the region underpins its ability
to deliver upon its strategy, benefit from the evolving Ukrainian and
Russian gas landscapes and return value to shareholders.

The Ukrainian gas market is a key
focus of the Board who believe the
Ukrainian domestic gas price will,
after accounting for net-backed
transportation costs, converge with
gas prices in western Europe. The
Group’s strategy is to maximise
exposure to this upside and deliver
value from it. Accordingly the growth
in, and level of, realisations for the
Group’s Ukrainian gas production 
is a key measure of strategic
performance used by the Board.
The Board believes its strategic
objective of returning value to
shareholders is most appropriately
measured by the return on average
capital employed. This measure, it
believes, reflects the underlying
ability to return value by a
combination of: dividends; share
buy-backs; and any capital
appreciation in the Company’s
equities as may be determined by the
capital markets. The decrease in
2007 reflects the large investment
made in Russia during the year offset
by strong operating performance 
in Ukraine.
The Board believes that a significant
component of the Company’s ability
to add shareholder value lies in its
success in adding to the reserves
base, both through acquisitions and
the organic growth of its existing
production and exploration portfolio.
The addition during the year of
proven and probable reserves in
Russia has resulted in an increase 
of 72 per cent year-on-year .
Measuring performance
The Board and senior management use monthly management reporting to
measure, monitor and manage performance of the Group, its subsidiary
companies and investments. A wide range of measures are included in this
process, the key such measures being those listed below. The Board consider
these measures to most accurately measure performance against the strategy.
The performance in 2007, compared to 2006, is outlined below with explanations
as to how the Board believe each performance indicator is linked to the strategic
objectives of the Group.

relationships we have established. 
We are fortunate that building these
relationships is a core aspect of the 
way that we operate, and it gives us 
a significant opportunity to apply a range
of resources, both internal and external,
to the challenges we face in developing
our programme.
CR organisation
Leadership
Responsibility at Board level for
corporate responsibility rests with the
Chief Executive Officer, Dr Paul Davies,
as the designated director . In each region
in which we operate, we have an
appointed person responsible for health,
safety and environmental management.
Management structure
In 2007, a Group Health, Safety,
Environment and Community (HSEC)
Manager was appointed to create a
consistent and standardised framework
for the management of the Group’s key
non-financial impacts. He is supported
by the appointed representatives in each
operating area. These representatives
are familiar with local culture, regulatory
requirements and operating practices.
They are competent health, safety and
often higher performance demands
expected by our investors. We are also
seeking to expand our performance
management to explore and apply
different solutions not only to particular
health and safety issues we have been
managing, but also to a wider range 
of environmental and community
challenges.
Our progress in developing a strong 
and embedded corporate responsibility
programme is therefore highly
dependent on our ability to use the 
range of local, regional and national
Operating context
We operate primarily in eastern Europe,
in markets that are developing rapidly
following the creation of new states from
the former Soviet Union. Our largest area
of operation is in Ukraine. The tight
regulatory model and the enormous
pressures to build strong and robust
economies is typical of many of the
places in which we operate. In many of
the countries in which we operate, we not
only seek to comply with the prescriptive
regulatory requirements established by
the national authorities, but also seek to
exceed these requirements to meet the
JKX has three fire engines at PPC’s key
production facility at Novo-Nikolaevskoye
complex which are made available 
to communities within the region for
emergencies. In 2007, JKX fire engine’s
helped with approximately 20 incidents.
Corporate responsibility in JKX
Vision and values
One of the core strengths of the Company is our knowledge and understanding 
of the communities in which we work. As our knowledge of the impact of a wider
range of non-financial aspects of business performance is enhanced, we have
become increasingly aware of the way that effective management of our impacts
enables us to do business more effectively.
We have always sought to achieve the highest standards of health and safety
performance. As we expand the range of aspects that we are monitoring, we
realise that, in corporate responsibility reporting terms, we are near the beginning
of our journey. The aim of our corporate responsibility report this year is to explain
what we have been doing in these wider core non-financial areas, and how we are
now putting in place a range of policies, processes, actions and other initiatives to
build on these early, organic foundations.

communities. We have not previously
developed measures of performance to
track how well we are meeting local
needs and expectations, but we report via
the case studies in this report, examples
of how we work with our communities 
to support their development. We are
examining appropriate objectives, targets
and KPIs which we comment on later 
in this report.
Benchmarks and standards
In determining how we will develop our
corporate responsibility programmes, 
we have undertaken a range of
benchmarking initiatives. We are looking
at what members of the International
Association of Oil and Gas Producers
(OGP) are themselves doing to provide 
an initial reference. We have also started
working with the Carbon Trust to develop
a carbon management programme and
understand our carbon footprint. In
addition, we have begun a dialogue 
with the Association of British Insurers
(ABI) about how we may improve our
governance systems and what their
expectations of effective CR reporting
are. We will be using this research to
inform our targets and KPI setting.
We have pursued an ambitious
programme to implement OHSAS 18001,
ISO 14001 and ISO 9000 series safety 
and health, environmental and quality
management systems at both
administrative and operational sites. 
We intend to have all key sites accredited
within the next three years. As part of 
this programme, we are benchmarking
current standards of performance so that
reviewed by the Audit Committee and
reported as appropriate to the Board.
Over the last year, one of the key
priorities for the HSEC Manager has
been to establish management systems
for non-financial risks, particularly with
regard to our high impact areas of
health, safety and environment. We are
now developing the risk management
system for these impacts and we expect
this in due course to form an integral
part of our Group-wide risk management
process.
In some of the locations in which we
operate, the prevailing culture has been
to report success rather than failure. 
A proactive risk management approach
demands that we track both success and
failure against agreed benchmarks,
targets and performance indicators. One
of our key priorities in the current year 
is to train our locally employed people to
work in this way and to show them why 
it is advantageous for them to do so.
The introduction of these evolving
systems has enabled us to determine 
our key impacts and issues with more
robustness and certainty. These are
addressed in more detail later in this 
CR report.
Stakeholder engagement
Our stakeholder engagement
programmes are typically developed 
in conjunction with our contractual
requirements at the local level. While 
the basic programmes are part of our
commercial arrangements, we have
typically adopted a proactive stance
towards building relationships with local
environment practitioners. The Group
HSEC Manager reports directly to the
Group Chief Executive. In each operating
company, we identify, appoint and train a
nominated individual who has executive
responsibility for health, safety and
environment. This individual reports
directly to the general director of the
local operating company.
CR policies
Prior to this year, while we had a range 
of local policies and practices in place in
our operating companies, our operating
practices often implicitly adopted a
responsible approach to the way that we
undertook business and engaged with
the communities in which we operate.
We recognised that this relatively
informal method was insufficient within
the rapidly changing and expanding
areas where we have a presence. One 
of our key short-term objectives over 
the year was to develop an appropriate
range of policies which encompass 
our key impacts. Accordingly, we have
implemented a series of HSE policies
and procedures. Where the policies and
practices of our local partners have fallen
short of these, we have required them to
comply with the standards we have set
ourselves. It is our ongoing practice to
apply a consistent standard across all
our theatres of operation, building on
local regulatory and contractual
requirements but exceeding these where
we consider it appropriate to do so.
CR risk management
The Company has a well-established risk
management process which is regularly
JKX has a well established track record in
maintaining high health and safety
standards. This commitment is extended
towards our work in the local communities
where, this year, JKX has contributed
three ambulances to local hospitals in
Ukraine. In addition to this, the Company’s
medical crew at PPC is made available to
provide assistance as required to the
communities.

enhanced and extended environmental
policies, procedures and management.
These requirements address the 
need to comply with local and national
environmental performance
requirements. In addition, as we
implement ISO 14001 through the
operations, we are introducing
continuous improvement practices. 
We will be identifying, measuring and
managing our key environmental
impacts. We anticipate that we will be
developing key performance objectives,
targets and indicators in carbon
management, energy use, transport and
fuel use, leaks and spills and waste
management. We are working with the
Carbon Trust to develop our carbon
management programme.
Community
Our philosophy as a company has been
to engage with the communities in 
which we operate to ensure that we 
are managing our operations with their
interests in mind. In addition, we value
the benefits this brings in maintaining
public confidence in the integrity of our
operations and products and our
commitment to HSEC performance.
However, we have not previously sought
to measure the benefits that our
community and social programmes
deliver . As we become clear on the
implementation of our enhanced HSE
programme, we will look at how to do
this so that we can maximise the benefits
of our programmes to local communities.
Our case studies in this report illustrate
how we have and how we continue to
engage with our local communities.
in the early stages of identifying an
appropriate management system.
Operating locations
Our strategy is to develop a portfolio of 
oil and gas interests in and around the
states of the former Soviet Union. The
operating cultures in these states are
very much compliance-driven. While we
must comply with the laws in these states,
we are also seeking to open and continue
dialogues with the authorities in these
regions to move the overall culture to a
more proactive risk management model. 
Key impacts and issues
Health and safety
Any health and safety management
system will fail if it lacks the support 
of senior management and the
commitment of the workforce. Our work
to date has focused on embedding our
safety culture more strongly throughout
the Company. We have introduced a
Company-wide HSE management
system to support the established
systems in local operating companies.
This will enable the faster identification
and implementation of best practice
throughout our operations.
All temporary and permanent changes 
to organisation, personnel, systems,
procedures, equipment, products,
materials or substances will be
evaluated and managed as a matter 
of routine good practice.
Environment
We have introduced project
environmental management and
performance requirements as part of our
we have clear reference points upon
which to assess and guide future
performance and targets.
In setting local benchmarks, we ensured
that we have taken into account local
culture and training capacity for the skills
we need within the Company to apply
appropriate standards. We remain
sensitive to the fact that we are guests 
in the countries in which we operate and
that, while seeking to attain a consistent
Group-wide standard on key issues, 
we are also doing so in the context 
of differing local expectations and
regulatory frameworks. This, however,
is not an obstacle in our aspiration to set
common health, safety and enviromental
practices across the Group. Nevertheless,
any systems we develop must be
sensitive to and build upon local
conditions.
Data management
We have not previously managed and
maintained a central data management
system for non-financial metrics. A key
part of the evolving management
systems is the introduction of centrally
managed and collated data management
processes. We are focusing initially on
HSE and local community metrics, which
are the areas of significant impacts and
issues for us. Effective data management
is a prerequisite not only to ensure that
we are able to obtain certification under
the various standards we have described
above, but also to enable us to ensure
that we are able to introduce and support
targets and KPIs in accordance with our
emerging key impacts and issues. We are
In 2007, JKX purchased and installed
underfloor heating for the local
kindergarten in Andreyevka village.
Previously, JKX also provided manpower
for the decoration of the kindergarten in
addition to installing new water and
sewage facilities at the premises.
Andreyevka Kindergarten, Andreyevka,
near Poltava, Ukraine Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 35
Quantitative data and targets
The KPIs that we have already
established are simple and designed 
to measure two key areas of progress 
in our HSEC management programme,
capacity development and incident
reporting. We are looking at:
• training frequencies;
• incident reporting frequencies;
• environmental incident reporting
frequencies;
• auditing and monitoring frequencies;
and 
• vehicle incident frequencies and
miles driven.
We are still collating baseline data in
these KPI areas. As and when we are
clear that we have the ability to report on
these in a reliable, consistent and robust
manner, we will publish appropriate
targets.
Objectives, targets and KPIs
Performance management
It is our intention not to report on all
aspects of the data that we collect, but to
concentrate the use of our resources on
those issues that are fundamental now 
to providing the most effective corporate
responsibility programme we can
achieve, given the state of development of
our programme and the environments
in which we operate. We will over the
coming year determine where we are
most likely to be able to improve
performance through carefully selected
and determined objectives, targets
and KPIs.
We have undertaken local hazard
identification studies in our principal
operations. Introducing appropriate
performance standards and
improvement measures is going to take
in the region of 12-18 months. It is our
strong preference to grow capability
organically where possible rather than to
import it, as we feel that this is the best
way to embed the understanding and
commitment necessary to achieve the
levels of performance and improvement
that we seek. Where we have not been
able to recruit people with the right skills,
we appoint people with local experience
and train them to the standards
we require.
JKX has a long-standing commitment
towards supporting education in local
communities where the Company has a
presence. This year, JKX donated a bus to
the Sokolova Balka School which is used
daily by children from three local villages. 
Qualitative targets
During the 2008-2009 financial year, 
we will:
• continue to roll out the
implementation of health and
safety, environmental and quality
management systems;
• develop ways to assess the scale
and impact of our community
economic and social contributions;
• scope out necessary policies and
management frameworks to
deliver against the key impacts
and issues that we have
identified;
• continue to recruit and train local
people to implement and manage
our emerging corporate
responsibility programmes;
• engage with local contractors to
ensure that they work to the
same standards as we are setting
for ourselves, and that they
understand why this is necessary;
• continue to develop local risk
registers and appropriate and
achievable action plans arising
from these;
• explore the feasibility of moving
people between our operating
regions so that they gain a wider
understanding and practical
experience of good practice in a
wider range of contexts; and
• continue to work with selected
partners to ensure that the
systems that we are putting in
place are being implemented 
on a SMART basis so that we are
confident that we are setting
ourselves reasonable aspirations.

38 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
Included in Special Business there are two special resolutions:
a) Purchase of own shares: The Directors recommend that
the Company seek authorisation at the AGM to renew the
authority for the Company to make on-market purchases 
of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company, such
authority to expire on the earlier of 15 months from the date
of the passing of the resolution and the conclusion of the
next AGM (if sooner). The minimum price payable per share
under the proposed authority in this resolution is the
nominal amount of each share (currently 10 pence) and the
maximum price (exclusive of expenses) is 5 per cent above
the average market price per share for the five business
days immediately preceding any purchase. If granted, the
authority will allow the Company to take advantage, if
appropriate, of stock market conditions to purchase its own
shares. In assessing whether to purchase the Company’s
own shares, the Directors will take into account all relevant
factors including the effect on earnings per share and
assets per share ratios and other benefits to shareholders.
Any shares purchased would be held as treasury shares.
b) Amendments to the Articles: The Companies Act 2006 (the
2006 Act) has enacted certain new provisions regarding the
administration of companies which led the Board to
consider it appropriate to make amendments to the Articles
of Association. These may be summarised as follows:
(i) The 2006 Act enables an Extraordinary General Meeting
convened to propose a special resolution to be held on
14 rather than 21 days’ notice and the Articles of
Association will be amended accordingly;
(ii) From 1 October 2008, the 2006 Act requires directors to
avoid conflicts of interest between themselves and their
companies but permits the boards of companies to
authorise such conflicts and potential conflicts where
such authority is permitted by the Company’s Articles of
Association. The 2006 Act further allows articles of
association to contain other provisions to deal with
directors’ conflicts of interest. Article 107 as revised 
will accordingly authorise the Board to approve such
situations and will include the ancillary provisions,
subject to certain safeguards.
c) Directors’ ordinary remuneration: The Board believes it 
is now appropriate to increase the limit on the ordinary
remuneration payable to Directors (excluding amounts
payable to Executive Directors) from £250,000 to £500,000
and that Article 104 should be amended accordingly.
Exploration and production interests
In the opinion of the directors, the Group’s exploration and
production interests have a value in excess of the balance sheet
figure. Expenditure for the year is detailed in note 15 (a) to
these accounts.
The Directors submit their report and the audited accounts 
for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Results and dividends
The result for the year is a profit for the year before tax of
$113.3m (2006: $109.2m). The profit for the year after tax is
$74.4m (2006: $77.8m). Following payment of the interim
dividend, details of which are set out in note 11 to the financial
statements, the Directors recommend a final dividend of 
2.4 pence per share for the year ended 31 December 2007 
to be paid on 30 May 2008 to shareholders on the register 
on 11 April 2008. This payment will bring the total dividend 
in respect of 2007 to 4.4 pence per share. A review of major
financial developments during the year is contained in the
Financial Review. 
Activities
The principal activities of the Group are oil and gas exploration
and production conducted through subsidiary undertakings.
Business Review
Details of the Company’s 2007 operations are included in the
Chairman’s statement and the Chief Executive’s statement. 
A review of financial performance including key performance
indicators for the business, is included in the Financial Review
on pages 30 and 31.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Company will be held
at 11.00 am on 29 May 2008 at the premises of Cardew Group, 
12 Suffolk Street, London SW1Y 4HG.
The business for the meeting includes nine resolutions as
Ordinary Business and two resolutions proposed as Special
Business.
Included as Ordinary Business are resolutions to re-elect five
Directors.
Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC and Viscount Asquith are proposed
for re-election given they have both served on the Board for
more than nine years. The Board has conducted a rigorous
review and concludes that Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC and
Viscount Asquith remain independent. As was reported in the
2006 Report and Accounts, in the spirit of the principles of
Corporate Governance contained in the Combined Code of
Corporate Governance appended to the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, the Board believes it appropriate
to seek annual re-election of all Non-executive Directors who
serve on the Board for greater than nine years.
Mr Dixon, Mr Miller and Mr Moore were appointed to the Board
after the Annual General Meeting in 2007 and therefore under
the Articles of Association retire and are seeking re-election. Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 39

Statement by the Directors on compliance with the 
Combined Code
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate
governance contained in the Combined Code of Corporate
Governance that is appended to the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority and for which the Board is
accountable to shareholders. It is, however, accepted that 
there are three items of non-compliance, concerning: Board
composition, Non-executive Director terms of appointment 
and the setting of the Chairman’s remuneration by the Board.
These matters are further discussed on pages 41 and 42. 
The Board composition is currently being addressed, but the
Company continues to believe the other two items remain
reasonable. 
The Board
The Board, which is responsible to shareholders for leading,
developing and protecting the interests of the Company,
comprises three Non-executive Directors and four Executive
Directors, the details of whom are contained on pages 36 and 37.
There is a clear division of responsibilities at the head of the
Company through the separation of positions of the Non-
executive Chairman, Lord Fraser and the Chief Executive
Officer, Dr Paul Davies. The Non-executive Directors are of
varied backgrounds and experience and the Board considers
them to exercise independent and objective judgment.
Matters reserved specifically for the Board are clearly laid
down. The Board: sets and monitors strategy; reviews business
plans, trading performance and overhead costs; approves
major capital investment projects; examines acquisition
opportunities; divestment possibilities and significant financial
and operational issues; and reviews and approves the
Company’s financial statements and control and risk
management systems. In executing these responsibilities the
Board relies on the receipt of accurate, timely and clear
information, the dissemination of which is the responsibility of
the Chairman. All other authorities are delegated by the Board,
supported by appropriate controls, to the Chief Executive Officer
on behalf of senior management.
Evaluation of the performance of Directors, the Board and its
committees is undertaken as follows: the Executive Directors
are evaluated by the Non-executive Directors in informal
session; the Chairman is evaluated by the other Non-executive
Board meetings

• B.2.2 The Remuneration Committee comprises the three
Non-executive Directors, which includes the Chairman. The
setting of the Chairman’s remuneration is the responsibility
of the Board and not the Remuneration Committee. The
Board believes this is appropriate given the Board size.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee currently comprises the three Non-
executive Directors and is chaired by Mr Nigel Moore, who as 
a former audit partner with Ernst & Young LLP possesses 
both recent and relevant financial experience. Mr Moore was
appointed Chairman of the Committee on 26 June 2007 upon
the resignation of Mr John Mapplebeck.
The Audit Committee, which has Terms of Reference agreed by
the Board and available to shareholders on request, meets at
least three times a year to: review the Company’s accounting
policies; to monitor the integrity of the financial statements 
of the Company and any announcements relating to the
Company’s financial performance, reviewing significant
financial reporting judgments contained in them; to review the
Company’s internal financial controls; to review internal control
and risk management systems and compliance procedures; to
report to the Board any matters which it considers actions or
improvement are needed with associated recommendations 
as to steps to be taken; and to make recommendations to the
Board, for it to put to shareholders for their approval in general
meeting, in relation to the appointment, reappointment and
removal of the external auditor and to approve the
remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor .
During 2007, the Committee met three times with each
Committee member attending all meetings held whilst they 
sat on the Committee except Lord Fraser who did not attend
the meeting of 24 September 2007. Meetings are attended, 
by invitation, by the Chief Executive Officer and the Finance
Director .
The Audit Committee reviews each of the Company’s
subsidiaries, interests and activities at least once a year; site
visits are also undertaken.
The Audit Committee maintains an objective and professional
relationship with the Company’s auditors and meets in private
session with them at least once a year . From time-to-time, the
auditor is requested to perform non-audit engagements for 
the Group. In such instances the continued objectivity and
independence of the auditors in their capacity of auditor is 
an objective of the Group. To meet this objective the Audit
Committee is delegated the role of vetting the appointment of
the auditor on specific engagements including considerations
of materiality and, where necessary, requiring a competitive
tender for such work.
The Company promotes a culture of openness and in
encouraging staff to, in confidence, raise any concerns of
possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other
matters. The Audit Committee has reviewed arrangements for
such concerns to be raised, investigated and if necessary
followed up.
Compliance
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2007, the Company
has maintained procedures and policies that ensured
compliance with the code provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Combined Code and the related Financial Services Authority
Listing Rule disclosure requirements. The Listing Rules of the
UK Listing Authority require that companies report on the
extent to which they comply with the Principles of Good
Governance and Code of Best Practice. The Board believes the
Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code with the following
exceptions:
• A.3.2 Excluding the Chairman, independent Non-executive
Directors do not comprise at least 50% of the Board. The
Board considers that the Chairman and the two other Non-
executive Directors are wholly independent. In March 2008
the Executive Directors undertook a review of the
independence of each of the Non-executive Directors and
Chairman. The review addressed the matters highlighted 
at Section A.3.1 of the Code, which could appear to affect 
a Director’s judgment. It was noted that Viscount Asquith 
as of 1 January 2008 no longer receives fees for providing
consulting services to the Company and PPC, although he
did receive such fees during the calendar year 2007. One
specific matter addressed was Lord Fraser and Viscount
Asquith having both served on the Board for more than nine
years. Following the review, the Non-executive Directors 
do not consider that this matter in any way influence the
independent judgment of Lord Fraser or Viscount Asquith.
Consultancy fees paid to John Mapplebeck, prior to his
resignation on 26 June 2007 related purely to his position 
as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committee
and in no way influenced his independent judgment. 
In the opinion of the Board, the appointment of an
additional Non-executive Director is now appropriate and 
is being addressed by the Nominations Committee in 2008.
• A.7.2 The terms of appointment of the Non-executive
Directors are set out in their service contracts, which for
Lord Fraser and Viscount Asquith are dated 1 January 2002,
and for Nigel Moore is dated 12 July 2007 and include a
termination notice of three months by either party.
However, the service contracts are for an indefinite term,
not a finite term, subject to re-election on an as required
basis. The Board continues to believe this is appropriate
given the company size, non-executive skill set, and
evaluation of performance and independence on an
ongoing basis with regards to Non-executives. As stated 
in the 2006 annual report, the Company contracted Mercer
to review the remuneration of Non-executive Directors,
including the Chairman. Mercer’s report included a review
of the alignment of JKX’s Non-executive remuneration with
best practice corporate governance. Despite the review
confirming that the unspecified term of appointment was
misaligned with corporate best practice, the Company has
decided the unspecified term continues to be reasonable
and the Non-executive contracts remain unchanged in 
this regard.  Corporate governance continued

by an additional Non-executive Director a matter being
addressed by the Committee in 2008.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for identifying and evaluating the
major business risks faced by the Company and for
determining and monitoring the appropriate course of action 
to manage these risks. The Audit Committee monitors the
integrity of the financial statements and financial statement
announcements, reviews the Company’s internal control
processes and risk management systems and reports its
conclusions to the Board.
The Board regularly conducts reviews, and has reviewed, for 
the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
2007 Annual Report and Accounts, the effectiveness of the
Company’s systems of internal control and risk management
and has concluded that the Company’s procedures, policies and
systems are appropriate and suitable to enable the Board to
safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets,
and comply with Turnbull Guidance.
The Audit Committee annually reviews, and has reviewed for
2007, the need for a dedicated internal audit function and, as
noted above, has recommended to the Board that, due to the
scale and geographic distribution of the Company’s licences
and operating interests, the Board continues to be best served
by utilising external specialist assistance on dedicated business
and financial risk areas to supplement the Company’s own 
risk analysis. The process and systems of internal control are
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
The key procedures, which the Directors have established with
a view to providing effective internal control, are described
below. In addition, the Company’s independent auditors present
reports to the Audit Committee, which include any significant
internal control matters that they have identified as part of their
normal audit work.
Business risk
An ongoing process is in place to enable the Board to identify
the major business, operational, financial and compliance risks
faced by the Company and to determine the appropriate course
of action to manage and monitor these risks. This process is
regularly reviewed by the Audit Committee and reported to the
Board as appropriate.
The Company identifies and distinguishes ‘High Profile Events’,
i.e. those risks that could have material effect on the
Company’s financial position or reputation, from other business
risks that it assesses and considers to be acceptable for the
The Audit Committee has reviewed the Revised Combined
Code, specifically Section C that addresses Audit Committee
aspects, and considers that it complies with all the provisions
identified apart from the provision concerning the need to have
a dedicated internal audit function which is not established for
the reasons listed below. Areas of non-compliance in addition 
to Section C are listed above.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises the three
Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Viscount Asquith,
who was appointed Chairman of the committee on 26 June
2007 upon the resignation of Mr John Mapplebeck. The
Company’s Chairman, Lord Fraser, is included on the
Committee to meet its objective of being comprised of three
members. The Chief Executive Officer attends meetings by
invitation.
The Remuneration Committee which has terms of reference
agreed by the Board and available to shareholders on request,
meets at least twice a year, to assist the Board in determining
the remuneration arrangements and contracts of the Directors
and senior employees.
During 2007, the Remuneration Committee met three times
with each of the members attending each of the meetings held
whilst they were members.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The report of the Directors’ remuneration, which involves
details of the Directors’ interest in options together with
information on service contracts, is set out on pages 44 to 50.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Revised
Combined Code, specifically Section B that addresses the level,
make-up and procedural aspects of remuneration. 
The Remuneration Committee considers that it complies with
all the provisions and practices identified with the exception of
provision (B2.2) concerning the setting of the Chairman’s
remuneration for the reasons listed above.
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are the three 
Non-executives, Lord Fraser (Chairman), Viscount Asquith 
and Mr Nigel Moore. The Nomination Committee did not meet
formally in 2007.
Separate to the Nomination Committee, the Board discuss the
skill set and experience of the individual Board members, the
need for additional appointments, succession planning and the
need for progressive refreshing of the Board. The most recent
comprehensive review was undertaken in 2005. During 2007,
the Board reviewed the need for additional appointments and
decided that the composition of the Board would be enhanced Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 43
Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity and competence of personnel is ensured through
high recruitment standards and subsequent training courses.
High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the
control environment and the ethical standards expected are
communicated through the corporate accounting and
procedures manual.
Investment appraisal
Capital investment is regulated by the budgetary process and
authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond specified levels,
detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board.
Capital expenditures are reviewed with major overruns in terms
of cost and time being investigated.
The internal financial control situation is reported to the Audit
Committee, which has reviewed the effectiveness of the system
of internal financial controls as it operated during the year and
reported its conclusions to the Board.
Communication with shareholders
Extensive information about the Group’s activities is provided in
the Annual Report and Accounts and the Interim Report which
are sent to shareholders. There is a regular dialogue with
institutional shareholders for which the Board, as a whole, 
has responsibility, and enquiries from individuals on matters
relating to their shareholding and the business of the Group 
are welcomed and are dealt with in an informative and timely
manner . All shareholders are encouraged to attend the AGM 
to discuss the progress of the Group.
Going concern
After making inquiries and taking into consideration the
Ukrainian and Russian business environments, as detailed in
note 30 of the accounts, together with reviewing the Company’s
budget for 2008 and its medium-term plans, the Directors have
a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate
resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future. The
going concern basis for the accounts has therefore continued to
be adopted.

financial risk perspective to ensure that the system of internal
control and accountability is embedded in the operations of the
Group. Members of the Audit Committee visit subsidiaries and
operations on a regular basis.
The Audit Committee considers that management are fully
aware of the need to identify and assess risks in their
operations and the effect of changes in the business
environment, to respond quickly and appropriately and to report
immediately any significant control failings and weaknesses
that are identified together with details of corrective action.
Management structure
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by
the Board. Each Executive has been given responsibility and is
accountable for specific aspects of the Group’s affairs. 
Financial reporting
The Company maintains an effective and reliable accounting
and management information system. The Board receives a
monthly report that monitors actual performance against
budget and forecast for oil and gas production; sales and costs;
and provides the Board with information amongst other things
on debtors, the cash position, cash flow forecasting and to the
financial implications of key sensitivities including changes in
commodity prices and exchange rates.
Budgetary process
Each year the Board approves the annual budget with key risk
areas identified. Performance is monitored and relevant action
taken throughout the year through the monthly reporting to the
Board of variances from the budget, updated forecasts for the
year together with information on the key risk areas.
Corporate accounting and procedures manual
Responsibility levels are communicated throughout the Group
as part of the corporate accounting and procedures manual
which sets out, inter alia, the general ethos of the Group,
delegation of authority and authorisation levels, segregation of
duties and control procedures together with accounting policies
and procedures. The manual, which includes policies common
to all Group companies along with company-specific
procedures and controls are reviewed regularly and updated 
as required.
The application of internal financial control and operational
procedures are reviewed during visits to the overseas offices 
by Head Office staff. In 2007, the Committee met on three occasions to discuss,
agree and make recommendations to the Board on the
following issues:
• 18 January – to approve payments to be made under the
Annual Bonus Scheme relating to performance in 2006 and
to approve salary changes for 2007;
• 15 March – to approve the strategic objectives, financial and
share price targets for the 2007 Annual Bonus Scheme, to
confirm the vesting of share options made in 2003 and to
discuss and agree the performance conditions to be used 
in and agree the allocation of share options in 2007; and
• 24 September – to discuss Executive Directors’ service
agreements. 
Remuneration policy
The Company’s overall approach to pay and benefits is to
reward employees competitively, taking into account Company
and individual performance, market value and competitive
pressures in the independent oil and gas sector . The Company
does not seek to maintain any strict market position but aims to
ensure that pay is set at an appropriate level and is comparable
with peer group companies.
The Committee has appointed Mercer to provide technical
advice on developments and market trends in how Directors’
remuneration packages are structured, to provide general
advice on remuneration matters including contract structure
and to provide information on remuneration levels in
comparator oil and gas companies. Mercer provide no other
services to the Group.
The comparator companies are UK-based oil and gas
companies and are primarily quoted on the LSE or AIM. These
companies subscribe to a survey conducted by Mercer . For
comparator purposes the Committee requested Mercer to
group them into three divisions in the UK oil and gas sector,
which includes subsidiaries of non-UK parent companies.
In early 2007, Mercer was also asked to undertake a ‘health
check’ of the Company’s remuneration practices and policies 
to ensure that the Company was continuing to apply best
practice approach.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for
Executive Directors and senior management:
• Basic annual salary (including Directors’ fees) and benefits;
• Annual bonus payments;
• Medium Term Incentive arrangement i.e. Share Option
Scheme; and
• Pension.

Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) operates
under the delegated authority of the Board; the Committee’s
primary role is to review, agree and approve, or as required
under the Combined Code to make recommendations to the
Board, on:
• the Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors
and senior management;
• service contracts of the Executive Directors;
• remuneration of the Executive Directors;
• remuneration of senior management identified by the
Committee; and
• participation in, and operation of, the Company’s share
option plans.
The full terms of reference are available from the Company
Secretary.
The Committee is chaired by Viscount Asquith (having been
appointed on 26 June 2007 upon the resignation of Mr John
Mapplebeck) and comprises the two independent Non-
executive Directors (Viscount Asquith and Mr Nigel Moore) 
and the Chairman, Lord Fraser, who is included to meet the
Company’s objective of the Committee comprising three
members. Dr Paul Davies, the Chief Executive, attends the
Committee meetings by invitation but is not able to vote and 
is not present when his own remuneration arrangements are
agreed. No Director plays a part in any discussion about his
own remuneration.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest
(other than as a shareholder as detailed in page 44, which 
given the level of holdings the Board accepts as not impairing
independence), conflicts of interests arising from cross-
directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the
business.  Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 45
Annual Bonus Scheme 
The Annual Bonus Scheme, which is based on the achievement
of relevant and stretching performance conditions determined
by the Committee, was introduced in 2001 for Executive
Directors and certain senior management including staff in
Poltava Petroleum Company (PPC). The application of the
scheme in any given year is discretionary and annual awards
are not pensionable.
The Chief Executive may earn an annual performance-related
bonus payment of up to 100 per cent of his basic salary (Bonus
Factor), the Finance Director and Company Secretary 70 per
cent and the Technical and Commercial Directors 60 per cent.
Other senior managers can earn an annual bonus payment of
up to a maximum of 50 per cent of their basic salary. 
The Committee establishes the performance conditions
objectives that must be met for each financial year . The
performance conditions, which are derived from the Company’s
annual budget and strategic plan approved by the Board, are
divided into three segments: 1. financial; 2. increase in share
price; and 3. strategic, as follows:
1. Financial objectives 
(i) Pre-tax profit and (ii) Return on average capital
employed; these include a minimum level (-10 per cent)
below which no bonus element is earned, a target level and
a maximum of (+25 per cent) of the target.
2. Increase in share price
(i) Average annual share price and (ii) Spot year start and
year end share price. 
A ‘strike price’ of base price +0 per cent and +10 per cent is
established respectively for each measurement before any
bonus element is paid. For the maximum to be earned the
average strike price must increase 10 per cent and the spot
strike price must increase 10 per cent. A sliding scale
operates between the base and maximum. 
3. Strategic objectives
This segment includes a variety of measures e.g. book new
reserves, acquire new licences, increase production, drill
exploration wells, develop permits etc; as far as possible
these measures all contain quantifiable figures to reduce
the subjective assessment of performance.
The Board believes that the performance-related elements of
remuneration which feature in the Annual Bonus Scheme and
the Medium Term Incentive Plan (Share Option Scheme) should
form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package
of Executive Directors, should be designed to align their
interests with those of shareholders and structured to give
Executive Directors keen incentives to perform at the highest
levels. The remuneration packages are prudently designed to
attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed
to maintain the Group’s position in the market and to reward
them for enhancing value to shareholders. 
It is the Group’s policy that service contracts, including the
Chief Executive’s, be unlimited in term but capable in normal
circumstances of termination on 12 months’ notice. The
Directors’ contracts of service that include details of
remuneration will be available for inspection at the AGM. The
Directors’ contracts are sterling denominated contracts, and
basic salaries, annual bonuses and other payments are paid 
in sterling.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside
the Company providing that the Chairman’s permission is
sought and fees in excess of £20,000 from all such
appointments are accounted for to the Company.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined
by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
Basic salary
An Executive Director’s basic salary is determined by the
Committee at the beginning of each year and when an
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding
appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a
whole and relies on independent and objective research that
gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of UK
companies operating in the independent oil and gas sector . 
The individual salaries and benefits of Executive Directors 
are reviewed and adjusted taking into account individual
performance and market factors. No Executive Director 
plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive
certain benefits-in-kind, principally health cover .
Details of the Executive Directors’ basic salary and benefits 
in 2007 are shown on page 49. Based on the 2007 results, the Chief Executive received a bonus
payment of £249,900 (80 per cent of basic salary), the Finance
Director and Company Secretary £119,900 (57 per cent), the
Technical Director £57,800 (37 per cent), and the Commercial
Director £60,300 (39 per cent). Other senior management
received bonus payments of between 24 per cent and 39 per
cent of basic salary.
The Bonus Scheme has been in existence for six years. In
March 2007, the Committee reviewed the overall performance 
of the Bonus Scheme and approved revised performance
conditions to apply for 2007 although the basic criteria of
measuring performance against financial, strategic and share
price objectives have been retained. 
Medium Term Incentive arrangements – Share Option Scheme
The Board believes that the attraction, motivation and retention
of senior executives and employees is central to the Company’s
success and is convinced that a medium term incentive plan is
an important and effective means of achieving this objective.
The Inland Revenue approved the JKX Oil & Gas plc
Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2001 and the Unapproved
JKX Oil & Gas Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2001
(collectively the ‘New Share Option Schemes’) that were
introduced in 2001 reflected the best practice aspects
recommended by the Association of British Insurers following
the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI
Guidelines’).
Remuneration report continued
46 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The table below shows that the weighting applied to each
performance condition varies slightly for each Executive
Director (and for senior management). This is done so that the
performance conditions are structured individually to reflect
each Executive Director’s area of responsibility and his ability 
to influence results although the need for the executive
management to operate as a team is also recognised.
To earn the maximum level of bonus requires: all pre-tax profit,
return on average capital and average and spot share price
maxima to be met or exceeded and all of the strategic
objectives to be met.
In 2007, the performance conditions established and the actual
achievements for the financial and share price segments were

Grants are made by reference to the market value (mid-Market
price) of the Company’s shares under option at the time of
grant. Executive Directors are not required to pay for the grant
of share options. 
Annual awards to the Executive Directors are currently limited
to a maximum of 100 per cent salary in the case of the Chief
Executive Officer and the Finance Director and 80 per cent 
for the Technical and Commercial Directors calculated by
reference to the face value of the shares under option at the
time of grant. 
After three years, the number of options that can be exercised
is determined by two factors: (1) the actual increase in the
Company’s share price; and (2) a comparison of the actual
increase in the share price to the change in the FTSE FI until
the end of June 2004 and the FTSE SI until 2006. For awards
made from 2006 onwards the comparison is made against the
higher of the change in the FTSE 250I and the FTSE Oil & Gas
Producers Index.

Share price between exercise price 
and 150 per cent of exercise price Up to 0.5

Share price in excess of 200 per cent

FTSE FI/SI/250I/Oil & Gas Producers Index factor
Where the percentage increase in the share price is:
– in the lowest quartile of the percentage 
growth in the FTSE index 0.25
– in the second quartile of the percentage 
growth in the FTSE index 0.5
– in the third quartile of the percentage 
growth in the FTSE index 0.75
– in the top quartile of the percentage 
growth in the FTSE index 1
The share price and FTSE index factors are multiplied together
and the resultant figure is applied to the number of options
granted to an individual to determine the number of options 
to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale 
as distinct from a specific individual benchmark. It requires the
share price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile
of the growth in the FTSE index for all of the awards granted to
become vested. For awards granted in 2006 onwards the share
price must have doubled and for this increase to be in the top
quartile of the growth in the higher of the FTSE 250I and 
FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index for all of the awards to 
become vested. 
At the time the New Share Option Schemes were developed, 
a variety of alternative measurements to link remuneration to
performance and align the interests of participating Directors
and senior management with those of shareholders were
considered. The ABI Guidelines suggest comparison of the
Company’s performance against an appropriate peer group. 
At the time it was difficult to select sufficient quoted companies
of similar size and profile in the independent oil and gas sector
to form a meaningful peer group. Consequently, it was felt that
an increase in share price combined with a comparison to an
external benchmark, the Financial Times Stock Exchange
Fledgling Index (FTSE FI), was the most appropriate structure. 
As a result of an increase in share price in the second quarter
of 2004, the Company moved up into the FTSE Smallcap Index
(FTSE SI) and the benchmark was rebased. Further increases
in share price meant that in March 2006 the Company moved
up into the FTSE 250 Index (FTSE 250I). 
Also in March 2006, the Committee reviewed the operation and
effectiveness of the New Share Option Schemes taking into
account the Company’s growth, progression out of the FTSE FI
and the relevance of the performance conditions after four
years of operational experience. The Committee concluded that
a comparison of total shareholder return (TSR) against the
FTSE Index in which the Company is a constituent at the time 
of the grant remained an appropriate external benchmark but
that, in view of the substantial changes in oil and gas prices
over the past four years, the share option scheme should also
have an oil and gas industry benchmark. The Committee
concluded that the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the
most appropriate external oil and gas benchmark. 
The Rules of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility,
timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that
the shareholders are to be consulted if any substantive
amendments to the Rules are required. The Committee
continues to feel that ongoing annual refinements of the
scheme are not a substantive change that required shareholder
consultation. 
The Committee has discretion as to the application of the Rules
of the New Share Option Schemes, particularly in the level of
awards and the setting of the level of Performance Conditions.
The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to
administer the New Share Option Schemes. In awarding share
options the Committee take into account the ABI Guidelines in
terms of individual and collective limits and other factors such
as the performance of the Company and the individual in the
previous 12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded
in previous years e.g. dilution, cost to the Company, the overall
remuneration level (annual salary, bonus award and benefits) of
the individual relative to the market and his/performance in the
previous year . Reference is also made to the value of medium
and long-term incentive arrangements in comparator groups
shown in the aforementioned report from Mercer . Remuneration report continued
48 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has
determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise
up to 50 per cent of vested options at any one time and up to 
50 per cent after a period of 12 months, unless determined
otherwise by the Committee.
The graph below shows the Company’s performance,
measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE
FI, the FTSE SI the FTSE 250I and the FTSE Oil Producers Index
measured by TSR. 
Share option awards, vesting and valuation of options
The Committee also confirmed that prudent and appropriate
arrangements for any acquisition and financing of shares to
meet contingent liabilities, to provide shares or meet
obligations are in place.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive
schemes other than the share option schemes described
above. No significant amendments are proposed to be made 
to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director 
to share options.
Pension arrangements
The Company makes a contribution equivalent to 15 per cent 
of basic salary to the pension scheme of the Director’s choice.
Directors’ contracts
It is the Company’s policy that Executive Directors should have
contracts with an indefinite term but with two-way notice
periods. Dr Paul Davies and Mr Bruce Burrows have
employment contracts dated 1 January 2007 and Mr Martin
Miller and Mr Peter Dixon have employment contracts dated 
1 July 2007. All the contracts are subject to one year’s notice 
by either party.

In the event of early termination, the Directors’ contracts
provide for compensation up to a maximum of basic salary for
the notice period.
Non-executive Directors
All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement
and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the
limits set by the Articles of Association and based on
independent surveys of fees paid to Non-executive Directors of
similar companies. The setting of the Chairman’s remuneration
is the responsibility of the Board and not the Committee, 
as recommended by Section B.2.2 of the Combined Code. 
The Board believes this is appropriate given the Board size. 
Lord Fraser and Viscount Asquith have Non-executive Director
service contracts dated 1 January 2002. Mr Nigel Moore’s Non-
executive service contract is dated 12 July 2007. These service
contracts are for an indefinite term, not a finite term as
recommended by Section A.7.2 of the Combined Code, subject
to re-election on an as required basis. However, all of the
contracts are subject to three months’ notice by either party
and as such, the Board continues to believe this is appropriate
given the company size, the non-executive skill set, and the
continuing evaluation of performance and independence. 
In the event of early termination, the Non-executive Directors’
contracts provide for compensation of three months’ base fee.
The Non-executive Directors contracts specify the powers 
and duties of the Non-executive Directors and the time
commitments anticipated and remuneration arrangements.
The Non-executive Directors are paid a base fee for carrying 
out their duties and responsibilities as Directors, and fees for
membership and where applicable chairmanship of each of the
remuneration and audit committees. The base fees is based on
a per annum rate (in sterling) that is compared to published
material concerning Non-executive fees in similar size
companies.
In 2007, the total fees paid to each Non-executive Director in 
the year were: Lord Fraser £49,000, Viscount Asquith £45,000, 
Mr Nigel Moore £23,000 (appointed 26 June 2007) and 
Mr John Mapplebeck (resigned 26 June 2007) £50,000. This
includes compensation for performing the additional roles 
in respect of the Committee and Audit Committee. 
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the
Company’s share option schemes and are not eligible to join 
the Company’s pension scheme.
In March 2007, the Board reviewed the amount of time that the
Non-executive Directors were spending on Company business.
The Board recognised that changes in company law and
corporate governance were placing additional responsibilities
and time requirements on Non-executive Directors. The Board
examined information on Non-executive Directors’ fees in other
and similar companies in the sector . As a result, Mercer were
asked to review existing Non-executive arrangements. Mercer’s
report was received in April 2007 and the levels of
compensation changed to those outlined in this report.  Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 49

52 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report,
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare the financial
statements for each financial year . Under that law, the directors
have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are
required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs
of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period.
In preparing these financial statements the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state that the financial statements comply with IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union; and
• prepare the consolidated financial statements on the going
concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Group will continue in business, in which case there
should be supporting assumptions or qualifications as
necessary. 
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements. In addition,
as far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the auditors are unaware and each of the
directors have taken all the steps that he ought to have taken 
in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditors were aware 
of such information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration
Report comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards
the Group financial statements, article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the
Group hence for taking responsible steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the website. Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

2 April 2008 Auditors’ report
Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 53
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report
and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group
financial statements. The other information comprises only 
the Directors’ Report, the unaudited parts of the Directors’
Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Statement, the Operations and Financial Review,

material inconsistencies with the Group financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis,
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of
the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors
in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the Group financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error . In forming our opinion we also evaluated
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December
2007 and of its profit and cash flows for the year then
ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the Group financial statements.

1. Authorisation of financial statements and statement of
compliance with IFRS
JKX Oil & Gas plc (the ultimate parent of the Group) is a public
limited company listed on the London Stock Exchange and
incorporated in England. The registered office is 6 Cavendish
Square, London W1G 0PD and the principal place of business is
disclosed in the introduction to the annual report. The principal
activities of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) are
the exploration for, appraisal and development of oil and gas
reserves. The registered number of the Company is 03050645.
The Group’s financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2007 were authorised for issue by the Board 
of Directors on 2 April 2007 and the balance sheets 
were signed on the Board’s behalf by Lord Fraser and 
Mr Bruce Burrows.
The Group’s financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Company’s
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
UK GAAP . The principal accounting policies adopted by the
Group are set out below.
2. Adoption of new and revised International Financial
Reporting Standards
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with Note 1, on the basis of the structure of the Group at 
31 December 2007.
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations effective 
in 2007.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to
published standards are mandatory for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2007 but have no impact on 
the Group’s financial statements:
IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ and the
complementary amendment to IAS 1, ‘Presentation of
financial statements – Capital disclosures’, introduces new
disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not
have any impact on the classification and valuation of the
Group’s financial instruments;
IFRIC 8, ‘Scope of IFRS 2’, requires consideration of
transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments,
where the identifiable consideration received is less than
the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to
establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
This standard does not have any impact on the Group’s
financial statements; and
IFRIC 10, ‘Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment’,
prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim
period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments
and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a
subsequent balance sheet date. The standard does not
have any impact on the Group’s financial statements.
(b) Standards, and Interpretations to existing standards that
are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the
Group.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to
existing standards have been published and are mandatory for
the Group’s financial statements from 2008 or later periods, 
but the Group has not early adopted them, those which are
expected to be most relevant to the Group are IFRS 8 and IAS 23
(revised).
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ – mandatory for 2009. The
segmental information reported under the standard is that
which the chief operating decision-maker uses internally
for evaluating the performance of operating segments and
allocating resources to those segments.
IAS 23 ‘(Amendment), ‘Borrowing Costs’ (effective from 
1 January 2009). The amendment to the standard is still
subject to endorsement by the European Union. It requires
an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable
to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying
asset (one that takes a substantial period of time to get
ready for use or sale) as part of the cost of the asset. The
option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will
be removed. The Group will apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 
1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is
currently not applicable to the Group or Company as there
are no qualifying assets. IAS 27 (Revised) ‘Consolidation 
and separate financial statements’ – mandatory for 2009.
IAS 1 (Amendment), ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’
– mandatory for 2009. 
IFRS 3 (Amendment) ‘Business Combinations’ – mandatory
for 2009. 
IFRS 2 (Amendment) ‘Share based payment – Vesting
conditions and cancellations’ – mandatory for 2009. 
(c) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing
standards effective in 2007 but not relevant.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to
published standards are mandatory for the Group’s financial
statements from 2007 but they are not relevant to the Group:
IFRIC 7, ‘Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29,
‘Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies’; and
IFRIC 9, ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’.
3. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year .
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition,
being the date on which the Group obtains control. Notes to the accounts continued
58 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Revenue recognition
Sales of oil and gas products are recognised when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to 
the buyer and it can be reliably measured. Other services are
recognised when the services have been performed. Revenue 
is measured at the fair value of the consideration received,
excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty. 
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues, by
reference to the net carrying amount at the effective interest
rate applicable.
Interests in joint venture agreements
The Group is party to a number of joint venture contractual
arrangements with other parties (venturers) which govern the
operation of associated jointly controlled assets.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group
and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject
to joint control. Joint control exists only when the strategic
financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require
the unanimous consent of the venturers.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint
venture arrangements, the Group’s share of jointly and directly
controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other
ventures are recognised and classified according to their
nature. Income from the sale or use of the Group’s share of the
output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture
expenses, are included in the consolidated financial statements
in proportion to the Group’s interest.
Foreign currencies
The presentation currency of the Group is the US Dollar based
on the fact that the Group’s primary transactions originate in
the US Dollar, these being amongst others oil sales and
procurement of rigs and drilling services. Financial statements
of foreign currency denominated companies are translated into
US Dollars using the monthly average exchange rates. On
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s non-US
Dollar functional currency companies are retranslated into US
Dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet
date. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and
transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation
differences are only recognised as income or as expenses in 
the period in which any such operation is disposed of.
The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries
which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the
foreseeable future and thus this is considered to be part of 
the Company’s net investment in the relevant subsidiary. 
An exchange difference arises on translation in the Company
income statement which on consolidation is recognised in
equity, only being recognised in the income statement on the
disposal of the net investment.
With effect from 1 January 2007 the parent changed its
functional currency from Sterling to US Dollars. The change
reflects the increasing influence of the US Dollar on the
Company’s operations.
The exchange rate used for the revaluation of the closing
balance sheet at 31 December 2007 was £1/$1.9908 
(2006: £1/$1.957).
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
purchase method.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the
cost of the business combination over the Group’s share in the
net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any
accumulated impairment losses. For the purposes of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business
combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of
the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit
from the synergies of combination.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment comprises the Group’s tangible
oil and gas assets together with computer equipment, motor
vehicles and fixtures and fittings and are carried at cost, less
any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
losses. Cost includes purchase price and construction costs for
qualifying assets and borrowing costs capitalised in accordance
with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Oil and gas assets
Exploration and development expenditure is accounted for
under the ‘successful efforts’ method. The successful efforts
method means that only costs which relate directly to the
discovery and development of specific oil and gas reserves 
are capitalised.
Exploration and evaluation costs are capitalised within
intangible assets. Capital expenditure on producing assets is
accounted for in accordance with IAS 16, ‘Property, plant and
equipment’. Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to
explore are expensed immediately to the income statement.
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and
geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration,
evaluation and development are capitalised as intangible 
or property, plant and equipment according to their nature.
Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the exploration 
and evaluation of properties which the Directors consider to be
unevaluated until reserves are appraised as commercial, at
which time they are transferred to property, plant and equipment
following an impairment review and depreciated accordingly.
Where properties are appraised to have no commercial value,
the associated costs are treated as an impairment loss in the
period in which the determination is made.
Costs are amortised on a field-by-field unit of production
method, based on commercial proven and probable reserves,
with the exception of compressors, which are depreciated on a
straight-line basis (10 years) over their anticipated useful life. Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 59
3. Significant accounting policies continued
The calculation of the ‘unit of production’ amortisation takes
account of estimated future development costs and is based 
on current period-end unescalated price levels. Changes in
reserves and cost estimates are recognised prospectively.
Other assets
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated
residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the
straight-line method, for the following classes of assets;
Motor vehicles – four years
Computer equipment – three years
Other equipment – five to 10 years
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis and,
if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted for
prospectively.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an
asset is determined as the difference between the sales
proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is
recognised in the income statement for the relevant period.
Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant 
and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying
amounts of its property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those
assets have suffered an impairment loss. Individual assets are
grouped together as a cash-generating unit for impairment
assessment purposes at the lowest level at which their
identifiable cash flows, that are largely independent of the cash
flows of the other Group’s assets, can be determined. In the
case of exploration and evaluation assets this will normally 
be at a field level.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Group makes 
an estimate of its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount
is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Where the carrying amount of an individual asset or a cash-
generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the
asset/cash-generating unit is considered impaired and is
written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing the value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the
risks specific to the asset/cash-generating unit and are
discounted to their present value that reflects the current
market indicators.
Excluding goodwill, where an impairment loss subsequently
reverses, the carrying amount of the asset/cash-generating
unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-
generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss
is recognised as income immediately.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets at 
the time when the obligation to decommission arises. Such
provision represents the estimated discounted liability (the
discount rate used currently being at 10%) for costs which are
expected to be incurred in removing production facilities and
site restoration at the end of the producing life of each field. 
A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment is 
also created at an amount equal to the provision. This is
subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the
production facilities. Any change in the present value of the
estimated expenditure attributable to changes in the estimates
of the cash flow or the current estimate of the discount rate
used are reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the
property, plant and equipment. The unwinding of the discount 
is recognised as a finance cost.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the
Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are
measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure
required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and
are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable,
direct labour costs plus attributable overheads based on a
normal level of activity and other costs associated in bringing
the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is
calculated using the weighted average method. Net realisable
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated
costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing,
selling and distribution.
Leasing
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income
on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Notes to the accounts continued
60 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash. Cash equivalents are
short term with an original maturity of less than three months,
highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known
amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk
of changes in value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 day terms, are
recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced
value and recoverable amount. 
Loans are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market,
do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated
as either fair value through profit and loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective
interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains
and losses are recognised in income when the loans are
derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Financial instruments
The Group may use derivative financial instruments (primarily
foreign currency forward contracts) to hedge its risks
associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain
firm commitments and forecasted transactions. Any such
derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date on
which the contract is entered into and subsequently
remeasured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
No financial instruments were designated as hedges during the
period (2006: $nil) and no other hedging activity took place
during the period (2006: $nil).
Share-based payment
Share options
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to the
Directors and senior management. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The 
fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the
grant of options is expensed on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that
will eventually vest. At each subsequent balance sheet date, 
the Group calculates the estimated cumulative charge for each
award having regard to any change in the number of options that
are expected to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. 
The change in this cumulative charge since the last balance
sheet is expensed. Once an option vests, no further adjustment
is made to the aggregate amount expensed. The fair value
which is calculated using the binomial model takes into account
two performance criteria, being the actual increase in the
Company’s share price and a comparison of the actual increase
in the share price to the change in FTSE FI until end of June
2004, the FTSE SI until end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil 
& Gas Producers Index subsequent to that. The expected life of
the options depends on the behaviour of the option holders,
which is incorporated into the option model consistent with
historic data. The fair values calculated are inherently subjective
and uncertain due to the assumptions made and the limitations
of the model used.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value 
of 10 pence per share) and share premium when the options
are exercised.
The rules regarding the scheme are described in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 45 and 46 and in note 26 on
share-based payments.
Bonus Scheme
The Group operates a bonus scheme for its Directors and
employees. The scheme has three performance conditions: 
1. financial objectives; 2. increase in share price; and 3. key
strategic objectives. The bonus payments are made annually,
normally in January of each year and the costs are accrued in
the period to which they relate.
Pension costs
The Group contributes to the individual pension scheme of 
the qualifying employees’ choice. Contributions are charged to
the income statement as they become payable. The Group has
no further payment obligations once the contributions have
been paid.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax
payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year .
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that
are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes
items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability
for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 61
3. Significant accounting policies continued
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable 
on differences between the carrying amount of assets and
liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax
base used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary
differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such
assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary
difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition
(other than in a business combination) of other assets and
liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit 
nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, and interests
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow
all or part of the asset to be recovered. Any such reduction shall
be reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that
sufficient taxable profit will be available.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
realised based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted by
the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in
the income statement, except when it relates to items charged
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is
also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there exists 
a legal and enforceable right to offset and they relate to income
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method.
Treasury shares
JKX Oil & Gas plc treasury shares held by the Company are
classified in shareholders’ equity. The consideration paid,
including any directly attributable incremental costs is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until
the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net
of transaction costs, is included in equity attributable to the
Company’s equity holders. No gain or loss is recognised in 
the financial statements on the purchase, sale, issue or
cancellation of treasury shares.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the
future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition,
seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and
assumptions that have a risk of causing material adjustment to
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
financial year are discussed below.
Recoverability of intangible oil and gas costs
Costs capitalised as intangible assets are assessed for
impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying
value may exceed its recoverable value. This assessment
involves judgement as to (i) the likely commerciality of the
asset, and (ii) future revenues and costs pertaining and the
discount rate to be applied for the purposes of deriving a
recoverable value.
Decommissioning
The Group has decommissioning obligations in respect of its
producing interests. The full extent to which the provision is
required depends on the legal requirements at the time of
decommissioning, the costs and timing of any decommissioning
works and the discount rate applied to such costs.
Depreciation of oil and gas assets
Oil and gas assets held in property, plant and equipment are
mainly depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate
calculated by reference to proven and probable reserves and
incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and
extracting those reserves. Future development costs are
estimated using assumptions as to the numbers of wells
required to produce those reserves, the cost of the wells, 
future production facilities and operating costs; together 
with assumptions on oil and gas realisations. Notes to the accounts continued
62 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
4. Segmental analysis
Segmental information
The primary segmental reporting format is determined to be the geographical segment according to the location of the asset. The
Directors consider the Group to have a single class of business, being the exploration for, development and production of oil and gas
reserves. Accordingly, no secondary segmental information is presented.
There are four geographic reporting segments. The Ukraine and US are involved with production and exploration; the ‘Rest of World’
are involved in exploration and the UK is the home of the head office. The ‘Rest of World’ segment comprises operations in Hungary,
Bulgaria, Georgia and Turkey.
Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. Segment
revenue, segment expense and segment results include transfers between segments. Those transfers are eliminated on
consolidation.

The provision for impairment/write off of exploration costs, includes impairment of the Group’s Italian asset portfolio of $3.3m
(based on the agreed disposal proceeds); West Georgia offshore licence $5.9m (recognising the passage of time that the assets have
been held); Turkish licence Thrace $0.5m; and $0.9m relating to exploration expenditure in Ukraine. Additionally, the Group wrote
off $7.1m relating to the Golitza B1 well in Bulgaria which was dry.
The Group previously recognised an impairment charge in respect of certain producing assets in Ukraine. The impairment 
reflected uncertainty regarding the political and regulatory environment in Ukraine together with the relatively low Ukrainian 
oil and gas prices.
In 2006, following a step change in Ukrainian gas prices and easing of political and regulatory uncertainty, it was determined that
the factors giving rise to the impairment have reversed and the impairment was reversed in 2006. The amount of the reversal was
determined by reference to the recoverable amount of the associated assets. Recoverable amount was calculated based on
expected future cash flows of the cash-generating unit discounted at a rate of 10%. The cash generating unit is the Group’s 
Novo-Nikolaevskoye complex in Ukraine.
Consideration was given to the amount of depreciation that would have been suffered in the period since the impairment charge
was taken. The carrying value was reinstated in 2006 at a value not higher than the carrying value had the impairment not been
made.
The cost of inventories (calculated by reference to production costs) expensed in 2007 was $40.5m (2006: $34.5m). Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 65

Factors that may affect future tax charges
A significant proportion of the Group’s income will be generated overseas. Profits made overseas will not be able to be offset 
by costs elsewhere in the Group. This could lead to a higher than expected tax rate for the Group. Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 67

In respect of the full year 2007, the Directors propose that a final dividend of 2.4 pence per share (2006: 1.2 pence per share) be paid
to shareholders on 30 May 2008. This dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not
been included as a liability in these financial statements. The proposed dividend is payable to all shareholders on the Register of

13. Business combinations – acquisition of Yuzhgazenergie LLC
On 22 November 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Yuzhgazenergie LLC, an oil and gas exploration and
development company based in Russia. Yuzhgazenergie LLC was owned by Mostotal Investments Limited (‘Mostotal’). Mostotal and
Glengary Overseas Limited (‘Glengary’) are controlled by Mr Alexander Zhukov. Glengary, held a 25.15% shareholding in JKX Oil &
Gas plc at the date of acquisition. As a related party transaction, the acquisition was approved by the shareholders of JKX Oil &
Gas plc at an Extraordinary General Meeting.
The acquired business is in development stage and therefore contributed no revenue and a net loss of $0.3m representing
administrative expenses to the Group for the period from 22 November 2007 to 31 December 2007. If the acquisition had occurred
on 1 January 2007, the net loss would have been $2.7m representing administrative expenses. These amounts have been calculated
using the Group’s accounting policies.
Details of net assets acquired and goodwill are as follows:

Cash paid 41,610
Deferred consideration 9,044
Direct costs relating to the acquisition 2,974
Total purchase consideration 53,628

Goodwill 2,716
The goodwill arises after the application of IAS 12, ‘Income taxes’ and is attributable principally to expanded growth opportunities 
in Russia. Notes to the accounts continued

Part of these costs associated with the US have been carried for more than three years. The Company believes it is appropriate to
retain them based on the ongoing ‘test production’ from the Center Deep Unit and the proposed new well to be drilled into a new
structure during 2008 by the new operators.
The write off of unsuccessful exploration costs of $7.1m in 2007 relates to costs associated with the Bulgarian well drilled in the
year and determined to be dry. Provision was also made in the period for $3.3m against the Italian assets, $0.4m against assets
held in the Turkish licence Thrace and $0.7m for exploration in Ukraine.
In Ukraine, $0.3m pipeline costs were moved from intangible to property, plant and equipment during the year . In ‘Rest of World’ an
amount of $2.3m, in respect of the Italian licences, was moved to ‘assets available for sale’. These assets were subsequently sold
on 27 February 2008. Notes to the accounts continued

date on the remaining losses. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
At 31 December 2007, a deferred tax liability of $5.7m (2006: $1.6m) relating to investments in subsidiaries has not been recognised.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of unprovided items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will
be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences.

26. Share-based payments
Share options
Share options are granted to Executive Directors and senior management based on performance criteria. The scheme rules are
described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report and repeated below. All share-based payments are equity settled.
At 31 December 2007, there were outstanding options under various employee share option schemes, exercisable during the 
years 2008 to 2017, to acquire 2,271,500 (2006: 3,629,531) shares of the Company at prices ranging from £0.1675 to £3.83 per share
(2006: £0.1675 to £3.83). The vesting period of the options is three years, with an exercise period of seven years, making a 10-year
maximum term.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average prices (WAEP) of, and movements in, share options during the year .
2007 2006
Number WAEP Number WAEP
Outstanding as at 1 January 3,629,531 89.47p 6,246,531 46.45p
Granted during the year 367,000 298.00p 305,500 330.77p
Exercised during the year (1,725,031) 70.61p (2,922,500) 22.76p
Outstanding at 31 December 2,271,500 151.21p 3,629,531 89.47p
Exercisable at 31 December 692,500 40.94p 479,031 20.80p
Included within this balance are options over 396,531 (2006: 2,471,531) shares for which an income statement expense has not been
recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options were granted on or before 7 November 2002. These options have not been
subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 70.61 pence.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of the options is 22.76 pence.
For the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2007, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 1.45 years 
(2006: 1.71 years).
During the year, share options were granted in accordance with the New Approved Share Option Scheme and the New Unapproved
Share Option Scheme (collectively the ‘New Share Option Schemes’) that were introduced in 2001. They reflect the best practice
aspects recommended by the Association of British Insurers following the publication of their guidelines in March 2001 (the ‘ABI
Guidelines’).
For the options to vest there has to be an increase in share price combined with a comparison to an external benchmark (the
Financial Times Stock Exchange Oil & Gas Producers Index (‘FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index’). As a result of an increase in share
price in the first quarter of 2006, the Company moved up into the FTSE 250 Index (‘FTSE 250’) and the benchmark was therefore
reviewed and the Remuneration Committee decided that the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index was the most appropriate. The Rules
of the New Share Option Schemes address eligibility, timing of grants and exercise of options etc, and require that the shareholders
are to be consulted if any substantive amendments to the Rules are required.
The Remuneration Committee (Committee) has discretion as to the application of the Rules of the New Share Option Schemes,
particularly in the level of awards and the setting of the level of performance conditions. Notes to the accounts continued
78 JKX Oil & Gas plc Annual report and accounts 2007
26. Share-based payments continued
The Committee has prepared internal guidelines to enable it to administer the New Share Option Schemes. In awarding share
options the Committee takes into account the ABI Guidelines in terms of individual and collective limits, the need for demanding
Performance Conditions etc, and other factors such as the performance of the Company and the individual in the previous 
12 months, the effect of the vesting of grants awarded in previous years e.g. dilution, cost to the Company and the overall
remuneration level (annual salary, bonus award and benefits) of the individual relative to the market. Grants are made by reference
to the market value (mid-Market price) of the Company’s shares under option at the time of grant. Executive Directors and
employees are not required to pay for the grant of share options.
After three years the number of options that can be exercised is determined by two factors: (1) the actual increase in the Company’s
Share Price; and (2) a comparison of the actual increase in the share price to the change in the FTSE FI until the end of June 2004,
FTSE SI until the end of February 2006 and the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index after that date.
The share price and FTSE factors will be multiplied together and the resultant figure will be applied to the number of options
granted to an individual to determine the number of options to be vested.
The structure has been designed to introduce a sliding scale as distinct from a specific individual benchmark. It will require the
share price to double and this increase to be in the top quartile of the growth in the FTSE FI/SI/Oil & Gas Producers Index for all 
of the awards granted to an individual to determine the number of options that vest.
To encourage the retention of key staff, the Committee has determined that an option holder will only be able to exercise up to 50%
of vested options at any one time and up to 50% after a period of 12 months, unless determined otherwise by the Committee.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 58.8 pence (2006: 21.771 pence).
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a variant of the standard binomial
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted, which includes the performance condition
related to the Company’s share price directly. The performance condition based on performance relative to other companies is
modelled with a Monte Carlo model. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 31 December 2007
and 31 December 2006. The expected future volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility.
2007 2006
Dividend yield (%) 0.60 0.30
Historical volatility (%) 45.50 49.40
Expected share price volatility (%) 45.50 49.40
Risk-free interest rate (%) 5.10 4.73
Expected life of option (years) 4.75 3.50
Weighted average share price (pence) 151.21p 89.47p
Bonus scheme
The performance criteria of the Directors and senior employees bonus payments includes a component that relates directly to JKX’s
share performance over the vesting period and a component which relates to the performance of JKX share price in relation to the
FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index. The full details of the bonus performance criteria are explained in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on pages 45 and 46.
The bonus accrued for 2007 was $1.4m (2006: $1.4m) and was paid in January 2008.
27. Capital commitments
Under the programmes for the development and production of oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and Russia, the Group had
committed $4.5m to future capital expenditure on drilling rigs and facilities at 31 December 2007 (2006: $3.5m). Annual report and accounts 2007 JKX Oil & Gas plc 79

Business combination
On 22 November 2007, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Yuzhgazenergie LLC, an oil and gas exploration and
development company basin in Russia. Yuzhgazenergie LLC was owned by Mostotal Investments Limited (‘Mostotal’). Mostotal and
Glengary Overseas Limited (‘Glengary’) are controlled by Mr Alexander Zhukov. Glengary, held 25.15 per cent shareholding in 
JKX Oil & Gas plc at the date of acquisition. As a related party transaction the acquisition was approved by the shareholders of JKX

In December 2003, JKX disposed of its Oklahoma assets for $8.8m. The consideration was to be paid in two equal tranches of which
$4.4m was paid in December 2003 and the balance was due December 2004. In December 2004, JKX entered into a US Dollar loan
agreement with Avalon Exploration Inc. which bore interest at 10% and was to recover principal and interest over a three-year
period. In February 2006, Avalon Exploration Inc. paid down the loan, including principal and interest.
30. Ukrainian and Russian business environment
Ukraine and Russia display emerging market characteristics, and the legislation and business practices regarding banking
operations, foreign currency transactions and taxation are constantly evolving as the governments attempt to manage the
economies. Risks inherent in conducting business in an emerging market economy include, but are not limited to, volatility in 
the financial markets and the general economy. Uncertainties over the development of the tax and legal environment, as well as
difficulties associated with the consistent interpretation and application of current laws and regulations, have continued. As at 
31 December 2007, oil and gas assets based in Ukraine and Russia represent approximately 66% and 28% respectively of the
Group’s oil and gas assets.
The Group’s operations and financial position may be affected by these uncertainties. The Group’s financial statements do not
include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability, and classification of assets or the amounts 
or classifications of liabilities that may result from these uncertainties. Company accounts

Company law requires the directors to prepare the financial
statements of the Company for each financial year . Under that
law the directors have prepared Company financial statements
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice. The financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that
period.
In preparing these financial statements the directors are
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
• make judgments and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
Company will continue in business, in which case there
should be supporting assumptions or qualifications 
as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements. In addition,
as far as each director is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the auditors are unaware and each of the
directors have taken all the steps that he ought to have taken in
order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information
and to establish that the auditor was aware of such information.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act
1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of
the Company hence for taking responsible steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity
of the website. Legislation in the UK concerning the preparation
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.

A. Presentation of the financial statements
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable 
UK accounting standards. The Directors have reviewed the
Company’s existing accounting policies and consider that they
are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting
Standard (‘FRS’) 18 ‘Accounting Policies’.
The Company has not adopted the provisions of FRS 29
‘Financial Instrument Disclosures’, as it has applied the
exemption provided in paragraph 2D of the standard.
The Company’s accounting policies are otherwise consistent
with last year . The financial statements have been prepared on
a going concern basis.
Foreign currencies
Effective 1 January 2007 the Company changed its functional
currency from Sterling to US Dollars. The change reflects the
increasing influence of the US Dollar on the Company’s
operations.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the
exchange rate ruling at the time of the transaction. Exchange
differences arising on the translation of monetary items are
taken to the profit and loss account. Non-monetary items are
measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency and are
translated using the exchange rates of the original statement.
The presentation currency of the Company is the US Dollar .
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments are initially measured at cost, including
transaction costs and stated at cost less impairment losses.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
value of an investment may not be recoverable. If any such
indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an
estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying 
amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, 
the investment is considered impaired and is written down 
to its recoverable amount.
Impairment reversal
Where impairments have been recognised in previous periods
and the condition giving rise to the impairment is determined to 
have reversed, the carrying value of the assets is assessed by
reference to recoverable amount where the recoverable amount
is calculated as the lower of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. On reversal of an impairment, carrying value is
reinstated at a value not higher than the carrying value had the
impairment not been made.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to the
Directors and senior management. Equity-settled share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The
fair value in the Group is determined at the grant date of the
equity-settled share-based payments and is expensed on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. At each subsequent
balance sheet date the Company calculates the estimated
cumulative charge for each award having regard to any change
in the number of options that are expected to vest and the
expired portion of the vesting period. The movement in
cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet relating 
to awards for services to subsidiaries is expensed in the income
statement of those subsidiaries. Once an option vests, no
further adjustment is made to the aggregate amount expensed.
The corresponding entry is shown in equity in the Company. 
The fair value which is calculated using the binomial model
takes into account two performance criteria, being the actual
increase in the Company’s share price and a comparison of the
actual increase in the share price to the change in FTSE FI until
end of June 2004, the FTSE SI until end of February 2006 and
the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers Index subsequent to that. The
expected life of the options depends on the behaviour of the
option holders, which is incorporated into the option model
consistent with historic data.
Dividends
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the
Company’s shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when
they are approved by shareholders. 
Treasury shares
The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company
and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in
shareholders’ funds through the profit and loss account reserve.
No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Related parties
The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8, ‘Related
Party Transactions’, from disclosing related party transactions
with entities that are part of the JKX Group.
Cash flow statement
The Company accounts are included within the publicly
available consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Consequently, the Company has taken advantage of the
exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under 
the terms of the FRS 1 (revised 1996). Notes to the Company accounts continued

This is an important
document, if you are in any
doubt as to what action to
take you should consult an
appropriate independent
advisor such as an accountant
or a lawyer . The Poltava Petroleum Company (PPC) is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of JKX and is the largest non-state
producer of oil and gas in Ukraine. Established in
1994, PPC initially focused its efforts on four fields
located within the Novo-Nikolaevskoye complex
located in the Poltava region of Ukraine. Production of
commercial quantities of oil and gas began in 1995. 
Since that time JKX has added two additional 
exploration licences to the portfolio, Elizavetovskoye
and Chevonoyarske East.

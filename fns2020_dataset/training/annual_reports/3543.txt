 have considered the adequacy of the 
disclosure made in note 2 to the ﬁnancial 
statements concerning the Group’s ability 
to continue as a going concern. While the 
directors are conﬁdent that the Group

to 18 months, any signiﬁcant deviations 
from their forecasts could impact on its 
ability to do so, and these conditions

New standards, amendments  
and interpretations 
These consolidated ﬁnancial statements are 
 for accounting periods beginning 1 January 
2012, but have not had a material impact on 
the results or ﬁnancial position of the Group:

Going concern 
The directors consider it to be appropriate 
for the accounts to be prepared on a going 
concern basis, based on the assumptions 
considered in the Directors’ report on  
page 19.
Basis of consolidation 
i Subsidiaries
 The results of subsidiaries (deﬁned 
 operating policies of the subsidiary) are 
 control of the net assets and operations 
of the acquired company are effectively 
transferred to the Group. Similarly, the 
results of subsidiaries disposed of cease to 
 control of the net assets and operations 
are transferred out of the Group.
 The Group applies the acquisition method 
to account for business combinations. 
The consideration transferred for the 
acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value 
of the assets transferred, the liabilities 
 business and the equity interests issued 

liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination 
are measured at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. Acquisition related  
costs are expensed as incurred.

such magnitude that the directors believe 
 readers to gain an understanding of the 
underlying results of the business. 
Exceptional items in the year ended

provisions, and restructuring costs incurred 
during the year.

 Finance costs 
Finance costs are recognised on an effective

Finance income 
Finance income is accrued by reference to 
the principal outstanding and the effective 
interest rate applicable. Finance income

 Commissioning costs comprise 
staff, property, consultancy and

 Such costs are capitalised up to the point 
that the commissioning is complete and

to contractual arrangements.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for 
goods or services that have been acquired 
in the ordinary course of business from 
suppliers. Trade payables are initially 
recognised at fair value and subsequently 

 classiﬁed as current liabilities.
Pension costs
The Group operates personal deﬁned 
contribution pension schemes. Contributions 
are charged to the income statement as 
 the rules of the scheme. The Group has 
no further payment obligation once the 
contributions have been paid.
Current and deferred income taxation
Tax expense comprises current and deferred 
tax. The charge for current income tax 
is based on the results for the period, as 
 deductible in other accounting periods and 
 is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period.

Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group has entered into derivative 
ﬁnancial instrument arrangements to 
manage its exposure to interest rate risk. 
The Group’s criteria for entering into such

an asset or a liability and it must change the 
character of the interest rate by converting 
a variable rate to a ﬁxed rate or vice versa.

Compound ﬁnancial instruments
Compound ﬁnancial instruments issued  
by the Group comprise convertible loans 
that can be converted to share capital at  
the option of the holder. The number of 
shares to be issued is calculated based on 
the outstanding loan commitment at the 
date of conversion.
The liability component of a compound 
instrument is recognised initially at the 
fair value of a similar liability that does 
not have an equity conversion option. The 
equity component is recognised initially as 
 and the fair value of the liability component. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, the 
liability component of a compound ﬁnancial 
instrument is measured at amortised cost,

instrument is not remeasured subsequent 
to initial recognition, except on conversion

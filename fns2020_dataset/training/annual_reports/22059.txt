Chairman’s statement
Peter Buckley
Chairman
Caledonia’s second year
as an investment trust
has been successful, 
with significant
outperformance again
recorded against our
benchmark.
Results
I am delighted to report that our second year as an investment
trust has been another successful one. We are pleased once
again to have delivered excellent results for shareholders with
total shareholder return over ﬁve and ten years outperforming 
our benchmark of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index by 
133% and 111% respectively, which is considerably ahead of the
outperformance recorded a year ago. It has also been an eventful
year in that we found a satisfactory solution to the ill-considered
attempts to liquidate Caledonia and destroy a company with a
proud record of delivering good value for its shareholders over 
a long time frame. This is fully explained under ‘Elective special
dividend’ below.
Share price
We are pleased that our continued growth in net assets per share
amounting to some 21% over the year has been complemented
by a further reduction in the discount of our share price to our
underlying assets. This discount has narrowed from 30% two
years ago to 21% a year ago and now to 12% at the close of the
year under review. The discount is slightly above the average of
our Global Growth sector peer group, and still well above some 
of the other top performers in this sector with whom we can
justiﬁably compare ourselves. We do well to remember however
that we do not control our share price, though we have worked
diligently to create greater awareness of our good long term
performance and particularly with retail investors whom we
believe to be natural owners of our shares. We shall continue 
with this effort as Tim Ingram explains in his chief executive’s
report, but the restoration of stability within our shareholder base
is likely also to have contributed to this lower discount so that it
will prove much more challenging to continue this trend from now
onwards, which may in turn affect our total return performance.
Nonetheless, we believe that our long established strategy of
taking signiﬁcant stakes in businesses of which we have a good
understanding, with particular emphasis on identifying sound
managements, should continue to deliver good long term net
asset value performance.
Dividend
We are pleased to recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 19.5 pence per
share bringing the total for the year to 28.2 pence. This amounts
to an increase of 4.4% and maintains our policy of seeking to
achieve progressive annual dividend payments, which we have
now delivered for 38 successive years.
Elective special dividend
In July 2004, the elective special dividend and reduction of
capital that had been proposed to resolve the long running
dispute amongst the shareholders of Caledonia’s largest
shareholder, The Cayzer Trust Company, in which two
institutional shareholders had also become involved, became
effective. This dispute had been damaging to Caledonia’s
business model, which is founded on being a stable investor,
willing and able to take the longer term view. Under these
proposals, all shareholders were offered the opportunity to
receive an elective special dividend, on up to two-ninths of 
their shareholdings, of an amount based on an 18% discount 
to the company’s net asset value per share, with subsequent
cancellation of those shares on which the dividend was paid
through a Court approved reduction of capital. I am pleased  03
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
to report that, aside from The Cayzer Trust Company, which had
undertaken in advance to take up its full entitlement in order to
facilitate the buy-out of its dissident shareholders, and Hermes,
which we expected to participate given its previous publicly
expressed views in support of the liquidation of Caledonia, 
the shares cancelled in respect of our other shareholders only
amounted to some 1% of our overall share capital. This outcome
enabled us to put an end to the misplaced and potentially
destabilising attempts by a small handful of shareholders to
liquidate Caledonia by paying out £88m, or less than 10% of our
shareholders’ funds. We were most encouraged by this support
and I would like to thank our many shareholders who believe in
our long term approach and who chose to remain with us. It is
good to know that the £88m outﬂow of funds has been more than
made up by the subsequent increase in the value of our assets 
by the year end.
Portfolio
In my interim statement, I reported on the reduced weighting 
in our portfolio of our two largest holdings, Close Brothers and
Kerzner International (‘KI’), where disposals had netted proceeds
of some £91m. These rebalancing issues are ones of success
given the strong share price performance of these companies
over time and we took advantage of an even higher price for 
KI shares in February of this year and realised a further £28m.
These investments still remain our two largest holdings, at 
14% and 12% of our portfolio respectively at the year end. 
The chief executive’s report gives a more detailed commentary
on our portfolio.
Economic and political background
Over the years, I have made brief reference to the economic
background against which we operate with the inevitable bias
which is imposed by the incumbent political faction. I have also
consistently highlighted the damage imposed on our economy 
by our failure to reject the political and federalist agenda emanating
from Brussels, as against one seeking to build a more open – 
or common – marketplace. However, we have rather missed the
bus on the latter , for the world is now our marketplace – not the
historic boundaries of Europe as recently expanded. It is therefore
encouraging to see the groundswell of opinion recognising the
shortcomings of an unelected and unaccountable body in Brussels
which seeks extravagantly to build an ivory tower . The forthcoming
referenda are pivotal to this issue but, even if the proposals for the
new European Constitution are rejected, the challenge will still
remain to undo much of the stultifying legislation which has been
imposed unilaterally on the business community .
The recent election has sadly perpetuated a regime whose
economic doctrines are gradually worsening the outlook for
business in this country. Most leading economic bodies have
recently warned of the growing public sector deﬁcit with its
inbuilt inefﬁciencies and of the likelihood of yet higher taxation.
The ﬂawed idealism attaching to this burgeoning Government
expenditure has not yet fully dawned but it inevitably will and this
causes us to be cautious on the investment front until the storm
develops more fully and realism looks like prevailing.
Board
We have taken the opportunity to strengthen our board over 
the past six months. I was pleased to welcome Richard Goblet
d’Alviella, chief executive of Sofina, the Belgium-based
investment company, to our board as a non-executive director 
in January and more recently, in April, Jamie Cayzer-Colvin and
Will Wyatt as executive directors. Given our interest in ﬁnding
suitable investment opportunities on the Continent, exempliﬁed
by our recent investment in Cobepa, and Soﬁna’s not dissimilar
investment philosophy to our own, Richard Goblet’s wide
investment experience of the continent of Europe is a valuable
added resource. Jamie Cayzer-Colvin and Will Wyatt, who have
worked for Caledonia since 1995 and 1997 respectively and who
both became associate directors three years ago, are responsible
for a growing number of recent investment initiatives. We now
have a younger board which is positive, whilst maintaining the
experience which is crucial to our long term approach.
Sir David Kinloch retired as an executive director in January 2004
on reaching the normal retirement age, but remained as a 
non-executive director until the conclusion of last year’s annual
general meeting. Accordingly, he left the board during the year
under review and I would wish to repeat my thanks to him for 
his valuable service to Caledonia since the company took to its
new life in 1988. Sadly, Michael Wyatt also decided to retire from
the board at the close of the ﬁnancial year. His contribution over
30 years as a director has been huge and his steady counsel
through the enormous changes which have taken place with the
business over that period has stood the company in great stead.
He was deputy chairman from 1994 until 2001 and became a
non-executive director in 2002. I would wish to thank him most
wholeheartedly on behalf of all our shareholders.
Staff
Once again I would like to pay tribute to the unstinting efforts 
of our focused management team in Cayzer House and for its
commitment to continuing to build Caledonia for the beneﬁt 
of all our shareholders. The consistency of good culture in any
business is a key ingredient for success and I believe we score
well on this count, with a strong will to preserve this special
feature. In addition to thanking the home team, I would also 
like to extend these thanks to all those who have done well for 
us in our investee companies.
Outlook
It is normally difﬁcult to interpret the crystal ball, but our view
tends on the cautious side. Deﬁcits and consumer debt in the
USA are high and the latter is repeated in the UK with the added
issue of rising Government spending. However, growth over 
the medium to longer term in Asia and the Far East, where we 
are inclined to seek some investment opportunities, looks
interesting. We shall bear these factors in mind as we move
forward in the belief that our philosophy should continue to
deliver good value for shareholders.

Annual report 2005
Chief executive’s report
Tim Ingram
Chief executive
We have continued to
make new investments
and to disinvest where
appropriate in an
environment in which
attractive opportunities
remain available to the
longer term investor.
This is the second year that we are reporting our results as an
investment trust. Last year we reported that for 2003 we had
been named the ‘Brightest Newcomer’ by the Investment Trusts
magazine and, this time, we can report that for 2004 your company
won an award as ‘Best Global Growth Trust’.
Performance
The year ended 31 March 2005 has again seen strong growth in
the value of our investment portfolio. Net asset value (‘NAV’) per
share, before accrued ﬁnal dividends, has grown from 1282p at
the beginning of the year to 1554p at 31 March 2005 – a growth 
of 21%. As the FTSE All-Share index has grown by nearly 12%
during this period, this represents a 9% outperformance. The table
below analyses this outperformance into its component parts.

Stock selection 7.6
Sector allocation 0.5
NAV per share enhancement (elective special dividend) 2.3
Management and other expenses (1.1)
Caledonia’s NAV per share 21.2
Of particular note, given our style to back strong management
teams, is that over 7% of the outperformance can be attributed
to our having, in aggregate, invested in companies which have
themselves outperformed within their sectors. Also of note is 
the NAV per share enhancement of 2.3%, which resulted from 
the elective special dividend and reduction of capital that was
completed last July. This exercise, which is mentioned more fully
in the chairman’s statement, both resolved in full a potentially
unstable situation within our largest shareholder , The Cayzer T rust
Company , and directly created additional value for our remaining
shareholders through the NAV per share enhancement.
Notwithstanding our good shorter term performance, our
approach continues to be long term and we believe that a more
pertinent measure for our shareholders is our total shareholder
return (‘TSR’), measured over ﬁve and ten year periods. The table
below shows this performance.

Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
We have signiﬁcantly outperformed our benchmark and this
performance again puts us in the top quartile when measured
against the Global Growth sector for all investment trusts over
these periods. The above table also shows that, as for last year,
we have been producing positive returns over the last ﬁve and
ten year periods, the former when our benchmark has been in
negative territory. This we will continue to strive to do. In order
to enhance our ability to produce positive returns in times when
equity markets are ﬂat or falling, as well as being prepared to
hold cash, we also invest in other classes of assets such as
unquoted investments (22% of the portfolio at 31 March 2005),
property (13%) and hedge funds (3%). In all these cases, our
business policy is the same: to back, with long term capital,
carefully selected management teams.
Investment activity
Our investment style remains consistent. We only invest when
we are conﬁdent that we are backing management teams that
should be able to create good medium and long term value for
their shareholders. We look to take signiﬁcant shareholdings in
such situations, usually with a Caledonia executive taking a
position on the board of the investee company, and where we
are aiming to be a long term supportive and involved investor.
This is a distinctive but unusual style, particularly in relation to
quoted companies, and one that brings us a strong ﬂow of
investment opportunities. Considerable time is spent analysing
these opportunities and we are very discerning in our ﬁnal
selection, especially in relation to the quality of the management.
The entry price is obviously a further major consideration, as we
need to be conﬁdent that there is room for good value creation
over the medium term.
During the course of our ﬁnancial year, our investment committee
evaluated around 150 potential new investment opportunities.
These were short-listed down to a more manageable number,
which were then intensely evaluated and from which we made
seven new investments for a total amount of £60m. In addition,
we invested a further £64m as follow-on funding in existing
investments. This is a similar level to the previous year when a
total of £108m was invested in new and follow-on investments.
Both new and follow-on investments for the year ended 
31 March 2005 are shown in the table below.
A second distinctive characteristic of our investment style is our
hands-on approach after we have made the investment. As stated
above, it is our normal policy for a Caledonia investment executive
to join the board of the investee company as a non-executive
director, and considerable time is spent in working supportively
with management to achieve long term shareholder value
creation. A large portion of the investment executive’s time is
spent in this way, and we believe that such an approach is a
signiﬁcant contributor to our performance. During the year, we
have had a Caledonia executive as a director on the boards of 
24 of our top 30 investments. Whether we have representation 
on the board or not, efforts are made to inﬂuence constructively
the operations and strategies of each investee company.

Chief executive’s report
continued
Although we are a long term investor, we believe that there comes
a time when it is appropriate for us to disinvest, or partially sell
down, from an investment. In addition, there may be redemptions
within funds in which we have invested which give rise to capital
ﬂows back to Caledonia. During the year, we realised some £218m
through such events as listed in the table below.

As a general rule, we disinvest when we believe that, going
forward, the funds released can achieve a higher return for our
shareholders through being employed elsewhere, or when
concentration of risk considerations mean it is prudent to reduce
our holding. However, when disinvesting, particular care is taken
to ensure that we do not damage our valuable reputation as a
long term supportive investor.
Treasury
We started the year with net liquid funds of £34m. Although some
borrowings were incurred during the year to ﬁnance the elective
special dividend which was paid in July, by the end of the year, as
a result of our net disinvestment activity, we again had net liquid
funds of around £40m and, thus, no external borrowings, reﬂecting
our conservative approach in the present market conditions.
At our extraordinary general meeting in June last year, we sought
and obtained authority to buy our own shares on the open market,
which we can now hold in treasury, when we believe this is
beneﬁcial to our shareholders. During the year, we bought into
treasury 100,000 of our shares at a price of 1015p per share. 
We will be seeking approval at our forthcoming annual general
meeting to extend this authority for a further year, as we believe
there may be further opportunities for us to enhance shareholder
value in this way.
We have taken a cautious approach to our structural US dollar
currency exposures, which arise because some of our investments
are denominated in US dollars. During the year, we increased the
extent of our dollar hedging so that by the end of the ﬁnancial
year these structural dollar exposures were fully hedged.
Costs
Keeping overhead costs down is an important objective for 
us. Every pound of overhead cost is a pound reduction in our
shareholders’ net assets. We believe that being a self-managed
investment trust with direct control over costs signiﬁcantly helps
this objective. Our overhead costs for the year were about 1% 
of our net assets, which compares favourably against a pre-tax
weighted industry average of 1.5% – particularly in view of the
time-consuming hands-on approach that we take with our
investment portfolio.
Shareholders
We believe that putting our efforts into growing NAV per share 
is the best way to achieve our financial objectives for our
shareholders. However , we are aware of the continuing desire of
shareholders also to see a narrowing in the discount of our share
price when compared with NAV per share. We reported last year
on initiatives we were taking to create an environment which
would encourage a narrowing of this discount. These initiatives
are bearing fruit in that our discount, which was around 21% at
31 March 2004, had narrowed to around 12% at 31 March 2005. 
It is our belief that our shareholder objectives are in line with the
aspirations of many retail investors, and we are continuing to
increase the awareness of Caledonia as an investment trust
amongst potential retail shareholders. As part of this initiative, 
we arranged from 1 November 2004 for our shares to be listed 
on the stock exchange in New Zealand, where UK incorporated
investment trusts currently offer a more tax efﬁcient means of
investment for New Zealand resident individuals when compared
with other collective investment vehicles. As a result of this and
other initiatives, we estimate that, during the course of the year,
the percentage of retail shareholders has increased by around
7% to about 23% at 31 March 2005.
Recent activity
The only signiﬁcant changes to our portfolio in the six weeks
since our year end have been the sale of all of our shares in 
F&C Asset Management for £20m and the purchase for £18m 
of a 22% stake in Satellite Information Services, an unquoted
company specialising in the distribution of betting related media.
The future
Since our ﬁnancial year end, stock markets have experienced
some turbulence, justifying our stance to be cautious and
ungeared. We are confident that the resilience of our long 
term approach should continue to prove to be of value in these
times. We are continuing to see a strong ﬂow of good business
opportunities, and our approach to these remains cautious 
but consistent. Over the last eighteen months, we have spent
signiﬁcant amounts of time looking at the higher growth markets
in Asia and the Far East, and during the last few months have
initiated a small portfolio of quoted Indian shares – these were
valued at £8.4m at 31 March 2005, which represents a 13.5%
gain on cost. We believe that the fast growing Indian economy
offers good opportunities for our long term approach and,
although we would not expect this area to become a particularly
significant part of our portfolio in the short to medium term, 
we are hoping to increase our investment activity in that country.
We are also looking at opportunities in China, but with added
caution in view of the linguistic, legal and cultural challenges 
for a ﬁnancial investor in that area. We are, of course, also
continuing to look at opportunities in our traditional markets. 
By carefully selecting the right opportunities where there are
strong management teams, by continuing our active involvement
in investee companies and through disinvesting when appropriate,
we seek to maintain our distinctive performance.

Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Objectives and strategy
Objectives
Caledonia aims to achieve a long term total shareholder return 
in excess of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index, while
maintaining a progressive annual dividend, through a focused
portfolio of signiﬁcant stakes in companies where it believes
there to be good opportunities for building value.
Caledonia measures its performance over the long term by
comparing its total shareholder return against the FTSE All-Share
T otal Return index over ﬁve and ten year periods.
Strategy
Caledonia’s strategy is to invest in and actively manage
signiﬁcant stakes in 30 to 40 companies and situations where 
it believes there to be good opportunities for building value.
Active management will usually be achieved by working closely
and constructively with the investee management, often through
board representation, as a long term supportive shareholder. 
Risk is managed by holding a diversiﬁed portfolio, with at least
50% of the portfolio in quoted securities or liquid assets.
Caledonia self-manages its portfolio, using in-house expertise, 
as well as using third party managers who specialise in particular
asset classes or geographical areas.
Caledonia seeks new investments with a typical size of £10m 
to £25m. Although Caledonia usually aims to have an inﬂuential
minority stake it will, on occasion, be prepared to take a controlling
interest where it believes that this will maximise shareholder
value. When considering an investment opportunity, particular
care is taken in appraising the capabilities and commitment of
the management team of the prospective investee company. 
The anticipated total return from the investment, the strategy in
relation to it, and the overall risks, are carefully analysed as part
of the investment process.
Caledonia will invest part of its portfolio in third party managed
funds. Again, a core skill is its ability to assess the capabilities
and commitment of the fund management team and Caledonia
will often seek to obtain a signiﬁcant stake in the management
company, thereby potentially enhancing returns to shareholders.
Caledonia seeks to work closely and constructively with the
management of companies that it has backed and to make
available the considerable experience of its own team to help 
the investee company’s management to address the business
issues. The strategy for each investment, including the returns
and the timing of eventual disposal, is reviewed regularly.
Investments are realised when it is believed that the funds
released can provide better long term returns, but in a manner
consistent with Caledonia’s reputation as a supportive long 
term investor.
Whilst the source of funding for new investments generally
comes from its own resources, Caledonia may at times seek 
to enhance returns by taking on moderate levels of gearing.
Tight control is exercised over costs, notwithstanding Caledonia’s
active and participative management style. Cost containment is
signiﬁcantly aided by managing the large majority of investments
through the in-house management team.
Competitive advantages
Caledonia believes that its history and strategy deliver the following
key competitive advantages:
■ Favoured access – Caledonia’s long established and valuable
reputation as a supportive long term investor attracts a strong
deal ﬂow of opportunities not always available to others, which
enables it to be highly selective in its investments.
■ Long experience – Caledonia’s management team has long
experience of proactively working with the management teams 
of investee companies to identify and promote business 
growth opportunities.
■ Self-management – Caledonia’s portfolio is largely self-managed,
thereby reducing third party fees and ensuring that performance
gains accrue to Caledonia’s shareholders. Where investments
are made in managed funds, Caledonia seeks to secure a
stake in the asset management business, to enhance further
potential returns.
■ Progressive dividends – Caledonia has a substantial level 
of distributable reserves to support its progressive dividend
policy for the foreseeable future. 08

Investment review
Financial
Caledonia has a history of
investing in financial services
companies and we have 
been actively involved in the
development of many such
businesses. Although we sold
part of our Close Brothers stake
during the year, our weighting 
in this sector of 27% is still 
greater than the FTSE All-Share
weighting of 24% and reflects 
our interest in an area where 
long term growth prospects
should be achievable. Over the
year, the value of our holdings 
in financial services companies
has decreased by 2%, compared
with an increase of 8% in this
sector of the FTSE All-Share.
Close Brothers
valuation: £139.5m; holding 12.5%
Close Brothers is the largest independent quoted merchant 
bank in the UK. Caledonia has been a supportive shareholder
since 1986, which highlights our long term investment approach.
One of Caledonia’s directors is an independent non-executive
director of the company.
Close Brothers has been a very successful investment, due 
in no small part to its sound management. At the start of the 
year, it represented over 21% of our portfolio and, after careful
consideration, we decided that it would be appropriate to
rebalance the holding. As a result, we sold 7.4m shares for just
over £57m in June last year. The remaining holding of 18m shares
is still our largest investment, representing 14% of our portfolio.
In March this year, Close Brothers released a very satisfactory 
set of interim results for the six months ending January 2005.
Operating proﬁt on ordinary activities before taxation and
goodwill amortisation increased by 13% over the same period 
a year earlier, to £65.1m. Earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation also grew by 13%, rising from 27.7p to 31.2p.
Investment banking proﬁts increased by some 17% compared
with the same period a year earlier and contributed 51% to the
group’s operating result. Components of these results include
market-making, which performed well given the quiet conditions
in the early part of the period, and corporate finance, which
completed a pleasing number of transactions for clients. The key
driver of growth, however , was the asset management division,
which saw proﬁts more than double with funds under management
growing by 22% to £6.1bn, from £5.0bn a year earlier .
Banking, which represents the remaining 49% of operating
proﬁts, saw proﬁts grow by 2% from the same period a year
earlier. Close Brothers’ loan book increased to £2.0bn from
£1.7bn, with an organic growth rate of some 6%. 13

Rathbone Brothers
valuation: £37.4m; holding 11.3%
Rathbones specialises in providing personalised investment
management and wealth management services for private clients
and trustees, including discretionary asset management, tax
planning, trust and private company management and banking
services. It manages £7.7bn of funds, including over £800m
managed by Rathbone Unit Trust Management.
Rathbones’ proﬁt before tax (before exceptional gains and
goodwill amortisation) for its year ended 31 December 2004
increased by 32.0% to £26.0m and earnings per share (before
goodwill amortisation) increased by 22.8% to 46.8p. T otal funds
under management rose by 13.2% to £7.7bn and the dividend 
of 27.5p was a 5.8% increase over the previous year.
The ﬁrst three months of 2005 saw Rathbones in discussion 
with Rensburg about a possible merger . Rathbones continued to
regard the strategic and ﬁnancial case for merging Rensburg and
Rathbones as compelling but, in the absence of a recommendation
from the Rensburg board, decided not to proceed with an offer .
Rathbones will continue to pursue its existing strategy of
developing its investment management and wealth management
businesses organically, as well as by selective acquisitions and
recruitments where culturally compatible and demonstrably
earnings enhancing to Rathbones’ shareholders.
F&C Asset Management
valuation: £21.1m; holding 1.9%
F&C Asset Management is one of the ﬁve largest UK fund
management businesses, following the merger of ISIS Asset
Management and F&C in the second half of 2004. Caledonia 
had been a long term and inﬂuential shareholder in ISIS and, 
until the merger, had board representation. Our shareholding 
in the company, which was renamed F&C Asset Management,
was diluted to 1.9% as a result of this merger.
The results of F&C Asset Management for the year to 
31 December 2004 are difficult to compare with previous 
years as a result of the merger. However, earnings per share 
rose from 12.0p to 14.0p and the dividend was maintained at
11.0p per share for the year. F&C Asset Management was also
able to conﬁrm that it would deliver the cost savings which 
were a signiﬁcant driving factor behind the merger. Funds under
management were £125bn at 31 December 2004 and F&C Asset
Management is aiming to build these through delivering strong
investment performance and increased choice of investment
alternatives for its institutional and retail customers.
Since the year end, our holding in F&C Asset Management has
been sold for £20m.
Oval
valuation: £17.0m; holding 27.4%
Oval is a UK commercial insurance and financial services 
broking business with annualised fee and commission turnover
of about £36m. It was established in late 2003, with ﬁnancial
support from Caledonia, to acquire and integrate some of the
best regional broking businesses in this still fragmented industry .
Our investment, in the form of equity and a convertible loan, 
now totals £17m.
The Oval concept involves the use of its own equity as well as
cash as consideration for its acquisitions, which should provide
incentives to vendors and help to maintain the value of goodwill
acquired. As it grows, Oval can take advantage of economies 
of scale and the improved terms of trade available from insurers.
Oval’s experienced and energetic management team has now
successfully completed and begun integrating ﬁve acquisitions,
RP Hodson, Bland Bankart, Beddis & Partners, Halkett Associates
and Barﬁeld. This has resulted in rapid growth, with original
revenue targets achieved early. Proﬁtability is broadly in line 
with expectations and more acquisitions are planned.

Marketform
valuation: £15.1m; holding 26.8%
Marketform is an unquoted Lloyd’s insurance business, with
substantial management ownership. It specialises in medical
malpractice and general liability business for insureds outside 
the USA. Marketform manages the business of a consortium 
of medical malpractice underwriters on a fee and profit
commission basis and participates in the consortium through 
its own partially aligned corporate syndicate, for which it also
acts as managing agent.
Caledonia has been a minority shareholder since autumn 2003,
through an investment of £15.1m in equity and convertible 
loan capital. Profits after tax for 2004 were broadly in line with
expectations. The specialised nature of Marketform’s classes 
of business offers some protection from rate competition and 
the outlook remains attractive.
SVB Holdings
valuation: £9.5m; holding 5.3%
SVB is a listed Lloyd’s insurance business, focusing on longer 
tail speciality lines, such as ﬁnancial institutions cover, directors’
and officers’ liability and professional indemnity, as well as
shorter tail property insurance, aviation reinsurance and some
marine cover. It also has insurance distribution businesses,
which produce about a quarter of its premium income. In 2003,
Caledonia invested £9.1m in equity and £4.9m in convertible bonds
to back a vigorous new management team to take advantage 
of the sharply improved trading conditions prevailing after 
11 September 2001. However , as a result of severe deterioration 
in earlier years’ losses, SVB had a tough year in 2004.
At the time we invested, problems in SVB’s US casualty treaty
reinsurance and other liability business (underwritten in 2001 
and prior years) had surfaced, but their full scale and severe
toxicity were not then apparent to anyone. The new management
discontinued this area of the business, which is now being run 
off in a separate unit.
Unexpectedly bad loss reviews began to disclose the full scale 
of the old year problems in the ﬁrst half of 2004 and further
reserves of £37.8m were required. In addition, at 30 June 2004, 
an exceptional loss provision of £103.6m was established, 
of which £67.1m remains unused. 
SVB’s ongoing business continues to be very proﬁtable. We have
conﬁdence in the management team and support their view that,
in the course of time, the continuing proﬁtability of the ongoing
business should substantially outstrip the old year losses. 15

Polar Capital
valuation: £7.3m (£27.4m including funds); holding 24.6%
In January 2001, Caledonia co-founded Polar Capital with 
a highly respected team of fund managers. Our assistance in
formulating the Polar Capital structure, obtaining FSA approvals
and recruitment of its key personnel, illustrates well our ability 
to play a constructive role in the formation of a business that has
shown impressive growth. Funds under management at the year
end stood in excess of $2bn.
Polar Capital is a research driven fund management company,
providing a highly entrepreneurial environment for talented
managers within a structure that offers a level of marketing,
administrative and operational support normally only found 
in much larger organisations. With a staff of 38, Polar Capital
manages $0.65bn in hedge funds and $1.35bn in long-only funds.
Caledonia owns 24.6% of the management company, with the
staff owning the balance, and is represented on the board of the
management company and the boards of its funds. As a result 
of the success and proﬁtability of the business over the year, the
value of our equity investment increased from £5.1m to £7.3m. 
In addition, Polar Capital repaid £1.0m of subordinated loan
notes, initially provided by Caledonia for regulatory capital.
Eddington Capital
valuation: £0.7m (£18.5m including funds); holding 50.0%
Eddington Capital was established in 2003 and is another
example of Caledonia co-founding a business in the fund
management arena. As a specialist in high return fund of hedge
funds, Eddington Capital launched its ﬂagship T riple Alpha Fund
on 1 September 2003, which Caledonia seeded with £15m.
Since launch, while Eddington built up a track record, limited
marketing of the Triple Alpha Fund has taken place and it only
grew from £15m to £23m. Eddington has recently started active
marketing of the fund and its investment approach is seen 
as refreshingly different from that of other funds of funds. 
As potential investors become more familiar with the fund,
Eddington hopes to see assets under management rise steadily
later in the year. Improving the performance and increasing the
size of the Triple Alpha Fund should result in Eddington earning
increasing performance fees.

Leisure and media
Caledonia has long experience 
of the leisure and media sector
through its involvement in the
hospitality and publishing
industries. Although we sold 
part of our Kerzner International
stake and our holding in Radio
Investments during the year,
further investments in media
companies have maintained a
weighting greater than the FTSE
All-Share index, at 17% compared
with 12%. Over the year, our
holdings have increased in value
by 35%, compared with an
increase in the leisure and media
companies in the FTSE All-Share
index of 11%.
Kerzner International
valuation: £117.4m; holding 10.1%
Kerzner International (‘KI’) is a leading developer, owner and
operator of destination resorts, casinos and luxury hotels
worldwide. Caledonia backed the management team when 
Sun International Hotels (now KI) was founded in 1994. Caledonia
has had a non-executive director on KI’s board from the outset.
In July 2004, Caledonia reduced its holding in KI by selling 1.3m
shares at $47.50 per share, as part of a transaction which allowed
Istithmar, a company owned by the Government of Dubai, to
acquire a 13% holding in KI. Istithmar is KI’s partner in building 
a new $1.1bn ‘Atlantis’ resort on The Palm, Jumeirah in Dubai.
We reduced our stake further in February this year, when we sold
886,000 shares at $61.48 per share. Caledonia’s remaining 3.62m
shares represented 12% of our portfolio at the year end and were
valued at £117.4m.
Earlier this year, KI reported 2004 full year adjusted earnings 
per share of $2.47, compared with $2.36 achieved in 2003. 
The company’s ﬂagship operation is Atlantis, Paradise Island, 
a 2,317 room, ocean-themed destination resort off Nassau in 
The Bahamas. The resort includes the world’s largest open air
marine habitat and is the home to the largest casino in the
Caribbean. KI continues to develop the resort and is currently
constructing the Atlantis Marina Village, comprising ﬁve new
restaurants and retail space, together with further timeshare
developments at the Harborside at Atlantis. Plans are also in
hand for expanding the water park attractions and constructing 
a 600 room all-suite hotel and a 500 room condominium hotel.
The company was also responsible for the development of, 
and receives income derived from, Mohegan Sun in Uncasville,
Connecticut, which has become one of the premier casino
destinations in the United States.
In its luxury resort hotel business, the company manages nine
resort hotels primarily under the One&Only brand. The resorts,
featuring some of the top-rated properties in the world, are
located in The Bahamas, Mexico, Mauritius, the Maldives 
and Dubai.
In addition to the Phase III expansion in The Bahamas, KI
currently has a number of new developments under construction
or in an advanced stage of planning. These include a 2,000 room
Atlantis project on The Palm, Jumeirah in Dubai, a 600 room hotel
and casino project in Morocco, a One&Only hotel in Cape T own,
South Africa, and a casino in Northampton, for which KI received
its certiﬁcate of consent from the UK Gaming Board in 2004.

A G Barr
valuation: £16.8m; holding 9.4%
Caledonia has been a long term shareholder and supporter 
of A G Barr, which manufactures, markets and distributes a 
range of carbonated soft drinks, including the well known brands
of Irn-Bru and Tizer, as well as juice drinks and mineral water.
A G Barr recently announced an excellent set of results for the
year to 31 January 2005. Pre-tax proﬁts rose 13.1% to £15.6m 
in a competitive market for soft drinks as a result of improved
margins and increased market share for its core brands. Earnings
per share rose by 13.3% to 56.6p and there was a 12.7% increase
in the dividend to 28.75p per share.
A G Barr has been improving and developing its manufacturing
and distribution operations and also announced a signiﬁcant
programme of capital investment of £17m over three years to
produce further efﬁciencies. This news was well received by the
market and the share price has continued to perform strongly
since 31 March 2005.
Incisive Media
valuation: £13.6m; holding 8.8%
Incisive Media is one of the UK’s foremost specialist providers 
of business information. Through leading magazines, consultancy ,
conferences and exhibitions, websites and a variety of other
platforms, it serves a number of business sectors, especially 
in retail and wholesale ﬁnancial markets. Caledonia acquired a
6.4% stake in Incisive Media through supporting a fundraising in
April 2004, to ﬁnance the acquisition of a specialist private equity
publishing business, and further purchases of shares were made
during the period. Caledonia is represented on the board.
In its year to 31 December 2004, Incisive Media reported a 49%
increase in pre-tax proﬁts to £7.7m on turnover which rose 31%
to £46.5m – evidence of the quality of the margins achieved by
the management team. Diluted earnings per share, adjusted for
goodwill, rose 20% to 7.96p.
The current year has started well and Incisive Media is conﬁdent
of producing another year of strong earnings growth in 2005.
The Sloane Club
valuation: £10.1m; holding 100%
The Sloane Club is a residential members club, based in the 
heart of Chelsea. Caledonia bought the Sloane Club in 1991 
on a long lease, both as a property investment and because 
of its trading potential. It has been enlarged and modernised,
most recently with the addition of air conditioning, flat screen

membership of around 3,500. Caledonia is actively involved 
in the management of the business.
The Sloane Club enjoys the support of a loyal membership.
However, the recruitment of new members, together with the
retention of existing members, is important to its future prosperity .
Overall proﬁtability remained stable during the year, in which the
refurbishment of the rooms enabled the Sloane Club to achieve
an 11% increase in the average room rate, although this was
offset by a fall in occupancy.
The business has continued to make progress with a number 
of successful sales and marketing initiatives during the year. 
In addition, the Sloane Club is actively engaged in the pursuit 
of hotel management opportunities. The Sloane Club competes
in the four star hotel sector and, for the foreseeable future,
expects the trading environment to remain challenging.

Industrial and services
Caledonia’s experience in the
industrial and services sector
dates back many decades, giving
us the expertise to work closely
with management teams of
investee companies. During the
year, we identified few attractive
new opportunities and, as a result,
only 18% of our investments are 
in this sector, compared with 
23% for the FTSE All-Share index.
However, we have made some
follow-on investments in
activities where we see value
opportunities. Over the year, 
our holdings have increased in
value by 32%, compared with 
an increase in the industrial and
services companies in the FTSE
All-Share index of 19%.
Paladin Resources
valuation: £55.7m; holding 9.0%
Paladin is an independent oil and gas exploration and production
company with assets in the North Sea, Australia, Indonesia,
Romania, Tunisia and Gabon. During the year, we sold part 
of our holding in Paladin for £6.5m. Despite this, the strength 
of Paladin’s share price during the period has seen the value 
of our residual stake rise to be the fourth largest in our portfolio.
Paladin reported strong ﬁnancial results for 2004, on similar 
levels of production to 2003. Operating cash ﬂow was particularly
impressive at £171.9m and earnings per share increased 24% 
to 11.1p. The dividend was increased by 8% to 1.7p and reserves
showed a 5% increase.
Paladin entered new territory during the year with the purchase
for $150m of an interest in the Laminaria and Corallina permits 
in the Timor Sea, off the coast of Australia. This acquisition ﬁts
neatly with Paladin’s strategy of purchasing assets where further
active investment enhances production.
The outlook for the coming year is favourable, with a strong 
oil price and a heavy capital investment programme driving
increased production.
Offshore Logistics/Bristow
valuation: £23.8m; holding 5.6%
Offshore Logistics, together with its afﬁliate company, Bristow
Helicopters, is a major provider of helicopter transportation
services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. During the year,
£3.7m was received as a result of a capital reorganisation 
of Offshore Logistics’ afﬁliate, Bristow Helicopters.
In February 2005, Offshore Logistics reported substantially
improved diluted earnings per share of $1.82 for the nine months 
to 31 December 2004, compared with $0.86 for the same period
in 2003. T ogether with generally higher levels of activity and
improved margins, the beneﬁts of restructuring the business 
to improve efﬁciencies are coming through. This has been
assisted by new ﬂeet introductions and customer and safety
orientated initiatives.
Offshore Logistics is listed on the New York Stock Exchange 
and Caledonia is represented on the board.
Wallem
valuation: £15.7m; holding 74.4%
Wallem is a maritime services group based in Hong Kong.
Caledonia has been a shareholder of Wallem for over 12 years
and has board representation. Wallem’s activities encompass
ship and cargo broking, ship management, shipping and air
cargo agency services and maritime software development.
In the period under review, which has been a period of strong
growth in the shipping sector, Wallem has increased the ﬂeet of
ships under management substantially and seen higher activity
and proﬁt from its agency business. Wallem reported signiﬁcantly
higher pre-tax proﬁts for the year to 30 September 2004.
Wallem continues to perform strongly in its current ﬁnancial year.
It has also established a number of new operations in Asia and
Europe, which positions Wallem well to take advantage of further
growth in world shipping markets and China in particular.
As a result of its strong performance, our valuation of Wallem 
has increased by 49% over the year to 31 March 2005. 19

Melrose Resources
valuation: £14.8m; holding 6.7%
Melrose Resources is an oil and gas exploration and production
company listed in London. The company has interests in Bulgaria,
Egypt, the USA and France.
The highlight of an eventful year for Melrose was the first
production from the Galata gas ﬁeld in Bulgaria, which came on
stream in June 2004. The seven month contribution from Galata,
allied with a 258% increase in production in Egypt, helped overall
production rise to over 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(‘boepd’), compared with 1,300 boepd in the previous year.
Proﬁts after tax for the year rose by 174% to £7.7m, driving 
an increase of 70% in earnings per share to 10.7p and a very
welcome maiden dividend of 1.0p was declared.
During the period, Melrose raised £24.6m of new equity, in 
which Caledonia participated with a further £1m investment, 
and agreed a syndicated debt facility of $75m to help fund
working capital requirements. Encouragingly, oil and gas reserves
increased by 14% compared with the previous year. A number 
of new exploration licences were secured in Egypt and Bulgaria,
as well as a permit to explore in the Rhône-Maritime concession
off the southern Mediterranean coast of France.
Easybox
valuation: £12.3m; holding 99.2%
Easybox, a self storage business currently operating in Italy and
Spain, was established in 2000 by Caledonia and a joint venture
partner. Caledonia bought out its partner in early 2003. We have a
longstanding relationship with the management of Easybox, who
had previously developed Abacus into a leading UK self storage
business. Abacus, a Caledonia-owned company, was sold in
1998 for a substantial proﬁt.
Finding new sites for operations continues to prove very difﬁcult,
particularly in Spain. Whilst a number of these have been viewed
during the year, none have been found which meet Easybox’s
exacting requirements. The existing six facilities are all trading
well, particularly the highly visible store in Rome. T otal retail
space let increased by 37% to 19,427 sq m and revenue is up
40% on last year. The company’s ﬁnancial position continues 
to strengthen and operating cash ﬂow is positive.
Sterling Industries
valuation: £10.8m; holding 100%
Sterling Industries comprises three distinct businesses, all
operating in the engineering sector. Sterling Hydraulics is a
specialist designer and manufacturer of hydraulic valves primarily
used in the construction machinery industry. Bloom Engineering
designs and builds burners for the iron and steel and aluminium
industries. Process Combustion Corporation (‘PCC’) designs,
manufactures, and supplies combustion heat transfer and
pollution control systems to various industries to meet
environmental requirements.
Sterling Hydraulics is currently enjoying strong demand for its
products, driven by high commodity prices stimulating demand
for construction and mining machinery. The results for the year
show a signiﬁcant improvement on last year’s outturn and the
Sterling board regards the prospects for the coming year as 
most encouraging.
Bloom Engineering has operations in Europe, the USA and China.
Whilst beneﬁting from high steel prices in the USA, the European
business has continued to ﬁnd the market challenging. Prospects
in China are encouraging following Bloom’s ﬁrst order from Bao
Steel, which was delivered during the year.
PCC had a successful year in Europe and the USA, with
prospects in the latter looking better than for several years.
Amber Industrial
valuation: £10.7m; holding 100%
Amber is a speciality chemicals business with two signiﬁcant
parts, a global silicones compounding division and an industrial
consumables distribution division operating in Germany, Austria,
France and Switzerland. At the start of the year, Amber sold 
its UK aerosols division and has subsequently relocated its
headquarters and UK silicones operation. Since Caledonia’s 
year end, Amber has also made a property disposal realising
proceeds of around £1m.
Underlying operating proﬁts, which exclude discontinued
businesses and the non-recurring costs associated with the
disposal of the aerosols division, were up 28% in the year to
March 2005. This was due mainly to improved trading conditions
in the USA. As a result of the disposal of the aerosols division,
Amber’s valuation has been reduced to £10.7m from £12.8m 
a year earlier.

Property
Caledonia’s history of property
investment has gained us valuable
knowledge of this sector. We
invest in both property assets 
and in property management
companies. We have made
follow-on investments in General
Practice and our weighting in
property companies has increased
to 13%, compared with 4% in the
FTSE All-Share index. However ,
the FTSE All-Share represents
quoted property companies only
and not properties held through
other vehicles. Over the year, our
holdings have increased in value
by 20%, compared with an increase
in the property companies in the
FTSE All-Share index of 21%.
Quintain Estates & Development
valuation: £48.2m; holding 7.0%
Quintain is a property investment and development company,
with a proven track record, specialising in commercial properties.
Over the year, the value of our holding has grown by 25%,
reﬂecting the continued outperformance of Quintain against 
the FTSE All-Share index.
Quintain has now received planning consent for the ﬁrst phase 
of the Wembley development and completed all commercial
contracts at the Greenwich Peninsula. In addition to progress
with these special projects, Quintain has completed a successful
programme of disposals and purchases within its main portfolio.
In July 2004, a new £475m corporate loan was syndicated that,
combined with the ongoing revenue stream from its investment
assets, has ensured that Quintain is in a strong ﬁnancial position
to acquire new assets and fund its special projects.
Proﬁt before tax decreased to £5.0m for the six months ended 
30 September 2004, compared with £7.3m in the corresponding
period in 2003. This was due largely to exceptional costs relating
to the re-ﬁnancing of the company’s debt. However, Quintain
notes that the increasing value of the Wembley and Greenwich
projects signals that it is on track to deliver good net assets
growth for the year to March 2005.
General Practice
valuation: £19.9m; holding 30.0%
General Practice Group (‘GPG’) was formed over ten years ago 
to develop and invest in new surgeries for doctors in general
practice and other associated primary care premises. Caledonia
initially invested in GPG in 2002 and has recently made an
additional investment of £16.9m to enable GPG to increase
substantially its portfolio of surgeries across the country. GPG
now owns 108 properties, with over 40 new properties per 
annum being added to the portfolio through its development
programme.
In the NHS there are currently over 9,000 main surgeries and
2,500 branch surgeries. The NHS’s aim is to bring all general
practice premises up to modern standards, with over 3,000 
new surgeries combining primary and community services. 
GPG is a market leader in this expanding sector.
GPG’s annualised rent roll for the year ended March 2005 was
£8m and it is on target to exceed £20m by 2008.

Savills
valuation: £15.5m; holding 4.2%
Savills is a listed property agency and advisory business
operating in the UK, Continental Europe and the Far East.
Recognising the strength and calibre of the management team,
and the potential for value creation, Caledonia built up its stake
mainly in 2003. One of Caledonia’s directors is a non-executive
director of Savills.
For the year to 31 December 2004, Savills showed strong
performance with turnover up 9% to £328m and group operating
proﬁt increasing 10% to £39m. As a result, the share price also
showed strong performance. As a major initiative, Savills has
launched its fund management arm, Cordea Savills, and had
around £1.4bn of funds under management at the end of
December 2004.
Edinmore
valuation: £11.0m; holding 100%
Edinmore is a wholly owned property group specialising in rural
estates and commercial property. Caledonia provides the ﬁnance
and is actively involved in the management of the business.
Edinmore has had another solid year, achieving a number of
substantial and proﬁtable disposals, mainly in the rural sector 
of its property portfolio. Residential properties in rural areas and
agricultural land have continued to command good prices,
normally above expectations.
Few substantial rural properties or portfolios have come to the
market in the past twelve months and opportunities have,
therefore, been very limited. Land has been kept back from the
market due to continuing uncertainty with regard to CAP reform,
but it is anticipated that more land will become available within
the next year or two.
It has been a very busy year for Edinmore’s commercial property
activities, with a number of substantial investments having been
secured, mainly in joint ventures with other property companies.
Although good rental returns have been achieved and there are
few voids, Edinmore is working hard on asset management to
increase yields where possible and improve the quality of the
properties, with a view to achieving enhanced capital values on
their disposal when market conditions are perceived to be right.
Buckingham Gate
valuation: £9.9m; holding 100%
Caledonia acquired 30 Buckingham Gate, London in December
2000 for its headquarters, as the scale of our activities had
outgrown our former City ofﬁce. The property is a seven ﬂoor
ofﬁce building in a prime West End location. Caledonia occupies
four ﬂoors, with the remaining space let out. As well as being our
head ofﬁce, this allows us to let space, and thereby provide easy
access, to some of our investee companies.
Buckingham Gate has beneﬁted from the gradual recovery of the
West End commercial property market, where there is less over
supply than in the City. The success of Polar Capital, the fund
management company in which Caledonia has a signiﬁcant stake,
caused it to vacate the one ﬂoor it occupied to move to larger
premises. The space vacated has already been partly re-let.

Managed general funds
Caledonia has particular expertise
in identifying and supporting
asset management teams, which
we often back with an investment
in the management company 
as well as in the fund itself. Our
weighting of 24% in managed
general funds is greater than the
3% of investment companies that
make up the FTSE All-Share index,
as a substantial proportion of 
our interests are structured as
limited partnerships or offshore
investment funds. Over the year ,
our holdings have increased in
value by 31%, compared with 
an increase in the investment
companies in the FTSE All-Share
index of 15%.
British Empire Securities
valuation: £104.9m; holding 19.9%
British Empire is a UK investment trust whose objective is to
achieve capital growth from a focused portfolio of investments,
particularly in companies whose share prices stand at a discount
to estimated underlying net asset value. Caledonia has been 
a signiﬁcant shareholder for over 14 years and is represented 
on the board.
British Empire has continued to perform strongly, both
outperforming its benchmark indices and remaining as a top
performer in the Association of Investment Trust Companies’
Global Growth sector. Over the year to March 2005, net asset
total return was 25.5% compared with a total return of 15.6% 
for the FTSE All-Share index.
From the end of 2004 until recently, British Empire had been
trading at a premium to its stated net asset value, reﬂecting this
strong performance. It has also been taking proﬁt and moving
some of its portfolio onto a more defensive footing, should
current market levels not prove sustainable.
Cobepa
valuation: £26.1m; holding 9.4%
Compagnie Benelux Paribas SA (‘Cobepa’) is a Belgian
investment company with an attractive portfolio of listed and
unlisted investments. Caledonia was part of a consortium that
backed the management team to purchase Cobepa from BNP
Paribas in April 2004 and is represented on Cobepa’s board.
The portfolio is currently valued at n449m, the largest holding
being Dicobel, the parent company of Autoglass. Other
investments of note include D’Ieteren and NAVTEQ, the NYSE
quoted supplier of in-car navigation systems. Cobepa seeks 
to invest between n20m to n50m of equity in either minority
shareholdings, alongside families or other institutions, or 
majority positions where transactions are structured as 
leveraged buyouts. Its sphere of investment encompasses
Belgium, France and Holland. 23

Aberforth LP fund
valuation: £22.5m; holding 25.5%
This limited partnership fund was launched in March 2001 
with a remit to acquire signiﬁcant shareholdings in smaller UK
listed companies and to work with those companies to release
latent value. Caledonia committed £25m to this fund, which was
fully drawn down by March 2003. By 31 March 2005, the £25m
was fully repaid, together with a further £4.5m from underlying
realisations. The carrying value of £22.5m at 31 March 2005
represents Caledonia’s interest in the remaining fund, which
contains ﬁve underlying portfolio investments. As at that date, 
the fund had generated an IRR of almost 33% per annum, based
upon both realised and unrealised gains, showing outperformance
against the FTSE All-Share index and demonstrating a signiﬁcant
achievement by the Aberforth team in both stock selection and
timing of investment and disinvestment. Caledonia is represented
on the advisory committee.
Polar Capital funds
valuation: £20.1m
Caledonia has an investment in both Polar Capital and a number
of its funds. Our investment in the management company is
reviewed on page 15.
The majority of our Polar Capital fund investments are in hedge
funds, which aim to generate a positive return substantially
above the market risk free rate, irrespective of market conditions.
These funds have performed well, returning between -1% and
21% over 2004.
During the year, Caledonia moved between various Polar 
Capital funds. We redeemed our investments in the Paragon 
and Japan funds for £11.4m and invested a total of £9.3m in the
new Asia ex-Japan fund, launched at the end of 2004, and the
Paragon fund.
Eddington Capital fund
valuation: £17.8m
The Triple Alpha Fund is the first investment vehicle of
Eddington Capital Management, reviewed on page 15. The fund 
is a multi-strategy fund of hedge funds, which seeks to deliver
two and a half times the returns of the mainstream hedge fund
universe. In the 18 months since launch, the fund has performed
in line with that target, delivering an 18% return.
Performance to date is in excess of the returns earned by
comparable indices, but hedge fund performance in general 
fell short of the long term outperformance we would have liked.
An abnormally high correlation between strategies, ﬁckle market
sentiment and an absence of volatility have all reduced returns
from hedge funds and the gain in value of the Triple Alpha Fund,
although positive for the year, was lower than we had hoped for.

Financial review
Jonathan Cartwright
Finance director
Caledonia became an investment trust company as from 
1 April 2003 and, as such, we believe that the company
statement of total return and company balance sheet are the
most appropriate statements for reporting our performance.
Therefore, this review discusses the ﬁnancial results of the
company as well as summarising the performance of the group.
Basis of presentation of accounts
Caledonia is an investment trust company, but we are relatively
unusual in holding trading subsidiaries as part of our investment
portfolio. Our ownership of subsidiaries requires us to prepare
consolidated accounts, but the accounting rules prevent us from
including subsidiaries in the consolidated accounts at valuation.
The consolidated balance sheet would not, therefore, give a
presentation of our investment portfolio consistent with other
investment trusts. However, the company balance sheet does
allow us to show the entire portfolio (including subsidiaries) at
valuation and is, therefore, considered to be the most relevant
statement in presenting our ﬁnancial position. Consistent with 
the presentation of other investment trusts, we also present a
company statement of total return. Actual proceeds from the
disposal of any individual investment will inevitably depend 
on market and economic conditions prevailing at the time.
Company total return
Company total return for the year was £173.2m, or 263.6p per
share, compared with £282.8m, or 391.5p per share last year.
Gains on investments over the year totalled £165.8m. This
included gains of £39.2m on Kerzner International, £28.3m on
British Empire, £24.8m on Paladin Resources and £13.5m on the
Aberforth LP fund. As a result of investment sales during the year,
historic gains of £99.2m were realised, notably £45.8m and
£43.3m on the sales of part of our stakes in Kerzner International
and Close Brothers respectively.
Income from investments of £18.9m fell from last year’s ﬁgure 
of £21.5m. The dividends from most of our principal investments
were maintained or increased over the year . However , the dividend
from Close Brothers reduced by £1.7m as a result of the sale of
part of our stake and a dividend of £1.3m from Wallem in 2004
was not repeated.
Management costs rose to £10.0m from £9.1m last year. This
movement included increased pension contributions of £0.6m as
part of a programme to address the company’s deﬁned beneﬁt
scheme’s deﬁcit.
Other corporate costs of £0.4m comprised the costs associated
with the elective special dividend and reduction of capital, which
was completed in July 2004. The cost last year of £2.5m arose
principally from the liquidation proposals promoted by a minority
group of shareholders in The Cayzer Trust Company, which were
subsequently withdrawn.
Interest payable of £1.0m, the same as last year, arose principally
on amounts due to a subsidiary undertaking.
The total taxation charge (revenue and capital) for the year
amounted to £0.1m, compared with £0.4m last year. 25
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Group proﬁt and loss and other gains and losses
Overall, proﬁt before tax for the year to 31 March 2005 totalled
£6.6m, compared with £6.1m reported last year.
The group operating loss for the year was £9.0m, compared 
with £11.5m last year. The main factors in this improvement were
increased proﬁts from Sterling Industries of £1.2m, compared
with a loss of £0.1m last year, offset by reduced proﬁts from
Edinmore of £1.0m, compared with £1.7m, and amortisation of
goodwill which increased by £0.7m. Also, as mentioned above,
other corporate costs reduced from £2.5m last year to £0.4m.
There were no sales of operations or properties last year , compared
with a £0.6m loss and £1.1m proﬁt respectively this year.
Income from investments of £16.5m was down on last year’s
ﬁgure of £17.3m. The main changes were dividends from Close
Brothers reduced by £1.7m as a result of the sale of part of our
stake and no dividends from Wallem, compared with £1.3m in
2004. Against this, dividends from most of our other principal
investments were maintained or increased over the year. Interest
receivable was £0.9m, slightly down on last year’s amount as 
the group was more fully invested throughout the 2005 ﬁnancial
year than in 2004. Interest payable of £2.3m increased over the
previous year’s ﬁgure of £0.8m as non-recourse bank ﬁnance 
of £20.5m was raised in The Sloane Club and Buckingham Gate
in March 2004.
Group realised and unrealised gains and losses mirror those 
of the company except for small differences where the company
ﬁgures include realised and unrealised gains and losses 
on subsidiaries.
The total taxation charge (revenue and capital) for the year
amounted to £2.9m, compared with £2.6m last year, principally
due to tax on overseas investments.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 8.7p per share has been paid and the
directors have recommended a ﬁnal dividend of 19.5p per share,
making a total of 28.2p per share for the year at a cost of £17.9m.
This is a 4.4% increase over the total dividend for 2004 of 27.0p
per share.
Cash ﬂow and balance sheet
The difference between company and group net funds reﬂects the
net funds held by trading subsidiaries and intra-group transactions.
The company’s net funds at the year end were £39.6m compared
with £34.0m at the start of the year, an increase of £5.6m.
Significant outflows were incurred in respect of investment
purchases totalling £127.4m, annual dividend payments of
£18.9m and the elective special dividend payment of £88.0m.
Investment purchases included £22.8m in Cobepa, £16.9m in
General Practice, £12.5m in Oval and £10.6m in Incisive Media.
Signiﬁcant inﬂows arose from investment sales of £218.5m,
capital dividends from group undertakings of £8.8m and £8.8m
on the realisation of forward currency contracts. Investment sales
proceeds included £62.0m from Kerzner International, £57.1m
from Close Brothers, £23.8m of distributions from the Aberforth
LP fund and £13.7m from the sale of Radio Investments.
The group’s net funds at the year end were £10.4m compared
with £8.2m at the start of the year, an increase of £2.2m. Most 
of the cash ﬂows were similar to those of the company. However,
the principal difference was due to operating cash ﬂows, tax
paid, elimination of intra-group dividends and purchase of 
ﬁxed assets.
Elective special dividend and reduction of capital
On 15 March 2004, the company announced outline proposals 
for an elective return of funds to ordinary shareholders. On 
19 May 2004, a circular was sent to all shareholders detailing 
the proposals. Subject to a number of conditions being met, all
Caledonia ordinary shareholders were offered the opportunity to
receive a special dividend on terms that they gave up part of their
shareholdings. The elective special dividend was set at a ﬁxed
discount of 18% to Caledonia’s net asset value calculated on the
date and according to the methodology set out in the circular.
Those who elected to receive the special dividend, which could
be on a maximum of up to two out of every nine ordinary shares
held, would have those shares on which they elected to receive
the special dividend cancelled for nil consideration, pursuant to 
a Court approved reduction of capital.
In the event, elections were submitted to receive the special
dividend on 8,407,676 Caledonia ordinary shares, representing
11.58% of the issued ordinary share capital. The net asset value
per share, calculated in accordance with the methodology set 
out in the circular, as at the 25 June 2004 certiﬁcation date, was
1276.91p. The amount of the special dividend per share was,
therefore, 1047.07p, a total of £88.0m for all shares elected,
which was paid on 2 July 2004. The 8,407,676 shares were
cancelled, reducing the number of ordinary shares in issue 
to 64,205,796 as at that date.
Treasury operations and controls
The group’s objective for its treasury operations is to ensure that
adequate ﬁnancial resources are available for its activities, whilst
managing its credit, interest rate and currency risks. 
Treasury operations are centred on the Group Treasury function
and managed within policies and procedures approved by the
board. The activities of Group Treasury are regularly reviewed 
by the executive directors and reported to the board.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used to manage risks arising
from group activities. Caledonia does not trade in derivatives and
does not enter into treasury transactions of either a speculative
nature or unrelated to its activities.
Credit risk
The group’s objective is to limit the risk of loss arising from
default by counterparties. This is achieved by limiting exposure
to single entities and by spreading risk across a number of
counterparties. Exposures are only created with counterparties
meeting standards predetermined by reference to the major
credit rating agencies and within ﬁnancial limits.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises on the ﬂuctuations in value of ﬁnancial
instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The exposure to interest rate movements on treasury assets 
is mitigated by the use of term deposits, certiﬁcates of deposit
and other instruments. In respect of specific debt, the group
manages its exposure by using derivatives, such as caps 
and collars. The group seeks to maximise interest returns 
on cash principally by pooling and using bank deposits of 
varying maturity. 26

Liquidity risk
The group’s objective is to ensure that funding is available to
meet its requirements, whilst minimising borrowing costs and
securing an advantageous return on liquid funds. 
The group maintains undrawn committed borrowing facilities 
to provide ﬂexibility in the management of the group’s liquidity. 
At the year end, the group had undrawn committed facilities 
of £86.7m.
The management of liquid funds of the company is undertaken
within guidelines designed to maintain its investment trust status.
The policy of the board is that borrowings shall not exceed 
20% of net assets. The company’s undrawn committed facilities
at the year end of £70m had been reduced from £200m as at 
31 March 2004. In February 2004, the company had increased its
committed facilities from £30m to £200m to fund the maximum
dividend payment were all shareholders to have elected to
receive the special dividend and consequent cancellation 
of shares proposed in March 2004. In the event, shareholders
elected to receive the special dividend on 11.58% of the issued
ordinary shares and therefore an amount of £88m was paid in
July 2004. Proceeds from disinvestments enabled us to repay
bank debt and we cancelled £130m of the committed facilities. 
In addition to the committed facilities, the company has an
overdraft facility of £10m.
Foreign currency risk
The group’s exposure to foreign currency risk arises primarily
from holding investments and treasury assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. Although the group is based
in the UK, it is a signiﬁcant investor in US dollar denominated
assets and has investments in Europe, the Far East and other
parts of the world. There is also exposure through UK portfolio
investments which have activities abroad.
For investments denominated in foreign currencies, the 
board’s current policy is that the company should have no 
direct exposure to the US dollar and that direct exposure to 
the euro and other currencies in aggregate should each not
exceed 10% of the company’s net assets. The full value of 
US dollar denominated investments, which amounted to £163.0m
equivalent at the year end, is hedged using forward currency
contracts. This policy is kept under review. At the year end, direct
portfolio exposures to the euro and other currencies in aggregate
were within the policy limits at 4.4% and 2.5% respectively.
Consequently, these exposures were not hedged.
The group’s policy is that, where possible, treasury assets and
liabilities are converted into sterling to minimise the net exposure
to foreign currencies.
The group also has a small amount of transactional currency
exposure. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases in
currencies other than the company’s functional currency. Where
these are material, it is the group’s policy to hedge using forward
currency contracts.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The requirement for Caledonia to adopt International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), commencing with the year
beginning 1 April 2005, involves a process of major change, 
for which we have established a project team working in
conjunction with the external auditors and other technical
advisers. The key differences between IFRS and UK GAAP
for Caledonia are the requirements to:
■ Mark listed portfolio investments from mid-market prices 
to bid prices (IAS 39).
■ Incorporate the difference between the balance sheet value 
of pension fund assets and discounted liabilities (IAS 19).
These adjustments are not expected to result in a material
change in reported net asset values.
In addition, under IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’, it will be
necessary to expense beneﬁts conferred on employees through
the granting of share options. This entry will be debited through
the company’s income statement, but will have no effect on 
NAV per share.
The ﬁrst accounts to reﬂect the adoption of IFRS will be the
interim report for the six months to 30 September 2005. This
interim report will include comparative ﬁgures adjusted in
accordance with IFRS, together with the required restatement 
of the 31 March 2005 balance sheet.
We are committed to ensuring compliance with all material
aspects of IFRS and action is being taken to establish the
accounting policies, systems and reporting changes that will 
be required to be implemented.

Annual report 2005
Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared to comply with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). 
The tables included in the statements below on directors’
remuneration, pensions and share options have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the
board whose members throughout the year were Mr M E T
Davies (chairman), Mr C M Allen-Jones and Mr J R H Loudon.
The Committee, whose written terms of reference are published 
on the company’s website and are available on request from the
company secretary , has been established for the following purposes:
■ T o determine and agree with the board the framework and
broad policy for the remuneration of the executive directors
and such other members of the executive management as it is
requested by the board to consider and to review the ongoing
appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy.
■ T o approve the design of, and determine targets for, any
performance related pay schemes operated by the company
and to approve the total annual payments made under 
such schemes.
■ T o review the design of all share incentive plans for approval 
by the board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to
determine each year whether awards will be made and, if so,
the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards 
to executive directors and other senior executives and the
performance targets to be used.
■ Within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total
individual remuneration packages of each executive director
(and if requested by the board, other senior executives)
including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments,
share options and other awards.
■ T o determine the policy for and scope of pension
arrangements, service agreements, termination payments 
and compensation commitments for executive directors and, 
if requested by the board, other senior executives.
■ T o review and assess annually the remuneration trends across
the company.
References to executive directors also include the chairman.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice
from independent remuneration consultants, T owers Perrin and
Hay Group. T owers Perrin was appointed by the Remuneration
Committee during the year and the Hay Group had been
previously appointed by the company. At the request of the
Remuneration Committee, T owers Perrin conducted a thorough
review of the company’s remuneration policy. Hay Group
assessed the comparability of senior executive remuneration
packages with the market place for the purpose of setting
executive directors’ salaries for the year commencing 1 April 2004.
The Remuneration Committee also received advice from
Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer in relation to the company’s
executive share option schemes. Hay Group and T owers Perrin
only advised in relation to the remuneration of executive directors
and senior management and Freshﬁelds Bruckhaus Deringer 
are the company’s main legal advisers. The Remuneration
Committee also consulted with the chairman, Mr P N Buckley,
and the chief executive, Mr T C W Ingram, in relation to the
remuneration of all of the executive directors other than their
own. Internal support was provided to the Remuneration
Committee by the company secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
During the year, the Remuneration Committee conducted a
review of the company’s long term incentive arrangements in the
light of the group’s objectives, and in order to reﬂect developments
in best practice in this area. As a result of this review, the
Remuneration Committee has adopted a remuneration policy
with the following objectives:
■ Performance related remuneration should seek to align the
interests of the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
■ A signiﬁcant portion of the executive directors’ remuneration
packages should be linked to the performance of the company.
■ Remuneration packages for the executive directors should 
be competitive in terms of market practice in order to attract,
retain and motivate executive directors of the quality needed 
to manage and grow the company successfully.
The Remuneration Committee has been guided by these
objectives in developing two new executive share plans – a new
executive share option scheme (which will replace the current
executive share option scheme) and a deferred bonus plan,
shareholder approval for both of which will be sought, under
separate ordinary resolutions, at the annual general meeting.
It is currently intended that the policy statement set out in this
report shall apply for the year to 31 March 2006 and for subsequent
years. However, the Remuneration Committee considers that 
an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufﬁciently ﬂexible
and kept under review in order to take account of future changes
in the company’s business environment and in remuneration
practice. Accordingly, the policy may be further amended in
future years. Any changes in policy for financial years after 
31 March 2006 will be described in future directors’ remuneration
reports, which will continue to be subject to an advisory vote 
of shareholders. All statements in this report in relation to
remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2006 should be 
read in this light.
Policy on individual components of executive 
directors’ remuneration
Basic salary and beneﬁts
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by
reference to the experience and responsibilities of the director
concerned and taking into account external market research. 
The company’s policy is to pay salaries and other beneﬁts which
are competitive, but not excessive, in relation to the marketplace.
The company provides a range of beneﬁts, such as company
cars or cash allowances, life insurance, permanent health
insurance, and private medical cover. Company cars were
however phased out during the year and replaced entirely by
cash allowances. 
Bonus
The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme 
for executive directors, which takes into account both the
performance of individual directors and the performance 
of the company over the short and medium term. For the ﬁnancial
year ended 31 March 2005, the bonuses will either be paid in
cash or as an employer contribution to Inland Revenue approved
pension schemes. The method of payment will be determined
by the Remuneration Committee. 34
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Directors’ remuneration report 
continued
For the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2006, and for future years,
the Remuneration Committee intends to change the existing
arrangements in two respects – ﬁrst, by increasing the maximum
potential bonus, and second, by satisfying a proportion of the
bonus in shares on a deferred basis. It is proposed to increase
the maximum potential bonus that may be awarded from 70% 
to 100% of basic salary. The amount of bonus payable will
continue to be dependent on a combination of the level of the
outperformance of Caledonia’s net asset value per share (with
dividends added back) (‘NAV per share’) over the FTSE All-Share
T otal Return index, but measured over the ﬁnancial year, and 
on the individual director’s performance. The Remuneration
Committee will have the discretion to reduce the amount of
bonus payable if Caledonia’s NAV per share growth in the
ﬁnancial year is negative and/or Caledonia’s NAV per share
outperformance over the ﬁnancial year is greater than that
measured over the previous three ﬁnancial years. The payment 
of any such bonus also remains subject to the overriding
discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The revised bonus arrangements are also designed to align the
interests of directors with those of shareholders by requiring 
a proportion of any bonus paid to a director to be compulsorily
invested in shares. It is proposed that for any annual bonus 
paid in the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2006, that part of the
bonus, if any, which amounts to more than 50% of a director’s
basic salary will be invested in shares under the new deferred
bonus plan.
In addition, for the ﬁnancial year ending 31 March 2006, directors
will be entitled to convert voluntarily up to half of any remaining
cash bonus to a conditional entitlement to shares under the
deferred bonus plan. The shares so invested will be eligible for
matching, on a one for one basis, subject to the satisfaction of
performance conditions over a period of three years. Further
information on the deferred bonus plan is set out below.
The Remuneration Committee may also award bonuses outside
the terms of the company’s annual bonus scheme. No bonus
payments are pensionable.
Deferred bonus plan
The Remuneration Committee regards participation in share
based incentives as a key element in the executive directors’
remuneration packages. T o achieve this, the Remuneration
Committee is proposing to introduce a deferred bonus plan 
(the ‘Plan’), for which shareholder approval will be sought at 
the annual general meeting. A detailed summary of the terms 
of the Plan is set out in a separate circular to shareholders
containing the notice of the annual general meeting, which
explains the resolutions to be proposed at the annual general
meeting and which accompanies this annual report.
In developing the Plan, the Remuneration Committee’s primary
intention has been to align the interests of the executive directors
with those of the shareholders, to increase the degree of
performance related reward in the directors’ remuneration
packages and, further, to encourage retention by incentivising 
the directors. The main features of the Plan are as follows.
In any ﬁnancial year in which an executive director or other senior
executive receives a bonus under the company’s annual bonus
scheme, the Remuneration Committee may, in its absolute
discretion, determine that a proportion of any such bonus shall
take the form of an award of shares under the Plan (the
‘Compulsory Investment’). For the year ending 31 March 2006,
the Remuneration Committee has determined that any amount 
of bonus which is above 50% of an executive’s basic salary shall
normally comprise a Compulsory Investment under the Plan.
In addition to the Compulsory Investment, the Remuneration
Committee may invite executive directors and other senior
executives to convert a proportion of their bonus into a
conditional entitlement to shares (the ‘Voluntary Investment’). 
For the year ending 31 March 2006, executives may elect to
convert up to half of the remaining cash annual bonus payable 
to them. At the end of a three year holding period, the Voluntary
Investment will vest, together with an equal number of additional
shares (the ‘Matching Shares’), if the performance conditions
described below are met.
The number of shares comprised in the Compulsory Investment
and any Voluntary Investment will be determined by reference to
the market value of a share at the time the award is made, which
will occur shortly after the announcement of Caledonia’s results
for the ﬁnancial year to which the bonus relates (or following the
occurrence of exceptional circumstances justifying the making 
of awards). In both cases, the number of shares will be set on a
pre-tax basis (as the shares will be subject to income tax and
national insurance on release). The number of Matching Shares
will be equal to the number of shares in the Voluntary Investment.
No awards under the Plan will be made to executives within six
months of their anticipated retirement. Awards under the Plan are
not pensionable.
The shares comprised in a Compulsory Investment will normally
only vest (together with an amount equal to the dividends that
would have accrued on the shares) if the executive remains 
an employee of the Caledonia group for a three year period
following the award. The number of shares in the Compulsory
Investment will be set by reference to annual bonus criteria, 
and the vesting of these shares will not be subject to a further
performance condition.
The shares comprised in the Voluntary Investment will not be
subject to a performance condition and will vest (together with 
an amount equal to the dividends that would have accrued 
on the shares) at the earlier of three years from the date of the 
award or the date the executive ceases to be an employee 
of the Caledonia group for any reason.
The vesting of the Matching Shares will be dependent on the
company’s performance over a three year period, by reference 
to two separate performance conditions. Both performance
conditions relate to the performance of Caledonia’s net asset
value per share over the three ﬁnancial years starting with the
year in which the award is made (the ‘Prescribed Period’). 
This performance of net asset value per share will be compared 
against different indices as follows:
■ 50% of the Matching Shares will only vest if Caledonia’s net
asset value per share over the Prescribed Period outperforms
the Retail Price Index by at least 9%.
■ The remaining 50% of the Matching Shares will only vest if
Caledonia’s net asset value per share over the Prescribed
Period outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by at least 3%.
There will be no retesting of either performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance 
target if events occur that would make the amended target a fairer
measure of performance and provided that any amended target is
no more difﬁcult to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will also
have the ability to impose different performance targets in the
future, provided that any targets that are imposed are no less
demanding than that described above. Any such amended or
different performance targets will be described in the directors’
remuneration report for the relevant year. 35
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
If an executive leaves employment during the three year period,
the shares comprised in his Compulsory Investment will normally
lapse. However, if the executive ceases to be an employee 
of the Caledonia group by reason of death, injury or disability 
(as determined by the Remuneration Committee), retirement
either at or after normal retirement date, the sale of the business
or subsidiary for which the executive works, the executive’s
employing company ceasing to be a member of the Caledonia
group or any other reason at the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee (a ‘good leaver reason’) these shares will vest.
If an executive leaves employment during the three year period
for any reason, the shares comprised in his Voluntary Investment
will vest. In these circumstances, his entitlement to the Matching
Shares will normally lapse. However, if the executive ceases to 
be an employee of the Caledonia group for a good leaver reason,
the performance conditions attaching to the Matching Shares 
will be measured to the date of leaving and the Matching Shares
will vest on the basis of performance up to the date of leaving,
unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise. 
The Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to adjust
the vesting level if it considers that the performance conditions
would have been met to a greater or lesser extent at the end 
of the full three year performance period. The Remuneration
Committee will in normal circumstances scale down the vesting
level having regard to the time that has elapsed between grant 
of the Matching Shares and the date of leaving.
Pensions
The company’s policy on pension provision is to provide a 
means whereby executive directors either receive a pension at
retirement age from the company, or are funded to operate their
own money purchase pension plans or other arrangements. The
executive directors, other than Mr T C W Ingram and Mr J M May,
participate in the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which is a deﬁned
beneﬁts scheme and is contributory for employees who joined
the company after 1 April 1988, but which is now closed to new
members. The scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds 
of ﬁnal pensionable salary on retirement dependent on length of
service and also provides for dependants’ pensions and lump sums
on death-in-service. All of the executive directors participating in
the scheme, other than Mr J H Cartwright, transferred into the
scheme from The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme
which was non-contributory, and this status has been preserved.
Mr Ingram and Mr May do not participate in any company
pension scheme, but instead a ﬁxed percentage of basic salary 
is paid into personal pension arrangements or, in the case of 
Mr Ingram, as a cash supplement, which is inclusive of associated
income tax and national insurance costs. The percentage of basic
salary is 25% for Mr Ingram and 10% for Mr May .
It is the company’s policy that any future executive directors
recruited from outside the company will be funded to operate
their own pension arrangements and that the company will not
offer participation in any deﬁned beneﬁts arrangements.
Share options
A key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to
motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder
value. The Remuneration Committee believes that this is best
achieved through the grant of share options, which are only
exercisable if a demanding performance condition is met. 
The grant of options is considered to be a key element of the
remuneration package, alongside annual salary, annual bonus
and the proposed deferred bonus plan for which shareholder
approval is being sought at the annual general meeting.
In connection with its review of remuneration policy, the
Remuneration Committee wishes to obtain shareholder approval
to establish a new executive share option scheme to replace 
the executive share option scheme currently operated by the
company. The new share option scheme, to be known as the
Caledonia Investments 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme
(the ‘2005 Scheme’), is based on the current executive share
option scheme (details of which are set out on pages 38 and 39)
but has been updated to reﬂect current best practice.
Options under the 2005 Scheme will be subject to a more
demanding performance target than that which applies to 
current option grants. This will require that 50% of the shares
comprised in the option will vest if Caledonia’s net asset value
per share outperforms the Retail Price Index by at least 9% over
the measurement period. The other 50% of the shares comprised 
in the option will vest if Caledonia’s net asset value per share
outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by at least 3% over the
measurement period. The measurement period for these
purposes will be a period of three ﬁnancial years measured at 
the end of the third ﬁnancial year following the date of grant of
the options. There will be no retesting of the performance targets.
T o the extent that the performance target is not met over this
three year period, an option will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance target
if events occur that would make the amended target a fairer
measure of performance and provided that any amended target
is no more difﬁcult to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will
also have the ability to impose different performance targets 
in the future, provided that any targets that are imposed are no
less demanding than described above. Any such amended or
different performance targets will be described in the directors’
remuneration report for the relevant year.
T o the extent that the performance target is met, options may be
exercised between the date of vesting and the tenth anniversary
of the date of grant, except that only one-third of the shares
comprised in an option may normally be exercised after three
years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds normally
becoming exercisable six years after grant.
In recognition of the more stringent performance targets attaching
to options under the 2005 Scheme, the maximum value of options
that may be granted in any year to an executive will be increased
to 150% of salary. It is anticipated that the initial grants of options
to executive directors, following shareholder approval of the 2005
Scheme, will be at this level. The Remuneration Committee may
exceed this limit for individual executive directors where it
considers it necessary to do so to secure their appointment,
provided that the maximum value that may be granted in such
circumstances shall not exceed 250% of salary.
Unlike the current executive share option scheme, which
imposes a limit of four times an executive’s total annual
emoluments on the value of options that may be granted to 
an executive, there will be no ceiling on the aggregate value 
of options that may be granted to an executive under the 2005
Scheme. However, as with the current scheme, there will be 
an overall limit on the number of options which may be granted
under the 2005 Scheme. T o the extent that new shares are issued
(or shares held in treasury are transferred) to satisfy options, the
number of shares which may be issued (or shares held in treasury
transferred) over a ten year period under all of the company’s
discretionary share schemes will be limited to 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital and to 10% under all share schemes. 
No options will be granted at a discount. 36

In other respects, the terms of the 2005 Scheme are similar to
those of the current executive share option scheme. A detailed
summary of the terms of the 2005 Scheme, for which shareholder
approval will be sought at the annual general meeting, is set out
in the circular to shareholders containing the notice of the annual
general meeting, which explains the resolutions to be proposed
at the annual general meeting and which accompanies this
annual report.
Policy on executive directors’ service contracts
It is the policy of the company that no executive director 
should be offered a service contract that cannot be terminated
within one year or which contains provision for predetermined
compensation in excess of one year’s total emoluments. 
All existing directors’ service contracts comply with this policy.
The Remuneration Committee has regard to compensation
commitments and believes that these are best addressed by
restricting the term of the contract. In the event of a termination,
the Remuneration Committee would consider all the relevant
factors and circumstances and seek a just solution.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by 
executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold
external non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s
business, provided that the time commitment required is not
material. Normally the company will retain any fees arising from
such non-executive directorships, but may permit the executive
director to retain fees in certain circumstances. Details of any
such fees retained by executive directors are disclosed in the
statement on directors’ remuneration below.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration and terms 
of appointment
It is the company’s policy that non-executive directors should 
be appointed for ﬁxed periods of no more than three years (from
the next general meeting following their initial appointment in the
case of new non-executive directors) and that re-appointment at
the end of such periods should not be automatic. Non-executive
directors are paid an annual fee determined by the board as 
a whole within the overall limit contained in the articles of
association, but do not receive any other beneﬁts for their service
as non-executive directors from the company. The basic fee for
non-executive directors was £27,000 (2004 – £26,000) and fees of
£3,000 per annum (2004 – £3,000) were paid for the chairmanships
of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, with a further £3,000
(2004 – £nil) paid to Mr C M Allen-Jones for his role as senior
independent non-executive director and chairman of the
Governance Committee. Non-executive directors may also be
paid additional fees agreed by the board where they have
performed services that, in the opinion of the board, are over 
and above their normal duties.
The company is entitled to terminate a non-executive director’s
appointment at any time without compensation.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return
(‘TSR’) against that of the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index for
the ﬁve ﬁnancial periods ending on 31 March 2005 and has been
prepared in accordance with the Regulations. TSR has been
calculated assuming that all dividends are reinvested on their 
ex-dividend date. The FTSE All-Share T otal Return index has
been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company 
measures its delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

pensions below. Certain executive directors also hold external
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s
business, where it has been agreed that they may retain the 
fees arising therefrom. Mr T C W Ingram is a non-executive
director of Sage Group, for which he received fees during the
year of £37,500 (2004 – £30,000). Mr Ingram was appointed to 
the board of Sage Group before he joined Caledonia. During the
year, Mr J M May was chairman of Covenant Healthcare, which
paid a fee of £20,000 (2004 – £20,000) for his services to a private
company owned by Mr May and his wife. Mr May was appointed
to this position prior to his joining Caledonia and resigned from
Covenant Healthcare’s board on 14 April 2005.

1. Except for Mr P N Buckley, the accrued pensions were the amounts that would be paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation, if the director left service at the
relevant date. Mr P N Buckley reached normal retirement age on 23 September 2004 and his accrued pension has been calculated as at that date.
2. The increase in accrued pension, net of inﬂation, in column (3) is calculated by subtracting the pension accrued to 31 March 2004, multiplied by the increase in the Retail
Prices Index for the year to 31 March 2005, or earlier normal retirement date, from the accrued pension to 31 March 2005, or earlier normal retirement date.
3. The transfer value shown in column (4) represented the value of the increase in accrued pension during the year, as set out in column (3), minus director’s contributions.
4. The change in transfer value over the year shown in column (7) (calculated as column (5) less column (6) and any directors’ contributions) reﬂected the impact on transfer
values of factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as movements in stock markets. These can cause transfer values at different points in time 
to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly. Disclosed changes in value may therefore be subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
5. The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11’, published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
During the year, the company made contributions to a money
purchase personal pension plan for the beneﬁt of Mr T C W Ingram
of £35,700 (2004 – £29,700), being the maximum amount
permitted for this tax year under Inland Revenue limits. As
described above, and in accordance with his service contract,
Mr Ingram elected to receive the balance of his agreed pension
entitlement by way of a cash payment of £44,758 (2004 – £42,265),
before tax, in lieu of pension contribution. The company also
made contributions during the year of £26,415 (2004 – £15,606)
to a money purchase pension plan for the beneﬁt of Mr J M May .

The closing balance shown above represents the number of shares held under option at 31 March 2005 or, in the case of Sir David Kinloch who retired on 14 July 2004, the date
of his cessation as a director.
There have been no changes in directors’ options to acquire
ordinary shares up to the date of this report.
The company currently has two executive share option schemes
– an original scheme established in 1988 and which expired in
April 1998 for the purposes of new option grants, and a 1998
scheme approved by shareholders in July 1998, under which
option grants commenced in September 1998.
Under the terms of both of the above schemes, options may be
exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant,
although only one-third of the shares comprised in an option 
may be exercised after three years from grant, with the remaining
two-thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant. Options
may only be exercised if a performance target is met. 39
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
All targets for options granted under the original scheme, which
related to the company’s earnings per share growth or the
performance of its adjusted net asset value per share against
external benchmarks, have now been achieved. For options
granted from 1998 to 2001 under the 1998 scheme, the target
requires the company’s adjusted net asset value per share to
outperform either the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum, or the
average of the increases in the FTSE 250 and the FT Investment
Companies indices, over any consecutive three ﬁnancial years
prior to expiry. For options granted in 2002 and 2003, the
performance target requires the company’s adjusted net asset
value per share to outperform either the Retail Price Index by 3%
per annum, or the FTSE All-Share index, over any consecutive
three ﬁnancial years prior to expiry.
For options granted in 2004, the performance target is such
that 50% of the shares comprised in an option will vest if the
company’s net asset value per share outperforms the Retail Price
Index by 3% per annum over the relevant measurement period,
with the other 50% vesting if the company’s net asset value per
share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over the relevant
measurement period. The performance measure has to be
achieved either over the ﬁrst three years, or over the ﬁrst four
years, after the date of grant. If the performance measure is not
achieved four years after the date of grant, the options will lapse.
The performance targets have been met for all options granted
under the 1998 scheme from 1998 to 2002. The Remuneration
Committee has selected the targets referred to above because 
it believed they provided an appropriate benchmark of the
company’s longer term performance.
The company will prepare its accounts under International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) commencing with the 
year ending 31 March 2006. The principle differences between
IFRS and UK GAAP have been identiﬁed and, whilst IFRS will
result in some change to reported net asset values, these are 
not expected to vary materially from those which would have
been reported under UK GAAP . Accordingly, the Remuneration
Committee does not expect the adoption of IFRS to have a
material effect on the performance targets for options already
granted under the 1998 scheme but, if necessary, will make
adjustments to the extent considered appropriate to ensure that
the basis of calculation of net asset value per share is consistent
over the relevant performance measurement period.
Included in Mr Ingram’s options granted on 5 July 2002 are
options over 83,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme 
and on the following special performance-related terms. As in the
case of options granted under the 1998 scheme, only one-third 
of the shares under these special options are exercisable three
years after grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming
exercisable six years after grant. The special options are subject
to a stretching performance condition requiring Caledonia’s TSR
to outperform the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index (‘Index’) over
the measurement period, which commenced on the date of
grant. A tranche will vest in full if Caledonia’s TSR exceeds that 
of the Index by an average of at least 2% per annum over the
relevant measurement period. If Caledonia’s TSR equals that of
the Index, none of that tranche will be exercisable and there will
be proportionate vesting of a tranche if Caledonia’s TSR exceeds
that of the Index by an average of between zero and 2% per
annum. For the one-third tranche, the performance measure 
will be ﬁrst applied three years after grant, with two re-test
opportunities four and ﬁve years after grant. For the two-thirds
tranche, the performance measure will be ﬁrst applied ﬁve years
after grant, with two re-test opportunities six and seven years
after grant. If Mr Ingram remains in service until retirement at age
62, the option will remain exercisable until ten years from grant if
the performance conditions are met. Otherwise, Mr Ingram must
normally be in employment to be able to exercise the options.
The shares required to satisfy Mr Ingram’s special options will be
transferred from the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share
Trust. The remaining terms of the special options are based on
the rules of the 1998 scheme, and include provisions that any
beneﬁts obtained from the special options will not be pensionable
and that the terms of the special options will not normally be
capable of amendment to the advantage of the option holder
without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Included in Mr May’s options granted on 20 November 2003 are
options over 28,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme.
The performance conditions and other terms of these options 
are the same as those set out above for Mr Ingram (save that 
Mr May’s options are not subject to preservation on retirement 
in the manner described above for Mr Ingram).
At 31 March 2005, the market price of the company’s shares was
1367p (2004 – 1017p) and the range during the year was 1000p 
to 1411p.
Statement on directors’ service contracts and non-executive
directors’ letters of appointment
Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group
Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details
of which are summarised below:
Date of
Name contract Notice period Unexpired term
P N Buckley 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
T C W Ingram 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
J H Cartwright 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
The Hon C W Cayzer 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months
J M May 01.09.03 12 months Rolling 12 months
Directors’ service contracts contain provisions whereby the
company may in its discretion terminate the contract without
notice and make a payment in lieu of notice to the director and
whereby a liquidated sum is payable by the company in the event
of termination within one year following a change of control. Any
such payment in lieu of notice or liquidated sum would be
equivalent to no more than one year’s total emoluments.
The service contracts of the directors, other than Mr Ingram’s 
and Mr May’s, also contain provisions whereby, in the event of 
a payment in lieu of notice or payment of a liquidated sum on
termination, the director concerned would also be entitled to an
increase in his pensionable service equivalent to the unexpired
period of notice under his contract.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but 
are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for
termination without notice or compensation.
Executive directors’ service contracts and non-executive
directors’ appointment letters are available for inspection 
at the registered ofﬁce of the company.
The directors’ remuneration report was approved by the board
on 19 May 2005 and signed on its behalf by:
M E T Davies
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 40
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Corporate governance report
The board recognises the importance of good corporate
governance and this report describes how the company has
applied the principles of good corporate governance as set 
out in section one of the Combined Code issued in July 2003 
(the ‘Combined Code’).
Statement of compliance
The directors consider that the company has complied
throughout the year with the provisions set out in section one 
of the Combined Code, other than as follows.
The composition of the board did not comply throughout the year
with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code, which requires that,
except for smaller companies, at least half the board, excluding the
chairman, should comprise non-executive directors determined
by the board to be independent. The Remuneration and Audit
Committees did not comply with provisions B.2.1 and C.3.1
respectively throughout the year, which require that all members
of such committees should be independent non-executive directors.
The company also did not comply throughout the year with
provision C.3.4 of the Combined Code, which requires audit
committees to review arrangements by which staff of a company
may, in conﬁdence, raise concerns about possible improprieties
in matters of ﬁnancial reporting or other matters (‘whistleblowing
arrangements’) and to ensure that appropriate follow up
procedures are in place, as such whistleblowing arrangements
were only formally approved by the Audit Committee on 
24 March 2005. The reasons for the company’s non-compliance 
with these provisions are explained below.
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is responsible for the group’s objectives
and policies and the management of its resources. It has eleven
scheduled meetings a year, but also convenes at additional times
when required. The board has adopted a Schedule of Authorities
which sets out matters speciﬁcally reserved to it for decision.
Such matters include the approval of strategy, the annual budget,
material capital and revenue transactions and changes in business
activities, treasury policies, risk management and internal policy
limits relating to the company’s investment activities. The Schedule
of Authorities also sets out the authorities that are delegated to
board committees and to executive management.
All directors receive appropriate and timely information to ensure
that they are properly briefed in advance of boards meetings and
have unlimited access to the advice and services of the company
secretary and other senior management should further information
be required. Non-executive directors have access to independent
professional advice at the company’s expense where they judge
it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as directors.
Appointment, induction and training
All new directors appointed by the board are required to seek
election by shareholders at the next general meeting of the
company following their appointment and subsequently all
directors are required to retire by rotation at least every three
years. Any non-executive director who has served on the board
for over nine years is subject to annual re-election. On appointment,
new directors are offered induction and training considered
appropriate by the board and subsequently as necessary. The
company secretary provides details of, and where requested
arranges attendance at, external courses to assist in directors’
professional development.
Board composition
The directors who served during the year and subsequent
changes to the board are described in the directors’ report 
on page 31.
The board currently comprises 12 directors. Excluding the
chairman, six of the directors are executive and ﬁve non-executive.
The non-executive directors considered to be independent are
Messrs C M Allen-Jones, M E T Davies, R Goblet d’Alviella and 
D G F Thompson. Mr Goblet d’Alviella is chief executive ofﬁcer of
Soﬁna sa, which has a 4.7% shareholding in Caledonia, however
the board does not consider this level of shareholding to be
signiﬁcant in judging his independence. Collectively, the directors
throughout the year brought a wide range of experience, skills
and expertise to the stewardship of the company. The individual
biographies of the current directors appear on pages 28 and 29.
The board is led by the chairman, Mr P N Buckley, whose
responsibilities have been agreed and set out in writing in the
Schedule of Authorities adopted by the board. The chairman’s
primary role is to ensure that the board and individual directors
are able to operate efﬁciently by setting the agenda, style and
tone of board discussions to promote constructive debate and
effective decision making. He has overall responsibility for
monitoring the development needs of the board as a whole and
of individual directors and for ensuring that the performance of
the board, its committees and individual directors are evaluated
at least once a year. In conjunction with the chief executive, the
chairman is responsible for ensuring effective communication
with shareholders and that all board members develop an
understanding of the views of investors. This is primarily
achieved by board brieﬁngs following meetings with signiﬁcant
shareholders and private client stockbrokers, some of which are
also attended by the senior independent non-executive director.
The chief executive, Mr T C W Ingram, heads the executive
management team and is primarily responsible for the
implementation of the board’s policies and strategies and for
managing the activities of the company other than in relation to
those matters speciﬁcally reserved to the board or delegated to
its committees. His responsibilities have also been agreed and
set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities adopted by the
board. Except where the board gives speciﬁc direction otherwise,
the chief executive may delegate any of those matters to other
members of the executive management team or to executive
committees, but ultimately he is accountable to the board for the
overall performance of the company.
A strong independent non-executive representation on the 
board is headed by the senior independent non-executive
director, Mr C M Allen-Jones. The role of the non-executive
directors, as set out in their letters of appointment, is to challenge
constructively, and contribute to, the development of strategy; 
to scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed
goals and objectives and monitor their performance; to satisfy
themselves that ﬁnancial information is accurate and that
ﬁnancial controls and systems of risk management are robust
and defensible; to determine appropriate levels of remuneration
for executive directors; and to have a prime role in senior
management appointments and succession planning.
The composition of the board is such that, throughout the 
year, the company did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the
Combined Code. The board however believes that the main
objectives of board balance and independence set out in the
Combined Code – that the board should include a balance 
of executive and non-executive directors, and in particular
independent non-executive directors, such that no individual 
or small group of individuals can dominate the board’s decision
taking – are met. 41
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
The board is currently broadly comprised of three categories 
of directors – the four independent non-executive directors;
four directors (the chairman and three executive directors,
Messrs C W Cayzer, J M B Cayzer-Colvin and W P Wyatt) who 
are involved in the affairs of The Cayzer Trust Company Ltd
(‘Cayzer Trust’), Caledonia’s largest shareholder; and three 
other executive directors (Messrs T C W Ingram, J H Cartwright
and J M May). Mr J R H Loudon does not fall into any of these
categories as his ten year tenure as a non-executive director
prevents his meeting the Combined Code criteria for independence
(although his length of experience with the company, as well as
his business career, are both considered signiﬁcant assets by the
board) and, although a member of the wider Cayzer family, he is
not involved in the affairs of Cayzer Trust. 
In addition to the balance on the board brought by these
categories, the Governance Committee, comprising solely
independent non-executive directors, was established in 2003 to
keep under review corporate governance and conﬂict of interest
issues relating to the company and the board and has authority
to recommend that any director abstains from participating in any
decision of the board, or any board committee, where it believes
that a conﬂict of interest could, or could be perceived to, arise.
The board believes that this structure ensures the necessary 
level of board balance demanded by the Combined Code and
safeguards against any individual or small group of individuals
being able to dominate the board’s decision taking. Whilst not in
strict compliance with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code, the
board believes this structure is appropriate in the context of a
company with a large controlling shareholder whose stability and
support is fundamental to Caledonia’s business model as a long
term, supportive investor, and is therefore in the best interests of
all shareholders.
As stated previously, the Combined Code requires that the
members of the Remuneration and Audit Committees should all 
be independent non-executive directors. However , Mr Loudon’s
membership of these Committees, given that he is not
considered independent by virtue of his length of service as 
a non-executive director, means that provisions B.2.1 and C.3.1
of the Combined Code are not met. However, because of his
attributes described above, the board considers his membership
of these Committees to be in the best interests of the company.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain speciﬁc areas of responsibility
to the following standing committees, the terms of reference of
which are published on the company’s website and are available
from the company secretary on written request. The current
membership of these committees is noted on page 73.
The Nomination Committee, chaired by Mr P N Buckley, is
responsible for the regular review of the structure, size and
composition (including the skills, knowledge and experience) 
of the board and for giving consideration to succession planning
for executive directors and, if requested by the board, for other
senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using external
search consultants where necessary, candidates to ﬁll board
vacancies as and when they arise and for making recommendations
to the board in relation thereto and for keeping under review 
the leadership needs of the company, both executive and 
non-executive. It reviews annually the time required of 
non-executive directors and ensures that they receive formal
letters of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of
them in terms of time commitment, committee service and
involvement outside board meetings.
The Nomination Committee met three times during the year in
order to undertake a formal review of the size and composition 
of the board following the annual board performance evaluation
and to make recommendations for the appointments of Messrs 
R Goblet d’Alviella, J M B Cayzer-Colvin and W P Wyatt to the
board. The Committee did not use an external search consultant
or open advertising in the appointment of Mr Goblet d’Alviella as
a non-executive director, as he became known to the board as a
consequence of Soﬁna’s acquisition of a 4.7% shareholding in
the company. The Nomination Committee was therefore able 
to identify at ﬁrst hand that his considerable knowledge and
experience in corporate ﬁnance and investment management,
particularly in Continental Europe, would provide a valuable
additional resource to the board.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr M E T Davies, 
is responsible for the review of executive remuneration policy.
Within that policy, the Remuneration Committee determines the
remuneration packages of executive directors and reviews those
of other senior executive management. It is also responsible 
for the design and grant of awards under the company’s share
incentive schemes and for the determination of the policy for 
and scope of pension arrangements, service agreements,
termination payments and compensation commitments for
executive directors and, if requested by the board, for other
senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the year and
undertook a thorough review of senior executive remuneration,
advised by external consultants appointed by the Remuneration
Committee, T owers Perrin, to ensure that the company’s
remuneration policies remain sufﬁcient to enable it to recruit and
retain able executives and that its performance related rewards
continue to be competitive. Further details of the conclusions 
of this review and a description of the work of the Remuneration
Committee are included in the directors’ remuneration report 
set out on pages 33 to 39.
The Audit Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones, is
responsible for the monitoring of the integrity of the ﬁnancial
statements of the company and any announcements relating 
to the company’s ﬁnancial performance and for reviewing any
signiﬁcant ﬁnancial reporting judgements contained in them. 
It also reviews the company’s systems of internal ﬁnancial 
control and considers annually whether an internal audit function
is required. The Audit Committee believes that, in the context 
of the company’s business as an investment trust, the key issues
on which it has to satisfy itself are the integrity of the application
of the company’s policy for the valuation of its investments,
particularly those which are unquoted, and the robustness of 
the group’s internal financial controls. The valuations of the
company’s unquoted investments are subject to formal six
monthly reviews by an internal challenge committee, independent
of the investment executives and observed by the external
auditors, and a formal report on the effectiveness of the group’s
internal ﬁnancial control is prepared annually for the board by the
group ﬁnancial controller. It is the Audit Committee’s current
opinion that, in view of these control processes, the size of the
entities controlled by Caledonia and the relatively straightforward
control considerations in relation to other investments, a separate
internal audit function is not necessary. 42

Corporate governance report
continued 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing the
establishment of appropriate whistleblowing arrangements 
and for ensuring that any concerns raised by staff are properly
investigated and appropriate action taken. Formal whistleblowing
arrangements were approved by the Audit Committee on 
24 March 2005 and therefore, given that such arrangements 
were not in place throughout the year, the company has only
fully complied with provision C.3.4 of the Combined Code from
that date.
It is also the Audit Committee’s responsibility to review and
monitor the independence and objectivity of the external auditors
and the effectiveness of the audit process and to develop and
implement policy on the engagement of the external auditor to
supply non-audit services. In this regard, the Audit Committee
has approved a schedule of speciﬁc non-audit activities which
may not be undertaken by the external auditors, within the broad
principles that the external auditors should not audit their own
work, should not make management decisions on behalf of the
company, should not be put into the role of advocate for the
company and that no mutuality of interest should be created
between the company and the external auditors. The Audit
Committee believes that, by applying these principles, the
objectivity and independence of the auditors is maintained,
notwithstanding that non-audit work may be undertaken. 
On an annual basis, the Audit Committee considers and 
makes a recommendation to the board as to the appointment, 
re-appointment or removal of the external auditors.
The Combined Code recommends that at least one member 
of the Audit Committee should have recent and relevant ﬁnancial
experience. The Audit Committee considers that Mr J R H Loudon,
who was formerly group ﬁnance director of Blue Circle Industries,
has such financial experience. The chairman of the Audit
Committee, Mr C M Allen-Jones, is also a member of the Financial
Reporting Council.
The Audit Committee met four times during the year, twice
without any of the executive directors present. During the 
year, the business considered by the Audit Committee included:
■ The scope of the annual audit and agreement with the external
auditors of the key areas of focus.
■ The reports from the external auditors concerning their audit 
of the annual ﬁnancial statements of the company and their
review of the interim report.
■ The ﬁnancial disclosures contained in the annual and interim
reports to shareholders.
■ Reports from management on the effectiveness of the
company’s system of internal ﬁnancial control.
■ The need or otherwise for an internal audit function.
■ The independence and objectivity of the external auditors,
including their system of quality controls and the level and
nature of non-audit services provided by them.
■ The performance of the external auditors and of the Audit
Committee itself.
■ The company’s preparation for the implementation of
International Financial Reporting Standards.
■ The company’s compliance with the requirements for Inland
Revenue approval of its investment trust status.
■ The development and implementation of formal 
whistleblowing arrangements.
The Governance Committee, chaired by Mr C M Allen-Jones,
keeps under review corporate governance issues relating to the
company and is responsible for the monitoring and review of the
ability of each director to act in the interests of shareholders as 
a whole and to exercise independence of judgement free from
relationships or circumstances which are likely to, or could
appear to, affect his judgement. Where it concludes that such
criteria are not satisﬁed with regard to any director, it may make
such recommendations to the board as it may think ﬁt, including
that the director abstains from participating in any decision of the
board or any of its committees on the matter concerned. The
Governance Committee met twice during the year.

Board evaluation
Since the year end, a formal evaluation of the effectiveness 
of the board and its committees and of the performance of
individual directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005
has been undertaken. The evaluation of the board as a whole 
and of its committees was led by the chairman and was
conducted by inviting individual board members to complete 
a questionnaire regarding the operation and effectiveness of the
board as a whole and of its committees, the responses to which
were collated by the company secretary and discussed. The
evaluation of the performance of the chairman was led by the
senior independent non-executive director and involved private
discussion with other members of the board of their views on his
performance, the results of which were then considered at a
meeting of the non-executive directors without the chairman
present. The evaluation of the performance of the chief executive
was undertaken by the chairman and the non-executive directors.
The performance of the non-executive directors was reviewed 
the chairman, the chief executive and the senior independent
non-executive director , with the senior independent non-executive
director absent in respect of his own performance appraisal, 
and included the completion of self-assessment questionnaires
by the non-executive directors. The performance of the executive
directors, other than the chief executive, was undertaken by 
the Remuneration Committee as part of the annual salary 
review process. 43
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
The results of the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its
committees for the year ended 31 March 2005 were presented 
in a report to the board. The Nomination Committee reviewed 
the size, structure and composition of the board in the light of 
this report.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s system of
internal control, although the review of internal ﬁnancial controls
is delegated to the Audit Committee. The group’s system of
internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It is recognised that
such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The board
conﬁrms that the system of internal control operated by the
group accords with the guidance issued in September 1999 by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (the
Turnbull Committee guidelines) and has been in place throughout
the year and up to the date of approval of these accounts.
Major business risks facing group companies, including social,
ethical and environmental issues, are identiﬁed in conjunction
with operating management and procedures agreed to control
these as appropriate. Risks facing the group’s material
investments are identiﬁed and evaluated through board
representation or regular contact.
Key risks identiﬁed are regularly monitored at group level by
members of the executive management committee, who have
clear mandates to assess and report on risk in their particular
areas of responsibility. From these assessments, an ongoing 
risk proﬁle of the group’s activities is updated half-yearly and
reviewed by the board. The board is also provided quarterly with
a list of the key risk issues identiﬁed by executive management 
at that particular time. All of the company’s larger investments 
are reviewed at least annually by the board and the smaller
portfolio holdings reviewed at least annually by the executive
investment committee.
Speciﬁc control procedures are in place to ensure that 
the company continually monitors and complies with the
requirements for investment trust status. The board receives
monthly compliance reports evidencing that the company is
meeting the various tests for investment trust status and also
conﬁrming that the investment activities undertaken by executive
management are within the overall policy limits set by the board.
A compliance committee, comprising the company secretary
(chairman), the ﬁnance director and three associate directors has
been established, which meets weekly to review the company’s
ongoing compliance with its investment trust status and to
monitor and approve all investment activity from an investment
trust compliance perspective. The group ﬁnancial controller also
attends such meetings.
Financial performance is continuously measured by comparing
total shareholder returns and net asset value movements against
the FTSE All-Share index. Performance statistics are reported
monthly to the board. Income and expenses are monitored by the
board against an approved annual budget and regularly updated
forecasts. Valuations of unquoted investments are subject to a
rigorous six monthly review process undertaken by a challenge
committee independent of the investment executives and
observed by the external auditors.
Since the year end, the directors have conducted their annual
review of the operation and effectiveness of the group’s system
of internal control.
Going concern
The directors conﬁrm that they are satisﬁed that the group has
adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders
in order to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The
chief executive and the ﬁnance director seek meetings with
larger institutional shareholders and private client stockbrokers
after the announcement of year end and interim results. The
chairman and senior independent non-executive director also
attend some of these meetings. The annual general meeting 
also provides a forum for investors to meet the directors, both
formally and informally.
The chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available to
answer questions at the annual general meeting of the company. 44
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Directors’ responsibility statement
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial
statements for each ﬁnancial year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group as 
at the end of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss for that
period. In preparing those ﬁnancial statements, the directors 
are required to:
■ Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently.
■ Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent.
■ State whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the ﬁnancial statements.
■ Prepare the ﬁnancial statements on a going concern basis

Independent auditors’ report
to the members of Caledonia Investments plc
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements on pages 46 to 71. We
have also audited the information in the directors’ remuneration
report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a 
body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to 
the company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. T o the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and
the directors’ remuneration report. As described on page 44, this
includes responsibility for preparing the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting
standards. Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are
established in the United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing
Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁnancial
statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁnancial
statements and the parts of the directors’ remuneration report to
be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the ﬁnancial statements, if
the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for
our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement on
pages 40 to 43 reﬂects the company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Code speciﬁed for our review by the
Listing Rules, and we report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report,
including the corporate governance report and the unaudited
part of the directors’ remuneration report, and consider whether 
it is consistent with the audited ﬁnancial statements. We consider
the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
ﬁnancial statements. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes 
an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the group’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary 
in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable
assurance that the financial statements and the parts of the
directors’ remuneration report to be audited are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
ﬁnancial statements and the parts of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ The ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 March 2005 
and of the proﬁt of the group for the year then ended.
■ The ﬁnancial statements and the parts of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost
convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments,
and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Investment trust companies generally report under the Statement
of Recommended Practice – Financial Statements of Investment
Trust Companies (‘IT SORP’), dated January 2003 and published
by the Association of Investment Trust Companies. The IT SORP
assumes, however, that an investment trust is also an investment
company and can take advantage of the special provisions given
to investment companies under company law and accounting
standards. Caledonia is not an investment company and, in these
circumstances, the IT SORP states that an investment trust
company should prepare its financial statements in accordance
with the normal rules contained in Schedule 4 to the Companies
Act 1985 and accounting standards.
Caledonia recognises, however, that presenting information 
that is comparable with other investment trusts is important to
investors. It therefore augments its financial statements with the
information and disclosures required by the IT SORP in respect 
of the performance of the holding company. This is because the
company balance sheet (unlike that of the group) can reflect full
net asset value, and the movement in this figure is a key measure
of Caledonia’s performance. A statement of total return on an IT
SORP basis is also presented to explain this movement.
The group has implemented UITF 37 ‘Purchases and Sales of
Own Shares’ and UITF 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’, which
require the cost of shares in the company held by the group to be
shown as deductions from shareholders’ funds. Previously, own
shares were shown as fixed asset investments. This change has
not materially affected previously reported profits and losses, but
comparative figures have been restated in the balance sheet and
related notes.
The group has also implemented UITF 17 (Revised 2003)
‘Employee Share Schemes’, which requires the minimum profit
and loss charge for share options granted to be determined as
the intrinsic value. Previously, the charge was based on either
intrinsic value or, where purchases of shares were made by 
an ESOP trust at fair value, by reference to the cost of shares
available for the award less any contributions payable by the
employees. The implementation of the revised UITF 17 had 
no material impact on the group’s previously reported profits 
and losses.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the results 
of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up 
to 31 March each year. The results of subsidiary undertakings
acquired or sold during the year are included in the financial
statements from the date of acquisition or to the date of sale. 
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the
profit and loss account of the company has not been included 
in these financial statements.
In the company financial statements, investments in subsidiary
undertakings are stated in accordance with the ‘valuation of
investments’ and ‘income’ policies outlined below. Subsidiary
undertakings include equity and loan interest elements.
Joint ventures and associated undertakings
Investments in which the group has a long term interest and 
over whose operating and financial policies it exerts significant
influence, but which are held as part of an investment portfolio,
the value of which is through their marketable value as part 
of a basket of investments, are not regarded as joint ventures 
or associated undertakings. The directors believe that equity
accounting for such investments, that may come within the
Companies Act definition of associated undertakings, would not
give a true and fair view of the income from investment activities
of the group, since this is better measured by the inclusion of
dividends and interest income. It is impracticable to quantify the
effects of this departure. The treatment adopted is in accordance
with FRS 9 ‘Associates and Joint Ventures’.
Valuation of investments
Investments are included according to the following guidelines,
which have been drawn up having regard to the British Venture
Capital Association (‘BVCA’) guidelines.
Quoted investments, for which an active market exists, are
valued at mid-market price.
Unquoted equity investments are valued by the directors on a
number of bases depending on the nature of each investment.
Early-stage investments will generally be valued at cost, less 
a provision if performance is substantially below expectations,
for one year or until the investment starts to earn significant
maintainable profits. Investments earning significant
maintainable profits are generally valued using an earnings
multiple, based on current year profit after tax and an earnings
multiple for a comparable quoted company or sector average. 
A discount will be applied to recognise the absence of a ready
market on which the holding can be sold. The liquidity discount
will normally be 30%, but may be reduced to 10% if an initial
public offering or realisation is imminent. For some asset-backed
businesses, such as where there is a significant property element,
the earnings multiple method of valuation is inappropriate, and 
a net realisable asset basis is applied. It may also be appropriate
to use the net realisable asset basis of valuation if this results in 
a higher valuation than the earnings method, or the company is
incurring losses. A third party valuation, such as an independent
valuation report or a material arm’s length transaction, will
provide prima facie evidence of fair value and will usually take
precedence over other methods.
Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are valued 
at the lower of cost or recoverable amount. Investments in
unquoted funds are valued at the net asset value of the fund, 
with an appropriate adjustment where the net asset value has 
not been calculated in accordance with BVCA guidelines.
Realised surpluses or deficits on the disposal of investments 
are taken to the realised capital reserve of the company, 
and unrealised surpluses and deficits on the revaluation of
investments are taken to the unrealised capital reserve as
explained further below. 52
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Accounting policies
continued
Income
Dividends receivable from equity shares are brought into account
on the ex-dividend date or, where no ex-dividend date is quoted,
when the company’s right to receive payment is established.
Fixed returns on non-equity shares and debt securities are
recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the
effective yield on the shares and debt securities. Other returns
are recognised when the right to the return is established.
Expenses
Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are
charged to the revenue account except that expenses which 
are incidental to the acquisition or disposal of an investment are
included within the cost of the investment or deducted from the
disposal proceeds on sale of the investment.
Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year 
and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing
differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting
and taxation purposes. Any charge for taxation on the disposal 
of investments is dealt with in the capital reserve.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance
sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. In particular,
FRS 19 does not allow deferred tax to be provided in respect of
investment revaluations. No discounting is applied.
Foreign currency
In the company financial statements, transactions denominated
in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual
exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where
appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange
contract. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange
prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of
exchange in a related forward exchange contact. Any gain or loss
arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date
of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the
capital reserve or in the revenue account depending on whether
the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
In the consolidated financial statements, assets, liabilities and
results of subsidiaries accounting in foreign currencies are
translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the
balance sheet date. The exchange differences arising on
retranslating opening net assets are taken directly to reserves. 
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss
account, with the exception of differences on the revaluation 
of fixed asset investments denominated in foreign currencies,
which are taken directly to the revaluation reserve.
Capital reserves
The following are accounted for in the realised capital reserve 
of the company:
■ Gains and losses on the realisation of investments.
■ Realised exchange differences of a capital nature.
■ Expenses and finance costs charged to this reserve in
accordance with the above policies.
■ Realised gains and losses on transactions undertaken to
hedge an exposure of a capital nature.
The following are accounted for in the unrealised capital reserve
of the company:
■ Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held 
at the year end.
■ Unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature.
■ Unrealised gains and losses on transactions undertaken 
to hedge an exposure of a capital nature.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and amortised 
over its estimated useful economic life. Negative goodwill arising
on acquisitions is capitalised and written back through the profit
and loss account in the period in which the non-monetary assets
acquired are recovered.
Up to 31 March 1998, depending on the circumstances of each
acquisition, goodwill arising on acquisitions was either set off
directly against reserves or amortised through the profit and loss
account over the directors’ estimate of its useful life. Goodwill
previously eliminated against reserves was not reinstated on
implementation of FRS 10.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than
freehold land and assets in the course of construction, at rates
calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of
each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold and leasehold properties 50 years or the period 
of lease if shorter
Plant and machinery 5 to 25 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 to 10 years 53
Caledonia Investments plc
Annual report 2005
Employee share trust
The cost of shares in the company held by an employee share
trust is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’
funds, until the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
Treasury shares and own shares held by the group
The cost of shares in the company held by the the group is
accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders’ funds.
No profits or losses are recognised in respect of dealings in own
shares and no loss is recognised when share values reduce.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure 
to foreign exchange and interest rate risks and are not used for
trading purposes. Instruments qualify for hedge accounting
where the underlying asset or liability has characteristics which
can be directly related to the instrument transacted.
The sterling equivalent of forward foreign exchange contracts
used to hedge foreign currency investments are recorded in
debtors or creditors at valuation. Movements in the valuation 
of these contracts are included initially in the unrealised capital
reserve of the company or the revaluation reserve of the group.
When the underlying investment is sold, or the contracts mature,
the unrealised gains or losses on these contracts are recognised
in the realised capital reserve of the company or the profit and
loss account of the group.
Premiums paid on interest rate caps and collars are recognised
on the balance sheet as debtors. The options are not revalued to
fair value in the balance sheet. Premiums on the options, net of
any realised gains, are taken to interest payable, spread evenly
over the life of the cap and collar.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis and includes
production overheads as appropriate. Net realisable value 
is the estimated price at which stocks could be sold in the 
normal course of business, after allowing for all further costs 
of completion and sale.
Payments received on account are deducted from work in
progress. Where such receipts exceed the valuation, the excess
is taken to creditors.
Leases
Rentals payable and receivable under operating leases are
charged or credited to the profit and loss account on a straight
line basis over the terms of the leases.
Pensions
The group principally operates defined benefits pension schemes
in the UK, USA and Germany. Contributions to the schemes are
charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost 
of pensions over the working lives of the employees within the
schemes. In addition, contributions are made to grouped
personal pension plans and other arrangements, which are
charged to the profit and loss account when payable. The
transition rules of FRS 17 have been applied in drawing up 
these financial statements.
Long term contracts
Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried out 
if the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the
proportion of the work completed at the year end and full
provision is made for all foreseeable losses.
Turnover
Turnover represents the amounts derived from the provision 
of goods and services which fall within the group’s ordinary
activities, stated net of value added tax. 54

The capital tax assessed for the period relates to gains that were not covered by the exemption from corporation tax on chargeable
gains available to investment trusts.
Factors that may affect future tax charges
No unprovided deferred tax has been disclosed for 2005 (2004 – £nil) as the company expects to be able to conduct its affairs so as 
to meet the requirements for investment trust status, thereby not being liable to corporation tax on chargeable gains. Deferred tax 
on revaluations is not permitted, in accordance with FRS 19.
Exceptional items
The tax effect in the profit and loss account relating to the exceptional items, described in note 5, was £nil (2004 – £0.3m credit). 57

The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, used to calculate the company’s returns per ordinary share,
excluded shares held during the year by the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust and shares held in treasury.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, used to calculate the group’s earnings per ordinary share,
also excluded shares held during the year by a subsidiary undertaking.
The difference between the basic and diluted number of ordinary shares was the potential dilutive effect of share options.

The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights. The deferred ordinary shares carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p
per share or £4,000 in aggregate for all such shares currently in issue. On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary
shares carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only after holders of the ordinary shares have received the
sum of £100,000 in respect of each such ordinary share. All of the deferred shares are held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly owned
subsidiary undertaking of Caledonia.
By a special resolution of the company passed on 11 June 2004 and confirmed by an order of the High Court of Justice in England 
and Wales dated 29 June 2004, the authorised and issued share capital of the company was reduced by £420,384, being the nominal
amount of the 8,407,676 ordinary shares on which shareholders elected to receive the special dividend referred to in note 20, which
were then cancelled.
Authority to purchase own shares
On 11 June 2004, the company obtained shareholders’ approval for the authority to make market purchases of up to 7,260,000 of its 
own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of the ordinary share capital then in issue, at a price not more than 5% greater than 
the average of the middle market quotations for such ordinary shares during the five business days preceding any such purchase. 
The authority expires on 1 January 2006 or, if earlier, at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting.
On the same date, independent shareholders gave their approval for a waiver by the Panel on T akeovers and Mergers of the obligation 
that could arise on the Cayzer concert party under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers to make a general offer for
Caledonia on the implementation by the company of the above authority to purchase its own shares. The approval was subject to 
a maximum percentage of voting rights held by the concert party not exceeding 49.9% of the issued ordinary share capital of the
company as a result of the exercise by the company of the authority to purchase its own ordinary shares. This waiver expires on 
11 June 2005.
Pursuant to the above authority, the company purchased 100,000 of its ordinary shares on 22 July 2004 at a price of 1015p per share.
These shares are held in treasury, as set out in note 21. 65

Prior year adjustments for UITF 37 and UITF 38
The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 has been restated following the adoption of UITF 37 ‘Purchases and Sales of Own Shares’ and
UITF 38 ‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’. The impact on the company at 31 March 2004 has been to reduce fixed asset investments by
£3.9m, being the carrying value of shares held by the employee share trust, increase debtors by £0.3m, being assets in the employee
share trust, increase the revenue reserve by £0.6m, being the provision charged against own shares and other assets held by the
employee share trust, and deduct the net £4.2m from shareholders’ funds. The impact on the group is the same as for the company except 
for the restatement of debtors. In addition, £0.5m has been deducted from fixed asset investments, £0.1m written off the revaluation
reserve and £0.4m deducted from shareholders’ funds, being the book cost of own shares held by a subsidiary undertaking. 67

31 Related party transactions
Transactions with related parties, as defined by FRS 8 are described below.
Administration fees of £0.1m (2004 – £0.1m) were receivable from The Cayzer Trust Company Ltd, which held 33.3% of the issued
ordinary share capital of the company at 31 March 2005 (2004 – 37.8% held by Cayzer Ltd, formerly named The Cayzer Trust Company
Ltd). £4.7m of the variable rate unsecured loan notes 2010 was held by Cayzer Ltd in 2004, and repaid during the year, on which £0.2m
of interest was paid in 2004. Dividends were payable to Cayzer family members, trusts and controlled companies who, together, held
45.7% of the issued ordinary share capital of Caledonia at 31 March 2005 (2004 – 49.3%).
Included in normal business transactions was a management fee of £0.1m (2004 – £0.1m) payable to Landsdown Ltd, which owned 25%
of St Lawrence Properties Ltd, and in which the group has a 50% interest.
Messrs J M B Cayzer-Colvin and W P Wyatt, relatives of certain directors of the company during the year, are directors of some 
group companies.
Cayzer Ltd and certain other members of the Cayzer concert party elected to receive the special divided paid on 2 July 2004 and for
those shares on which the special dividend was paid to be cancelled pursuant to the Court approved reduction of capital. The total
amount paid to these members of the Cayzer concert party was £65.2m, in respect of which 6,223,214 shares were cancelled.
32 Pensions
The group operates a number of pension schemes in the UK, USA and Germany. The principal schemes, based in the UK, are the
Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes. These schemes are of the defined benefits type, with assets 
held in separate trustee administered funds. Contributions to the schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of 
the schemes’ actuaries. In addition, contributions are made to independently operated personal pension plans.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, the total pension cost for the group was £3.4m (2004 – £2.5m).
Pension cost relating to the principal UK defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries,
using the attained age and projected unit methods. The latest actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh
Crystal pension schemes (which are now closed to new members) were at 31 March 2003, 1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March
2002 respectively. The main actuarial assumptions made in the valuations were that long term investment returns would be 0.25% to
3.60% per annum higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries and that pensions would increase at the lesser of 5% per
annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index.
The market value of the assets on the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations for the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh
Crystal schemes totalled £10.5m, £6.9m, £3.1m and £4.6m respectively. The levels of funding for the schemes shown by the valuations,
being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of accrued benefits at the valuation date, allowing for expected future
increases in salaries, were 62% for Caledonia, 67% for Sterling, 53% for Amber and 91% for Edinburgh Crystal. T o address these
funding shortfalls, revised schedules of contributions have been entered into between the trustees and the participating employers 
of each of the schemes on the advice of the schemes’ actuaries. The schedules of contributions, other than in relation to Edinburgh
Crystal, include lump sum payments in addition to increased percentages of pensionable salaries.
The above actuarial valuations showed an aggregated deficit of £13.0m. 70

FRS17 disclosures
Although the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 ‘Accounting for Pension Costs’, the following
transitional disclosures are made in accordance with FRS 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’.
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes. The principal schemes, based in the UK and USA, are the
Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes. Where appropriate, this note presents an aggregation 
of information for these schemes.
Full actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal schemes were carried out at 31 March 2003, 
1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March 2002 respectively. FRS 17 based analyses of the schemes at 31 March 2005 have been
prepared by independent qualified actuaries.
All of the principal schemes are now closed to new members. As a consequence, under the projected unit method, the current service
costs will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in valuing the schemes’ liabilities were as follows:
2005 2004 2003
% %%
Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 4.5 4.3
Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 3.0
Discount rate 5.4 5.6 5.6
Inflation rate 3.0 3.0 3.0
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the
timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes’ assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change
before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes’ liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods
and thus inherently uncertain, were as follows:

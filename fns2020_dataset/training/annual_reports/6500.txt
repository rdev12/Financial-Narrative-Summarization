ENERGY 
CHAMPION
As the largest independent oil producer and 
holder of reserves in the KRI, we aim to 
have a positive and sustainable impact on 
the region both by growing the production 
of the hydrocarbons that fuel the economy 
and directly supporting the communities 
in which we operate by improving 
infrastructure and providing opportunities.

+58% 
increase in oil production
CONNECTING 
RESOURCES  
TO MARKETS
In 2014, Genel’s oil production rose by 58%, and the 
completion of the Kurdistan Regional Government’s 
export infrastructure has allowed increasing amounts 
of this production to be sold by the KRG on the 
international market.
GENEL ENERGY
2 Annual Report 2014 3
A watershed year for the KRI oil industry
KRI crude liftings from the T urkish port of Ceyhan have become 
regular and sales predictable.
The commencement of oil exports through the KRI-Turkey pipeline by the 
KRG was a landmark for the KRI oil industry. The ability to market oil through 
Ceyhan and receive international prices confirmed the status of the region as 
an important oil province, and revenues help to ensure a strong and prosperous 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
Exports through the pipeline rose to over 400,000 bopd by the end of the year, 
with more to come in 2015, allowing a clear route to market for Genel’s 
growing, low-cost, production. With this significant progress, Genel has grown 
production to end the year as one of the largest independent E&P producers 
listed on the London Stock Exchange.

4 Annual Report 2014 Unlocking the value of Genel’s gas business
An agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources of the KRG 
for the development of the Miran and Bina Bawi gas fields was 
reached in November .
The agreement materially de-risks the value of Genel’s gas business, gives 
attractive project returns and significantly lowers capital exposure. It unlocks 
the Miran and Bina Bawi gas resource and assists the Kurdistan Regional 
Government in satisfying domestic gas demand and its obligations under the 
KRG-Turkey Gas Sales Agreement, which will see an initial 4 bcma of gas 
exports from 2018, rising to 10 bcma by 2020. 
This will materially reduce Turkey’s gas import bill and cement the already 
close ties between the two governments. The KRG is set to become a major gas 
producer, consumer and exporter, which will unlock significant value for both 
the region and Genel.

Supporting and sustaining our communities
The development of positive and enduring relationships with the 
people and communities in the areas in which we operate is 
crucial to our success.
Our community investment programme aims to improve the lives of people in 
the areas in which we work, but we also strive to support the Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq as a whole. In 2014 there was an issue that could not be ignored, as the 
rise of ISIS caused an influx of refugees on an unprecedented scale, and the 
response formed a core part of our community work in 2014. 
Genel has undertaken a number of projects to support these refugees, 
working with the KRG, Save the Children, the Kurdistan Children’s Fund and 
the International Rescue Committee to help some of the most vulnerable 
people through this humanitarian crisis. 
“The partnership with Genel Energy and their generous donation of $1 million 
has enabled Save the Children to better support refugee children, providing 
shelter and safe areas in which they can play, learn and begin to recover from 
the trauma they have experienced fleeing their homes.”

8 Annual Report 2014 OUR INVESTMENT CASE
World-class assets
Our oil and gas fields are of the quality 
of those owned by larger integrated oil 
companies. We are the largest producer 
and the largest holder of reserves and 
resources in the Kurdistan Region of 
Iraq, with our production in the region 
now making us one of the largest 
independent oil producers listed on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Low-cost, growing  
oil production
Our production in the KRI during 2014 
averaged 69,000 boepd, an increase  
of 58%. This is set for further material 
growth in 2015. Our oil reserves and 
resources are being developed and 
produced at some of the lowest costs  
in the industry today – testament to 
their size, onshore location and prolific 
reservoirs. This contributes to a low 
breakeven oil price relative to other  
oil developments.
Transformational  
gas business
Our world-class Miran and Bina Bawi 
fields contain an estimated 11 tcf of 
mean raw gas resources, the value  
of which has been unlocked through  
an agreement reached with the KRG  
in November 2014. The agreement 
reduces our capital expenditure to 
first production, generates attractive 
returns for Genel, and will provide 
domestic gas production to power 
continued industrial and economic 
growth in the KRI, while also assisting 
the KRG to fulfil the gas sales agreement 
signed between Turkey and the KRG in 
November 2013.
Turkish heritage and strong 
local relationships
Genel’s decade-long operations in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq have allowed 
us to build meaningful and beneficial 
relationships, and our Turkish heritage 
plays an important part in assisting us 
in expanding our footprint across our 
chosen regions of operation.
Financial strength
Genel has a robust balance sheet, 
strengthened in 2014 through the  
issue of our senior unsecured bond. 
Maintaining this strength is a core 
element of our strategy, and we expect 
the revised commercial structure for 
our gas business to deliver significant 
free cash generation once Miran and 
Bina Bawi are on-stream. We will be 
disciplined in our capital investment 
across the portfolio while we continue 
to look for growth opportunities. 
Focused and disciplined 
exploration
Taking advantage of the significant 
flexibility in our portfolio, our exploration 
strategy has been reset to focus on 
lower-cost onshore potential within our 
existing KRI and Africa licences. Adding 
resource through exploration remains  
a key objective for Genel and we will 
continue to add new opportunities 
where appropriate. 
Strong management team 
and responsible operations
The strength of our management team, 
and an experienced board, provide the 
expertise to grow the business and the 
governance necessary to maintain the 
integrity of the Company and 
effectively manage risk. Our reputation 
is built not simply on our business 
achievements, but on the way we 
conduct ourselves with our employees 
and partners, our engagement with our 
host communities and governments, 
and our approach and record on health, 
safety and the environment.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT  
AND GOVERNANCE
STRATEGIC  
REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
A LANDMARK YEAR FOR  
THE KURDISTAN REGION  
OF IRAQ OIL INDUSTRY
Low‑cost, growing 
production, and the 
financial strength  
to thrive. 
The support that the KRG has received 
from the international community 
underpins confidence that security 
will not be an impediment to our 
ongoing operations.
The third change this year was the 
overall political situation in Iraq. With  
the Iraq-Turkey export pipeline in Iraq 
inoperable, the major Baghdad-controlled 
Kirkuk oil reserves were left stranded to 
the detriment of the Iraqi people. This, 
allied with the increasing production in the 
KRI, contributed to the re-engagement of 
the Federal Government of Iraq with the 
KRG. Dialogue was helped by the election 
of a more inclusive, pragmatic leadership 
in Baghdad, led by Prime Minister Haider 
al-Abadi, which is keen to work together 
with the KRG for the benefit of all Iraqis. 
The interim oil export agreement, finalised 
in December, provides a pragmatic solution, 
ensuring that oil exports from the KRI are 
able to reach their full potential and boost 
Iraq as a whole, with the KRG receiving its 
full budget allocation. Further payments to 
contractors, including Genel, are expected 
to follow.
Powering the Kurdistan  
Region of Iraq 
With export infrastructure in place, in  
2014 Genel has focused on its producing 
operations in the KRI. Production at 
Taq Taq and Tawke increased by over 
50%, and the low-cost of this production 
is a clear advantage at a time when the  
oil price has fallen significantly. A similar 
rise in production is expected in 2015.  
This increase means that Genel is now one 
of the largest independent oil producers 
listed on the London Stock Exchange – 
I am pleased to welcome you to Genel 
Energy’s fourth Annual Report, detailing 
what has been a significant year in the 
Kurdistan Region of Iraq and for Genel. 
We have continued to deliver material 
growth in the business, and have 
successfully positioned the Company  
to grow over the coming years – even  
in a lower oil price environment.
2014 was transformational for the KRI’s 
oil and gas prospects. Three things 
fundamentally changed the operating 
environment. First, the region’s 
independent oil export infrastructure 
was completed, and pipeline exports 
rose throughout the year, reaching over 
400,000 bopd by the end of 2014. This is 
also set to increase significantly in 2015. 
Increased exports were matched by 
successful tanker liftings and sales, and 
the second half of 2014 saw KRI crude 
being sold by the KRG on the international 
market on a regular and predictable basis, 
generating international export prices. 
The second change in 2014 was the 
emergence of ISIS, which dominated 
world headlines throughout the year 
and has reshaped the political landscape 
in Syria and Iraq. While the initial military 
advances of ISIS created market 
uncertainty, throughout the period the 
Kurdistan Regional Government has been 
able to protect its borders. We continued 
to operate at our producing assets 
throughout the summer, and our operations 
remained safe and secure. Of course, we 
did take additional steps to ensure that  
our workforce were safe, and I would like 
to express my sincere thanks for their 
perseverance and commitment.
14 Annual Report 2014 a significant achievement for a business 
that only listed a little over three years ago.
Oil exports are crucial to the economy of 
the KRI, and we will continue to underpin 
the success of the KRG through helping 
facilitate the sale of gas by the KRG to 
Turkey. Under the KRG-Turkey Gas Sales 
Agreement, signed in November 2013, 
the KRG is set to provide energy-hungry 
Turkey with an initial 4 bcma of gas exports 
from 2018, rising to 10 bcma by 2020. 
Agreement for the development of our 
Miran and Bina Bawi fields, reached with 
the KRG in November, will unlock a 
world-class gas resource and will assist 
the KRG to satisfy both domestic gas 
demand and its obligations to Turkey. 
This agreement was also a milestone for 
Genel, materially de-risking the value of 
our gas business, giving attractive project 
returns while significantly lowering our 
capital exposure. 
Robust balance sheet
The Company has a clear strategy in  
place for an environment that has seen  
a significant fall in the oil price. Fiscal 
responsibility and a robust balance sheet 
are crucial in the oil and gas industry, and 
your board will ensure that the business is 
managed prudently and will continue to 
monitor opportunities to preserve the 
competitive advantage of our financial 
strength and ensure ongoing growth.
After the period end we announced Julian 
Metherell’s retirement from the Company, 
and the appointment of Ben Monaghan as 
Chief Financial Officer. Julian leaves Genel 
in a strong position to prosper, and on 
behalf of the board I would like to thank 
him for all of his hard work. We look 
forward to working with Ben, who has 
precisely the attributes we were looking 
for as we continue building on our 
position as a leading exploration and 
production company.
Governance and risk 
management
The changing environment reinforces the 
need for strong independent governance 
and we will continue to monitor carefully 
risk across all operations. In this, we work 
closely with regional authorities and local 
communities to ensure the safety of our 
staff and contractors and equally to 
maintain a strong reputation for 
responsible operations. 
Since Genel’s inception, a key pillar of our 
strategy has been to observe the highest 
standards of corporate governance. In line 
with this, we continue to have strong, 
independent audit and remuneration 
committees. For more details of these 
committees and your board’s activities 
this year, please see the governance 
section of this report. 
Operating responsibly 
Your company has a partnership with the 
Kurdistan Regional Government stretching 
back over a decade, and we are proud of 
the important role that we have played in 
the development of the KRI and its oil 
industry. It has been distressing to see the 
humanitarian crisis in the region, as over 
one million people were displaced by the 
actions of ISIS and sought refuge in the 
KRI. With an indigenous population of 
only five million people, this influx is 
unprecedented. 
The successful management of this 
influx is a testament to the leadership of 
KRG. We continue to help in any way that 
we can. Our core strength, producing 
hydrocarbons, is vital to the economic 
prosperity of the region, and we have 
further embedded ourselves into the 
communities in which we operate. 
These works, and our contribution to 
easing the humanitarian crisis, are 
detailed in this report.
Growth in a low-price world 
We move into 2015 with rising oil 
production in the KRI fuelling increased 
exports. Payments for these exports are 
set to continue.
Our production costs are amongst the 
lowest in the world, and a robust balance 
sheet, allied with the significant capital 
flexibility in our portfolio, leaves Genel well 
positioned to continue its growth even in a 
period of sustained low oil prices.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT A JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE  
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRESIDENT
DELIVERING ON GENEL 
ENERGY’S STRATEGY  
AND GROWING OIL 
PRODUCTION IN THE KRI 
The opening of the 
KRI‑T urkey oil 
export pipeline was 
a transformational 
moment.
Momentum in the Kurdistan Region of 
Iraq oil industry provided the backdrop for 
a strong operational performance. 2014’s 
two overriding geopolitical factors – the 
emergence of ISIS and, later in the year, 
the fall in the oil price – did not distract 
us from our focus on core operations. 
This year we achieved a 58% growth in 
production, at the top end of our guidance 
range, resulting in a significant increase 
in revenue. This is a testament to the 
strength of the professional team we 
have in place and the quality of our 
KRI resources.
A year of delivery in the KRI 
In 2014, a focus on operations boosted 
working interest production to an average 
of 69,000 boepd, with gross production 
from Taq Taq and Tawke averaging 
194,000 bopd. In a year in which the 
Kurdistan Regional Government faced 
significant economic challenges this 
strong operational performance provided 
the oil that fed growing exports, which 
were sold with increasing regularity 
through the Turkish port of Ceyhan.
The opening of the KRI-Turkey oil export 
pipeline was a transformational moment. 
The ability to reach the export market, and 
in turn international pricing, provided a 
route to large-scale, cost effective 
monetisation of KRI oil. The first lifting of 
this oil took place in Ceyhan in May, 
increasing in regularity over the remainder 
of the year. Over 40 cargoes were lifted in 
2014, establishing a track record of 
predictable sales.
In total, 40% of Genel’s production was 
exported by the KRG through the 
KRI-Turkey pipeline system, with 9% 
exported via Turkey by truck and the 
remainder sold into the domestic market.
In 2014 focus in the KRI was on increasing 
production, and work will be undertaken in 
2015 to further grow this significantly. 
The successful installation and 
commissioning of well site temporary 
production facilities in December 2014 at 
Taq Taq helped set a new daily production 
record of 135,000 bopd and a new record 
for gross daily liftings of 147,000 bopd. 
Completion and commissioning of the 
second central processing facility is due  
by year-end 2015, and works to increase 
the processing capacity at the Tawke field 
are expected to complete in the early 
part of 2015.
This increasing production is not 
constrained by pipeline capacity issues. 
By the end of 2014 the Fishkhabour to 
Ceyhan 40” pipeline had capacity of 
700,000 bopd. Total exports by the KRG 
grew to over 400,000 bopd by the end 
of the year.
Developing the KRI oil industry 
We are proud of the integral role that 
Genel has played in the growth of the KRI 
oil industry. For over a decade we have 
worked with the KRG to develop this 
industry, working hand-in-hand for the 
region’s economic strength and stability. 
Our success is entwined with the strength 
of the KRI, and the KRG has repeatedly 
stated its clear intention to pay contractors 
their full PSC entitlements. The first 
payment for oil exports via the pipeline 
was received in December 2014.
16 Annual Report 2014 We expect our KRI operations to be 
significantly cash generative in coming 
years, despite the significant drop in the 
oil price. Our barrels can be developed 
and produced at some of the lowest 
costs in the industry today due to their 
onshore location and prolific reservoirs. 
This contributes to a low breakeven oil 
price, and Genel is well positioned to 
continue to grow even in a period of 
sustained low oil prices.
A transformational gas 
agreement
One of the most exciting developments 
was crystallising the potential of our KRI 
gas business through an agreement 
reached in November with the Ministry  
of Natural Resources of the KRG for the 
development of the Miran and Bina Bawi 
gas fields.
With 11 tcf of mean raw gas resources, 
these are world-class fields, and the 
agreement sets out a roadmap to develop 
them at low cost to provide domestic gas 
production to power continued industrial 
and economic growth in the KRI. It also 
assists the KRG in fulfilling the gas sales 
agreement signed between Turkey and  
the KRG in November 2013, which calls for 
4 bcma of gas exports from 2018, rising to 
10 bcma by 2020, and the potential for 
further increases in the next decade. 
Gas supplied from our Miran and Bina Bawi 
fields will significantly reduce Turkey’s gas 
import bill and help cement the already 
close ties between it and the KRI. With 
these fields, the KRI is poised to become  
a major producer, consumer and exporter 
of gas, which will create significant value 
for both the region and Genel.
The agreement provided a solution with 
clear benefits for both the KRG and Genel, 
and is in line with our key objectives:
• to maintain a meaningful exposure to 
the gas development while reducing  
our capital investment; and
• to generate attractive returns, including 
prior acquisition costs, for both fields 
and to unlock significant value for Genel.
Our negotiations with the KRG over the 
detailed PSC amendments regarding Miran 
and Bina Bawi have been going well in 
recent months. As a result, we expect the 
PSC amendments to be completed in the 
first half of 2015. 
The new structure will deliver a material 
reduction in our capital exposure: for both 
fields we anticipate that gross contractor 
capex to first gas will be $1 billion, 
generate attractive returns, and create 
significant value for Genel.
A focused exploration strategy 
Over the last few years, we have enjoyed 
considerable exploration success in the 
KRI with discoveries at Chia Surkh, Bina 
Bawi, Ber Bahr, Peshkabir and Tawke 
Deep. Unfortunately, in common with 
many of our peers, we have not enjoyed 
the same success in our frontier 
exploration programme offshore Africa. 
A well was drilled offshore Malta, and two 
offshore Angola, without success. 
In Morocco, the Juby Maritime well 
encountered a 110 metre gross oil column 
of heavy oil in the Upper Jurassic, and the 
SM-1 exploration well on our operated Sidi 
Moussa licence encountered oil in 
Our barrels can 
be developed and 
produced at some  
of the lowest costs  
in the industry today.

add new opportunities where appropriate.
A robust balance sheet 
Our portfolio has the benefit of significant 
flexibility, allowing us to target capital 
expenditure in key areas, driving growth in 
our core KRI operations. Cash balances at 
the end of 2014 stood at c.$490 million. 
We remain focused on maintaining a 
robust balance sheet and, with cash 
generative production, even at a low oil 
price, Genel has a very resilient business 
underpinning our future growth.
We are advantaged by having no capital-
intensive fixed long-term development 
projects in our portfolio. We will continue 
to focus spend in the Kurdistan Region, 
prioritising investment in our production 
assets which offer short paybacks and 
high returns on incremental expenditure.
Split broadly equally between the KRI and 
Africa, our capital expenditure in 2014 was 
c.$670 million. This will fall to $200-250 
million in 2015, a reduction of 70%. 
Importantly, this is without impacting near-
term production plans in the KRI. General 
and administrative cost reductions of 40% 
have been initiated to ensure staff levels 
are appropriate for our future level of 
planned activity.
A partner for the KRI 
Supporting and sustaining the regions in 
which we operate is fundamental to 
Genel’s success and our commitment to 
being a sustainable business. Having 
operated in the KRI since 2002, our 
operations have helped pave the way for

carbonates. We continue to evaluate the 
two wells and the implications for further 
activity in Morocco.
Following these drilling results, 
expenditure relating to exploration wells 
drilled in Angola, Malta and the Sidi 
Moussa and Juby Maritime licences in 
Morocco has been written off.
With a robust balance sheet being of key 
importance in a low oil price environment, 
we have reset our exploration strategy to 
reflect the current market conditions. We 
will now focus on less capital-intensive 
onshore exploration within our existing 
KRI and Africa portfolio. 
In 2016, we are planning to drill appraisal 
wells on both Peshkabir and Chia Surkh in 
the KRI. These wells will help refine the 
volumes for both discoveries and their 
potential developments. In Africa, we will 
concentrate on our Horn of Africa 
operations. Notwithstanding security 
difficulties over the past year, we continue 
to see significant potential in our 
Somaliland acreage. In addition, the 2D 
seismic acquired on the Adigala block in 
Ethiopia in 2014 supports the presence of 
a working hydrocarbon system and large 
structures which could hold material 
potential.
We are hopeful that work can resume on 
our highly prospective Somaliland 
acreage, and we will progress our 
Ethiopian prospects towards drilling, 
although capital discipline in the face of 
lower oil prices and the timing of existing 
work programmes means drilling activity is 
unlikely before 2016. Adding resource 
through exploration remains a key

contribution we have made to the 
development of an indigenous oil and

community investment programmes we 
have undertaken, which are making a real 
difference at a local level. We invite you  
to explore this in more detail in our 
sustainability section. 
The humanitarian crisis caused by the 
emergence of ISIS to the west of the KRI 
was a key focus of both the KRG and our 
community work in 2014, and we have been 
a leading supporter of the KRG’s Kurdistan 
Oil and Gas Humanitarian Initiative. 
Working with the KRG and leading NGOs, 
Genel has contributed to the provision  
of emergency aid to tens of thousands  
of vulnerable people displaced by conflict. 
We will continue to work with the KRG in 
2015, helping to ensure the wider benefit 
of our operations.
Outlook
Today, oil sales from the Kurdistan Region 
of Iraq are regular and predictable, the 
relationship between Baghdad and Erbil  
is closer than it has been for many years, 
and payments for increasing oil exports 
are expected to continue throughout 2015.

REPORT OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
THE LARGEST PRODUCER 
AND HOLDER OF RESERVES 
AND RESOURCES IN THE 
KURDISTAN REGION OF IRAQ
T otal net reserves  
and unrisked resources
Disappointing exploration results 
in 2014 on the offshore Africa 
portfolio led to a fall in total net 
reserves and unrisked resources. 
This fall is set to be reversed in 
2015, as the finalisation of the 
development plan with the KRG 
on the PSC relating to Miran and 
Bina Bawi will significantly increase 
unrisked resources in the KRI 
portfolio. This is because Genel  
will be paid for 100% of the raw  
gas produced, and the proposed 
acquisition of Bina Bawi, when 
completed will increase Genel’s 
working interest in the licence. 
Net production
Production growth is a clear 
indicator of the potential of our 
producing assets in the Kurdistan 
Region of Iraq, and represents a 
combination of the success of 
Genel’s capital development spend 
and operational performance. The 
completion of the KRI pipeline 
infrastructure early in 2014 also 
meant that production was not 
constrained by export capacity, 
contributing to a production increase 
of 58% year-on-year, at the top end 
of the 60-70,000 boepd guidance 
range. With production facilities 
being improved at both Taq Taq and 
Tawke, another significant increase 
is expected in 2015.
Net 2P reserves  
and resources
Our strategy is to enhance the value 
of our commercial oil and gas assets 
through drilling, and to explore for 
and discover additional oil and gas 
resources. In 2014 significant 
production at Taq Taq and Tawke 
led to a fall in 2P reserves, with the 
underperformance of the Dohuk 
field also leading to an amendment 
in the 2P number. The conversion of 
oil at Miran from 2C to 2P, following 
the finalisation of the field 
development plan, went some way 
to offsetting these decreases.

20 Annual Report 2014 Capital expenditure
De-risking and increasing the 
value of Genel’s assets by capital 
development and exploration is  
a key component of our strategy. 
Capex in 2014 was split broadly 
equally between the KRI and Africa, 
with the exploration campaign 
offshore Malta, Morocco and Angola 
increasing the total spent across 
the business.
Capital expenditure outlay is 
diligently managed to ensure the 
continued strength of our balance 
sheet, and the flexibility in our 
portfolio means that expenditure 
can be focused and targeted. 
In light of continued weakness in 
oil prices, capital expenditure for 
2015 will be materially reduced 
without affecting production and 
cash generation: our focus will 
be work programmes to expand 
production at Taq Taq and Tawke.
Lost time incidents
The safety of our workforce 
remains of paramount importance, 
and Genel is committed to running 
safe and reliable operations across 
our portfolio, aiming at zero 
fatalities and no lost time incidents. 
The reduction in incidents, from an 
already low base, and another year 
of zero fatalities indicates how 
successful our safety programmes 
are in preventing injury. This also 
reflects the good progress we 
have made in our safety culture 
development as the business 
expands and the effective 
implementation of our HSE 
management system.
Spills – loss of primary 
containment
Asset integrity is a key priority  
for the Company and we plan  
and execute the operations of our 
business and our engagement of 
subcontractors so as to minimise 
risk and mitigate potential impact. 
Loss of primary containment 
(“LoPC”) records any unplanned  
or uncontrolled release of material 
from a piece of equipment (such  
as a pipe, vessel or tank) used for 
containment of potentially harmful 
or hazardous substances and 
products. LoPC related incidents  
in 2014 were minor and although 
they did not result in harm to people 
or the environment, they were 
thoroughly investigated to ensure 
best practices are in place.

OPERATING REVIEW
22 Annual Report 2014 OPERATING REVIEW: OVERVIEW
Production
Net working interest production in 2014 
averaged 69,000 boepd, at the top end 
of the Company’s guidance range, 
which remained unchanged all year. 
This represented growth of 58% on 
2013. The main driver of higher 
production was the onset of KRI exports 
via the new export pipeline through 
Turkey. This allowed both Taq Taq and 
Tawke to deliver high levels of capacity 
utilisation during the second half of 2014. 
In addition, Taq Taq production capacity 
increased in H2 2014 through the 
installation of temporary well-site 
production facilities.
During the year, the Company’s net 
production from Taq Taq and Tawke 
totalled 68,000 bopd, which was sold 
into both export and domestic markets. 
Export volumes increased through the 
year as pipeline capacity increased. 
During the fourth quarter of 2014, around 
two thirds of Genel’s net working interest 
oil production was exported via pipeline. 
Over the course of 2014, there was a 
broadly equal split between domestic 
and export sales.
The Dohuk gas field on the Summail 
licence commenced production in May 
2014 and contributed 1,300 boepd to 
2014 net production. This was below 
expectations due to earlier than 
anticipated declines in reservoir pressure 
and water production in the first two 
production wells. In light of this initial 
performance, no further investment is 
planned at Summail and the field is 
expected to deliver minimal levels of 
production going forward.
Production guidance for 2015 is reiterated 
at 90-100,000 boepd, representing further 
significant growth as a result of a full year 
of pipeline availability and further surface 
capacity increases at Taq Taq and Tawke. 
This translates into revenue guidance of 
$350-400 million at a Brent price of  
$50/bbl.
Reserves and resources
At 31
st
 December 2014, Genel Energy’s 
proven and probable (2P) working interest 
reserves were 429 mmboe (2013: 453 
mmboe), a 5% decrease year-on-year. 
The booking of Miran oil reserves only 
partially offset production from Taq Taq, 
Tawke and Summail, and the removal of 
Summail 2P reserves following field 
underperformance. As a result, the 
reserves replacement ratio in 2014 was 
8% (2013: 147%).
Contingent resources declined by 5% to 
1,033 mmboe (2013: 1,088 mmboe) on a 
downward revision to Miran oil resources 
and subsequent transfer into 2P reserves. 
The contingent resources associated with 
the Dohuk licence (12 mmboe) have also 
been removed.
Year-end 2014 reserves and contingent 
resources do not include the potential 
impact of the arrangements with the KRG 
and OMV in respect of the Miran and Bina 
Bawi gas fields. Pro-forma for successful 
execution of these arrangements, 
year-end 2014 2P reserves would have 
been 437 mmboe, incorporating a  
further 25% share of Miran oil reserves.  
Pro-forma, year-end 2014 contingent 
resources would have significantly 
increased after factoring in the conversion 
of sales gas to raw gas and an increase in 
working interest in both assets.

OPERATING REVIEW: OIL
Annual Report 2014 24 KRI pipeline infrastructure
During 2014, the KRG commenced oil 
exports through the new KRI-Turkey export 
pipeline. The pipeline consists of a number 
of sections. The first, from the Taq Taq 
field to the Khurmala Dome, has capacity 
of 150,000 bopd, with the potential to 
increase to 200,000 bopd. The second 
section, from Khurmala to the KRI border, 
currently has capacity of 375,000 bopd, 
which will shortly increase to 700,000 
bopd once a section of the pipeline crossing 
the Zab river is upgraded. At the border, 
both the KRI pipeline and the dedicated 
export pipelines from the Tawke field, 
which have capacity in excess of 250,000 
bopd, are tied into the 40-inch section of 
the Iraq-Turkey pipeline. The 40-inch 
section currently has 700,000 bopd of 
capacity. Pipelines on both the KRI and 
Turkey sides of the border have sufficient 
capacity to facilitate all current or future 
oil exports from Genel’s fields.
Initial volumes were exported through the 
pipeline system in March 2014, and by May 
sufficient volumes had accumulated in 
storage at the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan 
to commence oil sales to international 
buyers. First sales commenced in May 2014 
and by the end of 2014, over 40 cargoes of 
KRI crude had been sold, representing a 
strong track record of unimpeded exports. 
T aq T aq
The Taq Taq field (Genel 44% working 
interest, joint operator) produced a 
gross average of 103,000 bopd in 2014, 
compared to 77,000 bopd in 2013. 
Pipeline exports to international markets 
via Turkey commenced in May 2014 and 
steadily increased over the year. Exports 
(via pipeline and truck) and domestic sales 
were split broadly equally over the year. 
Deliveries to the Bazian refinery averaged 
32,000 bopd, or c.30% of total production, 
during 2014.
After the installation of temporary 
well-site production facilities during 
the year, end-2014 surface processing 
capacity stood at 135,000 bopd, a c.10% 
increase on end-2013. The installation of  
a temporary production facility will further 
increase processing capacity to 150,000 
bopd in Q1 2015. The completion and 
commissioning of the second permanent 
central processing facility, which has 
planned capacity of 90,000 bopd, is 
expected by year-end 2015. 
At end 2014, Taq Taq wellhead production 
capacity was in excess of 150,000 bopd. 
The TT-23 deviated well and TT-24 
horizontal well have been drilled and  
will be tested over the coming months. 
Tawke
The Tawke field (Genel 25% working 
interest) produced an average of 91,000 
bopd in 2014, compared to 39,000 bopd  
in 2013. Production more than doubled 
year-on-year given the onset of export 
availability through the KRI-Turkey 
pipeline. Production was broadly equally 
split between domestic and export 
markets during 2014. 
The Tawke surface processing facilities 
are currently capable of producing up to 
125,000 bopd. This capacity is scheduled 
to increase to 200,000 bopd in the early 
part of 2015 through the utilisation of early 
production facilities. To facilitate the higher 
volumes, a new 24-inch pipeline has been 
constructed from the field to the Tawke 
partners’ Fishkhabour export facility. 
This increases export capacity to in 
excess of 250,000 bopd and delivers 
transportation system redundancy.
Wellhead production capacity at the end 
of 2014 was in excess of 150,000 bopd. 
The Tawke-27 and 28 wells were brought 
on-stream recently and have been 
producing at a combined rate of 11,500 
bopd. The Tawke-30 well has reached  
final depth and is being completed for 
production. 
OPERATING REVIEW: OIL
The ramp‑up of oil exports by the KRG via the new export pipeline 
facilitated strong growth in production from T aq T aq and T awke. This is 
expected to continue in 2015 given a full year of export availability and 
further surface capacity additions at both fields.

Proposed structure
Annual Report 2014 26 In November 2014, the Company 
announced that agreement had been 
reached with the Ministry of Natural 
Resources of the KRG for the development 
of the Miran and Bina Bawi gas fields.
In addition, the Company announced 
that key terms had been agreed with 
OMV to acquire its 36% operated stake 
in the Bina Bawi gas field. The total 
consideration will be $150 million in cash. 
An initial payment of $20 million will be 
paid on completion of the deal, with 
the remaining $130 million paid in two 
installments after first gas. This is subject 
to finalisation of documentation and 
OMV’s corporate approvals.
The agreement reached with the MNR for 
the development of Miran and Bina Bawi 
states that:
• The Miran and Bina Bawi field 
developments are to be combined. 
This is expected to be approved by end 
H1 2015. Following approval, Genel will 
become the sole contractor
•  The responsibilities of Genel will be: 
drilling of the gas wells, reservoir 
management, installation of flowlines 
and first stage condensate separation 
at Miran and Bina Bawi. The Company 
will also be responsible for the 
development of the oil resources 
at Miran and Bina Bawi
•  The KRG will assume responsibility for 
the gas treatment facilities and gas 
offtake arrangements from the fields
•  The tender process for the gas 
treatment plant will commence in 2015 
and first gas production for export will 
commence in 2018. The KRG also has an 
option to request gas for domestic 
consumption commencing in 2016
The benefits to the KRG from these 
arrangements are as follows:
•  Commercialisation of a major onshore, 
low-cost, gas resource which will 
generate significant revenue and 
value for the people of the KRI
•  The option for early gas production into 
the domestic market, which stands to be 
an important contributor to industrial 
and economic growth
•  The ability to assist the KRG in fulfilling 
its export commitments to Turkey under 
the Gas Sales Agreement signed in 
November 2013
The benefits to Genel are as follows:
•  The new structure will deliver attractive 
life of field returns and unlock significant 
value in Genel’s gas business
•  The arrangement covering Miran and 
Bina Bawi simplifies the structure of the 
gas business
•  Acquiring OMV’s Bina Bawi interest will 
consolidate the ownership structure 
across both fields, streamline project 
management and provide flexibility in 
meeting development goals
•  Gross contractor upstream capital 
investment to first gas is reduced to c.$1 
billion for the combined Miran and Bina 
Bawi developments
• Drilling activity and investment phased 
from 2016 onwards
Miran
The Miran field (Genel 75% working 
interest, operator) is a simple, large 
structure well defined on 3D seismic.  
The gas resources in the field are situated 
in Jurassic aged Butmah and Adaiyah 
reservoirs, which have delivered 20-25 
(mmscfd) on test. Raw gas volumes  
in the Jurassic have been independently 
estimated at 2-7 tcf. In addition, the 
Company estimates up to 50 mmbbls of 
condensate from first stage separation. 
The shallower Cretaceous Shiranish oil 
bearing reservoir is estimated to contain 
up to 60 mmbbls of 15 degree API oil, 
which has already been produced through 
an early production facility and which we 
plan to bring on-stream ahead of the gas 
resources in the field. 
Reprocessing of 3D seismic over the field 
suggests upside to existing oil, gas and 
condensate resource estimates.
Bina Bawi 
The Bina Bawi field (Genel 44% working 
interest) is a very large, simple, anticlinal 
structure which has five well penetrations 
and is fully appraised. Gas and condensate 
resources are reservoired in the Triassic 
Kurra Chine and Geli Khana reservoirs, 
with a small oil accumulation in the 
shallower Jurassic. Raw gas resources  
in the Triassic have been independently 
estimated at 4-12 tcf. In addition, we 
estimate up to 21 mmbbls of condensate 
from first stage separation. 
There is significant upside potential to 
existing estimates of raw gas volumes as a 
definitive gas water contact has yet to be 
established by any of the wells drilled.
Dohuk
The Summail gas field on the Dohuk 
licence (Genel 40% working interest) 
commenced production into the Dohuk 
power plant during May 2014. However, 
during the second half of 2014, production 
from the field declined sharply due to 
decreasing reservoir pressure and water 
production in the first two wells. The field 
continues to produce, albeit at rates 
significantly below those envisaged in  
the original field development plan.  
As a result, minimal levels of production 
are expected going forward, leading to 
Summail 2P reserves being de-booked 
and the carrying value of the asset being 
impaired in the 2014 accounts.
OPERATING REVIEW: GAS
In 2014, Genel materially de‑risked the Miran and Bina Bawi fields 
through a new commercial structure with the KRG and reached  
key terms to buy OMV’s interest in the Bina Bawi field. This unlocks 
significant value for Genel and the KRG and will enable the development 
of the Miran and Bina Bawi gas resource to satisfy both KRI domestic gas 
demand and exports to T urkey.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT OPERATING REVIEW: EXPLORATION
In 2014, the Company drilled six exploration wells across its Africa and 
KRI acreage, with no commercial successes. These results, combined with 
the fall in oil prices, has led to a prioritisation of near‑term spend on the 
KRI production and development assets, while our refocused exploration 
strategy will target lower cost onshore opportunities.  
2014 EXPLORATION REVIEW
KRI
Drilling operations on the Taq Taq Deep exploration well 
(Genel 44% working interest and joint operator) were completed 
in March 2014 after encountering oil and gas shows in Jurassic 
and Triassic reservoirs. A testing programme was carried out 
over three separate zones, which flowed minor non-commercial 
rates of oil and gas due to the tight nature of the reservoirs.
Morocco 
In March 2014, the JM-1 exploration well on the Juby Maritime 
licence (Genel 37.5% working interest) was plugged and 
abandoned without testing after reaching a total depth of 
3,711 metres. The well confirmed the presence of heavy oil over 
a gross interval of 110 metres as originally tested in the 1968 
MO-2 well, some two kilometres from the JM-1 well. Work 
continues to evaluate the potential for moveable hydrocarbons  
in the Upper Jurassic Cap Juby discovery.
In November, the SM-1 well on the Sidi Moussa permit (Genel  
60% working interest and operator) was plugged and abandoned 
after being drilled to a total depth of 2,825 metres. The well 
encountered oil in fractured and brecciated cavernous Upper 
Jurassic carbonates. In the course of well control operations, 
26 degree API oil was produced to surface. A subsequent testing 
programme over the same interval failed to produce oil at 
sustainable rates. Further evaluation of the well results and  
other sub-surface information is required before any definitive 
conclusions can be drawn.
Malta
In July, the Hagar Qim-1 well on the Area 4 licence (Genel 75% 
working interest and operator) offshore Malta was drilled to the 
Eocene target and plugged and abandoned with no indication of 
hydrocarbons. Genel has subsequently relinquished its interest  
in the Area 4 licence.
Angola
In April 2014, the Company announced that, together with White Rose 
Energy Ventures, it had acquired 15% working interests in the Blocks 
38 and 39 offshore Angola. The 15% working interest in Block 38 was 
acquired from China Sonangol for an upfront payment of $59 million 
($30 million net to Genel). The 15% working interest in Block 39 was 
acquired from the operator Statoil for a consideration comprising a 
pro rata share of past costs and a partial carry of Statoil’s share of the 
first exploration well, for a total consideration value of $222 million 
($111 million net to Genel).
In September, the Dilolo-1 well on Block 39 was plugged and 
abandoned after failing to encounter hydrocarbons. In November, the 
Jacaré -1 exploration well on Block 38 was plugged and abandoned. 
These two wells concluded Genel’s committed Angola drilling.

Chia Surkh
On the Chia Surkh licence (Genel 60% working interest and 
operator) recently acquired 3D suggests that the main closure 
in the field sits adjacent to and beneath the Oligo-Miocene 
reservoirs tested in the successful 2013 drilling campaign. 
The provisional location of the Chia Surkh-12 well has been 
chosen to test the possibility of several stacked reservoir zones 
in the Tertiary and Cretaceous. This well is due to spud in 2016.
Ber Bahr
At Ber Bahr (Genel 40% working interest and operator) a 
160km

 3D seismic survey was completed in September 2014. 
The initial interpretation of this data confirms a potentially large 
accumulation in Jurassic aged reservoirs. An appraisal well, Ber 
Bahr-2, is planned in 2016 to delineate the reservoir and define 
the oil water contact of the existing discovery.
Peshkabir
The Jurassic aged Peshkabir discovery is located on the 
Tawke licence. Recently acquired 3D seismic has confirmed 
that the original Peshkabir-1 well was drilled at structural closure. 
The Peshkabir-2 well has been located to appraise the Jurassic 
discovery up-dip from the original well location in addition to 
testing additional prospectivity in the Cretaceous. This well is 
planned for 2016. 
Africa
Outside the KRI, the Company’s near-term focus is on 
high-grading its exploration acreage in East Africa. 
Onshore Ethiopia
The 2D seismic acquired during 2014 on the Adigala block 
(Genel 40% working interest) continues to de-risk the 
prospectivity of the license, with field work proving the  
presence of a working petroleum system. The 2D data also 
supports the presence of large structures in the Jurassic  
which could hold material potential. A well is planned in 2016.
Onshore Somaliland 
The Company continues to support the government’s efforts  
to establish an Oilfield Protection Unit, which will provide an 
appropriate level of security in order to conduct future seismic 
and drilling operations. Seismic acquisition on the Odewayne 
licence (Genel 50% working interest and operator) and SL-10B/13 
license (Genel 75% working interest and operator) is currently 
scheduled for early 2016.

Results for the period 
For the year ended 31
st
 December 2104, 
the Group reported revenue of $519.7 
million (2013: $347.9 million), a loss before 
tax of $312.8 million (2013: $186.5 million 
profit) and a loss per share of 112.97 cents 
(2013: 66.24 cents earnings). Free cash 
flow for the period was an outflow of 
$560.9 million (2013: outflow of 
$252.6 million). 
Revenue
Revenue, which is on an accruals basis, 
of $519.7 million (2013: $347.9 million) 
and EBITDAX of $410.6 million (2013: 
$274.8 million) increased from the 
comparable period as a result of pipeline 
export availability. Pipeline exports 
brought about higher production volumes 
and improved crude oil realisations, 
which averaged $73/bbl (2013: $66/bbl).
Operating costs
Cost of sales of $203.1 million (2013: 
$140.7 million) includes 
depreciation charges of $141.0 million 
(2013: $94.4 million) and production 
costs of $62.1 million (2013: $46.3 million). 
Depreciation increased broadly in line 
with production levels whilst production 
costs were impacted favourably by 
lower transport costs, consumables  
and workover costs. 
Exploration costs of $476.8 million 
(2013: credit of $3.1 million) represent 
the write-off of expenditure relating  
to exploration wells drilled in Angola, 
Malta and the Sidi Moussa and Juby 
Maritime fields in Morocco. In addition, 
the Company wrote off the entire value 
of the Dohuk gas asset ($80.9 million).
Other operating costs amounted to 
$47.0 million (2013: $26.8 million) for 
the period and included $9.0 million 
(2013: $6.2 million) of costs relating  
to acquisitions and pre-licence activity. 
The remaining $38.0 million (2013: 
$20.6 million) represented general and 
administration costs with 2013 benefitting 
from a one-off credit of $6 million.
Finance expense 
Finance expense of $24.7 million 
(2013: $3.0 million income) represents 
primarily interest and issue costs on 
the $500 million bond issued in late 
May 2014.

All corporation tax due has been paid on 
behalf of the Group by the KRG from the 
KRG’s own share of revenues and there is 
no tax payment required or expected to be 
made by the Group other than some small 
amounts incurred and paid in respect of 
the Group’s service companies in Turkey 
and the UK.
Dividend
No dividend (2013: nil) will be paid for the 
year ended 31

 December 2014. 
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure in the year amounted 
to $676.9 million (2013: $563.6 million). 
Exploration spend in KRI amounted to 
$137.8 million (2013: $348.4 million) with a 
further $193.4 million (2013: $128.1 million) 
incurred on the development of existing 
producing assets in KRI. Capital 
expenditure in Africa amounted to 
$343.0 million (2013: $82.1 million).
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operations was $195.3 
million below last year at $116.0 million 
(2013: $311.3 million) primarily due to an 
increase in net amounts due from the KRG. 
This together with capex spend of $676.9 
million (2013: $563.9 million) resulted in  
a free cash outflow of $560.9 million 
(2013: $252.6 million). Acquisition spend 
was $76.8 million (2013: $43.0 million) and 
the purchase of own shares and shares for 
employee share plans amounted to $63.2 
million (2013: $6.0 million). Financing raised 
from the issue of bonds raised a net 
$490.3 million, leaving a net cash outflow 
of $210.6 million (2013: $301.6 million). 
Cash
At 31
st
 December 2014, the Group had  
a gross cash balance of $489.1 million 
(2013: $699.7 million). After the deduction 
of borrowings, net debt was $2.3 million 
(2013: net cash $699.7 million). 
Acquisitions
The Group spent a total of $76.8 million 
(2013: $43.0 million) on acquisitions in 
the year. On 6
th
 March 2014, the Group 
acquired a 40% interest in the Adigala 
block in Ethiopia for $4.0 million. 
On 3
rd
 April 2014, the Group acquired  
a 7.5% interest in Blocks 38 and 39 
offshore Angola for $72.8 million. 
Net assets 
Net assets at 31
st
 December 2014 
amounted to $3,733.5 million 
(2013: $4,104.2 million) and consist 
primarily of oil and gas assets of 
$2,010.7 million (2013: $1,998.4 million), 
exploration and evaluation assets of 
$1,676.6 million (2013: $1,630.9 million) 
and net debt of $2.3 million (2013: 
$699.7 million net cash).
Liquidity / counterparty risk 
management 
The Group monitors its cash position, cash 
forecasts and liquidity on a regular basis. 
The Group takes a conservative approach 
to cash management, with surplus cash 
held in government gilts or treasury bills 
or on time deposits with a number of 
major financial institutions. Suitability of 
banks is assessed using a combination of 
sovereign risk, credit default swap pricing 
and credit rating. 
Going concern
The directors have assessed that the  
cash balance held provides the Group  
with adequate headroom over forecast 
operational and potential acquisition 
expenditure for the 12 months following 
the signing of the annual report for the 
period ended 31
st
 December 2014 for the 
Group to be considered a going concern.
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to 
comply with the European regulation 
to report consolidated statements that 
conform to International Financial

Annual Report 2014 32 Developing with our 
communities
Genel and TTOPCO spent over $3 million 
on social projects in 2014, but it is the 
positive impact of our operations that 
has the potential to exert a greater, and 
lasting, influence. In order to ensure this

We are proud of the contribution our 
employees and contractors make within 
local communities, whether they are 
delivering aid directly to displaced

REPORT
33 www.genelenergy.com CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
W e are committed to conducting all of our operations in a manner that 
protects Genel’s employees and contractors from injuries and illnesses,  
as well as having regard to the health and safety of the general public  
and the protection of the environment. 
Health and safety
We firmly believe that a safe workplace is fundamental to protect 
our people and our business. Our primary consideration is always 
the safety and wellbeing of our employees, something that we 
never compromise. Everyone at Genel has to follow our HSE 
management system requirements, which we appraise and 
review regularly.
Genel’s HSE management system defines our approach to 
managing health, safety and environment matters across all  
of its facilities and activities. The system provides compliance 
requirements as well as practical guidance and procedures for  
all staff conducting operations or managing sites to achieve our 
health, safety and environmental objectives as an integrated part 
of our overall goals.
Highlights
During 2014 Genel’s HSE performance improved significantly. 
In particular, we:
• Reduced the number of lost time incidents to one,  
compared to three in 2013
• Further developed and updated our HSE strategy
• Improved our interface with TTOPCO
• Continued to roll out procedures and tools for enhanced 
HSE management
• Honoured our commitment to report our greenhouse 
gas emissions
Leadership
In 2014 we continued the programme started in 2013 to enhance 
operational leadership and to clarify roles and responsibilities 
with a focus on ownership of HSE by the operational ‘line’. 
We have also further developed our HSE culture by optimising 
the HSE organisation structure and capability, by communicating 
management commitments and expectations, and by embedding 
core HSE systems and processes to assure a focused and 
integrated approach to risk management.
Process safety
We commissioned gas dispersion and emissions modelling studies 
in order to ensure that process safety was included in the earliest 
stages of a project life cycle. This was done to ensure that risks 
are understood and necessary risk reduction measures 
implemented in a timely fashion.
Working with contractors
Working safely with contractors continues to be a priority for 
Genel. We continue to focus on rigorous and consistent on-site 
implementation of our HSE policies and procedures. During  
2014, improvements were made to our on-site leadership  
and supervision leading to more effective management of 
contractors. These changes led to significant performance 
improvement.
Measuring our performance 
Lost time incident frequency measures the number  
of lost time incidents per million work hours and is the headline 
indicator of the success of our safety programmes. In 2014 our 
LTIF improved significantly to 0.40 per million work hours 
versus a 2013 performance of 1.63 per million work hours. 
This improvement reflected good progress in our safety culture 
development and also in the effective implementation of our HSE 
management system. The combined Genel / TTOPCO 2014 LTIF 
was 1.01 per million work hours.

34 Annual Report 2014 People
Our talented, experienced and motivated staff are key to the 
success of our Company, and we are committed to developing  
our employees, promoting diversity, fairness and respect in the 
workplace and providing recognition based on success and 
achievement. 
Highlights
At 31
st
 December 2014, Genel employed 223 people. Of these 
223 employees, 110 are based in Ankara, 48 in London, 37 in  
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and 28 in our African operations. 
TTOPCO employed 608 people at the end of 2014. In 2015,  
we will be focused on work programmes to expand production  
at Taq Taq and Tawke, and headcount changes have been made 
in order to reflect this updated focus. 
T raining and skills
Continually investing in the technical and professional 
development of our people gives them the tools they need to 
drive our business forward, operate safely and efficiently and help 
Genel achieve our strategic and operational goals. Providing staff 
development opportunities is a priority, and we use an external 
provider to give employees access to a wide range of professional 
skills training, including geoscience, technical and engineering 
courses. The majority of our staff completed professional 
development training courses during 2014. 
Conduct
Adherence to the highest standards of corporate governance  
is a key pillar of our strategy, and our commitment to acting 
responsibly, ethically and in a safe manner across our entire 
business is embraced by all of our operations. Our Code of 
Conduct has been updated and relaunched to emphasise the 
ongoing importance of ethical conduct in all aspects of our work. 
We are proud of our staff and the way that our extremely high 
standards gain the respect and trust of the governments and 
communities that host our operations, underpinning the 
sustainability of our current and future business.
Pay and benefits
A transparent and competitive reward framework allows  
us to attract and retain a highly skilled employee base. 
Performance-related-pay is available to all our staff, in line  
with a well-structured and clearly defined performance 
management process. 
It is essential for us to uphold our commitment to hiring local 
people in the countries where we operate and continue to be a 
responsible and attractive employer. To do this, we participate  
in salary and benefits benchmarking surveys within the various 
regions to ensure we remain externally competitive and 
effectively retain and reward all of our employees. 
Diversity
Our commitment to employing a diverse and balanced workforce 
enables us to build an effective and talented workforce at all 
levels of the organisation, including the board. The value we place 
on equal opportunities and diversity of ideas, skills, knowledge, 
experience, culture, ethnicity and gender is evident in our daily 
operations as well as formalised in our policies and procedures.
Our recruitment policy is to appoint individuals based solely  
on their skills, experience and suitability to the role. 33% 
(74 employees) of our workforce are women. Of those, 5% 
(four employees) hold senior management positions within our 
organisation, including one member of our executive committee.
 
Environment
Our operations are managed in accordance with our policy of 
minimising environmental impacts and potential adverse effects. 
This includes a focus on effective design, efficient operation,  
and responsible energy use.
Greenhouse gas emissions
In line with the commitment we made last year, we are 
voluntarily reporting our 2014 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) 
emissions in accordance with the requirements of the UK’s 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) 
Regulations 2013. The regulations require companies to report 
on their GHG emissions from activities for which they are 
responsible. To determine responsibility for our activities 
we applied the ‘operational control approach’ to setting 
organisational boundaries as defined by the WRI/WBCSD GHG 
Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised 
edition — the GHG Protocol). The reported data has been sourced 
from operations where we have identified Genel as having 
operational control of the facility or asset during 2014.
The regulations require the reporting of emissions associated 
with: 1) the combustion of fuel, e.g. in stationary equipment  
and vehicles; and 2) the operation of facilities, e.g. through  
the purchase of electricity, execution of physical or chemical 
processes, and unintentional releases through leaks. These  
two categories are closely aligned with the scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions categories as defined by the GHG Protocol. The majority 
of energy and fuel data collected has been based on actual, 
measured consumption. 11.3% (4,100 tonnes of CO
2 
equivalent 
(tCO
2
e)) has been extrapolated from actual consumption figures. 
Emissions are calculated using appropriate conversion factors 
sourced from: the Defra/DECC UK Government Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting 2014; the IEA CO
2
 Emissions  
from Fuel Combustion Highlights 2013 Edition; and the US EPA 
emission factors for GHG inventories April 2014.
According to the methodologies outlined above, our total 
reportable scope 1 emissions in 2014 were 35,790 tCO
2
e, which 
included the combustion of aviation turbine fuel, diesel, LPG and 
oils associated with well testing. Our total reportable scope 2 
emissions were 494 tCO
2
e, attributable to purchased electricity  
at our offices and field operations. Our total reportable scope 1 
and 2 emissions were therefore 36,284 tCO
2
e, normalised to  
123 tCO
2
e per employee (based on our 2014 monthly average 
number of employees).
Environmental impact assessments
During 2014 we commissioned environmental impact assessment 
studies during the planning phase related to significant activities 
or the management of projects, such as the acquisition of seismic 
data or the drilling of wells. 
The EIA process is applied prior to major decisions and 
commitments being made and is designed to identify, predict  
and evaluate the environmental effects of proposed actions and 
projects, including the identification of measures to reduce or 
avoid these effects where possible. Particular attention is given  
to preventing, mitigating and offsetting the potential adverse 
effects of proposed undertakings. 
Not only does this systematic process help us ensure compliance 
with applicable legislation but it is also an effective way to 
maintain alignment with industry best practices.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT  
AND GOVERNANCE
STRATEGIC  
REPORT CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
W e partner with and invest in communities close to our operations to 
achieve mutual long‑term benefits, with a focus on four key areas:
Sustainable economic development
Our infrastructure development, capacity building payments 
and employee and contractor wages have a direct and 
material positive impact on development in the countries 
where we operate. 
Our most significant contribution to economic growth so far has 
undoubtedly been in the KRI, where we continue to play a key 
part in the development of the oil and gas sector and remain the 
biggest oil producer and largest holder of reserves and resources.
Aligning with local development goals
We align our operations and associated community work with the 
development goals of the countries in which we operate, and 
co-operate closely with governments to create partnerships that 
allow for shared prosperity and sustainable economic growth. 
This is particularly evident in the KRI, where our operations and 
capital expenditure have significantly contributed to the region’s 
oil industry and economic strength. Gross production at Taq Taq 
and Tawke averaged 194,000 bopd in 2014, and oil from these 
fields was instrumental in driving exports and providing a revenue 
stream for the KRI. Working together with the KRG, capital 
expenditure is planned at Miran and Bina Bawi that will allow the 
region to become a significant exporter of gas, further powering 
economic development. 
Developing local businesses
Part of the way we contribute to economic development is to 
support local companies, which we do whenever possible. One of 
the local companies we have helped develop is Banmel, based 
near to our Chia Surkh site. Previously they had no corporate 
experience and had worked only for the local government. In 2013 
and 2014 we contracted them to build 10 water wells, sheep dips 
for local farmers and a community public hall as part of our social 
projects in the area. This work enabled them to increase their 
local skilled staff from one civil engineer to four, and to develop 
their HSE and project management processes in line with 
international standards. They have now grown from 11 staff to 70 
and work for a number of other companies. They use only local 
personnel and, wherever possible, material and services procured 
from the area. We are proud to have been the first international 
company to work with them and to help encourage their growth.
We undertake community projects and make both financial 
and non-financial contributions to support the areas where 
we operate. All projects are undertaken in consultation with 
local people and local authorities, and the nature of projects 
depends on the status of our operations, needs of the area, 
and development goals of the region and country. 
Projects are selected carefully following extensive 
stakeholder consultation and are undertaken sensitively  
in line with our rigorous internal procedures and policies, 
including our corporate social responsibility policy, our 
anti-bribery policy and procedures and our community 
investment guidelines.

social projects and policies

Meaningful community relations
Strong community relations provide the social licence for us to 
continue and expand our operations on a local, regional and 
global level. 
We maintain proactive and constructive engagement with people 
living and working near our operations and work with them in 
order to develop understanding and engender a spirit of 
collaboration with our work and the way it is developing their 
area and region. 
Community relations teams
All our sites have community relations teams who work closely 
with local people, authorities and regional governments. This 
contact helps us to pre-empt and answer the questions of those 
who live close to our sites, and to operate hand in hand with local 
and regional development goals. Our teams maintain an open 
dialogue with communities, listening to feedback, and connecting 
with our operational teams to find ways to improve the ways in 
which we work and interact.
For example, in Somaliland, our license areas cover over 40,000 
km
2
, a greater area than the entire Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
Our in-country team travel the entire area to visit villages, discuss 
any concerns and explain our work and how it could impact and 
develop the area. They connect with over 30 local community 
leaders and representatives to ensure we have an open dialogue 
with the broad range of people who live in our license areas.
Ongoing communication helps us to identify appropriate 
projects to support local communities and development goals – 
accordingly in the KRI we have undertaken over 100 projects 
near our sites in the last decade.
Land acquisition
Land acquisition in the KRI has been a focus for Genel’s CSR 
team in 2014. We strictly adhere to the government process, 
and our community liaison officers work closely with local people, 
investing time and resources to ensure that we help landowners 
to receive appropriate compensation in a timely manner. 
Efforts to fully support local landowners through the process 
have included providing legal support to assist them with 
documentation. We are proud to say that over 80% of our 2014 
payments are complete – comprising all cases where we have 
received complete legal documentation. We have received 
positive feedback from local authorities over our efficiency and 
prompt compensation to over 750 farmers. 
36 Annual Report 2014 Improved community health
We support local health services and contribute to emergency 
refugee aid projects to help both local and regional communities.
Risk and safety
The health and safety of all employees and surrounding 
communities is of paramount importance to Genel. We 
undertake risk assessments to safeguard local communities 
through identifying potential risks and developing plans to 
minimise them. We work with the local community to 
communicate offsite risks, if any, arising from our activities and 
develop plans to be used in the unlikely event of an emergency.
Healthcare support
Some of our operations are in regions that, due to their 
remoteness and development challenges, can lack consistent 
access to medical services and infrastructure. We have 
undertaken a number of projects to improve the health of people 
living near our sites, people who do not have reliable access to 
good quality healthcare. Improving water supply, emergency aid 
and medical support are key ways we support communities.
Medical outreach
Since 2008, TTOPCO has built strong relationships with the local 
community through extending the services of the on-site medical 
clinic free of charge to people in the 11 villages around the Taq Taq 
facility. The team travels to the villages with a local doctor and 
treats patients at the clinic or at their homes, providing doctor 
consultations and a wide range of medication at no cost to 
patients. In 2014 they made 77 village trips and had 342 patient 
appointments. 
Emergency refugee aid
Emergency support for refugees has been an important part of 
our community work in 2014. The Genel/TTOPCO team in the KRI 
has been working directly with displaced families, handing out 
food and winter supplies in Sulaimaniyah, Erbil and Koya. At Koya, 
near our Taq Taq site, staff undertook a major project to 
construct emergency shelters for over 200 people. Our $1 million 
donation to Save the Children in December 2013 has helped them 
to support thousands of refugee children throughout 2014 
through the construction of child friendly spaces and playgrounds 
for over 2,000 displaced children, improving support facilities at 
camps, conducting resilience workshops for over 100 children, 
training local child protection teams and distributing over 1,500 
food parcels, hygiene packs and baby kits.
Smoke free cookers in Somaliland
Genel partnered with a local NGO in Somaliland to purchase and 
distribute 3,750 “Wonderbags” – smoke-free slow cookers that 
significantly reduce the need for cooking fuel. These reduce 
exposure to harmful smoke and allow those in rural areas to 
spend less time making meals and gathering wood, and more time 
focusing on education and other activities. Our team spent two 
weeks travelling across our licence blocks to distribute the 
cookers, which were gratefully received by families.
Local and regional capacity building
We are helping to unlock the potential of our host countries’ 
natural resources, developing infrastructure and supporting 
economic growth. We also have a responsibility to help the 
people who live near our sites develop the skills to thrive and  
play a central part in this exciting process.
Employing locally
At all our sites, the biggest demand we have from local 
communities is for jobs. People understandably want to 
participate in the development and growth of their country and 
we fully support this by employing and buying locally whenever 
possible, and requiring that our contractors do the same. Our 
commitment to this has been formalised in our policies and 
procedures during 2014, including a specific local content 
procedure for the KRI. As at 31
st
 December 2014, 86% of Genel’s 
and 76% of TTOPCO’s KRI employees were from the local area.
Building local capacity
The skills and services we require to run our business are not 
always available locally. In addition, local suppliers may not be 
used to our procedures, standards, requirements and way of 
operating. Our commitment to building local capacity includes:
• Running programmes to support education and training, 
particularly vocational training that fosters skills that are 
mutually beneficial for the area and our company
• Taking the time to work with small local suppliers to help them 
through our procedures, for example by explaining our 
standards, legal requirements and processes
Supporting the KRG’s localisation goals
Vocational training
At Koya, near our Taq Taq site, TTOPCO funded vocational 
training courses for 200 people. The courses were run in 
partnership with Guidelines Youth Organisation Kurdistan, 
a local association, and lasted three months. Skills developed 
included computing, mechanics, sewing and air conditioning 
installation and maintenance. The courses were extremely 
well-received by participants and local officials, who 
confirmed that they would have a real impact on 
increasing employability and opening new job prospects in 
an area where many have little opportunity to receive 
vocational training.
Oil and gas training
Genel contracted the American University of Iraq 
Sulaimaniyah to provide a training course and workshop for 
local officials in the Garmiyan area near our Chia Surkh site. 
The course was aimed at increasing understanding of the oil 
and gas industry for those who work closely with Genel’s 
operations on a daily basis, including people from the health, 
education, security, and agriculture departments, and the 
local mayor and municipality.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT RISK MANAGEMENT
The changing environment reinforces the need for careful monitoring 
across all operations. 
The board is responsible for Genel’s risk 
management, which it does primarily by:
• Setting the overall risk appetite of the 
Company and the assessment of what 
level of risk is acceptable to bear
• Providing oversight of appropriate risk 
management systems and internal 
control processes
Maintaining the highest level of corporate 
governance is a strategic priority, with the 
board’s oversight of the risk management 
systems structured to:
• accurately identify and assess principal 
risks to the business
• mitigate controllable risks to an 
acceptable level; and
• where possible, build resilience to 
accepted non-controllable risks
The risk management systems and 
internal control processes are designed to 
support the board in identifying key risks 
and associated judgements and then 
enable them to make effective, timely and 
appropriate decisions.
The board and its committees
The board is supported by its committees, which apply their expertise to the assessment and management of certain risks. 
The committees report findings and/or recommendations to the board.
The allocation of risks to the appropriate committees is summarised in the table below:

Commercial risks
Risk Explanation Oversight
Reserves and 
resources
The Group’s estimates of its contingent resources and prospective resources can change 
with time, and there can be no guarantee that the Group will be able to develop these 
resources commercially.
The Group operates in a competitive industry and its ability to generate returns depends  
on its ability to exploit, develop and commercialise present assets, as well as to select and 
acquire suitable assets for exploitation, development and commercialisation in the future.
If the Group is unable to develop its contingent and prospective resources there may be 
material and adverse effects on its business, financial conditions, results of operations 
and prospects.
Audit 
committee
Major 
projects
The Group relies on its ability to complete major projects on time and within budget. 
The Group is reliant on its completion of major projects to maintain its projected growth 
levels. In particular, there is a need to ensure projects (including the delivery by contractors 
and suppliers) are managed on time and within budget, using efficient technologies to 
achieve the required specifications. If projects are not executed on time and to budget,  
the planned growth and profitability of the Group will not be achieved. 
The Group continues to monitor the progress of all major projects as appropriate. Review 
outcomes and key concerns are reported to the executive team, and appropriate actions 
are agreed. Third-party contractor performance is monitored. However, if a third-party fails 
to meet the Group’s performance requirements, there can be no guarantee that the Group 
will be able to replace such third-party without further disruption to the project.
Board
Exploration 
and appraisal
Failure of the Group’s exploration activities to add additional commercially viable reserves 
could affect the Group’s long-term growth strategy. 
Failure to discover commercially viable hydrocarbons could have an impact on the valuation 
of the Group and returns made to its shareholders.
Board
M&A The Group cannot guarantee successful identification and acquisition of appropriate assets.
A failure to identify appropriately valued high-quality assets could have an impact on the 
valuation of the Group.
Board
In summary, the risks fall into four broad categories:
• Commercial risks in relation to the business environment 
within which the Group operates 
• Political risks in relation to the political, social and economic 
environment of the KRI, Iraq and other countries where the 
Group has a presence 
• Legal and regulatory risks in relation to the frameworks 
governing the Group’s operations 
• Health, security, safety and environmental risks which may 
prevent the Group from maintaining positive relationships with 
stakeholders 
There may be additional risks unknown to the Group and 
other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could 
become material.  41 www.genelenergy.com

Title to KRI 
PSCs
The Iraq oil ministry has historically disputed the validity of PSCs granted by the KRG.  
The Group has title to assets in the KRI pursuant to seven PSCs entered into with the KRG. 
Based on legal advice obtained by the Company, the directors believe that the Company  
has good title to its oil and gas assets.
However, if the validity of the PSCs was successfully challenged, the Group  
could be required by the KRG to accept contractor entitlements that are materially less 
favourable than the current PSCs.
Board
Infrastructure 
and essential 
services
The Group’s principal producing assets are dependent on the availability of infrastructure 
and services, including pipelines, utilities and third-party services in the Kurdistan region.
If a major accident causes environmental damage, or the KRG revokes or amends licences, 
the Group may be restricted from access to sales routes by the KRG.
The Group has put in place health, safety and other procedures to minimise the impact 
of unexpected disruptions to the supply of essential services. 
Disruptions in the supply of essential utility services, such as water and electricity, 
could halt or delay the Group’s production. Unexpected disruptions to the supply of 
essential utility services may cause loss of life, damage to the Group’s equipment and 
delay to the re-commencement of operations.
Board
Security The KRI and Iraq have a publicised history of political and social instability, with additional 
pressure caused by the influx of refugees into the KRI following the recent unrest in Iraq.  
If the situation were to deteriorate, it would represent an increased risk to the operations, 
revenue, security and development of the Group.
The Group assesses political, social, legal and economic risks as part of its evaluation of 
potential projects. The Group actively monitors developments in Iraq and the KRI, as well  
as the economic and political relationship between Turkey and the KRG. 
The Group has taken measures to protect its employees, equipment and other assets from 
security risks. Steps include the provision of security personnel and surveillance equipment, 
and the imposition of security checks and procedures at the sites that it operates. However, 
there can be no guarantee that such measures will prove effective against all safety risks.
Should security in the KRI decline or diplomatic relations between the KRG, Iraq or Turkey 
deteriorate, this may have a negative impact on the Group’s operations and potentially 
impact the cash flows, planned growth and valuation of the Group. 
Board
Local 
communities
Failure to manage relationships with local communities, government and non-government 
organisations could adversely affect the Group.
As a consequence of public concerns about the perceived ill-effects of economic 
globalisation, businesses generally, and large multinational corporations in particular,  
the Group faces increasing public scrutiny of its activities. The Group’s operations may  
be located in or near communities that may regard its operations as detrimental to their 
environmental, economic or social circumstances.
Negative community reaction could have a negative impact on the Group’s ability to operate 
efficiently or its ability to finance an operation. Such reactions could also lead to disputes 
with national or local governments or with local communities and give rise to disruption to 
projects or operations, or cause material reputational damage, which could in turn affect 
the Group’s revenues, results of operations and cash flows.

New 
hydrocarbon 
legislation
There remains an ongoing dispute between the KRG and the Iraqi central government in 
relation to both monies owed to the KRG for past exports and awarding of new PSCs. New 
laws may be enacted in the future, governing the regulation of Iraqi oil and gas resources.
The dispute between the KRG and Iraqi central government may require new laws and 
regulations to be introduced to resolve the situation. The enactment of any new law may 
alter the regulation of oil and gas resources in Iraq and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, reduce 
the value of the Group’s existing PSCs and increase the regulatory requirements placed on 
the Group. Additionally, depending on the content of any future enacted law, the Group’s 
existing PSCs with the KRG may be subject to review or revision of terms.
Increased legislative requirements could mean that the Group incurs additional expenditure 
obligations and have a material and adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial 
conditions, results of operations and prospects.
Board
Revocation or 
change of 
licensing 
terms
The Group may be unable to obtain or renew required drilling rights, concessions, licences, 
permits and other authorisations or such licences may be suspended, terminated or revoked 
prior to their expiration.
The Group conducts its exploration, development and production operations pursuant to 
drilling rights under a wide variety of licences. There can be no assurance that the host 
government will not significantly alter the conditions of, or that any third-party will not 
challenge, the licences held by the Group.
The Group continues to maintain a regular dialogue with its key stakeholders in particular 
with the KRG, the Turkish government and other regional public bodies, and expects to 
obtain and maintain all approvals it believes are necessary to operate its business.
Board
Health and 
safety 
regulations
The Group’s operations are subject to general and specific regulations and restrictions 
governing workplace health and safety requirements, environmental requirements, social 
impacts, and other laws and regulations.
The Group’s primary operational safety risks are those inherent in the oil and gas industry, 
including the release of hydrogen sulphide gas during flaring at the Taq Taq field, fires, 
blowouts, explosions, equipment or system failures and transportation accidents, which  
may result in death or injury to staff or local residents.
Certain of the Group’s operations may also create environmental risks in the form of spills, 
the release of gas or soil contamination from site operations, recycling and waste disposal. 
A health, safety, security or environmental incident could lead to the Group having to make 
material changes to its facilities or processes and pay compensation to any injured parties. 
There can be no assurance that the Group will not incur substantial financial obligations, 
which may lead to an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition 
and prospects.
The Group has implemented health, safety and environmental policies and complies 
with international environmental guidelines for crude oil exploration and production, for 
example those issued by the World Health Organization. The Group monitors compliance 
with its health, safety and environment policies regularly through a reporting system, 
inspections, third-party audits and management site inspections as overseen by the 
Group HSSE committee.

2014 achievements
• Successful issuance and listing on the Nordic ABN 
Exchange of 7.5% senior unsecured bonds 
• Maintained strong operational oversight during the 
emergence of ISIS enabling ongoing operation of our 
producing assets
• Considered the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
accordance with the application of malus and clawback 
to bonus and long-term incentives
• Strong support for our remuneration policy approved  
by shareholders at the 2014 AGM
• Undertook an internal review of our effectiveness 
concluding that the board continued to operate  
to a high standard 
50 Annual Report 2014
As a Jersey registered company with a standard listing, we  
are not required to comply with these requirements; however, 
in the interest of good governance, we choose to do so voluntarily. 
The board and the relevant committees consider the requirements 
in detail as part of their work during the year. Details of how  
we intend to apply malus and clawback to our remuneration 
arrangements are set out in the annual report on remuneration 
on pages 66 and 69.
On 2
nd
 February 2015, we announced that Julian Metherell  
would stand down as a director of Genel at the conclusion of the 
2015 AGM and leave the Company shortly thereafter. Julian has 
played an integral role in unlocking the value of our world class 
assets in the KRI and leaves the Company in a strong position to 
prosper. Ben Monaghan will join as CFO following a period of 
transition prior to Julian’s departure. I would like to thank 
Julian for his contribution and welcome Ben to Genel.
We have continued to make strong progress in the area of 
community engagement and investment, most notably responding 
quickly and positively to the impact of the influx of refugees into 
the KRI following the recent unrest in Iraq. As well as recognising 
our responsibility to support the regions in which we operate 
during such times of crisis, we have also continued to support 
development of the local community. In early 2014 we reviewed 
and updated our CSR policies and framework to enhance our 
approach in this area.
In May 2014 we successfully listed our 7.5% senior unsecured 
bonds on the Nordic ABN Exchange thereby strengthening our 
balance sheet.
We have continued to monitor our performance, and as last year, 
completed an internal effectiveness review continuing to build 
on the recommendations from the 2012 and 2013 reviews. 
More details of the findings and improvement programme 
are set out in this report.
Rodney Chase 
Chairman
We remain committed to operating to the highest standards of 
corporate governance to support us in delivering on our business 
objectives. The board, assisted by the work of the audit committee, 
keeps under review the governance framework, risk management 
and internal controls. 
We comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and 
accordingly have given enhanced consideration during the year to 
diversity and environmental matters in accordance with the code. 
We also complied with the new remuneration reporting regulations 
and put both our remuneration policy and implementation report 
forward for shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM. 
In 2014 the FRC updated the UK Corporate Governance Code 
to include provisions that require companies to apply malus

Corporate governance
Our objective remains to create long-term value for shareholders 
through the exploration, development and production of oil and 
gas resources. We have unique assets that are important to the 
growth of many of the world’s economies. In doing this, we have 
committed to a high level of governance and to developing a 
culture that values exemplary ethical standards, personal and 
corporate integrity and respect for others. The board governs the 
Company consistent with our business strategy and commitment 
to a transparent and high-quality governance system.
Our view is that governance is not just a matter for the board  
and that a strong governance culture must be fostered throughout 
the organisation. Our expectations of our employees and of those 
with whom we conduct business are set out in our code of conduct, 
which is summarised below and available on our website at  
www.genelenergy.com
This report aims to provide shareholders with a comprehensive 
summary of our governance arrangements and an explanation 
of how the Company has complied with the main principles 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code during 2014.
Genel Energy plc is a Jersey incorporated company with a 
standard listing on the London Stock Exchange. Notwithstanding 
our standard listing, we are committed to complying with the 
regulatory requirements in both Jersey and the UK, together  
with prevailing standards of best practice, as if we were a 
premium listed company. We are in full compliance with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code with the 
exception of B.3.3 due to Tony Hayward being appointed 
chairman of Glencore plc. A copy of the code can be found  
at www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm
As corporate governance principles continue to evolve, we will 
continue to adopt best practice guidelines as appropriate to our 
business. For example, in 2014, in response to the changes to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code, we reviewed our approach to 
malus and clawback and will be applying both to performance 
related remuneration. 
Model code
We have voluntarily adopted the model code for share dealing  
as set out in the Listing Rules. The board is responsible for  
taking all proper and reasonable steps to ensure compliance  
with the model code, including training staff in the requirements 
set out in the model code.
Code of conduct
Our code of conduct defines what we stand for as a company  
and sets out the principles that guide all of our business activities. 
We have recently reviewed and updated our code of conduct 
and all staff have received training in how to represent Genel  
in accordance with the principles of the code of conduct. 
We strive for operational excellence and aim to conduct our 
business in a responsible, ethical and safe manner with the 
highest standards of financial reporting, corporate governance, 
and compliance with applicable laws. The code of conduct sets 
guidelines by which we conduct our business and how we expect 
our board, employees, suppliers, partners and others to behave. 
As a result, being able to demonstrate behaviours aligned with 
the code of conduct forms part of the performance objectives 
for every employee.
SpeakUp
All employees are encouraged to raise any concerns they  
may have and to report any suspected or known violations  
of the code of conduct without fear of retaliation. We operate  
an independently run and confidential ‘SpeakUp’ hotline. All 
issues raised via this route are reported to the audit committee.
Business conduct
We conduct our business in an open, honest and ethical manner.  
We do not tolerate any form of bribery. We aim to ensure that 
all financial and non-financial information we create is complete 
and accurate, and we strive to provide accurate and timely 
information to external stakeholders, including governments, 
in the locations in which we operate. We take steps to protect 
against inappropriate use of confidential and privileged 
information and we aim to protect and use our business 
assets appropriately.

Our policy is not to make political donations and we have not 
done so in the period under review (2013: nil).
Conflicts of interest
We seek to avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible. 
We believe it is important that the decision making process is  
not impaired by an individual being conflicted by either an actual 
or a potential conflict. However, we recognise that from time to  
time situations may arise which could result in actual or potential 
conflicts and, accordingly, we have a formal system in place 
enabling directors and members of the executive team to declare 
any such conflicts and for those conflicts to be reviewed and, if 
appropriate, authorised by the board. A register of conflicts is 
maintained by the company secretary. The audit committee and 
the board have applied the principles and processes set out above 
during 2014 and confirm that they have operated effectively. 
Third parties
We maintain high standards of business conduct in our dealings 
with all third parties in order to promote mutually beneficial 
relationships and protect our reputation. We do not seek to win or 
maintain business by acting illegally or contrary to our contractual 
agreements. Our relationships with third parties are conducted on 
a fair and honest basis. We expect our third parties to maintain 
the same standards of business conduct as we adhere to. 
Communities and environment
Protecting and sustaining the communities and environment in 
which we operate is fundamental to maintaining our operating 
licences and to creating a long-term sustainable business. 
We strive to maintain high standards of environmental protection  
and we do not compromise our environmental values for profit  
or production. We seek to maintain proactive and constructive 
engagement with the local communities affected by our operations 
and assets, and invest to help them develop in a sustainable 
manner. We contribute to socio-economic development and 
provide transparency in respect of our contributions and their 
impact. Further information on how we engage with communities 
can be found in the community engagement and investment 
section of this report on pages 32 to 37.
The role of the board
The board’s role is to provide leadership in delivering on the 
long-term success of the Company. It is responsible for approving

board in accordance with the Company’s delegated authorities 
matrix. The board provides leadership within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls.
The board reviews the matters reserved for its decision

other meetings as necessary to fulfil its role. During the year  
we held eight meetings in various locations. One of those 
meetings was in addition to those scheduled. The board  
Roles and responsibilities
There is a clear division of roles between the chairman, chief executive officer, senior independent director and the president  
of the Company. 
Rodney Chase
Chairman
Rodney Chase is the chairman. The chairman reports to the board and is responsible for the leadership 
and overall effectiveness of the board and for setting the board’s agenda. Specific responsibilities of the 
chairman include ensuring the effective running of the board, ensuring that the board agenda is forward-
looking with an emphasis on strategic issues and ensuring the performance of the board and its 
committees is effective and in line with best practice. A culture of openness and debate is encouraged  
by the chairman through ensuring constructive relations between executive and non-executive directors 
and ensuring effective communication between the Company and its shareholders. 
T ony Hayward
Chief executive officer
Tony Hayward is the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer is responsible for all executive 
management matters of the Group. He reports to the chairman and to the board directly. All of Tony 
Hayward’s direct reports are members of the executive committee including the president. Specific 
responsibilities include the day-to-day management of the Group within delegated authority limits, 
identifying and executing strategic opportunities, managing the risk profile and ensuring appropriate 
internal controls are in place, maintaining a dialogue with the chairman and the board on important and 
strategic issues, ensuring the proper development of executive directors and senior executives and 
succession planning for executive positions.
Jim Leng
Senior independent director
Jim Leng is the senior independent director. The senior independent director is available to shareholders 
who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the normal channels of the chairman or the chief 
executive officer. He chairs the nomination committee when it is considering succession to the role of 
chairman and acts as a sounding board for the chairman and an intermediary for other directors if and 
when necessary. 
Mehmet Sepil 
President
Mehmet Sepil currently holds the position of president, which he will retain while he holds an executive 
position within the Group. As president, Mr Sepil provides the Company with a combination of local 
expertise, industry knowledge and strategic relationships. He plays a leading role in government and  
public affairs and in communications and relationships with key stakeholders, such as the KRG, the  
Turkish government and other regional public authorities. The president is not a director. He has  
a full-time executive role and reports to the chief executive officer. 
receives regular updates from management in between meetings 
on the performance of the business against the agreed strategy 
and on its operations and has a rolling agenda that sets out the 
key topics for consideration at each meeting.
Independence of the board
The independent non-executive directors (Jim Leng, Sir Graham 
Hearne, George Rose, Mark Parris, Chakib Sbiti and Mehmet 
Ög ˘ütçü) make up exactly half the board and are responsible for 
ensuring that the management and decisions of the board are 
properly checked and balanced. Rodney Chase (as chairman)  
was considered independent at the time of his appointment.  
In order to ensure the strongest possible governance the 
independent directors (plus the chairman) have a voting majority 
over the directors who are not independent. The independent 
directors meet in private session at the end of each scheduled 
board meeting.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
54 Annual Report 2014
The directors who are not independent include the founders  
of the Company (Nathaniel Rothschild, non-executive director; 
Tony Hayward, executive director and chief executive officer; 
and Julian Metherell, executive director and chief financial 
officer) plus Gulsun Nazli Karamehmet Williams and Murat Yazici 
who have been nominated for appointment to the board by Focus 
Investments and Elysion, respectively. 
The board considers that there is an appropriate balance between 
executive and non-executive, independent and non-independent 
directors, with a view to promoting shareholder interests and 
governing the business effectively. 
Board composition
The Company announced on 2
nd
 February 2015 that 
Julian Metherell would retire as a director of the Company at 
the conclusion of the 2015 AGM and leave the Company shortly 
thereafter. Julian will be succeeded by Ben Monaghan who 
will join the Company as chief financial officer.
Skills, knowledge, experience and attributes  
of directors
The board considers that a diversity of skills, background, 
knowledge, experience, perspective and gender is required  
in order to govern the business effectively. The board and its 
committees work actively to ensure that the executive and 
non-executive directors continue to have the right balance of 
skills, experience, independence and group knowledge necessary 
to discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the highest 
standards of governance.
The non-executive directors bring with them international 
and operational experience gained both in the sectors in which 
we operate and in other areas of business and public life. The 
executive directors bring additional perspectives to the board’s 
work through a deep understanding of the business. Together 
they oversee the strategy of the Group and monitor the pursuit  
of the corporate strategy. All directors are required to devote 
sufficient time and demonstrate commitment to their role.
Following his appointment as interim non-executive chairman 
of Glencore plc in May 2013, Tony Hayward was confirmed 
as the permanent non-executive chairman in May 2014. 
Having performed the role on a temporary basis for one  
year prior, the board was comfortable that Tony would, and  
is continuing to, devote sufficient time and commitment to  
his role as CEO of the Company.
Operation of the board
The chairman is responsible for ensuring that the board operates 
effectively. The board has an open style of communication and 
debates issues openly and constructively within an environment 
that encourages healthy debate and challenge both inside and 
outside the boardroom.
The directors receive board papers and other relevant 
information in a timely manner ahead of meetings. Board papers 
are delivered through an electronic portal that enables directors 
to access them wherever they are in the world. The timely 
provision of relevant information to directors is vital in ensuring 
they are able to fulfil their role of effective oversight and 
challenge and for enabling the board to make effective decisions.
Directors’ induction and ongoing development
In order to govern the Group effectively, non-executive directors 
must have a clear understanding of the Group’s overall strategy, 
together with a sound knowledge of the business and the industry 
within which it operates. 
The chairman, together with the company secretary, is 
responsible for ensuring that all new directors receive a full, 
formal and tailored induction upon appointment to the board. 
This includes a detailed overview of the Company and its 
governance practices and meetings with key personnel from 
across the Group in order to develop a full understanding of  
the business, its strategy and business priorities in each area. 
Risk monitoring and reporting
The Group keeps under constant scrutiny the major risks to  
which its operations in all regions are exposed by leveraging its 
local expertise, industry knowledge and strategic relationships.  
In particular, the Group continues to have a regular dialogue  
with its key stakeholders in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, such  
as the KRG, the Turkish government and other regional public 
bodies. We maintain similar relationships within the Africa region 
to ensure the risks across the organisation as a whole are fully 
understood and mitigated.
The Group’s risk management process, established by the 
executive committee and endorsed by the board, is used to 
identify the key risks to the business, the controls by which  
these are managed, and how these controls are monitored.  
The executive committee reviews and updates the risk 
management process and the risks identified on a quarterly  
basis and the board reviews these annually.
Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties to which 
the Group’s operations are exposed, and the framework within 
which these risks are managed, are set out on pages 38 and 42 
of this annual report. 55 www.genelenergy.com

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
Board effectiveness 
In 2014, as in 2013, we conducted an internal review of board effectiveness building on the findings of the last two reviews. 
The review was facilitated by the company secretary. In accordance with best practice it is our intention to commission an 
external review in 2015.
2013 actions for the year Progress made against the actions
Board composition  
and balance
Existing board composition was found  
to be working well and reflected a diverse 
range of depth and breadth of experience 
from existing board members. It was agreed 
that as in previous years, and should the 
opportunity arise to refresh the board, 
the nomination committee would use the 
opportunity to increase the E&P experience 
and possibly female representation on 
the board.
During 2014 the composition of the board 
was kept under review.
Strategy It was recognised that the business  
has a clear strategic agenda against which  
it continues to deliver. It was felt that the 
continued development of the CSR strategy 
should be a focus for the year.
A revised CSR policy and investment 
guidelines were adopted. This provides a 
framework within which our community 
programme can operate effectively.
Board development The directors considered that they would 
benefit from additional site visits to our 
assets. It was agreed that directors would  
be invited to accompany management 
as appropriate.
Two education sessions were held during the 
year, one on our CSR strategy and approach 
and a second on our drilling operations. In 
addition, certain directors made site visits to 
our assets. However, the security situation 
restricted the ability of the board as a whole 
to visit our assets in Kurdistan.
2014 actions 
Board composition  
and balance
The nomination committee will continue to keep under review the composition of the board 
with the aim of ensuring that an appropriate balance of skills and experience is present in 
the boardroom.
Strategy It was recognised that, whilst the Company had a clear strategic agenda for business 
development, in the context of a falling oil price and the insurgence of ISIS, the strategic 
agenda would be kept under close scrutiny in light of the risks facing the business. 
Risk management During the year, a head of internal audit was appointed to reflect the growing complexity  
of the business. The directors will keep under review the internal audit programme and the 
effectiveness of bringing internal audit in-house. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
56 Annual Report 2014
Internal controls
The board is responsible for maintaining and reviewing 
the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control. 
These systems are designed to identify, evaluate and manage 
the significant risks to which the Group is exposed. The board 
has established processes to meet the expectations of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code and those of a premium listed 
company. These processes will be developed further during  
2015 to reflect the most recent changes to the code requiring 
companies to publish long-term viability statements and to 
continually monitor systems of risk management and internal 
control. These processes include having clear lines of 
responsibility, documented levels of delegated authority and 
appropriate operating procedures. We recognise that the system 
is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable, 
and not absolute, assurance against misstatement or loss. 
The audit committee supports the board in the performance  
of its responsibilities by reviewing those procedures that relate  
to risk management processes and financial controls. The audit 
committee considers the reports of the internal audit function 
and the external auditor and reports to the board on such matters 
as it feels should be brought to the board’s attention.
A detailed budget is produced annually in accordance with our 
financial processes and reviewed and approved by the board  
in November. Operational reports are provided to the executive 
committee on a monthly basis and performance against the 
budget kept under regular review in accordance with the Group’s 
financial procedures manual. The chief executive officer reports  
to the board on performance and key issues as they arise.
The assessment of controls and risk management processes 
provides a reasonable basis for the board to make proper 
judgements on an ongoing basis as to the financial position  
and prospects of the Group.
The board has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the 
system of internal controls for the year ended 31
st
 December 2014 
and up to the date of the signing of the financial statements, and  
is satisfied that it remains appropriate to the business.
Communication with stakeholders
Part of the Group’s code of conduct sets a framework for how  
it partners with, and invests in, communities (local, regional 
and global) to achieve mutual long-term benefits. The Group 
contributes to socio-economic development through taxes, 
royalties and other local payments and donations. Further  
details of our community programmes can be found on  
pages 36 to 37 of this annual report.
2015 AGM
The 2015 AGM will be held on Tuesday, 21
st
 April 2015 at 
Goldman Sachs International, Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet 
Street, London, EC4A 2BB UK at 11.00am. The notice of AGM 
accompanies this annual report and sets out the business to be 
considered at the meeting. The AGM will provide an opportunity 
for shareholders to meet with the directors and senior 
management. Both this annual report and the notice of 
AGM are available on our website at www.genelenergy.com
Communication with institutional investors
We communicate on a regular basis with all our shareholders 
via presentations, calls and scheduled investor trips as part of 
our annual investor calendar. We also liaise with them on an ad 
hoc basis as and when questions arise.
Our major shareholders are also invited to meet with the 
chairman and company secretary to discuss any matters that 
they would like to raise outside the formal investor calendar. 
Several such meetings took place during the year and we 
welcome an open dialogue with our investors. 
The board receives investor relations updates at each scheduled 
board meeting covering key investor meetings and activities,  
as well as shareholder and investor feedback. 
We also engage with our shareholders at our AGM and via our 
website at www.genelenergy.com
Board committees
The board has established five committees: the audit committee, 
the remuneration committee, the nomination committee,  
the health, safety, security and environment committee and  
the political risk committee. These committees have adopted 
terms of reference under which authority is delegated by the 
board and copies of which are available on our website at

AUDIT COMMITTEE
Internal audit
During 2014, the board and the committee together with 
management reviewed the Company’s approach to internal audit 
taking into consideration the increasing size and complexity of 
the Group. Following this review it was felt appropriate to appoint 
a full time head of internal audit and this position was filled in 
September 2014. The committee met privately without the 
presence of management with the new head of internal audit 
following his appointment. For the majority of 2014, KPMG 
continued to perform the role of internal audit and deliver on 
the Group’s internal audit plan. 
External audit
The effectiveness and the independence of the external auditor  
are key to ensuring the integrity of the Group’s published 
financial information. Prior to the commencement of the audit, 
the committee reviews and approves the audit plan. PwC present 
to the committee their proposed plan of work which is designed 
to ensure that there are no material misstatements in the 
financial statements. 
The committee monitors and approves the provision of non-audit 
services by the Company’s external auditors and has in place a 
policy on non-audit services. The provision of non-audit services 
is generally limited to services that are closely connected to the 
external audit or to projects that require a detailed understanding 
of the Group (for example, taxation advice) which require 
pre-authorisation by the committee under the terms of the policy.
The level of non-audit fees for 2014 was $300,000, further 
details of which can be found on page 97 of the notes to the 
financial statements. These fees reflect the services and advice 
provided by PwC in respect of tax during the year. PwC have been 
appointed as the Company’s auditors for the past three years 
following a tendering process in 2011. When considering the 
re-appointment of the Company’s external auditors, the 
committee reviewed the external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity and the overall effectiveness of the audit process.
At its meeting in November 2014, the committee reviewed  
the effectiveness of the external audit process. It reviewed  
papers from both management and the external auditors,  
which set out the planning and execution of the audit process. 
The audit committee met privately with the external auditors in 
the absence of management for further discussions. Following  
this review, the audit committee was satisfied that the external 
auditor remains both effective and independent and on that  
basis we will be recommending their reappointment at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
The committee reviewed its own effectiveness during the year.  
The committee has also reviewed its terms of reference following 
the publication of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code  
to ensure they reflect its responsibilities in the context of the 
review of internal financial control systems and financial risk 
management systems. The committee terms of reference

 — Providing the board with an independent assessment of the 
political risk environment as it affects the Company and the 
board’s decision making
 — Monitoring and keeping under review political developments

Political risk is one of the highest duties of the board, the  
focus and rigour of which is overseen by the committee. 
During 2014, due to the impact of changes to the political 
landscape on the business, it was agreed that the committee 
would meet more regularly and conduct its discussions with 
the whole board present. This would better ensure a deeper 
understanding of the political landscape by all directors rather 
than just by committee members. 
In addition and as part of this oversight the committee chairman 
is in regular dialogue with management.  WE CONTINUE TO OFFER  
A CLEAR REMUNERATION 
STRUCTURE
On behalf of the remuneration committee, I am pleased to 
present the directors’ remuneration report for the year ended  
31 December 2014. 
Although as a Jersey registered company there is no legal 
requirement for us to prepare our remuneration report in 
accordance with the UK legislation on the disclosure of executive 
remuneration, it is the policy of Genel to comply with the highest 
standards of corporate governance and we have chosen to do  
so voluntarily. Consequently, we have prepared our report in 
accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended), 
as well as the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and the UK Listing Rules as they apply to premium listed 
companies. We trust that you welcome this and find our report 
both clear and informative.
Our remuneration policy remains unchanged. We continue 
to offer a clear remuneration structure for our executives with 
four components: base salary, a cash supplement in lieu of  
all benefits (including pension), an annual cash bonus and awards 
under the performance share plan (PSP) that have to be earned. 
Furthermore, any shares vesting under the PSP are normally 
retained for an additional three years, making this a six year 
period from award to unrestricted ownership.
Our remuneration policy has been designed to appropriately 
support the delivery of our strategic objectives. Both the annual 
bonus and PSP awards have stretching performance targets 
that have to be met and are aligned to the Company’s strategy. 
As I have outlined, our policy is to adopt the highest standards of 
corporate governance and accordingly we will also comply with 
the remuneration reporting regulations of the FRC as set out in 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. We will therefore introduce 
clawback provisions for both the annual bonus and the PSP with 
performance periods commencing in 2015 and beyond. 
Remuneration for 2014
Details of our remuneration decisions for 2014 are set out in the 
directors’ annual report on remuneration on pages 62 to 66. 
For the year ended 31
st
 December 2014 details of the performance 
of the Company included net working interest production of 
69,000 boepd, a 58% increase year-on-year, with growth driven 
by the onset of exports through the KRI-Turkey pipeline and 
processing capacity increases at the Taq Taq field. 
Further upgrades to the Taq Taq and Tawke facilities sanctioned 
during 2014 should lead to further significant volume growth 
during 2015. This led to an increase in revenue and operating 
profit before exploration and write off expense of 49 per cent. 
On our KRI gas assets, we reached an agreement with the 
Ministry of Natural Resources of the KRG for the development 
of the Miran and Bina Bawi fields. Alongside the proposed 
acquisition of OMV’s stake in Bina Bawi, this will deliver attractive 
life of field returns and unlock significant value in Genel’s gas 
business. The Company also capitalised on attractive debt market 
fundamentals by issuing $500m of 7.5% senior unsecured bonds. 
This strengthened an already robust balance sheet and leaves the 
Company well positioned to execute its growth plans.
To reflect performance in the year, the Company has awarded 
Tony Hayward, the chief executive officer, and Julian Metherell, 
the chief financial officer, 90% of their maximum opportunity 
of the annual bonus which is slightly less than in the prior year. 
PSP awards granted in 2012 vested at 82.5% of maximum based 
on TSR performance relative to the Company’s peer group over 
the three year period to 31 December 2014 resulting in 102,131 
and 65,992 shares being delivered to Tony Hayward and Julian 
Metherell respectively. These shares are subject to a further 
holding period of three years. 
Approach to 2015
Further details of how we will apply our remuneration policy 
throughout the coming year are set out on pages 65 to 66. 
As to salaries, and in line with the annual increase awarded to the 
Company’s employees at large, an increase of 3% was made to both 
Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell, resulting in their base annual 
salaries for 2015 being £705,000 and £490,000 respectively.
Structure of the report
This report is in two sections:
•  The directors’ annual report on remuneration on pages 62 to 66, 
which sets out the details of how our remuneration policy was 
implemented during 2014 and will be implemented in 2015. 
This report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at our 
2015 AGM, and;
• The directors’ remuneration policy report on pages 67 to 73. 
This contains details of the directors’ remuneration policy which 
was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. As there are 
no changes to our approved policy, this policy will not be put to 
this year’s AGM
Together with my fellow committee members and board 
colleagues, I will be available at our 2015 AGM to answer any 
questions regarding our policy on executive remuneration and 
the activities of the committee more generally.
On behalf of the committee, I would welcome any feedback and 
look forward to receiving your support.

during the year.
Advisers to the committee
The committee has appointed Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”)  
to provide independent advice on remuneration matters  
under consideration by the committee. They were appointed  
by the committee as it was felt they had the most relevant 
experience and expertise to advise the committee on 
remuneration related matters. 
Deloitte is a leading remuneration adviser and a member of  
the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily 
operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. Deloitte have also provided 
support and advice to the company including in respect of the 
operation of the Company’s share plans and advice in relation to 
employment arrangements for new employees below board level 
during the year. The committee is satisfied that the advice they 
have received has been objective and independent. Deloitte’s fees 
in respect of advice to the committee in the year under review 
were £84,700 and were charged on the basis of their standard 
terms of business for the advice provided.
The committee also consulted during the year with the chairman 
(Rodney Chase), CEO (Tony Hayward), CFO (Julian Metherell),  
HR director (Martha Desmond), the general counsel (Stephen 
Mitchell) and the company secretary (Sarah Robertson).  
No member of the committee nor any party from whom  
advice was sought participated in discussions regarding their  
own remuneration.

per share. They all elected to use their own funds and a proportion of their standard basic fee for the first two years of appointment to pay the subscription price. 
Accordingly, they were not eligible to receive the standard basic fee until 2
nd
 June 2013. They remained eligible to receive additional committee chairmanship fees 
during that period where applicable. The chairman of the board received the difference between his current fee of £260,000 p.a. and his original fee  
of £150,000 p.a.
(c)  Chakib Sbiti was appointed chairman of the HSSE committee on 22

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
Annual bonus
The 2014 annual bonus was measured against five key areas as 
shown in the table below:
Bonus performance measures Percentage
Operational and financial 35%
Safety and environment 15%
Build operational capability through people 15%
Corporate social responsibility 5%
Strategic objectives specific to the individual 30%
Based on the Company’s strong performance in all areas and a 
high level of individual performance from both executive directors 
in achieving key strategic milestones, the committee determined 
that bonuses for 2014 should be awarded at 90% of maximum.
The operational and financial targets are considered 
commercially sensitive so have not been disclosed. Safety and 
environmental performance was strong as demonstrated by 
the reduction in LTIs from three in 2013 to one in 2014 and the 
reporting of our greenhouse gas emissions for the first time this 
year. We continued to grow operational capability with a large 
number of staff completing development programmes during  
the year. We continued to evolve our CSR programme with the 
adoption of a Group-wide CSR plan and underlying policies 
ensuring a focused and consistent approach to CSR. 
The diagram below provides an indication of performance against 
each of the key business areas and further detail of performance  
is set out in the introduction from the remuneration committee 
chairman and in the strategic report. There was maximum 
performance in four areas, but the operational and financial 
element did not pay out in full. 
Performance share plan awards made in 2014 
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over 
shares in the Company with the number of options granted 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary. The 
2014 awards were based on a face value of 150% of salary for 
the CEO and 140% of salary for the CFO at the time of award.
The committee decided that, for the 2014 awards, it would continue  
to measure the performance of the Company against that of its 
sectoral peers using a relative TSR measure. The committee 
consider that TSR is the most appropriate measure to create 
maximum alignment with shareholders and encourage long-term 
value creation. The sectoral peer group for the 2014 PSP awards 
consisted of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Oil and Gas 
Producers Index as at the time of award, namely:
Afren Ophir Energy
BG Group Premier Oil
BP Royal Dutch Shell
Cairn Energy SOCO International
EnQuest Tullow Oil
Essar Energy

The percentage change in base salary and annual bonus for all 
employees reflects an increase in the number of employees at 
lower levels in the organisation during the year which has the 
effect of reducing the average percentage change in base salary 
and annual bonus for all employees.
Relative importance of the spend on pay
The table below illustrates the current year and prior year  
overall expenditure on pay. The regulations require that we report 
distributions received by shareholders through dividends and 
share buy backs. It is currently the Company’s policy not to pay 
dividends, however, we did buy back shares during 2014. 
Remuneration paid to all employees $m

Remuneration paid to all employees represents total staff 
costs from continuing operations. The $16.6 million increase in 
staff costs relates to an increase in the number of employees 
(31.84% growth during 2014).
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2015
This section provides an overview of how the committee is 
proposing to implement our remuneration policy in 2015.
Base salary
In determining executive director salary increases for 2015, the 
committee took into consideration a number of factors including:
• The individual’s skills and experience
• Business performance
• Salary levels for similar roles within the industry
• Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group
The committee has decided that a salary increase of 3% would 
be made with effect from 1
st
 January 2015 in line with other UK 
employees. The table below shows base salaries from that date.
Base 
salary from 
1
st
 Jan 2015
T ony Hayward £705,000
Julian Metherell £490,000
Benefits
As outlined above, executive directors receive an additional 
cash supplement in lieu of all benefits, including pension, 
private health insurance, life assurance and company car 
provision. The cash supplement is not included in calculating 
bonus and long-term incentive quantum.
For 2015, the cash supplement remains set at 25% of base salary. 
The table below shows the resulting cash allowances for 2015.
Benefits 
allowance
£
T ony Hayward £176,250
Julian Metherell £122,500 DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
66 Annual Report 2014
Annual bonus
The target bonus for executive directors for 2015 remains at 
100% of base salary, with a maximum opportunity of 150% of 
base salary.
For 2015, the performance of each executive director will  
be measured 70% against Group metrics and 30% against 
individual performance. The Group metrics will be measured 
against three key areas as shown in the following table:
Bonus performance measures Percentage
Operational and financial 45%
Safety and environment 15%
Build operational capability through people 10%
The specific targets are considered commercially sensitive so 
have not been disclosed. However, the committee is committed 
to providing shareholders with as much context as possible on 
performance against the targets and the resulting outcomes, 
within commercial constraints, in the following year.
Performance share plan
PSP awards are granted in the form of nil-cost options over 
shares in the Company with the number of options granted 
determined by reference to a percentage of base salary. 
The 2015 awards, as for prior awards, will be based on a face 
value of 150% of base salary for the CEO at the time of award.
The committee continues to consider that TSR is the most 
appropriate measure to create maximum alignment with 
shareholders and encourage long-term value creation. 
The vesting of the PSP award will therefore continue to be 
determined based on the Company’s relative TSR against a 
sectoral peer group. During 2014 the committee reviewed the 
constituents of the FTSE 350 Oil and Gas Producers Index. 
The number of companies in the index has reduced in recent 
years. Therefore the committee considered supplementing this 
group with other oil and gas producers of a similar size and with 
similar operations. As a consequence of this review, for the 2015 
award, the TSR peer group will be as follows:
Afren Nostrum Oil & Gas
BG Group Ophir Energy
BP Premier Oil
Cairn Energy Royal Dutch Shell
DNO Seplat Petroleum
Dragon Oil SOCO International
Enquest Tullow Oil
Gulf Keystone
The vesting schedule will remain the same as for awards  
made in 2014, as outlined on page 63.
Clawback provisions
The committee has considered clawback in the context of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and will apply clawback 
provisions to both the annual bonus and the PSP where it is 
considered appropriate. Such circumstances may include a 
material misstatement of the Company’s audited results, 
misconduct of the individual and any error in the calculation of 
any performance condition. Clawback may be applied up to one 
year after payment for bonus awards and three years after 
vesting for PSP awards. In compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, PSP awards to executives are subject to malus 
provisions. Details of these provisions are set out in the policy 
report on page 69.
Chairman and non-executive director 
remuneration
The fee policy for the chairman and non-executive directors 
remains unchanged in 2015.
Role Fee
Non-executive chairman £260,000
Senior independent director No additional fee
Non-executive director fee £80,000
Additional fee for membership of  
two board committees £20,000

REMUNERATION POLICY REPORT
Our Policy was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM and there are no changes proposed in this period. Accordingly the Policy 
will not be put forward for approval at the 2015 AGM.
The committee keeps the Policy under review to ensure that it continues to promote the attraction, retention and motivation of  
the high performing executive talent required to deliver the business strategy, and the long-term success of the Company.
However, in line with the UK regulation, in the event that in any year the directors’ annual report on remuneration is not approved by 
shareholders, the committee’s intention is that the Policy will be reviewed and resubmitted to shareholders for approval at the next 
general meeting.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey rather than the UK. Accordingly, the Company does not have the benefit of the statutory 
protections afforded by the UK Companies Act 2006 in the event that there were to be any inconsistency between this Policy and  
any contractual entitlement or other rights of a director. Therefore, in the event that there were to be any payment which was 
inconsistent with this Policy, the Company would not have the statutory right, under section 226E of the UK Companies Act 2006,  
to recover such payments from its directors.

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
Notes to the policy table
The committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office notwithstanding that  
they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the  
terms of that payment were agreed:
 — before the Policy came into effect; or 
 — at a time when the relevant individual was not a director  
of the Company and, in the opinion of the committee, the 
payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming   
a director of the Company
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration (including awards under any of 
the Company’s share plans) and, in relation to an award or 
option over shares, the terms are ‘agreed’ at the time the 
award is granted.
Performance measures and targets
Annual bonus
The annual bonus performance measures are designed to provide 
an appropriate balance between incentivising executive directors  
to meet financial targets for the year and to deliver specific 
strategic, operational and personal goals. This balance allows  
the committee to review the Company’s performance in the 
round against the key elements of our strategy and appropriately 
incentivise and reward the executive directors.
Bonus targets are set by the committee each year to ensure  
that executive directors are focused on the key objectives for  
the next 12 months. In doing so, the committee takes into account  
a number of internal and external reference points, including the 
Company’s business plan.
PSP
The ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide long-term 
sustainable returns to shareholders. The committee currently 
considers that relative TSR is the most appropriate measure  
to assess the underlying financial performance of the business 
while creating maximum alignment with shareholders and 
encouraging long-term value creation. 
Malus provisions
Under the PSP and RSP, prior to vesting, the committee may 
cancel or reduce the number of shares awarded or impose 
additional conditions on an award in circumstances where the 
committee considers it to be appropriate. Such circumstances  
may include a material misstatement of the Company’s  
audited financial results, a material breach of health and  
safety regulations, a material failure of risk management  
or serious reputational damage to the Company.
The committee has considered malus provisions in the context  
of the annual bonus and is satisfied that malus is appropriately 
taken into account at the time the committee approves a 
bonus payment.
Plan rules
The PSP and RSP shall be operated in accordance with the rules 
of the plans as approved by shareholders and amended from  
time to time in accordance with those rules. In particular:
• The plan rules provide for adjustments in certain circumstances, 
for example, awards may be adjusted in the event of variation 
of the Company’s share capital, demerger, special dividend, 
reorganisation or similar event;
• In the event of a change of control of the Company, existing 
share awards will vest in line with the plan rules to the extent 
the committee determines, taking into account the extent to 
which any performance conditions (where applicable) have 
been satisfied and, unless the committee determines otherwise, 
the time elapsed since that time. The committee may, in the 
event of a winding-up of the Company, demerger, delisting, 
special dividend or other event which the committee considers 
may affect the price of shares, allow awards to vest on the 
same basis;
• The performance conditions may be replaced or varied if an 
event occurs or circumstances arise which cause the committee, 
acting fairly and reasonably, to determine that a substituted or 
amended performance condition would be more appropriate 
(taking into account the interests of the shareholders of the 
Company) provided that the amended performance condition 
would not be materially less difficult to satisfy; and
• The committee may elect, prior to vesting or exercise in the 
case of options, to deliver the value of vested awards as cash.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for our executive directors is designed in 
line with the remuneration principles that underpin remuneration 
across the Group. When making decisions in respect of executive 
director remuneration arrangements, the committee takes into 
consideration the pay and conditions for employees throughout 
the Group, including the local inflationary impact for the countries 
in which we operate. As stated in the policy table, salary increases 
are normally made with reference to the average increase for the 
wider employee population.
The Company places a significant focus on variable remuneration, 
ensuring that a meaningful proportion of remuneration across  
all employees is based on performance, through its operation  
of the annual bonus plan throughout the Group and participation 
in share incentive plans.
Genel is committed to strengthening and widening employee 
share ownership by the use of share incentives granted under  
our share plans. As a result approximately 90% of employees 
participate in our share plans.
The committee does not directly consult with our employees  
as part of the process of determining executive pay. However, 
there is wide employee participation in our share plans. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED

STRATEGIC  
REPORT
Non-executive directors may receive professional advice in 
respect of their duties with the Company which will be paid for  
by the Company. Non-executive directors will also be covered  
by the Company’s directors and officers insurance policy.
Recruitment policy
In determining remuneration for new appointments to the board, 
the committee will consider all relevant factors including, but not 
limited to, the calibre of the individual and their existing package, 
the external market and the existing arrangements for the 
Company’s current executive directors, with a view that any 
arrangements offered are in the best interests of the Company 
and shareholders and without paying any more than is necessary.
Where the new appointment is replacing a previous executive 
director, salaries and total remuneration opportunity may be 
higher or lower than the previous incumbent. If the appointee  
is expected to develop into the role, the committee may decide  
to appoint the new executive director to the board at a lower  
than typical salary. Larger increases (above those of the wider 
employee population) may be awarded over a period of time  
to move closer to market level as their experience develops. 
Benefits will normally be limited to those outlined in the 
remuneration policy table above. However, additional benefits 
may be provided by the Company where the committee considers  
it reasonable and necessary to do so. Such circumstances may 
include where an executive director is required to relocate in 
order to fulfil their duties. In such cases, a cash payment higher 
than the 25% of salary that is ordinarily paid would normally be 
provided under the Company’s standard expatriate policy in lieu 
of certain benefits, which may include the provision of a housing 
allowance, education support, health insurance, tax advice, a 
relocation or repatriation allowance and a home leave allowance.
It is expected that the structure and quantum of the variable  
pay elements would reflect those set out in the policy table  
above. However, the committee recognises that, as an 
independent oil and gas company, it is competing with global  
firms for its talent. As a result, the committee considers it 
important that the recruitment policy has sufficient flexibility  
in order to attract the calibre of individual that the Company 
requires to grow a successful business. 
Therefore:
• Under the annual bonus, the committee reserves the right  
to provide either a one-off or ongoing maximum bonus 
opportunity of up to 200% of salary if this is required to  
secure an external appointment
• The committee would also retain the discretion to flex the 
balance between annual and long-term incentives and the 
measures used to assess performance for these elements, 
whilst maintaining the intention that a significant portion of 
variable pay would be delivered in shares 
• Variable pay could, in exceptional circumstances, be delivered via 
alternative structures, again with the intention that a significant 
portion would be share-based, but in all circumstances subject 
to an ongoing over-riding cap of 600% of salary. This cap 
excludes any awards made to compensate the director for 
incentive awards or any other remuneration arrangements 
forfeited from their previous employer (see below)
The above flexibility will only be used if the committee believes 
such action is absolutely necessary to recruit and motivate a 
candidate from the global market. The committee commits  
to explain to shareholders the rationale for the relevant 
arrangements following any appointment. 
Where an executive director is appointed from within the  
Group, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy 
arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms  
and conditions. Similarly, if an executive director is appointed 
following an acquisition of or merger with another company, 
legacy terms and conditions would be honoured. 
The committee retains the discretion to make appropriate 
remuneration decisions outside the standard policy to meet  
the individual circumstances of the recruitment, when an  
interim appointment to fill an executive director role is made  
on a short-term basis or a non-executive director or the  
chairman takes on an executive function on a short-term basis.
Buy-outs
In order to facilitate recruitment, the committee may  
make a one-off award to ‘buy-out’ incentive awards and any  
other compensation arrangements that a new hire has had  
to forfeit on leaving their previous employer. In doing so, the 
Executive director service contracts
The key employment terms and other conditions of the current executive directors, as stipulated in their service contracts, 
are set out below.
Provision Policy

Termination 
payment
• It is the Company’s policy for new service contracts that it may terminate employment by making  
a payment in lieu of notice (PILON) equivalent to (i) 12 months’ base salary and (ii) the executive director’s 
annual benefit allowance
• For the current executive directors (T ony Hayward and Julian Metherell) any termination payment  
in lieu of notice is capped at a sum equal to (i) 12 months’ base salary, (ii) the executive director’s annual 
benefit allowance, and (iii) time pro-rated annual bonus, subject to performance conditions being met
• Upon termination by the Company, an executive director has a duty to mitigate, and use reasonable 
endeavours to secure alternative employment as soon as reasonably practicable. In T ony Hayward  
and Julian Metherell’s service contracts, there are specific provisions requiring a reduction in any phased 
PILON payments in the event that they find alternative employment
Remuneration  
and benefits
• Participation in all incentive plans, including the annual bonus and the PSP , is non-contractual. 
• Outstanding awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
72 Annual Report 2014
committee will take into account all relevant factors including  
any performance conditions attached to the forfeited awards,  
the likelihood of those conditions being met, the proportion of  
the vesting/performance period remaining and the form of the 
award (e.g. cash or shares). Where possible, the forfeited awards  
will normally be bought out on an estimated like-for-like basis. 
The committee is at all times conscious of the need to pay no 
more than is necessary, particularly when determining any 
possible buy-out arrangements.
Recruitment of chairman and non-executive directors
In the event of the appointment of a new chairman and/or 
non-executive director, remuneration arrangements will normally 
be in line with those detailed in the relevant table above. The 
service contract of an executive director may also be terminated 
immediately and with no liability to make payment in certain 
circumstances, such as the executive director bringing the Group 
into disrepute or committing a fundamental breach of their 
employment obligations.
Unless otherwise approved, an executive director may accept  
only one position as a non-executive director or non-executive 
chairman of a FTSE 100 company that is not a competitor of the 
Company, subject to prior notification to the chairman of the 
Company and the approval of the board or duly authorised 
committee thereof.
Policy on payment for loss of office
In the event that the employment of an executive director is 
terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between  
the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any 
incentive plans. 
The Company considers a variety of factors when considering 
leaving arrangements for an executive director, including 
individual and business performance, the obligation for  
the director to mitigate loss (for example by gaining new 
employment) and other relevant circumstances (e.g. ill health).
If the executive director’s employment is terminated by the 
Company, the executive director may receive a time pro-rated 
bonus, subject to remuneration committee discretion.
The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the 
relevant share plan rules. The following table summarises the 
leaver provisions of share plans under which executive directors 
may currently hold awards.

Our remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of 
stretching short-term and long-term performance targets, aligned with the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The committee 
considers the level of remuneration that may be received under different performance outcomes to ensure that this is appropriate in 
the context of the performance delivered and the value added for shareholders. 
The charts that follow provide illustrative values of the remuneration package for executive directors under three assumed performance

Prior to admission, the founders (including Nathaniel Rothschild, 
Tony Hayward and Julian Metherell) were issued C shares in 
Vallares Holding Company Limited (since renamed Genel Energy 
Holding Company Limited), known as founder securities.
These founder securities were put in place to encourage the 
founders to grow the Company following an acquisition in order 
to maximise value for holders of ordinary shares by entitling the 
founders to a share of the upside in the Company’s value once 
certain performance has been achieved. The performance 
conditions are summarised below. 
If within four years of the acquisition of Genel Enerji AS (i.e. by  
21
st
 November 2015) the closing price per ordinary share of the 
Company reaches for the period of any 20 trading days out of  
30 successive days the higher of:
• a compound rate of return of 8.5% on the admission value  
of £10, measured from the date of the completion of the 
acquisition; or
• an increase of 25% from the admission value of £10, adjusted 
for any matters which have an impact on the capital structure 
of the Company,
(in each case, the Threshold Price), or there is a change of control  
in the Company resulting from an offer above the Threshold Price 
the founders have the right to exchange their founder securities  
for ordinary shares in the Company to a value of 15% of the 
increase in value from the placing admission value of £10. 
The performance condition is also deemed satisfied if a founder 
is removed from the Board other than for cause. The Company  
has the option to settle founder securities by issuing shares  
or the equivalent in cash.
The founder securities were deemed to have vested immediately 
as no performance conditions exist in relation to their vesting. 
However, as explained above, there are performance conditions 
which need to be met prior to exchanging the founder securities 
for ordinary shares. 
The interests of the directors in the founder securities as at  
31
st
 December 2014 are set out in the table below:

in Genel Enerji AS (sellers) held 3,000,000 founder securities as of

st
 December 2014, representing 30% of the issued founder securities.  
If the market price of the ordinary shares exceeds £20 per share for 
20 trading days out of any 30 successive trading days, the aggregate 
interests of the sellers in the founder securities will be increased from 
30% to 40% and the interests of the other persons interested in  
founder securities will be reduced accordingly.

respects and no action may be taken by the Company in relation 
to, or offer made by the Company to the holders of, the voting

its Affiliates or any person acting in concert with a Seller

rights attaching to the suspended voting ordinary shares, 
in which case each holder of suspended voting ordinary shares  
on a show of hands shall have one vote, and on a poll shall be

each suspended voting ordinary share held. For the purposes  
of any resolution of a type referred to in paragraphs (i) to (iii)

the holders of the suspended voting ordinary shares shall be  
required to be convened or passed.

person to a person who is not a Seller or an Affiliate of any  
Seller, such suspended voting ordinary shares shall convert into 
voting ordinary shares (on a one-for-one basis) automatically 
upon, and contemporaneously with, registration by the Company 
(or its registrars) of the transfer in the register of members of 
the Company.
Upon:
(i)  a transfer of voting ordinary shares to a person who is  
not a Seller or an Affiliate of any Seller as a result of which the 
Seller’s Voting Shareholding is reduced below the Maximum 
Voting Percentage; or 
(ii)  any issue of further shares by the Company or conversion  
of suspended voting ordinary shares as referred to below, as  
a result of which the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding is reduced 
below the Maximum Voting Percentage, 
such number of suspended voting ordinary shares as, immediately 
following conversion, will result in the Sellers’ Voting Shareholding 
being equal to the Maximum Voting Percentage, shall convert  
into voting ordinary shares (on a one-for-one basis) automatically 
upon, and contemporaneously with, registration by the Company 
(or its registrars) of the transfer in the register of members of  
the Company or the issue of such further shares or conversion  
of such suspended voting ordinary shares. In any such case, each 
Seller and its Affiliates’ holding of suspended voting ordinary 
shares (whether held directly or on their behalf by an escrow 
agent) at the time of such transfer, issue or conversion shall be 
subject to conversion into voting ordinary shares in accordance 
with a written notice of instructions as to the proportion of the 
suspended voting ordinary shares held by each of them (including 
by an escrow agent on their behalf) to be converted. Such notice 
shall be executed by each Seller (or such nominee of a Seller as 
the relevant Seller may notify the Company in writing from time 
to time) and must be received by the Company at its registered 
address not less than five business days before registration by 
the Company (or its registrar) of the transfer in the register of 
members of the Company or the issue of such further shares  
or conversion of such suspended voting ordinary shares (the 
“Conversion Notice”) (in each case rounded up or down to the 
nearest whole number as determined by any director of the 
Company in his absolute discretion). The Company shall be  
under no obligation to verify the validity of any Conversion  
Notice (or notification of nominees) or the authority and  
capacity of the relevant signatory.
(c) Conversion at the instance of a Seller  
(or any Affiliate)
At any time, a Seller (or any of its Affiliates) shall be entitled  
(but shall not be bound) to require the Company to convert 
suspended voting ordinary shares held by such Seller (or such 
Affiliate) into voting ordinary shares, on a one-for-one basis,  
so long as such conversion does not result in the Sellers’ Voting 
Shareholding being more than the Maximum Voting Percentage.
(d) Conversion following a pre-emptive offer
If the Company makes an offer of suspended voting ordinary 
shares in accordance with the provisions of the articles of 
association, it shall be entitled to convert into voting ordinary 
shares, on a one for-one basis, any suspended voting ordinary 
shares issued to persons other than the Sellers or any of their 
respective Affiliates in connection with such offer.
Within 21 days after the conversion of any suspended voting 
ordinary shares into voting ordinary shares, the Company shall 
forward to the relevant Seller (or relevant Affiliate) at its own risk, 
free of charge, a definitive certificate for the appropriate number 
of fully paid up voting ordinary shares and a new certificate for 
any unconverted suspended voting ordinary shares comprised  
in the certificate surrendered by it. Pending the despatch of 
definitive certificates, transfers shall be certified against the 
register of members of the Company.
(e) General
The Company shall use best endeavours to procure that  
the voting ordinary shares arising on conversion of the  
suspended voting ordinary shares are admitted to the  
Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s 
market for listed securities.
No admission to listing or admission to trading shall be sought 
for the suspended voting ordinary shares whilst they remain 
suspended voting ordinary shares.
Restrictions on transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of shares in  
the Company other than (i) as set out in the articles of association 
(ii) pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code (iii) as imposed 
from time to time by law and regulation and (iv) as set out in the

or on voting rights. No person has any special rights of control 
over the Company’s share capital and all issued shares are

INFORMATION
STRATEGIC  
REPORT
Articles of association of the Company
Under the Jersey Companies Law, the capacity of a  
Jersey company is not limited by anything contained in its 
memorandum or articles of association. Accordingly, the 
memorandum of association of a Jersey company does  
not contain an objects clause. 
Certain provisions have been incorporated into the articles  
of association to enshrine rights that are not conferred by  
the Jersey Companies Law, but which the Company believes 
shareholders would expect to see in a company listed on  
the London Stock Exchange.
Provisions in the articles of association also require shareholders 
to make disclosures pursuant to chapter 5 of the Disclosure  
and Transparency Rules, and require the directors to comply  
with chapter 3 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules and 
themselves to require any persons discharging managerial 
responsibilities (within the meaning ascribed in the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules) in relation to the Company who are  
not directors to do so, and to use reasonable endeavours to 
procure that their own and such persons’ connected persons  
do so. The articles of association may be amended by a special 
resolution of the shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement of directors
The rules for the appointment and replacement of directors  
are set out in the articles of association. Certain additional 
provisions relating to the appointment of directors are included  
in the Relationship Agreement between the Company, Elysion 
and Focus Investments. 
Directors
The biographical details of the directors of the Company at  
the date of this annual report are set out on pages 44 to 47. 
Details of directors’ service agreements and letters of 
appointment are set out on pages 71 to 72. 
Details of the directors’ interests in the ordinary shares of the 
Company and in the Group’s long-term incentive schemes are set 
out in the remuneration report on page 64 of this annual report.
Details of directors submitting themselves for re-election  
at the AGM are set out in the notice of meeting.
Service contracts and letters of appointment for all directors  
are available for inspection at the registered office of the 
Company and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Subject to applicable law and the articles of association and  
to any directions given by special resolution, the business  
of the Company will be managed by the board, which may 
exercise all the powers of the Company.
Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this annual report, indemnities granted  
by the Company to the directors are in force to the extent 
permitted under Jersey law. The Company also maintains 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance cover, the level  
of which is reviewed annually. 
Related party transactions
Details of transactions with directors and officers are set  
out in note 27 to the financial statements on page 108 of this 
annual report. There were no other related party transactions  
to which the Company was a party during the period.
Agreements with substantial shareholders
Merger Agreement
On 7
th
 September 2011, the Company, Elysion Energy Holding  
B.V. (formerly Genel Energy Holdings B.V.), Focus Investments  
and PRM entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger 
Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase, 
and the Sellers agreed to sell, the entire issued ordinary share 
capital of Genel Energy International Limited in consideration  
for the issue of 130,632,522 ordinary shares (the “Consideration 
Shares”). The Merger Agreement was amended by a deed of 
amendment entered into on 29
th 
October 2011.
Due to the size of the interest the Sellers have in the Company 
following completion, the Sellers agreed that part of the 
consideration they received under the Merger Agreement would 
be in the form of suspended voting ordinary shares in order to 
ensure that the Sellers’ aggregate holding of voting ordinary 
shares does not exceed the Maximum Voting Percentage. 
The suspended voting ordinary shares will automatically convert 
into voting ordinary shares in the event of further equity issues 
by the Company, provided that, following conversion, the Sellers’ 
holding of voting ordinary shares does not exceed the Maximum 
Voting Percentage.
Notwithstanding any other restriction or obligation under the 
Merger Agreement, PRM was permitted to distribute all ordinary 
shares owned by it to its shareholders in proportion to the  
shares in PRM held by such shareholders, which it duly made 
on 8
th
 April 2013. In connection with this distribution, the relevant 
PRM shareholders agreed to be bound by the terms of the  
Merger Agreement.
Relationship Agreement
On 7
th
 September 2011, the Company, Elysion and Focus 
Investments entered into a relationship agreement which 
regulates the ongoing relationship between Elysion, Focus 
Investments and the Company (the ‘Relationship Agreement’).
The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement is to  
ensure that the Company is capable at all times of carrying on  
its business independently of Elysion and Focus Investments  
(and their respective Associates) and that all transactions  
and relationships between the Company, Elysion and Focus 
Investments are at arm’s length and on a normal commercial 
basis. For the purposes of the Relationship Agreement, the  
term ‘Associate’ includes, in the case of Elysion, Mehmet  
Sepil and, in the case of Focus Investments, Mehmet  
Emin Karamehmet.
On 12
th
 February 2015 the Relationship Agreement was amended  
to reflect changes to the Listing Rules that apply to controlling 
shareholders. Whilst the Relationship Agreement reflected the 
majority of the requirements we felt it prudent to amend it to 
align it to the specific obligations under Listing Rule 6.1.4(d).
The Relationship Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of 
(i) the Company ceasing to have any of its ordinary shares listed 
on the Official List and admitted to trading on the London Stock 
Exchange’s main market for listed securities, and (ii) Elysion and 
Focus Investments together with their respective Associates 
ceasing between them to be entitled to exercise, or control the 
exercise of, in aggregate 10% or more of the Voting Rights. OTHER STATUTORY AND REGULATORY INFORMATION CONTINUED
78 Annual Report 2014
Pursuant to the terms of the Relationship Agreement, it has  
been agreed that, among other things:
(a)  For so long as Elysion and Focus Investments and their 
respective Associates are, between them, entitled to exercise 
or control the exercise of, in aggregate, 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, each of Elysion and Focus Investments will, and 
will procure so far as it is reasonably able to do so, that each 
of its Associates will:
 (i)  not take any action which precludes or inhibits any 
member of the Group from carrying on its business 
independently of each of Elysion and Focus 
Investments and their respective Associates;
 (ii)  not exercise any of its Voting Rights to procure 
any amendment to the articles of association of 
the company which would be inconsistent with or 
breach any provision of the Relationship Agreement;
 (iii)  if and for so long as paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the 
Listing Rules applies to the Company, abstain from 
voting on any resolution required by paragraph 
11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to approve a ‘related 
party transaction’ (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5R  
of the Listing Rules) involving Elysion or Focus 
Investments or any of their Associates as the  
related party;
 (iv)  comply with all provisions of the Listing Rules,  
the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, the 
requirements of the London Stock Exchange and the 
FSMA that apply to it in connection with 
the Company;
 (v)  ensure that the business and affairs of the Company 
are conducted in accordance with its articles of 
association; and
 (vi)  exercise all of its Voting Rights in a manner 
consistent with the intention that at all times at least 
half of the directors (excluding the chairman) are 
independent non-executives and that certain 
committees of the board shall comply with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code;
(b)  For so long as Elysion and Focus Investments and their 
respective Associates are, between them, entitled to exercise 
or control the exercise of, in aggregate, 10% or more of the 
Voting Rights, each of Elysion and Focus Investments will, and 
will procure that each of its Associates will:
 (i)  conduct all transactions and arrangements with any 
member of the Group on arm’s length and on normal 
commercial terms;
 (ii)  not take any action that would have the effect of 
preventing the Company from complying with its 
obligations under the Listing Rules; and
 (iii)  not propose or procure the proposal of a 
shareholder resolution which is intended or appears 
to be intended to circumvent the proper application 
of the Listing Rules; 
(c)  Provided that Focus Investments and its Associates are 
entitled to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more  
of the Voting Rights, Focus Investments shall be entitled to 
nominate for appointment to the board one director by 
giving notice to the Company;  
(d)  Provided that Elysion and its Associates are entitled to 
exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the Voting 
Rights, Elysion shall be entitled to nominate for appointment 
to the board one director by giving notice to the Company;
(e)  For as long as Elysion and Focus Investments and their 
respective Associates are between them entitled to exercise 
or control the exercise of 10% or more of the Voting Rights, 
but provided neither Elysion nor Focus Investments (in each 
case, together with its Associates) is entitled to exercise or

Elysion and Focus Investments will, acting jointly, be entitled 
to nominate for appointment to the board one director  
by giving notice to the Company;
(f)  Provided that Elysion and its Associates are between them 
entitled to exercise or to control the exercise of, in aggregate, 
10% or more of the Voting Rights, Mehmet Sepil will have

 (i)  Elysion, Focus Investments and their respective 
Associates are between them entitled to exercise or  
to control the exercise of, in aggregate, 20% or 
more of the Voting Rights; and
 (ii)  the voting ordinary shares are admitted to the  
Standard Listing segment of the Official List, if the  
Group is proposing (with board approval) to enter 
into any transaction for the acquisition or disposal of 
assets where the aggregate consideration to be paid 
or received by the Group in respect of such 
transaction would exceed US$1.5 billion (or its 
equivalent in any other currency at the prevailing 
exchange rates), unless Elysion and Focus 
Investments otherwise give their prior written 
consent, the board will convene a general meeting 
of shareholders in order to obtain prior approval for 
the proposed transaction from the Company’s 
shareholders and ensure that any agreement 
effecting the proposed transaction is conditional on 
that approval being obtained; and
(h)  For so long as Elysion or Focus Investments together with 
their respective Associates are between them entitled 
to exercise or to control the exercise of, in aggregate,  
10% or more of the Voting Rights, subject to compliance by 
the Company with its legal and regulatory obligations, the 
Company shall procure that Elysion and Focus Investments 
are provided with financial and other information as is 
necessary or reasonably required by them for the purposes  
of their accounting or financial control requirements or to 
comply with their legal or tax obligations as a shareholder  
of the Company.
The rights described at (b)–(h) above will terminate and cease 
to be of any effect:
 (i)  in the case of Elysion, in the event that it, or any 
Affiliate (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of 
Elysion that holds any ordinary shares) ceases to be 
controlled by Mehmet Sepil; or
 (ii)  in the case of Focus Investments, in the event that  
Focus Investments (or any Affiliate (as defined in 
the Merger Agreement) of Focus Investments that 
holds any ordinary shares) ceases to be controlled 
by Mehmet Emin Karamehmet.
In addition, the rights of Elysion under the Relationship 
Agreement (subject to certain exceptions) shall terminate  
and cease to be of any effect in the event that Mehmet Sepil 
ceases to beneficially own (directly or indirectly through other 
entities controlled by Mehmet Sepil) ordinary shares carrying, 
in aggregate, 10% or more of the Voting Rights. 79 www.genelenergy.com

Chief executive officer STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
80 Annual Report 2014
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, 
directors’ remuneration report and the Group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
The directors prepare financial statements for each financial  
year. The directors are required by the IAS Regulation to prepare 
the Group financial statements under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. 
The directors must not approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing the financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies
• present information, including accounting policies, in a  
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance and 
• make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as  
a going concern
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in Jersey or the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group  
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken  
as a whole; 
• the directors’ report contained in this annual report includes 
a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the Company and the Group 
together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
• the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

REPORT ON THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our opinion
In our opinion, Genel Energy plc’s group financial statements (the “financial statements”):
• give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 31
st
 December 2014 and of its loss and cash flows for the year 
then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European 
Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
What we have audited
Genel Energy plc’s financial statements comprise:
• consolidated balance sheet as at 31
st
 December 2014;
• consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;
• consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is applicable law and IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. 
In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also 
addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the 
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as ‘areas of focus’ in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order 
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be 
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.
Our audit approach
Overview
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas of 
focus
• Overall Group materiality: US$45.0 million which represents 1% of total assets.
• We performed an audit of the complete financial information of two reporting units, 
either due to their size or their risk characteristics. These reporting units relate 
principally to the assets in Kurdistan.
• Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were performed on 
10 other reporting units, relating to exploration activity in Malta and the African 
territories, operating expenses and the bond accounting in the UK.
• Impairment of oil and gas properties.
• PSC revenue recognition and interpretation. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GENEL ENERGY PLC CONTINUED
82 Annual Report 2014
Area of focus How our audit addressed the area of focus
IFRS6 and IAS36 impairment reviews of oil 
and gas properties (Note 11 and Note 12 of 
the accounts)
During 2014, management continued to assess information 
obtained from their drilling campaigns in Africa (including 
Malta) to determine whether there were grounds for 
continuing to carry the exploration costs relating to these 
exploration assets on the balance sheet. 
Impairment triggers were noted on the Sidi Moussa and 
Juby Maritime, Malta Area 4 and Angola Block 38 and 
Block 39 licences after wells drilled on the licences did not 
encounter commercial oil and were subsequently plugged 
and abandoned. Based on these results, full write-offs 
were recorded on these exploration assets totalling 
US$471.1million.
In 2014, there has been a certain amount of instability 
in Iraq. In addition, the oil price declined in the last 
three months of the year. Both give rise to potential 
impairment indicators for the producing assets of the 
Group in Kurdistan. 
Impairment triggers were identified in the Kurdistan 
non-operated producing field, Dohuk, as reserves were 
determined to be significantly below the initial estimates. 
An asset write-off $80.9million has been recognised in 
relation to this. 
We assessed management’s evaluation of each of the exploration  
assets in both the Africa (including Malta) and Kurdistan portfolios and 
corroborated this evaluation by making enquiries with management and 
reviewing information in the public domain such as press releases from 
joint venture partners. 
We agreed with management on the impairment triggers for the Sidi 
Moussa and Juby Maritime, Malta Area 4 and Angola Block 38 and 39 
licences based on examination of the results of drilled wells, and agreed 
with management’s assessment that the assets were fully written off 
as a result. 
In 2013 management temporarily suspended exploration activity in 
Somaliland due to security concerns. We found that the carrying 
value of the Somaliland asset continues to be supported by comparable 
farm-in transactions in Somaliland after the temporary suspension of 
operations by the Group and by ongoing discussions with the Somaliland 
Government in order to facilitate a resumption of activity. 
We evaluated management’s assessment for impairment triggers in its 
producing assets in Kurdistan and compared their assessment to our 
understanding of their operations and reserves base, and performed an 
independent assessment of market available data on long term oil prices 
as at 31
st
 December 2014 against management’s assessment of long 
term oil prices. 
Outside of Dohuk, management did not identify an impairment trigger  
in the Kurdistan assets and no impairment has been recorded in relation 
to these assets. Based on our assessment of the long-term oil price we 
agreed with management’s assessment. 
After making several enquiries with management and reviewing the  
joint venture party press release, we agreed with management on the 
impairment triggers noted in Dohuk and the asset write-off recorded.
PSC revenue recognition and interpretation
The Production Sharing Contracts (“PSCs”) to which the 
Group is a party are complex in nature and subject to 
potential alternative interpretation. 
The terms of the PSCs dictate the amount of revenue 
recognised by the Group. The Group maintains a working 
model which is built from the terms in the PSCs. The main 
inputs into the PSC model and calculation are volumes, 
price and capital expenditure. Once these inputs are 
entered into the PSC model, it calculates the revenue to be 
recognised in that particular period. There is an inherent 
risk that these inputs are not accurate and that the 
interpretations and calculations made are not appropriate.
Certain assumptions and estimates are made within the 
PSC model. This complexity of the PSCs and alternative 
interpretations could result in misstatements in various 
balances in the financial statements.
In addition, during 2014 management assessed that the 
accruals basis of accounting was appropriate for the 
recognition of export sales. The move from cash 
accounting to accruals accounting is based on 
management’s ability to reliably estimate the amount  
of revenue earned, confidence in receiving cash and its 
relationship with the Kurdistan Regional Government 
(“KRG”). Since export sales increased in the second half  
of the year, the debtor with the KRG increased significantly 
at year end.
We designed our procedures to test that the revenue recorded is in 
accordance with the PSCs and tested the calculations in the PSC model. 
The Group’s share of revenue is dependent on volumes sold, capital 
expenditure on the underlying asset and sales prices. We tested the 
capital expenditure by agreeing a sample of transactions to third party 
evidence. We tested the volumes sold and prices as follows:
• Volume of oil sold – for a sample of domestic and export sales, we 
agreed the internal daily production reports to third party signed 
volume reports and third party signed loading documents. Our testing 
did not identify any material misstatements.
• Pricing of oil sold – for a sample of domestic sales, we agreed the  
price recognised to Kurdistan Regional Government ministerial pricing 
orders. For export sales, we assessed the pricing assumptions made by 
management. We compared the pricing estimates to historical pricing 
information provided by third parties and to industry and market 
available data. We found that management’s estimates fell within  
a reasonable range indicated by this comparative data.
We reconciled the financial statements to the revenue calculated in the 
PSC models. No differences were noted.
We assessed whether management’s decision to recognise exports sales 
on an accruals basis was appropriate based on the requirements of IFRS 
(IAS 18 ‘Revenue’) and the latest available information. We found that 
the move to accruals accounting for exports was supportable under the 
requirements of IFRS based on pricing information obtained from the 
KRG during 2014 and management’s assessment of the ability of the 
KRG to fund its obligations under the PSCs. 83 www.genelenergy.com

DIRECTORS’ REPORT  
AND GOVERNANCE
STRATEGIC  
REPORT
How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed 
enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic 
structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, 
and the industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured along two business segments being 
the geographic areas in which it operates: Kurdistan and Africa 
(which includes Malta). The Group financial statements are a 
consolidation of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating 
businesses in these segments and centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, 
we determined the type of work that needed to be performed 
at the reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 
two reporting units. Because of its size, the majority of our audit 
work was performed on one of these - the main trading entity  
for Kurdistan assets. We also performed specified procedures  
on certain account balances within the other reporting units, 
including the audit of the following items: exploration expenses 
within the entities that hold the Africa (including Malta) 
exploration licences, operating expenses and related payables 
within UK and Ankara companies and cash and cash equivalents 
and the bond in the UK. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. 
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to 
determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of 
misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements 
as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined 
materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report 
to them misstatements identified during our audit above 
US$2.2 million (2013: US$2.0 million) as well as misstatements 
below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for 
qualitative reasons.
Overall group 
materiality
US$45.0 million (2013: US$40.0 million).
How we 
determined it
1% of total assets.
Rationale for 
benchmark 
applied
In FY13, we calculated materiality using a  
total assets benchmark and applied a ‘rule  
of thumb’ of 1%. We have not changed this 
benchmark or rule of thumb for FY14.  
We used this benchmark, rather than an 
income statement benchmark, in determining 
materiality because a significant portion of the 
value of the Group is locked up in exploration 
and production oil and gas assets (i.e. the 
balance sheet) and therefore we believed an 
asset measure remained more relevant.
We used a lower specific materiality of  
US$10 million (2013: US$7 million) for the 
following areas: revenue, cost of sales, 
exploration expense, operating expense 
and interest expense. Additionally we 
applied a materiality of US$0.5 million 
on the remuneration report and related 
party transactions.
Going concern
The directors have voluntarily complied with Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)
(3) of the Financial Conduct Authority and provided a statement 
in relation to going concern, set out on page 31, required for 
companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange. 
The directors have requested that we review the statement on 
going concern as if the Company were a premium listed company. 
We have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial 
statements using the going concern basis of accounting. 
The going concern basis presumes that the group has adequate 
resources to remain in operation, and that the directors intend it 
to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial 
statements were signed. As part of our audit we have concluded 
that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Other required reporting
Consistency of other information - ISAs (UK & Ireland) 
reporting
The directors have chosen to voluntarily comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (“the Code”) as if the Company were 
a premium listed company. Under ISAs (UK & Ireland) we are 
required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• Information in the Annual Report and Accounts (the “Annual 
Report”) is:
 — Materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or
 — Apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired  
in the course of performing our audit; or
 — Otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
• The statement given by the directors on page 80, in accordance 
with provision C.1.1 of the Code, that they consider the annual 
report taken as a whole to be fair, balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for members to assess 
the Group’s performance, business model and strategy is 
materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
• The section of the annual report on page 57, as required by 
provision C.3.8 of the Code, describing the work of the audit 
committee does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the audit committee.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF GENEL ENERGY PLC CONTINUED
84 Annual Report 2014
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information 
and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions 
to report arising from this responsibility.
Other voluntary reporting
Opinions on additional disclosures
Strategic report and directors’ report
In our opinion, the information given in the strategic report and 
the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Directors’ remuneration report
The Company voluntarily prepares a directors’ remuneration 
report in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies  
Act 2006. The directors have requested that we audit the part  
of the directors’ remuneration report specified by the Companies 
Act 2006 to be audited as if the parent company were a UK 
registered listed company.
In our opinion, the part of the directors’ remuneration report to 
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006.
Corporate governance statement
The Company voluntarily prepares a corporate governance 
statement that includes the information with respect to internal 
control and risk management systems and about share capital 
structures required by the Disclosure Rules and Transparency 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority. The directors have 
requested that we report on the consistency of that information 
with the financial statements. 
In our opinion the information given in the corporate governance 
statement set out page 50 with respect to internal control and 
risk management systems and about share capital structures is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matter on which we have agreed to report 
by exception
Corporate governance statement
The company’s voluntary corporate governance statement 
includes details of the company’s compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The directors have requested  
that we review the parts of the corporate governance statement 
relating to the company’s compliance with the ten provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for auditor review 
by the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority as if the 
company were a premium listed company. We have nothing to 
report having performed our review.
Responsibilities for the financial statements 
and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 80, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs 
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing 
the directors’ judgements against available evidence, 
forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures 
in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other 
auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to 
provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain 
audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, 
substantive procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information 
in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the 
audited financial statements and to identify any information that 
is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course  
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.

Summary of significant 
accounting policies 
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements of Genel Energy Plc 
(the Group) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted  
by the European Union (IFRS) and interpretations issued  
by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) are prepared 
under the historical cost convention and comply with Jersey 
company law. The significant accounting policies are set  
out below and have been consistently applied throughout  
the period. 
Items included in the financial information of each of the 
Group‘s entities are measured using the currency of the 
primary economic environment in which the entity operates 
(the functional currency). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in US dollars to the nearest  
million ($m) rounded to one decimal place, except where 
otherwise indicated.  
For explanation of the key judgements and estimates made  
by management in applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
refer to significant accounting estimates and judgement  
on pages 92 and 93. 
Going concern 
At the time of approving the consolidated financial 
statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation  
that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and  
therefore its consolidated financial statements have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Foreign currency 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the 
functional currency of the relevant entity using the exchange 
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or at the 
balance sheet date where items are re-measured. Foreign 
exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement  
of such transactions and from the translation at period-end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement  
of comprehensive income within finance income or  
finance costs. 
Consolidation  
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the 
Company and its subsidiaries. These accounting policies  
have been adopted by all Group companies.  
Subsidiaries 
Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities)  
over which the Group has control. The Group controls  
an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, 
variable returns from its involvement with the entity and  
has the ability to affect those returns through its power  
over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from  
the date on which control is transferred to the Group.  
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. 
Transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions 
between Group companies are eliminated. 
Joint arrangements 
Arrangements under which the Group has contractually 
agreed to share control with another party or parties are  
joint ventures where the parties have rights to the net assets 
of the arrangement, or joint operations where the parties 
have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities 
relating to the arrangement. Investments in entities over 
which the Group has the right to exercise significant  
influence but neither control nor joint control are classified  
as associates.  
Investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted 
for using the equity method, under which the investment  
is initially recognised at cost and subsequently adjusted for 
the Group’s share of post-acquisition income less dividends 
received and the Group’s share of other comprehensive 
income and other movements in equity, together with any 
loans of a long-term investment nature. Where necessary, 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint 
ventures and associates to bring the accounting policies  
used into line with those of the Group. In an exchange of 
assets and liabilities for an interest in a joint venture, the  
non-Group share of any excess of the fair value of the assets 
and liabilities transferred over the pre-exchange carrying 
amounts is recognised in income. Unrealised gains on other 
transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and 
associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest 
in them; unrealised losses are treated similarly but may also 
result in an assessment of whether the asset transferred  
is impaired.  
The Group recognises its assets and liabilities relating to its 
interests in joint operations, including its share of assets held 
jointly and liabilities incurred jointly with other partners.  
Acquisitions 
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting  
to account for business combinations. Identifiable assets 
acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a 
business combination are measured at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree at fair value at time of recognition  
or at the non-controlling interest‘s proportionate share of  
net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
Farm-in/farm-out  
Farm-out transactions relate to the relinquishment of an 
interest in oil and gas assets in return for services rendered 
by a third party or where a third party agrees to pay a portion 
of the Group’s share of the development costs (cost-carry). 
Farm-in transactions relate to the acquisition by the Group  
of an interest in oil and gas assets in return for services 
rendered or cost-carry provided by the Group. 
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the development 
or production phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted  
for as an acquisition or disposal of oil and gas assets. 
The consideration given is measured as the fair value  
of the services rendered or cost-carry provided and any gain 
or loss arising on the farm-in/farm-out is recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income. A profit is recognised  
for any consideration received in the form of cash to the 
extent that the cash receipt exceeds the carrying value  
of the associated asset. 
Farm-in/farm-out transactions undertaken in the exploration 
phase of an oil and gas asset are accounted for on a no 
gain/no loss basis due to inherent uncertainties in the 
exploration phase and associated difficulties in determining 
fair values reliably prior to the determination of commercially 
recoverable proved reserves.

Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Segmental reporting  
IFRS 8 requires the Group to disclose information about  
its business segments and the geographic areas in which  
it operates. It requires identification of business segments  
on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed  
by the entity’s chief operating decision maker in order to 
allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance. 
The Group has two reportable business segments: Kurdistan 
and Africa. These are described in note 2.  
Intangible assets  
Exploration assets 
Exploration assets are explained under oil and gas assets  
in property, plant and equipment below. 
Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets (predominately software) that are 
acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses. 
Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of intangible assets from the date they are available for use, 
unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets with an 
indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested  
for impairment at each balance sheet date.  
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment comprises the Group’s tangible 
oil and gas assets together with leasehold improvements  
and other assets and is carried at cost, less any accumulated 
depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost 
includes purchase price and construction costs together 
with borrowing costs where applicable for qualifying assets. 
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets  
are available for their intended use. 
Oil and gas assets 
Costs incurred prior to obtaining legal rights to  
explore are expensed immediately to the statement  
of comprehensive income. 
Exploration, appraisal and development expenditure is 
accounted for under the successful efforts method. Under  
the successful efforts method only costs that relate directly  
to the discovery and development of specific oil and gas 
reserves are capitalised as exploration and evaluation assets 
within intangible assets. Costs of activity that do not identify 
oil and gas reserves are expensed. 
All lease and licence acquisition costs, geological and 
geophysical costs and other direct costs of exploration, 
evaluation and development are capitalised as intangible 
assets or property, plant and equipment according to their 
nature. Intangible assets comprise costs relating to the 
exploration and evaluation of properties which the directors 
consider to be unevaluated until reserves are appraised as 
commercially viable, at which time, following an impairment 
review, they are transferred to property, plant and equipment 
and reclassified as development assets. Where properties are 
appraised to have no commercial value, the associated costs 
are expensed as an impairment loss in the period in which  
the determination is made. 
Development expenditure on producing assets is accounted 
for in accordance with IAS 16–Property, plant and equipment.  
Assets are depreciated once they are available for use  
and are depleted on a field-by-field basis using the unit of 
production method. The depreciation is calculated according 
to the Group’s share of production compared to its share  
of proved and probable reserves under the terms of the 
relevant PSC. The calculation of depreciation under the  
unit of production method takes account of estimated  
future development costs. Changes to depreciation rates  
as a result of changes in reserve quantities and estimates of 
future development expenditure are reflected prospectively.  
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual value, over the estimated useful lives  
of the assets using the straight-line method: 
Motor vehicles 5 years 
Computer equipment 3 years 
Other equipment  3-5 years 
The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment 
and their residual values are reviewed on an annual basis  
and, if necessary, changes in useful lives are accounted  
for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal  
or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference 
between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the 
asset and is recognised in the statement of comprehensive 
income for the relevant period. 
Subsequent costs 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item  
if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied 
within the part will flow to the Group, and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The net book value of the replaced  
part is expensed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing  
and maintenance of property, plant and equipment are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Leases 
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as 
operating leases. Payments made under operating leases  
(net of any incentives received from the lessor) are charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the period of the lease. 
Financial assets and liabilities 
Classification 
The Group assesses the classification of its financial assets  
on initial recognition as either at fair value through profit  
and loss, loans and receivables; or available for sale. The 
Group assesses the classification of its financial liabilities  
on initial recognition as fair value through profit and loss  
or amortised costs. 
Recognition and measurement 
Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised 
at fair value on the trade-date – the date on which the Group 
commits to purchase or sell the asset. Loans and receivables 
are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.  
Note 
1 
90 Annual Report 2014  
www.genelenergy.com 91
Trade and other receivables 
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for crude 
oil sales, sales of gas or services performed in the ordinary 
course of business. If collection is expected in one year or  
less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if 
longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they  
are presented as non-current assets. 
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method, less provision for impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement 
of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash in 
hand, deposits held on call with banks, other short-term  
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three 
months or less and includes the Group’s share of cash held  
in joint operations. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of 
transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently 
carried at amortised cost; any difference between the 
proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption  
value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive  
income over the period of the borrowings using the  
effective interest method. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are 
recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent  
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn 
down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down 
occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable 
that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee  
is capitalised as a pre-payment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. 
Borrowings are presented as long or short-term based on the 
maturity of the respective borrowings in accordance with the 
loan or other agreement. Borrowings with maturities of less 
than twelve months are classified as short-term. Amounts  
are classified as long-term where maturity is greater than 
twelve months. Where no objective evidence of maturity 
exists, related amounts are classified as short-term. 
Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair  
value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured  
at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable  
that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.  
Provisions are measured at management’s best estimate  
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the 
balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value 
where the effect is material. 
The unwinding of any discount is recognised as finance costs 
in the statement of comprehensive income. 
Decommissioning 
Provision is made for the cost of decommissioning assets  
at the time when the obligation to decommission arises.  
Such provision represents the estimated discounted liability 
for costs which are expected to be incurred in removing 
production facilities and site restoration at the end of the 
producing life of each field. A corresponding item of property, 
plant and equipment is also created at an amount equal to  
the provision. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the 
capital costs of the production facilities. Any change in the 
present value of the estimated expenditure attributable to 
changes in the estimates of the cash flow or the current 
estimate of the discount rate used are reflected as an 
adjustment to the provision. 
 
Offsetting  
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net  
amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and  
there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the 
asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Impairment  
Property, plant and equipment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are 
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there  
is any indication of impairment.  
If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable 
amount is estimated. 
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit  
is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of 
disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments  
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
Key assumptions in the discounted cash flows used to assess 
the fair value of property, plant and equipment are oil price, 
reserves and resources, operating expenditure and 
government deductions from revenue. 
For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped 
together into the smallest group of assets that generates  
cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets  
(cash generating unit). 
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount  
of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its  
recoverable amount. 
Non-financial assets that suffered impairment are reviewed 
for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. 
Financial assets 
A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it  
is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired  
if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimate of future cash flows  
of that asset.

An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured  
at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between  
its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated 
future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest 
rate. All impairment losses are recognised as an expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income. 
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised.  
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. 
Revenue 
Sales of petroleum are recognised when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer and the 
associated revenue can be reliably measured. Revenue is 
measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
excluding discounts, rebates, value added tax (VAT) and  
other sales tax or duty.  
The significant risks and rewards of ownership are deemed  
to have passed on delivery of crude oil to the customer at  
the point of loading and revenue is recognised accordingly to 
the extent that the receipt of cash is assessed as sufficiently 
probable and the amount of revenue can be reliably measured. 
Where income tax arising from the Group’s activities under 
production sharing contracts is settled by a third party  
at no cost and on behalf of the Group and where the  
Group would otherwise be liable for such income tax, the 
associated sales are shown gross including the notional tax 
and a corresponding income tax charge is presented in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
Employee benefits 
Short-term benefits 
Short-term employee benefit obligations are expensed to the 
statement of comprehensive income as the related service is 
provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to 
be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans  
if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to 
pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the 
employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
Share-based payments 
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The economic cost of awarding shares 
and share options to employees is recognised as an expense 
in the statement of comprehensive income equivalent to the 
fair value of the benefit awarded. The fair value is determined 
by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo 
and adjusted Black-Scholes models. The charge is recognised 
in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting 
period of the award.  
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate  
of the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. Any revision to the original estimates is  
reflected in the statement of comprehensive income with a 
corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent 
it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of 
the vesting period. The proceeds received net of any directly 
attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium when the options are 
exercised. 
Finance income and finance costs 
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested 
and foreign currency gains. Interest income is recognised  
as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Finance expense comprises interest expense on borrowings, 
and foreign currency losses. Borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the acquisition of a qualifying asset as  
part of the cost of that asset are capitalised over the 
respective assets. 
Borrowing costs, including the accretion of any discount on 
initial recognition of borrowings, incurred for the construction 
of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of 
time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for  
its intended use or sale. Other borrowing costs are expensed 
in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 
Taxation 
Under the terms of the Kurdistan PSCs, under which oil sales 
are made, any tax due is paid directly from the government’s 
take of revenues. This would normally be presented for as a 
gross up of revenue with a corresponding taxation expense  
in the statement of comprehensive income. No gross up  
of revenue and presentation of taxation expense has been 
accounted for in the period because, as a consequence of  
the uncertainty over the payment mechanism for oil sales  
in Kurdistan, it has not been possible to measure the quantum 
of taxation that has been paid on behalf of the Group by  
the KRG. 
Related parties 
Parties are related if one party has the ability, directly or 
indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant 
influence over the party in making financial or operational 
decisions. Parties are also related if they are subject to 
common control. Transactions between related parties are 
transfers of resources, services or obligations, regardless  
of whether a price is charged and are disclosed separately 
within the notes to the consolidated financial information. 
Accounting estimates and judgements 
Certain critical accounting judgements in applying the Group’s 
accounting policies are described below. 
Estimation of oil and gas reserves 
Oil and gas reserves impact the Group’s financial statements 
principally in the following ways: they are key elements in the 
Group’s investment decision-making process and allocation of 
fair values to acquired assets; they are an important element 
in determining depreciation and amortisation; and they impact 
the timing of decommissioning activity and in testing for 
impairment of tangible and intangible oil and gas assets.  
Changes in 2P oil and gas reserves will have a corresponding 
effect on the depreciation and amortisation charge in the 
statement of comprehensive income and on the discounted 
value of any decommissioning provision. Changes in oil and 
gas reserve estimates will affect the assessed valuation of 
capitalised oil and gas assets, which may result in impairment. 
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities  
of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering 
data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable 
in future years from known reservoirs under existing 
economic and operating conditions, that is, estimated  
future prices and costs as of the date an estimate is made. 
 
Summary of significant 
accounting policies continued
Note 
1 
92 Annual Report 2014  
www.genelenergy.com 93
Probable reserves are those additional reserves which 
analysis of geosciences and engineering data indicate are less 
likely to be recovered than proved reserves, but more certain 
to be recovered than possible reserves. Estimates of oil and 
gas reserves are inherently imprecise, require the application 
of judgement and are subject to future revision.  
Accordingly, financial and accounting measures (such as 
depreciation and amortisation charges and provision for 
decommissioning) that are based on proved and probable 
reserves are also subject to change.  
Proved reserves are estimated by reference to available 
reservoir and well information. All proved reserves estimates 
are subject to revision, either upward or downward, based  
on new information such as from development drilling and 
production activities, or from changes in economic factors, 
including product prices, contract terms or development 
plans. In general, changes in the technical maturity of 
hydrocarbon reserves resulting from new information 
becoming available from development and production 
activities have tended to be the most significant cause  
of annual revisions.  
In general, estimates of reserves for undeveloped or partially 
developed fields are subject to greater uncertainty over  
their future life than estimates of reserves for fields that  
are substantially developed and being depleted. As a field 
goes into production, the amount of proved reserves will  
be subject to future revision once additional information 
becomes available through, for example, the drilling of 
additional wells or the observation of long-term reservoir 
performance under producing conditions. As those fields are 
further developed, new information may lead to revisions.  
Changes to the Group’s estimates of proved and probable 
reserves also affect the amount of depreciation and 
amortisation recorded in the Group’s financial statements  
for property, plant and equipment related to oil and gas 
production activities. A reduction in proved and probable 
reserves will increase depreciation and amortisation charges 
(assuming constant production) and reduce income.  
Future development costs used  
in depreciation of oil and gas properties 
Certain classes of property, plant and equipment related  
to oil and gas exploration and production activities are 
depreciated using a unit-of-production method over 2P 
reserves. Since 2P reserves assume future development  
cost to access the proved and probable reserves, an estimate 
of future development costs is required for the calculation  
of depreciation. 
The Group’s estimation of future development costs is  
based on comparable data of similar companies in the region, 
future petroleum prices and the Group’s plans to increase  
the efficiency of the drilling process. However, actual drilling 
costs may be different from those estimated by the Group  
due to changes in market conditions, business and operating 
environment. Changes in estimates of reserve quantities 
and/or estimates of future development expenditure are 
reflected prospectively in the depreciation and amortisation 
calculation. 
Decommissioning costs 
Provision for decommissioning represents the present value 
of decommissioning costs relating to the Kurdistan oil and gas 
interests, which are expected to be incurred at the end of field 
life. These provisions have been created based on the Group’s 
internal estimates. Assumptions, based on the current 
economic environment, have been made which management 
believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the 
future liability. Those estimates are reviewed regularly to take 
into account any material changes to the assumptions. 
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend 
upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning 
works required, which will reflect market conditions at the 
relevant time. Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is 
likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at 
economically viable rates. This in turn will depend upon future 
oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.  
Business combinations 
The recognition of business combinations requires the excess 
of the purchase price of acquisitions over the net book value 
of assets acquired to be allocated to the assets and liabilities 
of the acquired entity. The Group makes judgements and 
estimates in relation to the fair value allocation of the 
purchase price. 
The fair value exercise is performed at the date of acquisition. 
Owing to the nature of fair value assessments in the oil and 
gas industry, the purchase price allocation exercise and 
acquisition-date fair value determinations require subjective 
judgements based on a wide range of complex variables at  
a point in time. Management uses all available information  
to make the fair value determinations.  
In determining fair value for the acquisition, the Group has 
utilised valuation methodologies including discounted cash 
flow analysis. The assumptions made in performing these 
valuations include assumptions as to discount rates, foreign 
exchange rates, commodity prices, the timing of development, 
capital costs, and future operating costs. Any significant 
change in key assumptions may cause the acquisition 
accounting to be revised. 
New standards 
The following standards have been adopted by the Group  
for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after  
1 January 2014 and do not have a material impact on the 
group: IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’, IFRS 11, 
‘Joint arrangements’ and IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests  
in other entities'.  
A number of new standards and amendments to standards 
and interpretations have been issued but are not yet effective 
and not early adopted. None of these are expected to have 
significant effect on the consolidated financial statements  
of the Group.

Segmental information 
The Group has two reportable business segments, which are its oil and gas exploration and production business in the KRI and 
its oil and gas exploration business in Africa. Capital expenditure decisions for the KRI business segment are considered in the 
context of the cash flows expected to be made from the production and sale of crude oil. Capital expenditure for the African 
segment is considered in the context of the available cash of the Group.  
Finance income is not considered part of a business segment and forms part of the reconciliation to reported numbers.

Taxation 
A taxation charge of $1.5 million (2013: $0.9 million) was made in the Turkish and UK services companies. All other corporation 
tax due has been paid on behalf of the Group by the Government from the Government’s own share of revenues and there  
is no tax payment required or expected to be made by the Group. 
The tax paid by the government in accordance with the terms of the KRI PSCs would usually be presented as a gross up  
of revenue and a corresponding taxation expense in the statement of comprehensive income with no cash outflow. In the 
Group’s results for the periods ended 31
st
 December 2014 and 31
st
 December 2013, no presentation of taxation expense with  
an equivalent gross up for revenue has been accounted for because it has not been possible to measure reliably the amount  
of taxation paid on behalf of the Group because of uncertainties over how the amount of taxation should be calculated.  
This is an accounting presentational issue and there is no taxation to be paid. For the same reason, it has not been possible  
to assess whether it is necessary to gross up the acquired assets for deferred tax. 
 
 
 
Earnings per share 
Basic 
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period.

Diluted 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all potential 
dilutive ordinary shares. The Group has four types of potential dilutive ordinary shares: 
 Shares granted to directors and employees under the performance share plan, to the extent that performance conditions 
have been met at the period end 
 Share options granted to employees under the share option plan, where the exercise price is less than the average market 
price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the period 
 Shares granted to employees under the restricted share plan 
 Shares and securities issued to the founders of the Company, to the extent that performance conditions have been met  
at the period end 
Further details of these potentially dilutive shares are shown in note 22.

Non-current provisions cover expected decommissioning and abandonment costs resulting from the net ownership interests in 
petroleum and natural gas assets, including well sites and gathering systems. The decommissioning and abandonment provision 
is based on management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the period.  
The cash flows relating to the decommissioning and abandonment provisions are expected to occur between 2031 and 2039. 
The provision is the discounted present value of the cost, using existing technology at current prices.

Financial risk management
Fair values of financial instruments 
Trade and other payables 
All the Group’s financial liabilities are predominantly short-term in nature or are repayable on demand and, as such, there 
is no difference between contractual cash flows related to the financial liabilities and their carrying amount. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand.  
Where it is not repayable on demand, then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted  
at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date. 
Interest-bearing borrowings 
Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate  
of interest at the balance sheet date.  
Financial risk factors 
Credit risk 
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis, except for credit risk relating to trade and other receivable balances. Credit risk arises 
from cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and other assets.  
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum credit exposure to credit risk 
at 31
st
 December was: 
 
2014 
$m  
2013
$m
Trade and other receivables   282.3  4.4
Cash and cash equivalents  489.1  699.7
    
  771.4  704.1
There are no trade and other receivables overdue at the period end and no provision for doubtful debt has been made.  
No interest is charged on receivables. The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.  
The Group takes a conservative approach to its cash management. Cash is deposited in government gilts, treasury bills  
or term deposits with banks that are assessed as appropriate based on, among other things, sovereign risk, CDS pricing  
and credit rating.  
Liquidity risk 
The Group is committed to ensuring it has sufficient liquidity to meet its payables as they fall due. At 31
st
 December 2014  
the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $489.1 million (2013: $699.7 million). The position of cash and cash equivalent 
balances can be seen in note 15. 
Currency risk 
As substantially all of the Group’s transactions are measured and denominated in US dollars, the exposure to currency risk  
is not material and therefore no sensitivity analysis has been presented. 
Interest rate risk  
The Group had borrowings of $491.4 million as of 31
st
 December 2014. Interest is payable at 7.5% on the nominal value  
of $500 million.  
Capital management 
The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise 
shareholder value. The Group’s funding needs are met through a combination of cash raised by IPO, cash raised through  
the issue of the $500 million high yield bond and cash generated from operations. The Group monitors its cash position  
on an ongoing basis. Capital includes share capital, other reserves and accumulated losses.

The range of exercise prices for share options outstanding at the end of the period is 621.15p to 1,046.00p. The weighted 
average remaining contractual life of the outstanding share options is 1.2 years. The weighted average fair value for PSP 
awards granted in the period is 495p and for RSP awards granted in the period is 935.36p. 
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes pricing model. The model takes into account assumptions regarding 
expected volatility, expected dividends and expected time to exercise. 
 
In the absence of sufficient historical volatility for the Company, expected volatility was estimated by analysing the historical 
volatility of FTSE-listed oil and gas producers over the three years prior to the date of grant. The expected dividend assumption 
was set at 0%, to reflect a prudent approach. The risk-free interest rate incorporated into the model is based on the term 
structure of UK Government zero coupon bonds.  
The inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model for RSP, PSP and SOP and SOP awards granted in 2014 and fair values per 
share using the model were as follows:

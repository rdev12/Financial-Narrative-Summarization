Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Chairman’s statement
Dear Shareholder
In my final report to you as Chairman of Pennon Group 
prior to my retirement following the 2015 Annual General 
Meeting (AGM), I can confirm that this has once again been 
a successful year for the Group. I am pleased to be handing 
over to Sir John Parker at a time when Pennon’s subsidiary 
businesses are well positioned for strong future growth.
Since joining the Board 18 years ago there has been a 
significant number of key achievements that have enabled 
the Group to develop and grow to become one of the 
UK’s leading utility and resource management companies. 
Under the guidance of Sir John and the Board, I remain 
confident in the continued success of the Group and its 
long-term prospects.
Business performance 
Group revenue was up by 2.7% to £1,357.2 million and 
profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 1.6% to 
£210.7 million
(1)
. We continue to maintain substantial cash 
resources and facilities to fund our capital programme and 
we ended the year with a record level of over £1.7 billion 
(including £196 million of restricted funds).
South West Water
Once again, I am pleased to report that South West Water 
delivered strong operational and financial performance 
and high standards of customer service. The year saw the 
successful conclusion of the K5 (2010-2015) regulatory 
period and Ofwat’s confirmation of ‘enhanced’ status for 
South West Water’s Business Plan to 2020. South West 
Water subsequently accepted the Final Determination in 
December 2014. I expect this to lead to a tangible financial 
benefit for Pennon. Key projects have been accelerated 
and there is an opportunity to achieve the highest potential 
returns on equity in the sector.
Further details of the company’s performance can be found 
in the Report from the Chief Executive, South West Water on 
pages 14 to 19.
Viridor
Viridor has made excellent progress in delivering its Energy 
Recovery Facility (ERF) business, with operations having 
started at five more ERFs and a further three plants under 
construction. The ERF business is now contributing 
meaningfully to growth in profits and cash flow.
Trading conditions in recycling remained under pressure 
during 2014/15 and, as anticipated, revenue from landfill 
continued to decline. These developments were monitored 
closely by the Board throughout the year. 
I am pleased to confirm to shareholders that, despite the 
challenges, EBITDA
(2)
 increased compared to the previous 
year. Outperformance from the fleet of ERFs more than 
offset the declining trend in landfill and the softening of 
recycling markets.
A full report can be found in the Report from the 
Chief Executive, Viridor on pages 22 to 27.
Dividend 
In March 2015 the Board announced a continuation of its 
dividend policy of year-on-year growth of 4% above RPI 
inflation until 2019/20, reflecting the Board’s confidence in 
the future financial performance of the Group. This amounts 
to a policy for 10 consecutive years (2010-2020) of 4% real 
dividend growth to shareholders. 
We are recommending a final dividend per share of 21.82p, 
which represents a 4.3% increase on last year’s final 
dividend. This will result in a total dividend for the year of 
31.80p, an increase of 4.9% (reflecting March 2015 inflation 
of 0.9%) on the total dividend for 2013/14. Following 
shareholder approval at last year’s AGM, we will again be 
offering a Scrip Dividend Alternative to shareholders in 
respect of the final dividend for which the timetable is given 
on page 158.
Sustainability and governance 
Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters are 
integral to the Group’s strategy and business model and the 
Sustainability Committee of the Board continues to oversee 
our performance in maintaining a responsible approach to 
ESG. Our notable achievements during the year include 
landfill restoration and biodiversity protection, completion of 
sustainable catchment schemes, continued high standards 
in bathing water quality and progress made in reducing the 
number of pollution incidents.
Pennon considers fair treatment of its customers, employees 
and other stakeholders to be an important factor in creating 
a sustainable business. The Group has continued to make 
good progress in achieving high standards of customer 
satisfaction, increased levels of employee engagement 
and good community relations. Further information on the 
Group’s approach to sustainability is provided throughout the 
strategic report and in the Sustainability Committee report 
for the year on pages 67 to 69.
The Group’s governance arrangements continue to be 
reviewed annually to ensure we develop and improve our 
governance structures and practices, taking account of 
market developments and new best practice guidance. The 
subsidiary boards have their own governance bodies and 
procedures under the Group framework. Details are set out in 
the Governance section of this report, on pages 54 and 58.

8 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Strategic overview Health and safety 
Health and safety continues to be a top priority for us. The 
Group’s boards and senior management teams are highly 
engaged with and supportive of the various initiatives that 
have been introduced throughout the year.
South West Water continuously reviews its policies and 
processes in order to minimise the likelihood of an incident 
and the company remains focused on developing a 
proactive health and safety culture.
Viridor continues to work towards achieving a step change 
in culture and attitudes, built around its ‘Stop & Think’ 
campaigns, and there has been a steadily improving trend 
in health and safety reportable incidents over the last three 
years. Tragically in early June 2015 there was an incident 
which resulted in the sad death of a Viridor employee. Our 
thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues.
Board developments 
In April 2015 Sir John Parker joined the Board as Deputy 
Chairman and will succeed me as Chairman following the 
AGM this year. Sir John is recognised as one of the most 
experienced and respected business leaders in the UK, and 
his previous background in the utilities and waste sectors 
will be particularly valuable to Pennon and its subsidiary 
companies. I wish him every success with the future 
strategic development of the Group. 
As announced last year, Gerard Connell, the Board’s 
Senior Independent Director, will also stand down following 
the AGM, marking the end of a term of office lasting 12 
years. We would like to thank Gerard for his considerable 
contribution to the Group’s success over the years and wish 
him well in his future endeavours. Gill Rider will become the 
new Senior Independent Director.
During the year we welcomed Neil Cooper to the Board as 
a non-executive director. Neil has become chairman of the 
Audit Committee in succession to Gerard Connell. 
At the end of January we saw the retirement of David 
Dupont after more than 12 years as the Group Director 
of Finance during which he successfully managed the 
financial affairs of the Group through a period of substantial 
development and growth. I am pleased to say that 
Susan Davy, who was finance and regulatory director of 
South West Water, was appointed as David’s successor.
As I prepare to stand down as Chairman of the Group, I 
am confident that I am leaving a strong Board with a broad 
wealth of experience and knowledge that is well placed 
to guide Pennon through its next phase of development 
and growth.
Diversity 
The Board continues to promote equality and diversity 
across the Group. Prior to the year-end we achieved our 
target of 25% female representation. Since then, due to 
Board transition, we have fallen below this level, but I am 
pleased to say we are set to achieve the target once more 
following the retirements that will happen after the AGM.
More information on the Board’s diversity policy can be 
found within the Nomination Committee’s report, on 
page 70.
Outlook 
Our priority continues to be the creation of shareholder value 
through our strategic focus on water and wastewater services, 
and recycling, renewable energy and resource management. 
Early receipt of Ofwat’s Draft Determination by South West 
Water enabled the acceleration of key projects in 2014/15 
that were identified in the company’s business plan for 
K6 (2015-2020). With South West Water’s track record of 
efficiency and outperformance, the company has a strong 
foundation to deliver its business plan and will have an 
opportunity to outperform the assumed returns on equity. 
In addition South West Water is well prepared for, and 
supportive of, industry reform.
Viridor is making excellent progress in developing further 
its ERF business with five ERFs having come on stream in 
the year. These projects and associated contracts already 
contribute to Viridor’s profitability and reflect the realisation 
of a strategy that is expected to contribute c. £100 million to 
Viridor’s EBITDA in 2016/17.
In April 2015 we acquired Bournemouth Water, one of the 
highest performing water-only companies in the UK. The 
Board believes the acquisition will be highly complementary 
to South West Water’s business, subject to clearance from 
the Competition and Markets Authority. Further detail can be 
found in the Report from the Chief Executive, South West 
Water on page 14.
The Group, with long-term financing, continues to be well 
positioned for the future and the Board remains confident 
about the future success of the Group.

Strategic report | Strategic overview How we manage our businesses to create value
We are committed to delivering sustainable shareholder returns, as reflected in our decision to continue 
the previous dividend policy of year-on-year growth of 4% above RPI inflation to 2019/20, meaning a 
policy for 10 consecutive years (2010-2020) of 4% real dividend growth to shareholders.
We create shareholder value by focusing on five core areas, underpinned by our commitment to 
creating and maintaining a sustainable business:
Strong governance
Pennon provides oversight and support to its businesses through a strong governance 
framework which includes robust processes for internal control and risk management.
More information on risk management and governance can be found below and on 
pages 53-71.
Financial performance
Our Group has set challenging financial targets through a range of key performance 
indicators (KPIs). These are set out on page 5.
Our focus in setting such targets is to achieve sustainable performance over the short and 
long term. Our financial performance is set out in more detail on pages 28 to 33.
Customer and stakeholder satisfaction
Both South West Water and Viridor are fully committed to meeting the needs of their 
customers and developing and maintaining good relationships with their stakeholders in 
general. This is the key to the success of each business.
How we respond to our stakeholders’ needs and assess customer satisfaction is set out on 
pages 17,19, 27 and 40.
Sustainability – environmental, economic and social 
We are aware that our businesses can, and do, have a material impact on the environment 
and the communities in which they operate. To address this we take a responsible and 
transparent approach to environmental, social and governance matters.
Our sustainable practices not only benefit communities but enable our businesses to be 
more successful. More information on our environmental, economic and social impacts is 
provided on pages 41 to 49.
Employee well-being and engagement
We know that the success of our Group is due to the talent, commitment and hard work of 
our employees and we aim to be a responsible employer.
We are focused on ensuring employee well-being, retention, efficiency and productivity. 
Essential to this is our commitment to the health and safety of our workforce.
More information on the initiatives we have introduced to improve employee engagement 
and health and safety in our businesses is set out on pages 18, 27, 50 and 51. 
How we manage risk 
Essential to achieving our strategic aims and creating value within our businesses is our 
operating framework, which is based on the principles of good governance.
Our operating framework includes a comprehensive and fully embedded risk management 
process which assists us in identifying and managing risks and opportunities to deliver the 
Group’s strategy and the other essential elements of our business model.
Further information on our control and risk management environment is described on page 
61 and our principal risks and uncertainties and how we mitigate them are set out on pages 
34 to 39.

Strategic 
overview
South West 
Water
Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements South West Water has performed strongly against the 2010-2015 
regulatory contract. Despite the tariff freeze, revenue has grown and 
robust cost control has resulted in cumulative cost increases over the 
five years being lower than inflation. As a result of outperformance, 
South West Water delivered a dividend to Pennon above the 2009 
Final Determination assumptions.
In December 2014 South West Water accepted Ofwat’s Final 
Determination of its Business Plan to 2020. This followed a 
favourable price review process that saw South West Water’s plan 
singled out for ‘enhanced’ status and subsequently fast-tracked 
for early Draft Determination. Ofwat praised the high quality of the 
‘WaterFuture’ plan, which had received the backing of 84% of 
customers at the time of its publication in December 2013. South 
West Water benefited from Ofwat’s ‘do no harm’ principle and 
was able to make an early start on its K6 investment programme, 
accelerating a number of key projects for the benefit of customers 
and shareholders. 
On 15 April 2015 Pennon acquired Bournemouth Water, a top 
performing water company which is an excellent fit with South 
West Water. The acquisition provides an opportunity to expand 
South West Water’s wholesale capabilities whilst driving synergistic 
and best practice operations. The combined business will 
provide an enhanced platform for innovation and growth ahead of 
market liberalisation.
Bournemouth is one of the highest performing water only companies 
in the UK across a range of indicators with outstanding customer 
service reflected in its Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM) scores.
In accordance with current legislation an automatic merger reference 
has been made to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). 
A decision on the merger is expected to be received from the CMA 
within its usual timescales.

Overview
South West Water’s enhanced business plan, track record of 
efficiency and outperformance makes the company well placed 
to deliver the new 2015-2020 (K6) regulatory contract and we will 
have an opportunity to beat the assumed returns on equity.

Business performance
As anticipated South West Water’s revenue for 2014/15 was 
impacted by the tariff freeze announced last year. However 
good cost control, the continued delivery of cost efficiency 
and lower financing costs has resulted in an increase of 
£5.4 million in profit before tax and exceptional items to 
£167.9 million.
Despite the tariff freeze, revenue increased marginally 
by 0.4% to £522.2 million driven by increased customer 
demand and new connections, offset by the effects of 
customers switching to a metered tariff. 7,600 new customer 
connections contributed £2.8 million of additional revenue. 
Customer demand was 0.9% higher than last year reflecting 
the drier weather over the summer and some relatively 
benign months over winter 2014/15. Customers switching 
from unmeasured to metered or assessed charges reduced 
revenue by £4.8 million. The impact of this is reducing as the 
number of customers left to switch falls. 79% of South West 
Water’s customers are now metered.
South West Water remained ahead of target in delivering 
the required operating cost efficiencies for K5. Cumulatively 
the efficiency delivered over K5 is 11% ahead of target 
reflecting the benefit of front-end loading delivery in the K5 
period. Annual operating costs are £27.3 million lower as 
a consequence, with £5.1 million cost savings delivered 
in 2014/15.
Cost efficiencies are being achieved through South West 
Water’s ongoing improvement programmes with specific 
initiatives this year in the areas of:
• asset investments and improvements supporting the 
PUROS programme
(1)
 – now finalised
• energy procurement and usage – continued energy 
efficiency schemes alongside additional power generation 
through renewable sources
• restructuring of defined benefit pension schemes
• right-sourcing and innovative contracting – tendering 
to achieve the ‘right price’ including in-sourcing and 
renewed K6 key and strategic contracts.
Capital expenditure in the year was broadly in line with 
last year at £145.1 million (2013/14 £141.6 million). A key 
element of the programme was the acceleration of K6 
projects into 2014/15 to deliver early benefits to customers 
and the environment. This includes asset enhancements 
to deliver bathing water quality, investments targeting 
wastewater compliance and preparatory expenditure on the 
innovative new water treatment works for Plymouth and its 
surrounding area.
The focus for the final year of the K5 programme was 
weighted towards the maintenance of existing assets, 
increasing infrastructure resilience and delivering 
environmental improvements. Investments during the 
year included:
• safeguarding high quality drinking water through the 
completion of upgrades at two key water treatment works
• upgrades at wastewater sites to improve compliance
• innovative investments to reduce the number of 
customers’ properties previously highlighted as at risk 
from flooding.
Through focused planning, innovative scoping and asset 
solutions and efficient delivery, capital expenditure for K5 
is lower than the Capital Incentive Scheme baseline
(2)
 and 
achieved 6% outperformance against the capital expenditure 
assumed within the 2009 Final Determination. Regulatory 
capital value at 31 March 2015 was £2,928 million. With 
an increase in net debt, this has led to gearing
(3)
 of 62% 
(2014 56%) – within Ofwat’s optimum range for K5 and 
below the notional ratio assumed for K6 of 62.5%.

Pure Water 
Drinking water quality 
South West Water’s performance for mean zonal compliance 
– the industry standard for drinking water quality – remains 
strong. There was a very slight fall in this year’s score 
reflecting the tightening of European Union standards. 
Further targeted investment is being made in treatment 
assets and processes. 
Significant capital schemes were completed during the year. 
These included the combined £14.5 million of investment in 
water quality improvements at the water treatment works of 
Restormel and Wendron, which together supply around half 
of the population of Cornwall. Ultraviolet treatment was also 
installed at Avon water treatment works in Devon.
South West Water also made significant progress in reducing 
taste, odour and discolouration with the number of customer 
contacts for such issues reaching the lowest level on record.
Water resources 
South West Water customers enjoyed unrestricted drinking 
water supplies for an 18th consecutive year with the 
company’s prior investment in its reservoirs and supply 
network ensuring adequate supplies for the region. 
During 2014/15 investment in the maintenance of reservoirs 
included the completion of spillway improvements at 
the Kennick, Trenchford and Tottiford site in Devon and 
the completion of a £10 million ‘grouting’ scheme at 
Wimbleball Dam. 
The company is confident of being able to achieve a healthy 
surplus of water for the foreseeable future as outlined in its 
Water Resources Management Plan, published June 2014. 
Leakage control 
The amount of water lost through leaks and bursts during 
2014/15 remained in line with South West Water’s target 
of 84 megalitres or less on average per day. In addition 
to improving response times to any network issues, the 
company has been focusing on improving its water pressure 
management capabilities and using advanced diagnostic 
tools to help pre-empt any problems. 
Furthermore, South West Water is targeting improved leak 
detection and increasing its use of innovative technologies in 
the field. Additional training for staff is also helping to deliver 
improvements in this area. 
Upstream Thinking 
South West Water’s award-winning £9 million programme 
of catchment management, ‘Upstream Thinking’, is 
designed to improve raw water quality and natural storage 
in the landscape. Delivered in partnership with a number 
of regional organisations, national park authorities, 
conservation groups, landowners and the farming 
community, the programme involves the restoration of 
moorland and agricultural land using a range of low-cost 
sustainable techniques (for example, ditch-blocking, fencing, 
grassland and habitat management). 
In 2014/15 the company successfully met its five year 
restoration target of 2,000 hectares of dried out peatland 
on Exmoor. In the same time period more than 200 farm 
improvement schemes have also been implemented in 
order to reduce the amount of diffuse pollution entering the 
region’s watercourses.

Customer satisfaction 
Over the last five years South West Water has made 
significant progress in improving its customer service and 
customer satisfaction scores, as measured through SIM 
(Service Incentive Mechanism) and customer satisfaction 
surveys. The 2015 survey showed a 90% customer services 
satisfaction rating, its highest yet. This reflects improvements 
made at both an operational level and in the way the 
company interacts with its customers and responds to any 
issues they may have. 
A key part of South West Water’s strategy for improving 
customer satisfaction is to be proactive in delivering 
information, advice and support. This includes making 
the most of digital communications and new media (for 
example, Webchat, SMS messaging and MyAccount 
online, as well as WaterLive and BeachLive, which provide 
real time information on operational activities and bathing 
water quality), investing in the training and development 
of its customer-facing staff, and ensuring that processes 
for resolving any issues are as integrated and effective 
as possible. 
Moving into the 2015-2020 period the company is also 
making greater use of customer analytics to identify how 
it can further improve the experience customers receive 
and providing them with more opportunities to ‘self serve’ 
through online platforms. 
Affordability 
Water bills in the South West have historically been higher 
than the national average, largely due to the scale of 
environmental investment required to protect the region’s 
coastal waters. 
In 2013 the annual £50 government payment was 
introduced in acknowledgement of this situation. Customers 
have subsequently benefited from plans announced as part 
of South West Water’s Business Plan to 2020 to freeze 
prices for 2014/15 and peg the increase in the average 
household bill at below inflation to 2020.
Furthermore, to help those with affordability issues, 
South West Water continues to offer a range of advice 
and support services. The company was among the 
first to roll out a social tariff (in 2013) and has also taken 
innovative steps to engage its most economically deprived, 
hard-to-reach or vulnerable customers through initiatives 
delivered in partnership with housing associations, 
community organisations, the Citizens' Advice Bureau and 
carers' networks. 
Business customers 
South West Water provides water and wastewater services 
to over 74,000 businesses and other non-household 
customers, around a third of which operate within the 
tourism and agricultural sectors.
The company is currently preparing for the opening of the 
non-household retail market in 2017. In the past year this 
has included the introduction of sector-specific business 
customer specialists and a new series of tariffs for base 
and enhanced levels of service (which came into effect in 
April 2015). The company’s strategy is designed to retain its 
South West business customer base while also exploring 
opportunities for out-of-area growth.
Metering 
79% of South West Water’s customers are now metered 
with 7,489 installations carried out over the past year. This 
represents a high level of overall metering when compared 
to the rest of the industry. 
During 2015-2020 the company aims to increase household 
metering coverage to 85% while also testing the benefits 
of SMART metering through a series of pilots at new 
housing developments.

Bathing waters
Of the 146 designated bathing waters sampled in the 
South West Water region during the 2014 bathing season, 
145 (99.3%) met or exceeded the European Union’s good 
(mandatory) standard and 126 (86.3%) met the excellent 
(guideline) standard. 
The decline in the number of bathing waters reaching the 
'excellent' standard can be attributed to the wetter weather 
during August.
In preparation for the tighter standards introduced by the 
European Union’s revised Bathing Water Directive – which 
comes into effect in November 2015 – South West Water 
carried out an accelerated £18.9 million programme of 
targeted improvements at key wastewater assets around 
the region. 
Preventing pollution
In the past year South West Water has focused on 
improving its maintenance schedules and procedures while 
using advanced technologies to improve its capabilities 
for wastewater network monitoring and analytics. The 
company’s efforts have been reflected in this year’s figures 
for serious or significant pollutions (Categories 1 and 2), 
which are the lowest they been in the past five years. In 
2014/15 there were three Category 2 (‘significant’) incidents 
(2013/14 10) and no Category 1 (‘serious’) pollution 
incidents (2013 nil). The number of Category 3 (‘minor’) 
incidents has fallen by over a third. While these results are 
favourable, further work is required in order to bring down 
the total number of pollution incidents. 
During 2015-2020 South West Water will carry out further 
investment in its wastewater treatment processes, pumping 
stations and network monitoring. This is expected to be 
complemented by ‘Downstream Thinking’ – a programme 
of work currently being piloted in which wastewater issues 
in urban areas are tackled through a combination of ‘soft’ 
engineering and sustainable techniques. 
Wastewater treatment standards 
Since 2011 South West Water has been focusing on the 
delivery of a programme of improvements at more than 90 
wastewater treatment works as agreed with the Environment 
Agency. Substantial capital investment, together with 
improved working practices, is delivering progress in 
this area. 
The ‘enhanced’ status of South West Water’s Business 
Plan to 2020 has allowed the company to accelerate the 
delivery of a number of key capital schemes. Sites are being 
prioritised for improvement as appropriate and South West 
Water continues to work towards its target of 100% numeric 
compliance by 2020. 
Flooding 
Overall, 2014/15 was a relatively benign year in terms of 
heavy rainfall events. The number of properties flooded 
internally was significantly fewer than the previous year and 
the number of repeat floodings was below the K5 average. 
To help prevent sewer flooding, South West Water invests 
in increased sewer capacity, the separation of storm 
water from the wastewater from properties, and other 
capital schemes. In 2014/15 the company completed a 
£3.5 million scheme to upgrade the sewerage network 
in Truro, Cornwall, and a jointly-funded £2 million flood 
alleviation scheme to protect homes in the Colebrook area 
of Plymouth. 
South West Water continues to work alongside lead local 
flood authorities and other stakeholders to identify best 
practice in the management of excess storm water.
People 
South West Water prides itself on being a responsible 
employer, attaching paramount value to the well-being, 
training, needs and ambitions of its 1,400 employees.
Employee involvement and participation in all aspects of 
business and organisational change is encouraged and 
supported through the company’s ‘People Strategy’, which 
is designed to attract, develop and retain a high calibre 
workforce. In the past year the company has continued 
to deliver skills-based programmes for operational staff, in 
addition to a variety of training and development schemes 
aimed at improving personal and leadership skills. A new 
Finance Development Programme was also implemented 
in order to build knowledge and experience among new 
recruits in the finance teams.
During spring 2015 a series of Director-led ‘roadshows’ were 
held at venues across the region to communicate plans for 
K6 (2015-2020). 
During 2014/15 South West Water’s apprenticeship 
scheme grew with 14 new recruits joining the company 
and bringing the total number of apprenticeships to 61. 
The company has also played a key role in the creation of 
a new University Technical College (UTC), which will help to 
ensure a regionally based talent pool of future scientists and 
engineers. Located in Newton Abbot, Devon, the college will 
open its doors in autumn 2015.

Regulators and others
South West Water actively engages with a wide variety of 
environmental and regulatory stakeholders. The company 
contributes to national policy on developing issues through 
its membership of Water UK, the industry trade body, and 
works with the Consumer Council for Water to ensure that 
customers’ issues and concerns are addressed and a full 
understanding of the company’s activities is maintained.
In preparation for the introduction of competition in the 
non-household retail market in 2017, South West Water 
is playing an active role in the Open Water programme, 
which is responsible for delivering the market architecture 
and implementation of the central market operator. The 
company is a member of the Programme Delivery Board, 
which comprises representatives of customers, regulators, 
incumbent water companies, new market entrants and other 
key stakeholders. 
Procurement and suppliers 
South West Water operates an innovative ‘mixed economy’ 
model to source its capital programme delivery partners. 
This means using a significant number of smaller local 
contractors to provide specialised services as well as 
developing long-term relationships with more major supply 
chain partners. 
The company’s procurement strategy is focused on the 
proactive management of relationships with around 70 key 
and strategic suppliers, which account for the large majority 
of expenditure. South West Water sources all its purchases 
from competitive markets. The company operates strict 
procurement policies, ensuring suppliers adhere to clearly 
defined policies of sustainability and ethical working practice.
WaterShare panel
South West Water’s Business Plan to 2020 included an 
innovative ‘WaterShare’ mechanism. Designed to share the 
benefits of outperformance fairly and transparently between 
customers and shareholders, it will be monitored by an 
independent panel of key stakeholders and regulators. 
In early 2015 recruitment began for panel members 
whose responsibility will be to monitor and evaluate South 
West Water’s performance against its targets for the 
2015-2020 period. 
Outlook 
South West Water’s strong overall performance for the 
K5 period and the success of its Business Plan to 2020 
means the company is making a smooth and confident 
transition into K6. Substantial efficiencies have been made 
and the company continues to focus on innovation, new 
technologies and sustainable solutions to deliver further 
improvements and streamlining across the business. 
For the next regulatory period South West Water’s 
performance will be reported against the eight 
outcomes identified in its Business Plan to 2020 (see 
www.southwestwater.co.uk/waterfuture). The company 
has set itself demanding targets but is well placed to 
deliver for the benefit of customers and shareholders alike. 
Significant investment continues in order to safeguard the 
progress made to date, satisfy regulatory and legislative 
obligations, meet the needs and expectations of customers 
and protect the natural environment. 
For 2015/16 South West Water’s areas of focus include: 
• further investment to improve wastewater treatment 
compliance and safeguard bathing water quality
• ongoing improvements in customer service 
• rigorous cost control and outperformance with the 
highest potential Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE) in 
the sector
• preparation for the opening of the non-household retail 
market in 2017 – this includes governance, structural 
and process changes to ensure compliance with the new 
market code 
• continuing to ensure robust and transparent assurance. 
South West Water is well placed to meet the challenges 
and opportunities of the next regulatory period. The board 
recognises that there are improvements still to be made 
but is confident that through further investment, strong 
leadership and the hard work and dedication of its people, 
South West Water will remain a high performing, sustainable 
and profitable business in the years ahead.

statements Sustainability and resilience
To drive towards greater resource efficiency and energy 
security in times of economic austerity and challenging 
market conditions requires leadership and resolve. To 
balance the needs and priorities of communities, employees 
and stakeholders with the demands of the bottom line 
requires a clear understanding that they are essentially one 
and the same. The drive for sustainability supports growth. 
Clients, customers, employees and partners demand 
community benefit and responsibility in business, and Viridor 
is pleased to address that demand as part of the service. 
Viridor was delighted with its three star ranking in the 
Business in the Community Corporate Responsibility Index, 
demonstrating clear overall progress for the business.
The new strategic orientation of Viridor’s business model 
around the company’s ‘Energy’ and ‘Recycling & Resources’ 
divisions, aligned with a clear focus on the engagement and 
professional development of its employees, is now delivering 
results. Viridor stands at the forefront of transforming waste 
in the UK using input materials to produce high quality 
recycled commodities, raw materials and energy. 
Report from the  
Chief Executive, 
Viridor
Overview
Viridor has now passed its strategic point of inflexion, as we 
continue to give more resources new life through our leading 
recycling and energy recovery services. I’m pleased to confirm 
that our Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) business is now 
operational with five new ERFs brought on line during the year. 
We remain well on track to deliver c. £100 million of EBITDA from 
ERFs in 2016/17. 
Despite the challenges in the recycling markets during the year, 
there are strong regulatory and market drivers for growth in the 
sector. Viridor is well positioned in its strategic business elements 
with significant cash being generated in Landfill Energy and with 
Contracts and Collection providing essential input materials for our 
‘Energy’ and ‘Recycling & Resources’ divisions’ operating facilities.

22 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Report from Chief Executive, Viridor UK context
The UK is required under the European Union (EU) Landfill 
Directive to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal 
waste going to landfill sites. This is being achieved by 
a continued increase in recycling, with residual waste 
increasingly being used for energy recovery. A new and 
more ambitious EU Circular Economy legislative package 
is expected in 2015. The previously proposed package, 
withdrawn in 2014, contained 70% recycling targets, 80% 
packaging recycling targets and material-specific landfill bans.
The EU Renewable Energy Directive requires the production 
of 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. Energy 
recovery from waste in all its forms has a clear role within 
the Government’s UK Renewable Energy Roadmap and 
continues to deliver a substantial proportion of total UK 
renewable energy generated. Viridor believes that by 
2020, UK energy recovery from waste could produce 15 
terawatt hours (TWh) of the total forecasted UK renewable 
energy generation (120 TWh), accounting for 12%. This 
is particularly significant given predicted future energy 
capacity shortages. 
The UK’s main mechanism for diverting waste from landfill 
and incentivising recycling and ERFs remains landfill tax. 
The UK and Scottish Governments have confirmed that 
landfill tax will rise on 1 April 2016 in line with inflation from 
the current position of £82.60 per tonne. This continues to 
influence the long-term economics of both recycling and 
energy recovery. In addition, recyclate costs have been 
typically significantly lower than the cost of using virgin 
materials for manufacturers. 
Viridor is clearly focused on giving resources new life through 
recycling and waste-based renewable energy. Investment 
in technology and operational practices continues to 
enhance recyclate quality to differentiate Viridor from its 
competitors and to position it strongly within a consolidating 
sector. Significant progress has also been made in the 
delivery of the ERF business, with a substantial asset base 
now operational in conjunction with associated business 
capability processes across the whole ‘source to supply’ 
energy from waste (EfW) cycle. 
Business strategy
Viridor’s strategy, built on its purpose to give resources new 
life, is to add substantial value through:
Energy
ERFs
Viridor’s strategically located network of ERFs now 
provides an established and growing business serving PPP 
contracts and the commercial sector. Viridor has moved 
from investment to delivery with five facilities commencing 
operations in 2014/15. EfW remains central to the UK’s 
waste and renewable energy strategies as the low cost 
alternative to landfill for treatment and disposal of residual 
waste, and provider of base load electricity and heat 
utilisation opportunities. Viridor expects to have c.15% EfW 
market share by 2020, with its network of strategic facilities 
driving the company’s long-term profit growth.
Landfill energy
The focus of the landfill energy business is to maximise 
the value of landfill gas power generation across all sites; 
to manage the ongoing decline in landfill inputs by closing 
18 sites over the next five years and maintaining three 
strategic operational sites; and to optimise returns on 
the closed landfills asset base through alternative uses 
such as photovoltaic installation, energy storage and 
divestment opportunities.
Continued focus on growing market share in a consolidating 
sector through its contracts and collections services, which 
play an essential role in securing inputs for the energy and 
recycling divisions, will also help to drive the delivery of the 
Viridor strategy. 
Recycling and resources
Clear regulatory drivers for recycling from the EU and from 
UK governments, alongside expectations from leading 
corporates, are ensuring strong and ongoing demand for 
recycling services. Viridor has established its recycling 
business over the past five years and currently handles 
volumes approaching two million tonnes per annum. Viridor’s 
focus on Input, Throughput, Output Optimisation (ITOO) 
across its recycling activities is yielding improvements, 
ensuring the production of high quality materials and 
management of the cost base to mitigate impacts 
on margins.

Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Business performance
Revenue was up 4.2% to £835.9 million reflecting ERFs 
coming into operation and further growth in assets under 
construction, partly offset by anticipated lower recycling 
revenue, down £30.0 million, due to lower volumes and 
prices resulting from adverse market conditions.
Before exceptional items: Viridor’s earnings before 
interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was 
up £4.1 million to £80.4 million (2013/14 £76.3 million); 
Viridor underlying EBITDA, which includes IFRIC 12 interest 
receivable and Viridor’s share of joint venture EBITDA, was 
up £9.4 million to £135.3 million; profit before interest and 
tax (PBIT) fell £8.6 million (28.5%) to £21.6 million; and PBIT 
plus joint ventures decreased by £5.7 million (13.1%) to 
£37.9 million. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 
£0.1 million (0.4%) to £27.7 million reflecting lower PBIT plus 
joint ventures, offset by reduced interest payable, as a result 
of increased equity investment in Viridor by Pennon and 
higher IFRIC 12 interest receivable. 
Capital expenditure including spend on service concession 
arrangements for the year was £262.2 million (2013/14 
£292 million) of which c. £242 million was for Viridor growth 
projects (largely ERFs) with the balance being maintenance 
of existing assets. 
Renewable energy
Energy can be recovered essentially via two methods, either 
via gas utilisation (notably landfill gas power generation and 
anaerobic digestion (AD)) or via combustion in ERFs and 
similar facilities, some of which may be a part of Combined 
Heat and Power (CHP) schemes. Landfill gas, biodegradable 
waste in ERFs and AD accounted for 25% of total UK 
renewable energy fuel use in 2013 (Digest of UK Energy 
Statistics 2014). 
(a)  Energy Recovery Facilities (ERFs) and 
Anaerobic Digestion (AD)
Viridor now has 139 MW of renewable energy capacity from 
its fleet of ERFs and AD facilities, which includes its share 
of joint ventures at Lakeside ERF, Runcorn I ERF and the 
Greater Manchester AD operations. 
The company has been successfully implementing its 
strategic plan to deliver the ERF business which will drive 
long-term profit momentum. This includes establishing a 
significant asset base of ERFs, the majority of which are now 
operational. Viridor and its partners have a total operational/
committed ERF capacity of 2.8 million tonnes. 
Five plants, being Runcorn I and II, Exeter, Ardley and 
Cardiff, have been delivered into the operational Energy 
Division, contributing underlying EBITDA of £41.9 million 
during the year. 
While the Runcorn plants were delayed in construction, 
liquidated damages were receivable for the period post 
the original contractual completion date. All other plants 
were delivered within or below budget. Two further plants, 
Peterborough and Glasgow, are more than halfway through 
construction; Dunbar commenced construction towards the 
end of the year, and Notice to Proceed with the construction 
of Beddington ERF was issued after the year-end.
100% of waste inputs have been secured for all plants 
at opening and Viridor has now secured c. 80% of the 
required waste inputs for the portfolio of the operational 
and committed plants, of which three-quarters are from 
long-term contracts. Achieving a balance between long-term 
local authority contracts and shorter term commercial 
waste fuel inputs enables an appropriate level of control 
over calorific value and therefore throughput and efficiency 
optimisation, as well as enhancing gate price control.

24 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Report from Chief Executive, Viridor (b) Landfill gas generation
Viridor’s landfill energy business is being managed to 
maximise the value of landfill gas power generation, while 
exploring cryogenic energy storage and solar power 
developments as alternative uses for landfill sites with 
existing grid connections.
Gas volumes reached peak production in 2012/13 and 
have been reducing gradually. In 2014/15 the landfill gas 
power generation output was marginally down to 602 
gigawatt hours (GWh) (2013/14 606 GWh), reflecting a 
successful output optimisation programme. Landfill gas 
power generation EBITDA was £35.8 million (2013/14 
£37.3 million).
Average revenue per megawatt hour (MWh) was 3.3% 
higher at £92.72 (2013/14 £89.74) reflecting the higher 
proportion of Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs). 
The switch from legacy Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) 
contracts to ROCs continues with 94% of energy now sold 
under the higher value ROCs. The remaining 6% NFFO 
component will migrate to ROCs by 2016/17. Average 
costs increased to £33.19 per MWh (2013/14 £28.13) due 
to maintenance costs to improve gas capture and lower 
volumes. Total landfill gas power generation operational 
capacity remained at 104 MW (excluding 3 MW capacity at 
sub-contract sites in Suffolk).
A 2.75 MW solar power installation at Westbury landfill was 
completed during the first half of 2014/15 and an £8 million 
cryogenic energy storage pilot project at Pilsworth landfill, 
funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, 
is under way. Future alternative uses for landfill sites are 
also being assessed as most of Viridor’s landfill operations 
accelerate into closure. 
(c) Landfill
The business plan now being implemented for the landfill 
business is reducing operations to a few strategic sites, 
reflecting the fact that there will still be demand for landfilling 
of certain materials for the foreseeable future. The other sites 
are being run to closure and aftercare with an emphasis on 
maximising the value of electricity generation from landfill 
gas and reducing costs. Non-strategic sites and closed sites 
are being assessed for alternative uses – both for energy 
and for development potential. Three sites were closed in 
2014/15 and a similar closure rate is forecast for the next 
five years, taking the number of sites from 18 to three.
The business continues to be cash generative and 
contributed £15.4 million to EBITDA in the year. Volumes 
were slightly down at 2.5 million tonnes.
Average gate fees decreased by 13.6% to £19.92 per 
tonne. Consented landfill capacity reduced from 57.7 million 
cubic metres (mcm) at 31 March 2014 to 51.7 mcm at 
31 March 2015, reflecting usage during the period and site 
closures. As previously stated, and provided for, 39 mcm is 
not expected to be used.
Landfill tax is now increasing in line with inflation and 
increased on 1 April 2015 from £80 to £82.60.

Strategic 
overview
South West 
Water
Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Recycling and resources
During the year recycling volumes traded decreased by 
151,000 tonnes (8.4%) to 1.7 million tonnes. Recyclate 
prices, while lower, have stabilised to some degree for most 
commodities but remain under pressure, reflecting world 
economic conditions and competitive markets. Overall, 
average revenues per tonne from recyclate sales and gate 
fees for the year fell to £86 per tonne, 7.7% lower than for 
2013/14. Viridor remains cautious about future recyclate 
price growth and shipping costs.
EBITDA for the year was £49.0 million (2013/14 
£62.6 million).
As announced at the half year, Viridor has commenced a 
two year Input, Throughput, Output Optimisation programme 
(ITOO) to provide an enhanced focus on increasing margins 
by taking actions across the value chain. The company 
is targeting a substantial enhancement in EBITDA margin 
through improvements in asset productivity. 
Viridor continues to operate the most extensive Materials 
Recycling Facility (MRF) capacity in the UK with 
accreditations for export to China, and is established 
as a quality brand in the UK, Europe and other Far 
Eastern markets.
Profits were down slightly across the 15 local authority 
contracts around the UK (the more significant contracts 
include Greater Manchester, Lakeside, Glasgow, Lancashire, 
Somerset and West Sussex) and the Thames Water 
contract. The decrease reflected lower volumes on some 
contracts and the expiry of other contracts. 
Additional contracts have been won since the year-end but 
profits are expected to be impacted by the expiry of some 
old contracts.
Profits in the collection business were ahead of expectations, 
reflecting the benefits of sustained management action. 
Collection remains a key focus in securing increased input 
tonnages for the business.
Joint ventures
Total share of joint ventures’ EBITDA (comprising VLGM 
(including IFRIC 12 interest), TPSCo and Lakeside) was 
up 0.7% to £41.4 million (2013/14 £41.1 million). Total 
share of joint ventures’ profit after tax was £4.9 million, up 
£1.2 million from 2013/14. 
(a) Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) (VLGM)
The 25 year Greater Manchester Waste PFI contract (being 
delivered through VLGM) is the UK’s largest ever combined 
waste and renewable energy project. The company is a 
joint venture between Viridor and John Laing Infrastructure. 
Operation of the associated facilities is being carried out on 
a sub-contract basis by Viridor.
Solid recovered fuel produced from the waste is used to 
generate heat and power at Runcorn I ERF, which has 
been built primarily for the Greater Manchester Waste 
PFI contract. 
As part of the VLGM contract, a separate contractor was 
mandated to construct 43 facilities. All of the facilities have 
now been formally taken over by Viridor. Final acceptance of 
certain facilities remains subject to fulfilment of the required 
contractual terms. 
Viridor’s share of VLGM’s EBITDA was £3.0 million (2013/14 
£2.5 million). Viridor’s share of IFRIC 12 interest was 
£12.1 million (2013/14 £12.5 million). 
(b) Runcorn I (TPSCo)
Viridor’s share of TPSCo’s EBITDA was £8.2 million 
(2013/14 £10.9 million) reflecting higher costs during 
final commissioning.
The Runcorn I ERF was taken over in January 2015. 
(c) Lakeside
Lakeside, the first of Viridor’s ERF projects, continues to 
outperform its financial close assumed power generation 
and waste processing targets. Viridor’s share of Lakeside’s 
EBITDA was £18.1 million (2013/14 £15.2 million). 
Results in 2014/15 benefited from different scheduled 
outage timing (H1 2013/14 vs H1 2015/16) and continued 
good performance.
Strategic review Continued
26 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Report from Chief Executive, Viridor People 
Viridor employs over 3,000 people across the UK. The 
achievements, professionalism and innovation of its 
employees remain a great source of pride to the company. 
Their health, safety and welfare remain its top priority.
Health and safety
Viridor has set itself the goal of making a step change in the 
way it manages health, safety and welfare, and is working 
hard to promote a ‘zero incidents’ safety culture throughout 
the organisation. Central to its approach are clear, effective 
and regular campaigns and communications supporting 
health, safety and working well, such as the high profile 
‘Stop & Think’ campaign originally developed in the South 
West and now rolled out across all company sites. There 
was a continued fall in the RIDDOR incidence rate, with 
28 reportable incidents giving a rate of 889 per 100,000 
employees (2013/14 1,197). 
A tragic incident which resulted in a fatality of a Viridor 
employee in early June 2015 is under investigation. Our 
thoughts are with his friends, family and colleagues.
Employee development
Leading organisations across the world recognise that 
skills, professional development and retention are of crucial 
importance, and good employee engagement is becoming 
one of the key differentiators in business. Engaged 
employees and high-performing teams help drive safety, 
productivity, profitability and customer focus. Viridor has 
renewed its focus in this area utilising the well-respected 
Gallup Q12 engagement programme. Following its first 
company-wide Q12 survey and a series of staff roadshows 
sharing the company strategy and key business priorities, 
local level action planning is now helping to drive positive 
change and a focus on business improvements across 
the company. This is particularly timely as the company 
continues the implementation of its Enterprise Resource 
Platform throughout the business.
Viridor has comprehensive programmes of training and 
professional development to ensure its employees have the 
skills, expertise and support to meet the demands of the 
business. 5,887 training days were delivered across the 
company during the year. Viridor currently has 15 full-time 
apprenticeships and an additional five new apprenticeships 
have been confirmed for Viridor’s ERFs. A new intake 
has been confirmed for the innovative Viridor Foundation 
Management Degree course, developed in partnership 
with Edge Hill University. The first cohort of 15 managers 
successfully graduated in 2014, with 25 due to graduate 
in 2015/16.
The company continues to strive towards a workforce that is 
representative of the communities in which it operates and to 
ensure a pipeline of talent for the future needs of the business. 
Viridor’s employee performance appraisal system incorporates 
the company’s six core behavioural competencies, designed 
to ensure the right managerial skill sets. Succession planning 
is also underway across the business.
Key relationships
Of Viridor’s largest customer groups, local authorities 
account for 39% of the company’s revenue (2013/14 
31%). No individual authority accounts for more than 12% 
(2013/14 12%). Viridor’s ROC energy contracts account for 
7% of revenue (2013/14 7%), primarily with one customer.
The company’s operational facilities in England and Wales 
require environmental permits to be issued and regulated 
by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales. 
In Scotland similar waste management licences or pollution 
prevention and control permits are issued and regulated 
by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. Viridor 
maintains a positive and proactive working relationship 
with these and other regulatory bodies by means of close 
ongoing liaison and active management of any issues arising 
under permit conditions at either site or strategic levels. For 
example, Viridor continues to share live monitoring data from 
operational sites with the regulators via custom-developed 
web portals to ensure a transparent and resource-saving 
approach to monitoring and regulation.
Viridor has strengthened its approach to procurement and 
supply chain relationships during the year with the formation 
of a new procurement function and more efficient protocols. 
These include a formal policy on sustainable procurement 
utilising whole life costings, ensuring clear environmental and 
social responsibility criteria for goods and services procured, and 
delivering long-term value for Viridor and, in turn, its customers. 
Outlook
Excellent progress has been achieved in the realisation and 
delivery of its ERF business. Five major facilities became 
operational in the financial year adding to the existing 
Lakeside and Bolton operational ERF assets. Three others 
are under construction and Notice to Proceed with the 
construction of Beddington ERF has been issued. 
The drivers and demand for recycling in the UK remain strong, 
although Viridor remains appropriately cautious about the future 
prospects for recyclate prices. The company is nonetheless 
strongly positioned and remains focused on its ITOO 
programme to maximise revenues and achieve efficiencies to 
sustain margins. A further decline in recyclate prices and UK 
power prices would impact profitability next year.
Viridor’ s EBITDA figure in 2014/15 exceeded 2013/14 as 
expected. The operational ERFs along with those that are 
under construction are expected to contribute c. £100 million to 
Viridor’ s EBITDA in 2016/17. Viridor is also well positioned with 
its recycling, contracts and collections assets and services.

28 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Report from the Group Director of Finance The year’s financial highlights
(before exceptional items)
Group profit before tax increased by £3.4 million (1.6%) to 
£210.7 million, driven by a resilient performance across the 
Group. Earnings per share before deferred tax decreased by 
6.6% to 39.8p and includes the impact of the tariff freeze in 
South West Water, which will be recovered on a net present 
value (NPV) neutral basis over the next five year period. 
South West Water recorded a strong performance against 
the 2010-2015 (K5) regulatory contract and outperformed 
regulatory assumptions. South West Water profit before 
tax was up £5.4 million (3.3%) to £167.9 million reflecting 
higher revenues, good cost control and lower average 
borrowing rates, all achieved against the backdrop of in-year 
tariff freezes.
Viridor earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA) were up £4.1 million to £80.4 million. 
Viridor underlying EBITDA, which includes IFRIC 12 interest 
receivable and Viridor’s share of joint venture EBITDA, 
increased by £9.4 million to £135.3 million. The increase in 
earnings reflects Energy Recovery Facilities (ERFs) becoming 
operational, partly offset by continuing declines in landfill and 
a softening of the recycling market.
We have secured further funding to finance continuing 
growth. By the year-end we had £1,741 million in cash and 
facilities (including £196 million of restricted funds) in place 
to fund the continuing growth in Viridor’s ERF business, 
together with a significant proportion of South West Water’s 
2015-2020 (K6) capital programme.
Capital investment remained significant this year at 
£407 million due to continuing major investment in Viridor’s 
ERFs, which are driving future growth. Two-thirds of 
committed ERF capital investment is now complete. South 
West Water’s capital expenditure in the year was broadly 
in line with 2013/14. A key element of the programme in 
the year was the acceleration of certain K6 projects into 
2014/15 to deliver early outcome benefits to customers and 
the environment. 
We have secured funding at a cost that is relatively low in 
absolute terms. The Group interest rate on average net debt 
improved to 3.4% (2013/14 3.8%).
Revenue
Group revenue increased by 2.7% to £1,357.2 million. South 
West Water’s revenue increased by 0.4% to £522.2 million 
as a result of higher demand, new connections and higher 
other revenue, partially offset by a reduction in revenue from 
customers switching from unmeasured to metered charges. 
Viridor’s revenue increased by 4.2% to £835.9 million due 
primarily to ERFs becoming operational and increased 
construction spend on service concession arrangements, 
partly offset by lower recycling revenues.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA)
(before exceptional items)
Group EBITDA increased by 0.9% to £411.0 million with 
South West Water up by 0.1% to £331.3 million and Viridor 
up by 5.4% to £80.4 million. K5 outturn operational cost 
efficiencies in South West Water were cumulatively 11% 
ahead of the K5 Final Determination. Viridor’s EBITDA was 
ahead of last year due to ERFs becoming operational, partly 
offset by declines in recycling and landfill.
Net finance costs
We continued our effective management of interest rates in 
2014/15 with interest payable (including capitalised interest) 
net of interest receivable, on average net debt equating to 
3.4% (2013/14 3.8%) which included lower interest payable 
on RPI-linked debt.
Net finance costs of £40.8 million were £13.1 million lower 
than last year, reflecting an £8.7 million saving due to the full 
conversion of the £125 million convertible bond, £5.0 million 
higher IFRIC 12 interest receivable and lower average 
borrowing rates. 
Interest receivable totalling £19.1 million (2013/14 
£13.7 million) has been achieved from the objective of 
enhancing returns on the Group’s substantial pre-funding of 
£771 million.
During the year net finance costs (excluding pensions 
net interest, discount unwind on provisions and IFRIC 12 
contract interest receivable) were £41.1 million (2013/14 
£49.1 million), covered 6.0 times (2013/14 5.2 times) by 
Group operating profit.
A continuing low net interest rate was achieved, 
coupled with raising cash and facilities to fund 
ongoing capital investment: £1,741 million cash and 
facilities at 31 March 2015, including £830 million of 
new and refinanced facilities sourced during the year.

Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Financial review Continued
Profit before tax
(before exceptional items)
Profit before tax was £210.7 million, an increase of 1.6%. 
Pages 12 and 20 give a detailed description of the financial 
performance of South West Water and Viridor respectively. 
On a statutory basis, profit before tax was £197.0 million 
reflecting exceptional items of £13.7 million.
Taxation
(before exceptional items)
The Group’s UK corporation tax charge for the year was 
£39.2 million (2013/14 £35.3 million) after the release of 
prior year credits of £5.5 million (2013/14 £16.5 million). 
The increase primarily reflects lower prior year credits, partly 
offset by a reduction in the rate of corporation tax and higher 
ERF capital allowances. Deferred tax for the year was a 
charge of £18.2 million (2013/14 credit of £25.8 million). 
The charge compared to the previous year reflects the 
one-off credit of £40.1 million in 2013/14 due to the enacted 
3% reduction in the future rate of UK corporation tax.
Earnings per share
(before exceptional items and deferred tax)
Earnings per ordinary share decreased by 6.6% to 39.8p 
primarily reflecting South West Water’s tariff freeze, which will 
be recovered over 2015-2020 (K6) on an NPV neutral basis. 
The weighted average number of shares in issue during 
the year was 390.9 million (2013/14 367.4 million) with the 
increase largely reflecting the issuance of 20.9 million shares 
from the £125 million convertible bond. Net assets per share 
at book value at 31 March 2015 were 340p.
Exceptional items
Net exceptional items totalling a charge before tax of 
£13.7 million have been recognised. The net charge 
includes £24.3 million to write down the carrying values of 
Viridor’s property, plant and equipment (net of impairment 
reversals of £9.2 million), £11.0 million for a small number 
of underperforming Viridor contracts, net of credits of 
£14.9 million from changes made to the Group’s defined 
benefit scheme and £6.7 million from the reassessment 
of Viridor landfill environmental provisioning. The net 
exceptional charge has no immediate cash impact.
The exceptional items total a charge net of tax of £11.0 million.
Dividends and retained earnings
The statutory net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 
of £126.3 million has been transferred to reserves.
The Directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 
21.82p per share for the year ended 31 March 2015. With 
the interim dividend of 9.98p per share paid on 2 April 2015 
this gives a total dividend for the year of 31.80p, an increase 
of 4.9% over 2013/14 (reflecting 4% real growth plus March 
2015 RPI of 0.9%).
Proposed dividends totalling £129.5 million are covered 
1.2 times by net profit (before exceptional items and deferred 
tax) (2013/14 1.3 times). Dividends are charged against 
retained earnings in the year in which they are paid.
Dividend policy
This year we announced our dividend policy for the period 
to 2019/20. The previous policy of increasing the dividend 
each year by 4% above RPI has been extended to 2019/20. 
This results in a 10 year (2010-2020) policy of 4% annual 
dividend growth above RPI. 
Operating costs 
(before exceptional items)
Operating costs for the year totalled £1,111 million.  
The most significant areas of expenditure were:

Liquidity and debt profile
The Group has a strong liquidity and funding position 
with £1,741 million cash and facilities at 31 March 2015. 
This includes cash and deposits of £771 million (including 
£196 million of restricted funds representing deposits with 
lessors against lease obligations) and undrawn facilities of 
£970 million. A total of £830 million in new or renewed debt 
facilities was arranged during the year, being:
• £125 million new 17 year facility
• £130 million new Schuldschein
• £80 million new 13 year facility
• £240 million of new finance leases of which £175 million 
are for Viridor ERFs, £65 million for South West Water
• £255 million of new loans and revolving credit facilities.
At 31 March 2015 the Group’s loans and finance lease 
obligations totalled £2,968 million. After the £771 million 
held in cash, this gives a net debt figure of £2,197 million, 
an increase of £3 million during the year. Debt incurred for 
the construction of Viridor’s portfolio of ERFs at Runcorn II, 
Ardley, Exeter, Cardiff, Glasgow and Dunbar increased to 
£844 million at 31 March 2015, which represents 38% of 
Group net debt.
The Group’s debt has a maturity of up to 42 years with 
an average maturity of 23 years. The Group has fixed, or 
put swaps in place to fix, the interest rate on a substantial 
portion of South West Water’s debt for the entire K6 period. 
During the year the average rate achieved on all fixed rate 
debt was 3.4% for 2014/15. For South West Water this 
figure was 3.1%. 
A further £393.1 million of South West Water’s debt is 
index-linked at an overall real rate of 1.7%. As a result of 
the aforementioned initiatives, South West Water’s cost of 
finance is among the lowest in the industry.
The Group’s financing structure gives us the scope and 
flexibility we need to implement our strategic objectives in 
order to maximise value for our shareholders.
The Group’s interest rate on average net debt for the year 
to 31 March 2015 is 3.4% (after adjusting for capitalised 
interest of £22.5 million, notional interest items totalling 
£0.3 million and interest received from shareholder loans to 
joint ventures of £11.4 million, as detailed in note 8 to the 
financial statements).
Just under half of the Group’s gross debt is finance leasing 
giving us a long maturity profile. Interest payable benefits 
from the fixed credit margins which were secured at the 
inception of each lease.
At 31 March 2015 the fair value of the Group’s non-current 
borrowings was £74 million less than its book value 
(2014 £275 million) as detailed in note 28 to the financial 
statements. This reflects the benefit of securing interest rates 
below the current market rate.

Strategic 
overview
South West 
Water
Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Capital structure – overall position
At the end of the financial year the Group’s net debt of 
£2,197 million gave a gearing ratio of net debt to (equity plus 
net debt) of 61.9% at 31 March 2015 (2014 64.7%).
In March 2013 the Group issued a £300 million hybrid capital 
security recognised as equity as set out in note 37 to the 
financial statements.
During the year the Company continued to benefit from 
offering a Scrip Dividend Alternative. £48 million of potential 
cash dividend was retained in the business and instead 
distributed by issuing c. six million shares.
South West Water’s debt to Regulatory Capital Value (RCV) 
was 62% at 31 March 2015 (2014 56%), which compares 
to Ofwat’s optimum range of 55%-65% for K5 and K6 target 
efficient gearing of 62.5%.
Viridor is funded by a combination of Pennon Group equity 
and debt (raised by Pennon Group) and direct borrowing by 
Viridor. At the year-end Viridor’s net debt was £920 million 
(2014 £901 million), equivalent to 11.4 times EBITDA before 
exceptional items (2014 11.8 times).
Treasury policies
The role of the Group’s treasury function is to ensure we 
have the funding to meet foreseeable needs to maintain 
reasonable headroom for future contingencies and to 
manage interest rate risk. The Group enters into certain 
structured financing transactions that have, and are 
expected to provide, an improved return on surplus funds 
and overall interest rate performance. It operates only 
within policies approved by the Board and undertakes no 
speculative trading activity.
The Board regularly monitors expected financing needs for 
at least the following 12 months. These are intended to be 
met for the coming year from existing cash balances, loan 
facilities and operating cash flows.
The Group has considerable financial resources and a broad 
spread of business activities. The Directors therefore believe 
that it is well placed to manage its business risks.
Internal borrowing
South West Water’s funding is treated for regulatory 
purposes as ring-fenced. This means that funds raised by, or 
for, the company are not available as long-term funding for 
other areas of the Group.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue its operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. They therefore have 
continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Taxation objectives and policies
Our tax strategy, as approved by the Board, is to fulfil our 
statutory obligations by the application of relevant tax 
legislation in a reasonable way, engaging in tax planning only 
when it is aligned with the commercial and economic activity 
of the Company. This is in line with the principles published 
by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in 2013.
Tax contribution 2014/15 – collected/paid
The Group made a net payment of £21.0 million of UK 
corporation tax in the year (2013/14 £58.1 million). The 
main elements of the payment were £25.3 million in relation 
to 2014/15 net of refunds of £3.1 million from prior years. 
No additional quarterly payments were made in relation to 
2013/14. South West Water paid £36.4 million (2013/14 
£44.1 million) of UK corporation tax on profit before tax of 
£167.9 million (2013/14 £162.5 million).
The total tax charge for the year (before exceptional 
items) of £57.4 million was greater than the charge that 
would have arisen had the accounting profit before tax 
and exceptional items been taxed at the statutory rate 
of 21%. A reconciliation is provided in note 9 to the 
financial statements. 
The mainstream tax charge for the year (before deferred tax, 
prior year and exceptional items) of £44.7 million results in 
an effective rate of 21.2%, which is close to the statutory 
rate of 21.0%. 
The Group’s total tax contribution extends significantly 
beyond its UK corporation tax charge:
Landﬁll tax
£209m
Employment taxes
£50m
Business rates
£33m
UK corporation 
tax
£21m
Fuel Excise 
Duty
£10m
Environmental 
payments
£9m
Carbon Reduction 
Commitment
£4m
Other
£2m
Total taxes amounted to £329 million (2013/14 £347 million) 
of which a net amount of £26 million (2013/14 £6 million) 
was collected on behalf of the authorities for employee 
payroll taxes and VAT.
In addition to corporation tax the most significant taxes 
involved, together with their profit impact, were:
• landfill tax of £204 million (2013/14 £186 million) collected 
by the Group on behalf of HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). 
This amount includes £11 million (2013/14 £12 million) paid 
to local environmental bodies via the Landfill T ax Credits 
Scheme. Landfill tax is an operating cost that is recovered 
from customers and is recognised in revenue. In addition the 
Group incurred landfill tax of £5 million (2013/14 £29 million) 
on the disposal of waste to third parties. The reduction of 
£24 million compared to 2013/14 reflects that more waste 
from the Greater Manchester contract is being deposited in 
Viridor sites and is also being diverted to the Runcorn I ERF . 
This is an operating cost for the Group and reduces profit 
before tax. The net amount of landfill tax paid to HMRC by 
the Group and via third parties represents 17% of the total 
landfill receipts of HMRC in the year
Financial review Continued
32 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Report from the Group Director of Finance • Value Added Tax (VAT) of £9 million recovered (2013/14 
£29 million recovered) by the Group from HMRC. The 
reduction in the repayment is a result of the following: a 
reduction in capital expenditure, an increase in revenue in 
Viridor and the increase in the level of sale and leaseback 
transactions. VAT has no material impact on profit 
before tax
• business rates of £33 million (2013/14 £32 million) paid 
to local authorities. This is a direct cost to the Group and 
reduces profit before tax
• employment taxes of £50 million (2013/14 £48 million) 
including employees’ Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and total 
National Insurance Contributions (NICs). Employer 
NICs of £14 million (2013/14 £13 million) were 
charged approximately 92% to operating costs with 
8% capitalised to property, plant and equipment. The 
total amount of £50 million includes PAYE of £2 million 
(2013/14 £2 million) on pension payments made by the 
Group pension schemes
• Fuel Excise Duty of £10 million (2013/14 £10 million) 
related to transport costs. This reduces profit before tax
• payments to Environment Agency and other regulatory 
bodies totalling £9 million (2013/14 £10 million). This 
reduces profit before tax
• Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) payment for the 
Group of £4 million (2013/14 £1 million). This represents 
the commitment payments for both carbon usage in 
2013/14 and 2014/15 as phase 2 of the CRC mechanism 
has commenced and payments are now made in 
advance. In addition the rate has increased by 33% and 
Viridor no longer receives credit for its energy generation. 
This reduces profit before tax.
The corporation tax rate for 2014/15 used to calculate 
the current year’s tax is 21%. The corporation tax rate has 
been reduced to 20% for 2015/16 following changes in the 
Finance Act 2013.
Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for 
certain employees of Pennon Group, South West Water and 
Viridor. The main schemes were closed to new entrants on 
or before 1 April 2008.
At 31 March 2015 the Group’s pension schemes showed 
a deficit (before deferred tax) of £59.6 million (2013/14 
£79.3 million). The decrease primarily reflects an increase in 
the schemes’ asset values and an exceptional reduction in 
the liability of £14.9 million (£11.9 million after tax) relating 
to past service cost. This has been recognised following 
changes in the Group’s main scheme benefits, particularly 
the introduction of a cap on increases in pensionable pay.
Net liabilities of £48 million (after deferred tax) represented 
around 2% of the Group’s market capitalisation at 
31 March 2015. 
The last actuarial valuation of the main scheme was as at 
31 March 2013.
Insurance
Pennon Group manages its property and third party 
liability risks through insurance policies that mainly cover 
property and business interruption, motor, public liability, 
environmental pollution and employers’ liability.
The Group uses three tiers of insurance to cover 
operating risks:
• self-insurance – Group companies pay a moderate 
excess on most claims
• cover by the Group’s subsidiary (Peninsula Insurance 
Limited) of the layer of risk between the self-insurance 
and the cover provided by external insurers
• cover provided by the external insurance market, 
arranged by our brokers with insurance companies which 
have good credit ratings.
Post year-end acquisition of Bournemouth Water
On 15 April 2015 Pennon acquired Sembcorp Bournemouth 
Water Investments Limited from Sembcorp Holdings Limited, 
including the non-regulated and regulated subsidiaries, 
for a cash consideration of £100.3 million. As part of the 
acquisition £86.9 million of external net debt and debt-like 
items have been assumed by Pennon Group Plc.
An equity placing was undertaken to replenish Pennon’s 
cash resources in respect of the acquisition and ensure 
funding flexibility. 
The acquisition has been accounted for in 2015/16 using the 
acquisition method. Provisional goodwill of c. £66 million will 
be capitalised.
The acquisition represents an incremental 5% growth in RCV 
and is modestly earnings enhancing following integration.
In accordance with current legislation an automatic merger 
reference has been made to the Competition and Markets 
Authority (CMA). A decision is expected to be received on 
the merger from the CMA within its usual timescales.

Non-recovery of 
customer debt.
In addition to existing strategies, which are kept under review, 
South West Water continues to implement new initiatives to 
improve and secure cash collection.
A new strategy for debt collection is being implemented which 
includes:
• improved processes for managing customer moves 
targeting previous occupier debt;
• specific case management and utilising court claims 
effectively; and
• increasing the use of charging orders to secure debt.
South West Water is one of the few companies to have 
implemented a social tariff ‘WaterCare’. 
The company has also continued to fund and promote ways 
to help customers struggling to pay bills (WaterCare, Restart, 
Fresh Start Fund), which seek to reduce bad debt exposure.
In future, further changes to the benefits and universal credit 
system, any significant changes to personal taxation policy 
implemented by UK Government as well as macro-economic 
trends, such as levels of household income relative to the 
cost of living, may further affect the ability of customers to pay 
their bills.

Extreme weather 
and climate change 
can place pressure 
on the company’s

and networks.
South West Water is well placed to cope with extreme 
incidents. A key mitigation is having detailed contingency 
plans, sufficient emergency resources and a capital 
programme that supports ongoing efforts to manage 
these risks.
In the longer term, the impacts of climate change are being 
considered. The company has plans ready and will adapt 
the way it conducts its business to respond effectively to the 
anticipated hotter, drier summers and wetter winters. 
Poor service provided

The company has delivered further improvements to customer 
service demonstrated across a number of measures including 
improved satisfaction (value for money), reduced written 
complaints and fewer water quality complaints. 
South West Water has improved its relative industry measure 
SIM, resulting in its best ever score in 2014/15.
While South West Water’s performance continues to 
improve, the performance in the K5 period has incurred a 
modest financial penalty (already incorporated in the 2014 
Final Determination). 
Targeted improvements are being made to further improve 
customer service and the company’s relative industry standing

South West Water has a number of schemes in place to 
maintain water resources (such as pumped storage for 
certain reservoirs) and promotes conservation measures and 
customer water efficiency measures.
South West Water also considers the longer-term resource 
situation. It prepares a new Water Resources Management 
Plan every five years and reviews it annually for a range of 
climate change and demand scenarios. 
In recent years South West Water has worked in partnership 
with other representatives to identify a wide range of factors 
that can cause and exacerbate flooding events. 
The company has identified targeted capital investments to 
reduce the risk to specific customers in key affected areas 
and, working alongside lead local flood authorities, other 
partner agencies, developers and environmental groups, 
is identifying best practice management of extreme rainfall 
and flooding.

Risk Mitigation 2013/14 2014/15 Direction
Failure or increased 
costs of capital 
projects and/or joint 
ventures not achieving 
predicted revenues 
or performance.
Increased skilled management resource including the 
establishment of ‘oversight boards’ for each of the major 
projects has added additional rigour to their delivery. 
Wherever possible back-to-back agreements with, and 
guarantees from, suppliers are entered into which provide 
a significant degree of protection. Viridor’s experienced 
and dedicated project/contract teams carry out detailed 
due diligence on all projects, suppliers, technologies and 
acquisitions prior to commencement.
There is also regular monthly reporting on performance on 
major contracts and post project appraisals are carried out, 
which all assist in being able to improve future performance.
Exposure to contractor 
failure to deliver 
construction progress, 
increasing costs and 
potentially requiring 
lengthy legal action or 
other redress.
Extensive due diligence and significant protection of back-to-
back contracts and/or penalty clauses in contracts to deliver 
new technologies on time and within budget.
Viridor, through its Capital Projects and Engineering Director, 
proactively manages its contractors. It has enhanced its 
team, both from internal and external resources, to reflect the 
increased scale of its capital programme.
Competitive pressures
Risk Mitigation 2013/14 2014/15 Direction
Reduced customer 
base, increased 
competition affecting 
prices or reduced 
demand for services.
Viridor provides recycling and waste management services 
which are locally delivered services from locally managed 
facilities and a significant proportion of its revenue is 
contracted over the medium or long term. In general terms 
Viridor’s strategy is to establish a sustainable competitive 
advantage in the business in which it operates; this is 
designed to protect long-term shareholder returns.
With regard to major competitive projects being pursued there 
are barriers to entry due to planning permissions being difficult 
to obtain and significant investment requirements. Viridor 
believes there is competitive shake-out taking place among 
marginal competitors which will, in due course, benefit Viridor.
Potential overcapacity 
in the UK ERF market 
could impact demand 
for Viridor’s new plants.
Viridor has fully evaluated projected demand and competing 
capacity for each of its planned facilities and is confident that 
they can be filled profitably. As landfill tax reached £82.60 per 
tonne in April 2015, Viridor’s large-scale ERFs will remain one 
of the low-cost ways of disposing of residual waste.
Overcapacity in parts 
of Europe could impact 
the UK ERF market. 
UK waste could be 
converted into solid 
recovered fuel (SRF) 
or refuse derived fuel 
(RDF) and exported 
under Environment 
Agency licence for 
disposal in Europe.
The costs of producing SRF and RDF to the required quality 
and of shipping it to Europe are broadly at the cost of landfill 
tax. Disposal and generation of the associated renewable 
energy in ERFs in the UK is generally lower cost (and better for 
the UK economy). Despite the availability of export, Viridor is 
successfully winning new contracts for its ERFs. Nevertheless, 
amounts of SRF and RDF may continue to be exported, 
especially if UK ERF capacity remains insufficient.
Business systems
Risk Mitigation 2013/14 2014/15 Direction
Some of Viridor’s 
IT systems require 
replacement, 
development or 
upgrading to meet the 
growing requirements 
of the business. 
Project Enterprise, charged with developing a fully scalable 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) type platform, is now well 
advanced and involves external consultancy as required, with 
a focus on best practice and minimising implementation risk.

more than 20% of net borrowings mature in any one year. 
In addition, in respect of South West Water the economic 
regulator has a statutory duty to ensure that the company is 
able to finance its functions in the normal course of business. 
The Group has to date obtained funding at lower effective 
average interest rates compared with many other companies 
in its sector and is well placed to meet the funding 
requirements of both South West Water and Viridor in the 
foreseeable future.

From the efforts made to reduce the impact of construction 
or roadworks on local communities to the steps taken to 
provide information in a proactive and easily understandable 
way, South West Water strives to improve the relationships it 
has with its customers and stakeholders. Progress made in 
the ‘Pure Service’ pillar of the company’s strategy is covered 
in the Chief Executive’s review, on page 17. Of particular 
note is the significant increase in the company’s customer 
satisfaction score, a result of operational improvements and 
a focus on improving the customer experience.
South West Water continues to build relationships with local 
communities through a number of affordability-focused 
initiatives delivered alongside local councils, housing 
associations, voluntary organisations and carers’ 
associations. In specific areas of economic deprivation, 
community engagement events and face-to-face 
activities are used to provide a platform for engaging with 
hard-to-reach or vulnerable customers. This helps to 
ensure they are receiving the right advice and support on 
issues such as water efficiency, overdue payments and 
benefits entitlement. 
Viridor
Viridor provides high quality recycling, recovery and waste 
management services to over 100 local authorities and 
over 32,000 customers across all sectors throughout the 
UK. An increasing proportion of our customers continue to 
seek a ‘zero waste to landfill’ service and to maximise waste 
reduction, recycling and recovery from their own waste in 
a cost effective manner. The company looks to form close 
partnerships with its clients and continuously improve its 
services to meet their aspirations.
Viridor’s customers want assurance of a reliable and quality 
service, financial integrity and high standards of compliance. 
Increasingly they require both detailed auditing and reporting 
of resource and carbon management practices and a 
commitment to ongoing improvement and engagement as 
part of their own supply chains. Viridor is pleased to be able 
to continue to offer a progressive and collaborative approach 
to service and sustainability in these challenging times.
Viridor’s achievement of a three star rank in Business in the 
Community’s annual benchmark of responsible business, 
the Corporate Responsibility Index (see page 45), marks 
a further milestone in its drive towards productive and 
sustainable partnerships with community stakeholders.

Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements South West Water
From sustainable abstraction and award-winning catchment 
management schemes to the investments made in 
wastewater treatment and the steps taken to reduce 
carbon emissions, South West Water plays a critical role in 
protecting and enhancing the region’s natural environment. 
The company’s ‘source to sea’ approach to the 
management of water and wastewater favours innovation, 
the use of sustainable solutions and an emphasis on 
partnership working to deliver positive outcomes for the 
region’s ecosystems and habitats. 
As one of the three pillars of South West Water’s strategy, 
an overview of the company’s ‘Pure Environment’ vision 
is covered in the Chief Executive’s strategic review, on 
page 18. This section of the report includes information on 
progress made with Upstream Thinking, the company’s 
catchment and water storage programme; bathing 
water quality; pollution prevention; and wastewater 
treatment standards.
Viridor
Viridor’s stated strategic purpose is to give resources new 
life and its business strategy clearly focuses on transforming 
waste into quality recycled materials and into essential 
renewable energy. This is aligned with key long-term UK and 
global trends (in policy, business and customer demand) 
towards greater resource efficiency, energy security and 
associated environmental benefits.
Recognising the importance of stewardship, since 
2008 Viridor has also sought to restore and manage its 
substantial landholdings (notably at closed landfill sites) in 
accordance with the Wildlife Trusts’ Biodiversity Benchmark 
Scheme (BBS).
The BBS provides a framework within which an organisation 
can ensure that its impact is as positive as it possibly can 
be by providing robust, independent verification of planning 
and implementation of land management practices. The 
benchmark is a standard for assessing and certifying an 
organisation’s systems for achieving continual biodiversity 
protection and enhancement on its landholdings and the 
implementation of those systems.
By the end of 2014 Viridor had a total of six sites that had 
achieved and retained the Biodiversity Benchmark. These 
include sites of notable habitat importance such as two 
heathland restorations (Tatchells and Warmwell in Dorset) 
and a grassland restoration (Beddingham in Sussex). 
Viridor currently has the fourth highest number of BBS 
sites in the UK and is the leading company in its sector 
for BBS certifications. It has set itself a target of achieving 
three further accreditations, in line with its five year 
biodiversity plan.

Strategic report | Group South West Water
Through the services it provides, the people it employs and 
the suppliers it commissions, South West Water plays a 
large and vital role in the regional economy. 
The company has around 1,400 employees, including 
engineers, scientists, customer service advisers, office staff 
and other skilled workers. It also supports a further 6,000 
jobs in the wider economy through the use of contractors 
and other third party labour and support services.
With around eight million visitors to the region annually, 
tourism is a significant industry which relies on a safe 
and healthy environment. The company is committed to 
delivering improvements to reduce its environmental impact, 
and this year has focused on delivering bathing water 
improvements ahead of new standards in 2015.
South West Water continues to operate a ‘mixed economy’ 
supply chain model that uses smaller specialist companies 
alongside larger strategic partners. A culture of innovation 
and sharing of best practice is encouraged, not least through 
the company’s supplier forum and annual supplier awards. 
South West Water provides dedicated and essential services 
to the region’s 74,000 business and other non-household 
customers and therefore has a crucial role to play in the 
success of the local economy. This is underpinned by a 
focus on helping individual customers make the best use of 
the water they pay for, ensuring they receive a level of service 
tailored to their needs and maintaining a reliable service 
with minimal disruption. The company’s economic impact is 
set to expand with the opening of the non-household retail 
market in 2017, which will present opportunities for growth 
outside the South West. 
Viridor
Viridor’s committed investment programme totalling 
£1.5 billion in energy recovery and materials recycling 
facilities included £242 million of capital investment in 
growth projects in 2014/15. During the year £217 million 
was invested in vital energy recovery infrastructure and 
£25 million was invested in leading-edge glass and plastics 
recycling facilities at Newhouse and Rochester. 
These projects continue to create significant direct and 
indirect employment and training opportunities, including 
construction jobs and supply chain opportunities. As 
projects move from construction into operational phases, 
long-term relationships are built with local companies 
supplying services and contracts, which benefit the 
local economy. 
As an example, businesses in and around Glasgow have 
already accessed £16 million in contracts and are set to 
benefit from £9 million more due to the construction of 
Viridor’s Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre 
(GRREC) in Polmadie. Small and medium-sized enterprises 
(SMEs) and social enterprises are being encouraged to 
take advantage of the opportunities on offer via a series of 
business breakfasts and capacity building sessions in the 
local community. The GRREC facility, incorporating recycling, 
anaerobic digestion and gasification technology, is due to be 
completed in 2016.

Viridor Street Trees is Viridor’s flagship sponsorship project in its 
Northern region. As part of the partnership with the environmental 
charity Red Rose Forest, launched in 2011, Viridor seeks to reward 
its key recycling customers in Greater Manchester and the North West 
by helping them to give something back to their local communities.
The partnership also supports the Government’s national tree planting campaign, The Big Tree 
Plant, which saw one million trees being planted in the UK over the past five years. Individual 
trees between three and eight metres tall are planted on residential streets, with a plaque or 
marker to recognise the support of Viridor, Red Rose Forest and the recycling customer. Where 
practicable, these projects are undertaken in the vicinity of the recycling customer’s business 
activities, maximising awareness for Viridor and its customer.
Viridor
A new community strategy has been adopted setting out 
Viridor’s commitment to delivering lasting community benefit 
and to meeting community priorities in service areas. The 
strategy has been developed following consultation with its 
community stakeholders and therefore reflects the views and 
priorities of the communities in which Viridor operates, and 
of which it is part. Clear progress was recognised with the 
award of a three star ranking in Business in the Community’s 
2015 Corporate Responsibility (CR) Index. This is a rigorous 
and robust benchmarking tool which has helped hundreds 
of companies measure and manage the progress they are 
making to integrate responsible business practice into their 
mainstream business at all levels. 
For Viridor, the award marks a further milestone in its drive 
towards sustainability. The three star ranking (two stars in 
2013/14) also recognises the company’s significant progress 
in a broad range of key areas including procurement, 
partnerships, people, health, safety, energy, and 
environmental management.
Feedback indicates that community stakeholders’ 
priorities and expectations of Viridor are broadly in areas 
of employment, training and apprenticeships; community 
funding; youth opportunities (including education and sport); 
and reducing the risk of potential local impacts from Viridor 
operations such as traffic, noise and odour.
Among its strategic community objectives, Viridor commits 
to be a good neighbour at all of its operational facilities 
through the maintenance of quality operations and 
services, and via high levels of compliance and community 
engagement. It aims to apply similar principles and 
standards of customer care to community stakeholders as it 
does for its customers.
The company will continue to offer and utilise its education 
programmes and activities for maximum community benefit 
and engagement. This will include ensuring community 
access, quality, consistency and the sharing of best practice 
throughout the Viridor visitor centres and educational 
activities. This commitment is demonstrated at new 
interactive centres at its Energy Recovery Facilities (ERFs) in 
Cardiff and Ardley, and via its Go4SET flagship educational 
partnership with the Engineering Development Trust 
in Scotland.
Viridor also offers structured and transparent programmes 
of community investment, linked to the company’s core 
business. Such activities include an annually reviewed 
programme of targeted charitable giving and sponsorship, 
and employee volunteering opportunities.
Viridor’s achievement of a three star ranking in Business 
in the Community’s CR Index recognises strong company 
progress in relation to the business considering social and 
environmental issues when making strategic decisions 
such as investments, research and development, selection 
of business partners and addressing the priorities of the 
communities in which Viridor operates. Moreover, Viridor was 
recognised for moves to link executive directors’ and senior 
managers’ remuneration and bonuses to CR objectives and 
targets, and for providing relevant CR training for employees, 
senior managers and board members.

Scope 1 (direct emissions) Activities owned or controlled by our

example the combustion of fuels in company owned and controlled 
stationary equipment and transportation, emissions from site based 
processes and site based fugitive emissions.
Scope 2 (indirect emissions) Emissions released into the

that are a consequence of our activities but which occur at sources 
we do not own or control.
Scope 3 (other indirect emissions) Emissions that are a 
consequence of our actions, which occur at sources that we do not 
own or control and that are not classed as Scope 2 emissions.
Notes
Change in emissions
Our overall net emissions increased by 3.3% between 2013/14 and 
2014/15, largely as a result of the addition of Viridor’s new Energy 
Recovery Facilities that became fully operational during the course 
of the year. We also calculated a marginal increase in our emissions 
intensity measure of tCO
2
e/£100,000 revenue as a result of the 
Group’s emissions growing at a faster rate than its revenue.
Methodology and approach 
We have modified the methodology we use for calculating our 
emissions for 2014/15 by adopting the ‘equity share’ approach for 
Viridor companies. Under the Environmental Reporting Guidelines 
published by the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs in 
June 2013, the ‘equity share’ method reflects the extent of the rights 
a company has to the risks and rewards from an operation based 
on its equity interest. For Viridor, this means that emissions from 
joint venture operations can be accurately attributed to the company 
in proportion to the percentage of Viridor’s equity holding. The 
remaining companies within the Group continue to use the ‘financial 
control’ approach. This is the conventional method for parent 
companies and subsidiaries within a group that have the ability to 
direct financial and operating policies and retain the majority of the 
organisation’s risk and rewards. 
In order to maintain comparability between reporting years, we have 
rebased our 2013/14 reportable emissions to reflect the equity share 
methodology for Viridor.
Quantification and reporting 
We have followed the Government’s environmental reporting 
guidelines for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting 
published by DEFRA in June 2013. In calculating our emissions we 
have used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard (revised edition) and the web based conversion 
factors provided by DEFRA.
Organisational boundary
As explained above, the emissions listed here cover the Pennon 
Group of companies using the financial control approach, with the 
exception of Viridor, which uses the equity share approach.
Operational scopes 
We have measured our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and certain Scope 
3 emissions where information is available.
Intensity measurement 
We have chosen an intensity measure of Scope 1 and 2 gross 
emissions in tCO
2
e per £100,000 revenue.
External assurance statement
Our greenhouse gas emissions data has been independently verified 
by Strategic Management Consultants who tested the assumptions, 
methods and procedures that are followed in the development 
of the reported data and audited that data to ensure accuracy 
and consistency.
Carbon offsets
We rely on self-generated renewable energy to reduce our overall 
Scope 2 emissions. We supplement this with power purchase 
contracts from third party renewable energy suppliers through 
private wire arrangements where opportunities exist near our sites.
Renewable energy export
Pennon Group self-generates more electricity than it uses and much 
of its renewable electricity generation is exported to the grid. We 
account for this exported renewable electricity in our net emissions 
measure where we subtract ‘emissions credits’ up to the limit of our 
gross volume of Scope 2 emissions.
We aspire to leadership in minimising emissions that contribute to 
climate change and we develop climate change adaption strategies

46 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Group South West Water
South West Water continues to focus on reducing its carbon 
emissions through a combination of asset optimisation, 
renewable energy generation and energy-saving initiatives.
Overall energy use for 2014/15 at 260.68 GWh was 
marginally lower than the previous year (2013/14 264.5 GWh) 
despite the drier than average summer in 2014 which 
increased the need for energy-intensive water pumping. 
Although South West Water recorded a reduction in its 
energy usage, the company’s carbon emissions rose 
between 2013/14 and 2014/15. This was largely as a result 
of an increase in the Government’s electricity grid average 
emissions conversion factor which is used to calculate 
emissions from electricity usage. 
Renewable energy usage during 2014/15 was 18.5 GWh, 
an improvement on the company’s output from the previous 
year (2013/14 17.4 GWh). A number of renewable energy 
installations were taken offline for essential maintenance 
during 2014/15. The improvements made to these sites, 
along with investment in new installations, means the 
company is now able to generate 25 GWh – around 10% of 
its annual energy needs.
Furthermore, South West Water is building links with 
a number of third party renewable energy providers in 
order to increase the proportion of energy it draws from 
renewable sources.
Viridor
Viridor’s 2020 goal is to reduce its carbon footprint by 35% 
from a 2013 baseline. This is particularly challenging for the 
company as it continues with a programme of wind-down 
and aftercare in the operating landfill business while bringing 
a fleet of ERFs into operation. Recycling facilities are also 
energy intensive.
The increase in emissions between 2013/14 and 2014/15 
is primarily as a result of the addition of new ERFs that 
became fully operational during 2014/15. Emissions from 
Viridor’s landfill operations decreased between 2013/14 
and 2014/15.
Key trends in Viridor’s operational carbon footprint include:
• recycling and energy consumption – the company’s 
aspiration is to become 20% more efficient than its 
2013 baseline in terms of the fossil fuel-based energy 
used, and Viridor continues to lead the sector in the 
implementation of the ISO 50001 Energy Management 
Standard. As Viridor continues to invest in recycling 
technology, its energy consumption, mainly electricity, has 
continued to grow. Although energy intensive for Viridor, 
the displacement of virgin materials in manufacturing 
supply chains with recycled material contributes to 
significant reductions in embodied carbon across product 
lifecycles (although of course outside reporting scopes)
• transport emissions (road and rail) – these continue 
to be reduced through fleet management activities and 
greater use of rail movements where possible
• landfill – the largest contribution to Viridor’s carbon 
footprint, these continue to decline as inputs reduce, 
biodegradable waste is diverted and sites close
• energy generation (ERF and anaerobic digestion) – 
although biogenic emissions (over 60% of ERF inputs) 
are out of scope, with an increasing fleet of ERFs this 
will continue to become a more significant proportion 
of the company’s carbon footprint. Measured using 
tCO
2
e per tonne of waste input, ERF treatment delivers a 
step-change improvement over landfill in the long term.

South West Water
Resource efficiency is critical to the success of South West 
Water’s operations. First and foremost, the company does 
everything it can to make the best use of the raw water it 
treats and then distributes. The company’s achievements in 
this area, which include 18 consecutive years without water 
restrictions, are covered in the Chief Executive’s strategic 
review on page 16. 
Where appropriate, the company favours the use of 
innovation and new technologies to deliver an efficient use 
of resources. This spans everything from the implementation 
of remote technologies to better manage assets and 
employees to the adoption of low-cost sustainable 
techniques in areas such as urban wastewater management 
(Downstream Thinking). The company’s K6 investment 
programme includes a new water treatment works for 
Plymouth and its surrounding area, which will use less 
energy and chemicals than its traditional counterparts. This 
will be achieved through the use of cutting edge treatment 
technologies that were piloted during K5.
There are inevitable by-products of South West Water’s 
operations and the company does its best to recycle and 
reuse where this is feasible. Sludge is recycled for use 
as fertiliser on agricultural land. Strict regulations on this 
practice continue to be adhered to. South West Water also 
works with its contractors to ensure that any waste materials 
from construction work are recycled or disposed of in a 
responsible way. 
Viridor
Viridor works closely with its clients and with communities 
to help educate and inform residents and businesses 
about waste prevention and best practice in recycling and 
resource efficiency.
In Greater Manchester, an updated communications plan for 
2015-2018 has been developed to drive behavioural change 
and increase recycling. The communications plan will be 
focused strongly on campaigns, education programmes and 
online support communications to enable waste prevention 
and higher levels of recycling in targeted residential areas. 
These activities are all based on auditable, tested and 
proven techniques, including extensive EU-funded activities 
conducted between Viridor and its partner local authorities 
that have further established best practice in this area. The 
programme includes the ongoing and award-winning ‘Right 
Stuff, Right Bin’ campaign. 
In Somerset, Viridor has closely supported The Somerset 
Waste Partnership’s ongoing waste awareness campaigns, 
aimed at raising participation and quality levels in recycling 
schemes. This has included a widely recognised incentive 
scheme to encourage people to bring waste electrical 
and electronic equipment (WEEE) items to Household 
Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs), and has also included 
establishing an award-winning and successful reuse shop 
at Priorswood HWRC. This programme continues to be 
supported and augmented by the Carymoor Environmental 
Education Centre (of which Viridor is the major sponsor), 
which delivers a model of excellence for environmental 
and waste awareness programmes for schools and 
community groups. 
With regard to Viridor’s own waste awareness, prevention 
and recycling programme, recycling systems have been 
established at 21 of its biggest sites. Roll-out to further sites 
will begin later in 2015.
48 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Group Energy efficiency at Pennon Group
The Group has large energy requirements so energy 
efficiency plays a key role in reducing costs. 
In addition to its large-scale energy business, Viridor is 
keen to promote energy efficiency internally and last year 
invested in a low-energy lighting solution. This has slashed 
energy consumption from illumination across 26 sites. As 
well as saving money, boosting light quality and reducing 
maintenance requirements, Viridor’s investment in new LED 
lighting has further advanced its overall commitment to 
improving resource efficiency and will be paid back within 
just two years. Moreover, the company is planning a second 
phase of the project to install further low energy lighting 
across 10 of its sites in Manchester.
Renewable energy generation by South West Water, 
primarily for its own use, continues to grow through a 
combination of wind, hydro, solar and combined heat 
and power. 20% of the power needs for Restormel water 
treatment works (the largest water treatment works in 
Cornwall) were met using renewable energy during 2014/15. 
In-house energy-saving initiatives and the promotion of 
energy efficiency in the workplace also play their part. 
Like Viridor, South West Water is moving to LED lighting, 
with installation at the company’s headquarters due for 
completion in the coming year.

We aim to develop and motivate our employees, treat them 
fairly and ensure that they are fully engaged in all aspects of the 
Pennon Group’s objectives
Pennon’s success is fundamentally down to its employees. 
We seek to recruit talented and committed people and we 
provide training packages to equip them with the skills they 
need to deliver the Group’s objectives.
The strategies of South West Water and Viridor are designed 
to attract, nurture and retain a high calibre workforce. The 
companies have set out a clear commitment to training 
and development, employee engagement, human rights, 
equality and diversity, and ongoing support through a range 
of workplace policies. These include policies covering health 
and safety, equal opportunities, ethics, employee relations 
and family-friendly practices such as flexible working and 
parental leave, and schemes designed to promote the health 
and well-being of employees. The Group’s commitment to 
ensuring the human rights of its employees are not infringed 
extends to those of its suppliers. Supplier codes of conduct 
are in place to ensure that people are treated fairly and with 
respect and dignity. Further information is provided on pages 
19 and 27.
As at 31 March 2015, the gender breakdown of the 
Group’s workforce was as follows:
Employee engagement surveys were carried out across 
the Group during the year, with responses demonstrating 
positive levels of engagement in many areas within the 
Group. Action plans covering areas that scored less well are 
being progressed.
South West Water and Viridor have each played a key role 
in establishing educational facilities and courses designed to 
provide a pipeline of talented prospective employees, and 
both run successful apprenticeship schemes. In total, 29 
new apprenticeships have been created within the Group.
In 2014 South West Water was recognised in the prestigious 
Top 100 Apprenticeship Employers list which is compiled 
annually by the National Apprenticeship Service.

South West Water
The health and safety of employees is paramount and South 
West Water continually reviews its policies and processes in 
order to minimise the number of incidents. During 2014/15 a 
major review of operational sites was undertaken to risk assess 
our activities and identify and prevent any potential hazards. 
The company’s accident frequency rate (measured per 
100,000 man hours) has been successfully reduced over 
the past 12 months. However there were seven reportable 
incidents during the year, which is above the company’s 
target threshold. 
Work continues to reduce the likelihood and severity of any 
incident, and the company remains focused on developing 
a proactive health and safety culture. This includes in-house 
initiatives such as TAP (‘Think, Act, Prevent’) and SEC 
(‘Safety, Environment, Customer’). Furthermore, South 
West Water is enhancing its health and safety management 
systems to ensure the company is operating in line with 
externally accredited standards of best practice at all times. 
South West Water continues to promote its health and safety 
strategy through a steering group comprising a cross section 
of directors, managers and employee representatives who 
are tasked with driving health and safety improvements 
across the business.
Viridor
Viridor has set the goal of making a step change in its health 
and safety performance and in the way it manages health, 
safety and welfare throughout the business. The aim is to 
create and maintain a ‘zero incidents’ culture at all sites 
and facilities. 
Viridor’s ‘Stop & Think’ campaign is at the heart of its 
drive to improve behavioural safety and bring down 
accident rates. 
Clear, high profile signage on site is but one of the elements 
to help drive positive change. The ‘Stop & Think’ concept 
applies to all users of Viridor’s sites, not only employees. 
Health and safety compliant systems, policies and 
procedures are augmented by continual training, toolbox 
talks and briefings, and are overseen by qualified and 
experienced health and safety advisers.
Other practical improvements such as new guards being 
added to Viridor’s London collection vehicles to improve 
cyclist safety, and high profile roles for the company’s 
Representatives of Employee Safety (RESs), are being 
implemented wherever identified.

52 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce my final corporate governance 
report on behalf of the Board, covering Pennon Group’s 
2014/15 financial year.
As explained on pages 10 and 11 strong governance is 
one of the core areas through which we create shareholder 
value and build and maintain a sustainable business. Part 
of the role of the Chairman and the Board is to ensure that 
Pennon Group operates to the highest standards of corporate 
governance. This will continue to be a priority for the Board when 
Sir John Parker takes on the role of Chairman following the 2015 
Annual General Meeting.
The Annual Report continues to be the principal method of 
reporting to our shareholders on the Board’s governance policies 
and the practical application of the principles of good corporate 
governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 
UK Code). The UK Code is published on the Financial Reporting 
Council website, www.frc.org.uk. In accordance with the FRC’s 
requirements, we have reported against the September 2012 
version of the Code.

statements
 www.pennonannualreport.co.uk/2015 53 Role of the Board and its effectiveness
My primary role as Chairman has been to provide leadership 
to the Board and to provide the right environment to 
enable the Directors and the Board as a whole to perform 
effectively to promote the success of the Company for the 
benefit of its shareholders. In doing so we take account 
of the interests of our customers, employees, suppliers, 
the communities in which we operate and other interested 
stakeholders including, in particular, Ofwat, the Drinking 
Water Inspectorate and the regulatory bodies responsible for 
the environment in the UK.
I believe we continue to demonstrate that we have good 
governance in place and that we operate effectively and 
cohesively as a Board. Each year a detailed performance 
evaluation is carried out of the Board and each of the 
Committees as well as of the Directors and the Group 
General Counsel & Company Secretary. The aim is to 
identify further areas for improvement and ensure that 
our knowledge, skills and methods remain relevant as the 
Group’s businesses develop and grow. Further details of 
the review, which was facilitated by an external governance 
consultancy, are set out later in this report.
It remains vital that all Board members continue to have 
appropriate up to date knowledge and understanding of 
both South West Water, as it enters into a new regulatory 
period following Ofwat’s Final Determination in December 
2014, confirming the award of ‘enhanced’ status for the 
2015-2020 business plan; and Viridor, as it implements its 
strategic reorientation around its ‘Energy’ and ‘Recycling & 
Resources’ businesses.
Accordingly I have ensured that the Board has received 
presentations in the past year from senior management on, 
among other matters, the strategy for delivery of South West 
Water’s business plan for the next regulatory period and, in 
respect of Viridor, developments in the recycling sector and 
progress in the construction and operational performance of 
its portfolio of Energy Recovery Facilities.
Governance and subsidiary boards
During the year South West Water and Viridor continued to 
operate under the enhanced governance frameworks that 
were put in place during 2013/14. For South West Water, 
this demonstrates our continued support for Ofwat’s board 
leadership, transparency and governance principles which 
were published in January 2014. Our corporate governance 
framework, including that of our subsidiaries, is set out on 
page 58 of this governance report.
Governance and corporate reporting
Last year we revised our approach to governance and 
corporate reporting in accordance with the requirements 
of the UK Code and the new reporting regulations that had 
come into effect. We have broadly maintained the same 
methodology this year but within those parameters have 
sought to move to a more integrated approach to corporate 
reporting, to present a holistic view of the business and to 
better reflect that sustainability is core to Pennon’s strategy, 
business model and the creation of value. As such, there 
is no separate sustainability report this year but rather the 
structure and content of the strategic report as a whole is 
derived from the strategic priorities through which the Group, 
via its two businesses, creates shareholder value. These are 
set out on page 11. 
Bournemouth Water
Following our acquisition of Bournemouth Water we are

54 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Shareholder engagement
Appropriate and regular communication with our 
shareholders is recognised by the Board as vital to ensuring 
that we are able to explain our actions and that shareholders 
provide feedback on the matters they consider to be 
important and any issues which require addressing.
Regular dialogue with the Company’s institutional 
shareholders is maintained through a comprehensive 
investor relations programme. During the year some 80 
meetings and conference calls were held with institutional 
shareholders and prospective shareholders. All were 
attended by the Group Director of Finance and the 
Company’s Investor Relations Manager. The Chief Executive 
of South West Water, the Chief Executive of Viridor and I 
participated when appropriate.
The Group Director of Finance continues to report to the 
Board regularly on major shareholders’ views about the 
Group, and every six months the Company’s brokers give a 
presentation to the Board on equity market developments 
and shareholder perceptions. This ensures that the Board is 
fully briefed on the views and aspirations of shareholders.
Those shareholders who attend our AGMs will know that 
I also actively encourage their participation and welcome 
questions on any business issues affecting the Group. As 
usual at our 2015 AGM on 30 July all our Directors intend 
to be present together with a number of directors and 
executives of South West Water and Viridor to meet with 
shareholders to further explain the business of the Group.
Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and other requirements
I am once again pleased to report that throughout the year 
the Company complied with the provisions and applied the 
main principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the 2012 edition) with no exceptions to report.
My introduction to this corporate governance report and 
the following sections are made in compliance with the 
UK Code, FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6 and FCA Disclosure and 
Transparency Rules 7.1 and 7.2 and cover the work of our 
Board and its Committees, our internal control systems 
and procedures including risk management, our corporate 
governance statements relating to share capital and control, 
our confirmation of the Company as a going concern and 
Directors’ responsibility statements. Finally, in accordance 
with reporting requirements, on page 95 the Board confirms 
to shareholders that the Annual Report and Accounts taken 
as a whole are fair, balanced and understandable and 
provide the information necessary to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Governance and remuneration
58 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 The Directors, their independence and duties
The Board of Directors at the end of the year comprised the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and four Non-executive 
Directors. All of the Non-executive Directors were considered 
by the Board to be independent throughout the year. None 
of the relationships or circumstances set out in provision 
B.1.1 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (2012 edition) 
(the UK Code) applied to them other than in respect of 
Gerard Connell who, since the 2013 Annual General 
Meeting, has served on the Board for more than nine years 
since his first election. Neil Cooper was appointed by 
the Board as Gerard’s successor on 1 September 2014. 
Following a suitable handover period in respect of the Audit 
Committee chairmanship in particular, Gerard Connell will 
retire from the Board following this year’s Annual General 
Meeting. Throughout the year, Gerard was determined by 
the Board to be independent and the Board is satisfied that 
he does and will continue to demonstrate independence of 
character and judgement in the performance of his role on 
the Board until the date of his retirement.
Sir John Parker, who was appointed to the Board on 
1 April 2015 as Deputy Chairman, will succeed Ken Harvey 
as Chairman following the 2015 Annual General Meeting. 
The Board considers that Sir John, as a Non-executive 
Director, is independent and that he will continue to meet 
the independence criteria set out in the UK Code upon his 
appointment as Chairman.
All of the Non-executive Directors are considered to have the 
appropriate skills, experience in their respective disciplines 
and personality to bring independent and objective judgement 
to the Board’s deliberations. Their biographies on pages 56 
and 57 demonstrate collectively a broad range of business, 
financial and other relevant experience. Gerard Connell is the 
Senior Independent Director and his duties include leading the 
annual evaluation of the performance of the Chairman by the 
Non-executive Directors and being available as an additional 
point of contact on the Board for shareholders. Gerard will 
be succeeded by Gill Rider as Senior Independent Director 
following his retirement.
Neil Cooper is chairman of the Audit Committee and in 
accordance with the UK Code and FCA Disclosure and 
Transparency Rule 7.1.1 he has recent and relevant financial 
experience (as set out in his biography on page 57). Martin 
Angle is also a member of the Audit Committee and he has 
relevant financial experience as set out in his biography on 
page 57.
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the 
roles of Chairman and the Chief Executives of South West 
Water and Viridor as recorded in the descriptions of the 
roles approved by the Board. All Directors are subject to 
re-election each year in accordance with provision B.7.1 of 
the UK Code. 
Following the acquisition of Bournemouth Water, 
Chris Loughlin and Gerard Connell were appointed as 
non-executive directors on the Bournemouth Water board.
Operation of the Board in the year and its activities

All Directors are equally accountable for the proper 
stewardship of the Group’s affairs with the Non-executive 
Directors having a particular responsibility for ensuring that 
strategies proposed for the development of the business 
are critically reviewed. The Non-executive Directors also 
critically examine the operational and financial performance 
of the Group and fulfil a key role in corporate accountability 
through their membership of the Committees of the 
Board. In addition the Chairman holds meetings with the 
Non-executive Directors, without the Executive Directors 
present, to discuss performance and strategic issues.

Strategic 
overview
South West 
Water
Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements
 www.pennonannualreport.co.uk/2015 59 In accordance with the governance framework set out on 
page 58, the Board has a schedule of matters reserved for its 
decision, some of which may be escalated by the subsidiary 
boards of South West Water and Viridor for approval. The 
Board delegates more detailed consideration of certain 
matters to Board Committees, to the Executive Directors 
or to the Group General Counsel & Company Secretary, as 
appropriate. The matters reserved to the Board include:
• approval of the preliminary and half year 
results announcements;
• the approval of the Annual Report & Accounts (including 
the financial statements);
• all acquisitions and disposals;
• major items of capital expenditure;
• authority levels for other expenditure;
• risk management process and monitoring of risks;
• approval of the strategic plan and annual 
operating budgets; 
• Group policies, procedures and delegations; and
• appointments to the Board and its Committees and to the 
subsidiary boards and their committees.
The Pennon Group Board and the boards of South West 
Water and Viridor liaise on strategic and operational matters. 
In addition the subsidiary board committees liaise with the 
Pennon Committees as appropriate to ensure a consistent 
Group-wide approach to governance matters.
The Board operates by receiving written reports circulated 
usually in advance of the meetings from the Executive 
Directors and the Group General Counsel & Company 
Secretary on matters within their respective business areas 
of the Group. When considered appropriate, the Board also 
receives presentations on key areas of the business and 
undertakes site visits to gain a better understanding of the 
operation of business initiatives.
Under the guidance of the Chairman all matters before 
the Board are discussed openly and presentations and 
advice are received frequently from other senior executives 
within the Group and from external advisers to facilitate the 
decision making of the Board.
Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Group General Counsel & Company Secretary and the 
Board has an established procedure whereby directors, in 
order to fulfil their duties, may seek independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense.
Newly appointed Directors receive a formal induction which 
includes an explanation of the Group structure, regulatory 
and legal issues, the Group governance framework and 
policies, the Group’s approach to risk management and 
its principal risks (financial and non-financial), duties and 
obligations (including protocols around conflicts of interest 
and dealing in shares), and the current activities of the 
Board and its Committees. The training needs of Directors 
are reviewed as part of the Board’s performance evaluation 
process each year. Training consists of attendance at 
external courses organised by professional advisers and also 
internal presentations from senior management.
Performance evaluation
The Board has well developed internal procedures to 
evaluate the performance of the whole Board, each 
Committee, the Chairman, each individual Director and 
the Group General Counsel & Company Secretary. 
The evaluation of the performance of the Board and its 
Committees was administered by an external governance 
consultancy, Lintstock. All participants’ views were sought 
via an online questionnaire on a range of questions which 
were designed by the Chairman and the Group General 
Counsel & Company Secretary in conjunction with Lintstock 
to ensure objective evaluation of performance. Responses 
were then analysed and summarised by Lintstock for the 
Board and each Committee to consider and determine 
possible improvement areas. Apart from providing services 
relating to subsidiary boards’ and committees’ and pension 
scheme boards’ and committees’ performance evaluation, 
Lintstock has no other connection with the Company.
The Board considered the evaluation which it believed was 
a thorough assessment of Board performance. Overall it 
was not considered that there were any major matters which 
required attention but it was recognised that at a time of 
transition for the Board it was important to focus further on 
strategy in conjunction with the new Chairman.
The areas for action that had been identified as a result of 
the 2014 performance evaluation (namely the allocation 
of more time for consideration of strategic matters, the 
appointment of an additional Non-executive Director, a 
review of induction arrangements for new Directors, and 
developing closer links with subsidiary boards) had been 
followed up appropriately during the year.
The Chairman’s performance was evaluated 
separately by the Non-executive Directors, led by 
the Senior Independent Director. 
Dealing with Directors’ conflicts of interest
In accordance with the directors’ interest provision of 
the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, the Board has in place a procedure for the 
consideration and authorisation of Directors’ conflicts or 
possible conflicts with the Company’s interests.
Board Committees’ terms of reference
In accordance with Group policies, a range of key matters 
are delegated to the Board’s Committees as set out on 
pages 62 to 71 of this governance report.
The terms of reference of each of the Board’s 
Committees are set out on the Company’s website 
www.pennon-group.co.uk or available upon request to 
the Group Company Secretary.

Governance and remuneration
60 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Internal control
Wider aspects of internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining the Group’s system 
of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment 
and the Group’s assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. There is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group that has been in place throughout 
2014/15 and up to the date of the approval of this Annual 
Report and Accounts.
The Board confirms that it continues to apply procedures 
in accordance with the UK Code and the ‘Guidance on 
Internal Control’ (the Turnbull Guidance) which suggests 
means of applying the internal control provisions of the 
Code. As part of these procedures the Board has a Group 
risk management policy which provides for the identification 
of key risks including environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) risks in relation to the achievement of the business 
objectives of the Group, monitoring of such risks and annual 
evaluation of the overall process, as described in more detail 
below. The policy is applied by all business units within the 
Group in accordance with an annual timetable.
The Group’s system of internal control is being further 
reviewed to take account of the FRC’s new ‘Guidance on 
Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial 
and Business Reporting’ (September 2014), which will be 
reported against in next year’s Annual Report.
Risk identification and management
A full risk and control assessment is undertaken annually 
by the management of each business to identify financial 
and non-financial risks, including ESG risks, which are then 
regularly updated. Each business compiles (as part of regular 
management reports) an enhanced and focused assessment 
of key risks against corporate objectives. At each meeting the 
Board receives from the Executive Directors details of any new 
high-level risks identified and how they are to be managed, 
together with details of any changes to existing risks and their 
management. The subsidiary boards of South West Water 
and Viridor also receive similar reports in respect of their 
own areas of responsibility. In addition the Group Director of 
Finance is responsible for monitoring the Group risk register 
and for reporting on key risks and how they are managed at 
regular intervals to the Audit Committee and to the Board.
Under the Group risk management policy, all Executive 
Directors and senior managers are required to certify on 
an annual basis that they have effective controls in place to 
manage risks and to operate in compliance with legislation 
and Group procedures.
The Group also has policies covering suspected fraud, 
anti-bribery and whistleblowing, and we thoroughly 
investigate any allegations of misconduct and irregularity and 
consider the implications for our control environment. In the 
normal course of business, investigations into irregularities 
may be ongoing as of the date of the approval of the 
financial statements.
All of these processes serve to ensure that a culture of 
effective control and risk management is embedded within 
the organisation and that the Group is in a position to react 
appropriately to new risks as they arise. Details of key risks 
affecting the Group are set out in the strategic report on 
pages 34 to 39.
Internal control framework
The Group has a well established internal control framework 
which is operated and which applies in relation to the 
process for preparing the Group’s consolidated accounts.
This framework comprises:
• a clearly defined structure which delegates an appropriate 
level of authority, responsibility and accountability, 
including responsibility for internal financial control, to 
management of operating units
• a comprehensive budgeting and reporting function with 
an annual budget approved by the Board, which also 
monitors the financial reporting process, monthly results 
and updated forecasts for the year against budget
• documented financial control procedures. Managers 
of operating units are required to confirm annually that 
they have adequate financial controls in operation and to 
report all material areas of financial risk. Compliance with 
procedures is reviewed and tested by the Company’s 
internal audit function
• an investment appraisal process for evaluating proposals 
for all major capital expenditure and acquisitions, with 
defined levels of approval and a system for monitoring the 
progress of capital projects
• a post-investment evaluation process for major capital 
expenditure and acquisitions to assess the success 
of the project and learn any lessons to be applied to 
future projects.
Internal control review
An evaluation of the effectiveness of overall internal controls 
and compliance by the Group is undertaken in respect of 
each financial year (and subsequently up to the date of 
this report) to assist the Audit Committee in considering 
the Group internal audit plan for the forthcoming financial 
year and also the strategic report for the Annual Report. 
The Group General Counsel & Company Secretary initially 
carries out the evaluation with Executive Directors and senior 
management for consideration by the Audit Committee and 
subsequently for final evaluation by the Board.
In addition, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the 
operation and effectiveness of the internal control framework 
and annually reviews the scope of work, authority and 
resources of the Company’s internal audit function. The 
Committee reports and makes recommendations to the 
Board on such reviews. For 2014/15 and up to the date of 
approval of this Annual Report and Accounts, both the Audit 
Committee and the Board were satisfied with the effectiveness 
of the Group risk management policy and the internal control 
framework and their operation within the Group.
Further information on the internal control review is set out in 
the Audit Committee report on page 62.

 www.pennonannualreport.co.uk/2015 61 Dear Shareholder
As the new chairman of the Audit Committee since 
September 2014 I am pleased to introduce the report on the 
Committee’s activities during the year. I see the Committee 
as an essential part of the Board’s toolkit in ensuring good 
governance: overseeing the effectiveness and integrity of 
Group financial reporting, internal control processes and risk 
management activities. 
The work of the Audit Committee has, therefore, continued 
to be focused on the appropriateness of the Group’s 
financial reporting, including accounting judgements, the 
review of key risks across the Group and the challenging and 
testing of the Group’s internal control processes including 
risk management and internal audit. The Committee has 
also reviewed a number of activities associated with its key 
responsibilities to ensure the risk environment and levels of 
risk across the Group were appropriately managed. These 
included the Company’s foreign exchange policy, recyclate 
trading controls, financial instruments risk appetite, treasury 
risk and our subsidiaries’ information security frameworks.
Due to a change in our external auditor, during the year we 
oversaw the arrangements made for the introduction of the 
new auditor to the systems and processes operated within 
the Group and the handover of knowledge and experience 
of the retiring auditors.
As part of the year-end reporting review process we reviewed 
and challenged the key judgements of management in 
relation to a range of matters, including the Viridor impairment 
review, bad and doubtful debt provisioning, tax provisioning 
and revenue recognition. Significant matters considered by 
the Committee both during the year and in relation to the 
year-end financial statements are explained in this report.
Finally I would like to thank my predecessor, Gerard Connell, 
for his assistance through the handover of the chairmanship 
of the Committee.

The Audit Committee Continued
In respect of the monitoring of the integrity of the financial 
statements, which is a key responsibility of the Committee 
identified in the UK Code, the significant issues considered 
in relation to the financial statements for the year ended 
31 March 2015 are set out in the following table, together 
with details of how each matter was addressed by the 
Committee. At the Committee’s meetings throughout the 
year the Committee and the external auditor have discussed 
the significant issues arising in respect of financial reporting 
during the year and the areas of particular audit focus, as 
reported on in the independent auditor’s report on pages 
96 to 99. In addition to the significant issues set out in the 
table below, the Committee considered a range of other 
matters including presentational issues, in particular relating 
to the quality of earnings, exceptional item classification and 
contingent liability disclosure.
Significant issues the 
Committee considered in 
relation to the financial 
statements
How the issue was addressed by the Committee
Going concern basis for the 
preparation of the financial 
statements
The Board receives a monthly report from the Group Director of Finance on the financial performance 
of the Group including forward looking assessments of covenant compliance and funding levels under 
differing scenarios. The Board also regularly reviews and challenges rolling five year strategy projections 
and the resultant headroom relative to borrowings. A report to the Audit Committee, prepared by the 
Group Director of Finance, at each half year and year-end, focuses on the Group’s liquidity over the 15 
months subsequent to a period end and the Group’s solvency over a longer period. This report provides 
the basis for a detailed review and discussion of the key issues at Committee meetings. These discussions 
together with the ongoing monitoring of the Group’s business model and financial performance, provide the 
evidence on which the Committee forms its assessment and satisfies itself that it remains appropriate for 
the Group to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 2014/15 
financial statements.
Viridor: asset impairment 
and provisions
There has been considerable focus at the year-end on Viridor’s environmental provisions and the carrying 
value of its assets, including goodwill. Underlying assumptions, both in respect of markets and individual 
operating sites, have been discussed and reviewed with executive management, including consideration 
of external market research where appropriate, at both subsidiary and Group Board levels, before being 
considered and challenged again at Committee meetings. As part of the year-end reporting to the 
Committee, the Group Director of Finance presented a report summarising the key issues in relation to the 
impairment review and Committee members asked questions of the Viridor Chief Executive, the Viridor 
Finance Director and the Group Director of Finance and discussed the detailed sensitivity analysis in 
respect of key assumptions carried out by management, which had also been reviewed as part of the year-
end audit by the external auditor.
South West Water and 
Viridor bad and doubtful 
debt provisions
Both the South West Water board and the Viridor board, as well as the Group Board, receive regular 
updates on progress against debt collection targets. Performance is monitored regularly against South 
West Water’s historical collection record and the track record of other companies in the sector. At the year-
end the external auditor reported on the work it had performed, and the Committee considered the results 
of this report and asked questions of both the South West Water and the Viridor Chief Executives before 
forming a view on management’s assessment of the year-end position.
Tax and treasury The Group takes a prudent view of its tax position and has a general policy of releasing tax provisions only 
when matters under discussion are expected to be cleared by HM Revenue & Customs. If any outstanding 
issues are considered to be potentially material, such matters are also discussed, and challenged where 
necessary, at Group Board level. Expert external legal advice is sought as and when appropriate. The 
external auditors reported on the work they had performed in respect of tax provisions in the Group’s 
balance sheet. Questions raised by this review were addressed at the year-end audit clearance meeting 
of the Committee and the Group Director of Finance separately reported on the proposed treatment 
of certain items. The Committee also considered at the year-end the tax and accounting treatment of 
certain structured treasury transactions and the Group Director of Finance reported on the treatment of 
these transactions. During the year the Committee gave further consideration to the Group’s policies and 
activities in relation to tax and treasury and approved minor updating to these policies.
Revenue recognition The key areas reviewed by the Committee at year-end in respect of revenue recognition related to the 
accrual for metered billing within South West Water, service concession arrangements under IFRIC 12 and 
accrued powergen income at Viridor. The Committee relied primarily on South West Water’s track record of 
assessing an appropriate level of accrual at previous year-ends given actual outturns and Viridor’s internal 
processes for analysing complex long-term contracts. The Committee also considered the work in respect 
of these areas at the year-end by the external auditor who was satisfied with the approach taken by 
the companies.

Governance and remuneration
64 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Effectiveness of the external audit process
We continue to monitor carefully the effectiveness of our 
external auditor as well as its independence, bearing in mind 
that it is recognised there is a need to use our external auditor’ s 
firm for certain non-audit services. We have full regard to the 
Auditing Practices Board’ s Ethical Standards and ensure that 
our procedures and safeguards meet these standards.
A new external auditor was appointed in the year following 
a comprehensive audit tender process, which was reported 
on last year, and approval by shareholders at the Company’ s 
2014 AGM.
The new external auditor initially prepared and followed a 
transition plan to ensure a good understanding of the Group 
prior to review of the half year financial statements of the Group. 
This was followed up with a detailed audit planning report in 
preparation for the year-end financial statements. These actions 
have assisted the auditor in delivering the timely audit of the 
Group’ s annual report and financial statements.
The effectiveness review of the external auditor is undertaken 
as part of the Committee’ s annual performance evaluation. 
The review demonstrated that there was considerable 
satisfaction with the performance of the external auditor in its 
first year in the role. Accordingly the Committee considered that 
it is appropriate that the external auditor be re-appointed and 
and has made an appropriate recommendation to the Board.
The Committee Chairman has also met privately with the 
external auditor.
Auditor independence
The Committee carefully reviews on an ongoing basis the 
relationship with the external auditor to ensure that the auditor’ s 
independence and objectivity is fully safeguarded. 
Both the previous and the new external auditor reported on 
their independence during the year and confirmed to the 
Committee that they have complied with the Auditing Practices 
Board’ s Ethical Standards and, based on their assessments, 
that they were independent of the Group.
Provision of non-audit services
The Committee has a restrictive policy for the engagement of 
the external auditor’ s firm for non-audit work. The policy is for 
non-audit fees not to exceed 70% of the audit fee for statutory 
work. Where fees for non-audit work exceed 50% of the 
annual audit fees (but are less than 70%), the Committee must 
be notified of the assignment with a summary report on the 
background and the reasons for using the auditor for the work. 
In exceptional circumstances, where there is good rationale for 
the auditor’ s non-audit fees to exceed 70%, the Group Director 
of Finance is required to set out in a report to the Committee 
the reasons why the auditor’ s firm should be appointed for any 
work. The Committee would carefully review whether it was 
necessary for the auditor’ s firm to carry out such work and 
would only grant approval for the firm’ s appointment if it was 
satisfied that the auditor’ s independence and objectivity would 
be fully safeguarded. If there was another accounting firm that 
could provide the required level of experience and expertise in 
respect of non-audit services, then such firm would be chosen 
in preference to the external auditor.
The level of non-audit fees payable to the external auditor 
for the past year is 10% of the audit fee, which is well within 
the Group’ s 70% non-audit fee limit. This represents a very 
significant reduction in the level of fees for non-audit services 
paid to the Company’ s previous external auditors.
The Group Director of Finance regularly reports to the 
Committee on the extent of services provided to the Company 
by the external auditors and the level of fees paid. The fees paid 
to the external auditor’ s firm for non-audit services and for audit 
services are set out in note 7 to the financial statements on 
page 118.

Internal audit
The internal audit activities of the Group continue to remain a 
key part of the internal control and risk management functions 
of the Group. At Group level there is a long-standing and 
effective centralised internal audit service led by an experienced 
head of function who makes a significant contribution to the 
ability of the Committee to deliver its responsibilities.
A Group internal audit plan is approved in September each 
year. It takes account of the activities to be undertaken by the 
external auditor and also the Group’ s annual and ongoing risk 
management reviews. This approach seeks to ensure that there 
is a programme of internal and external audit reviews focused 
on identified key risk areas throughout the Group.
The Group Audit Manager reports quarterly to the Committee 
on audit reviews undertaken and their findings and there are 
regular discussions, correspondence and meetings between 
the Group Audit Manager and the Committee Chairman.
The areas of the business that received attention from Group 
internal audit over the past year included:
• Pennon – Group information security framework, Group 
treasury log audits; 
• South West Water – credit management and debt collection, 
transport control environment, capital expenditure planning 
and delivery, energy management; and
• Viridor – contract management, purchasing and high risk 
transactions processes, TPSCo (joint venture) processes, 
major contract review.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
T o enable the Committee to provide support to the 
Board in making its statement that it considered that the 
Company’ s Annual Report and Accounts is fair, balanced and 
understandable (FBU) on page 95, the Committee has applied 
a detailed FBU framework that was prepared by the Group 
Company Secretary following consultation with the Committee 
Chairman and the Group Director of Finance and implemented 
initially for 2013/14. This framework has been refined and 
updated for the last year taking on board developments in 
reporting best practice. The FBU process takes account of 
the Group’ s well-documented verification process undertaken 
in conjunction with the preparation of the Annual Report and 
Accounts. This is in addition to the formal process carried 
out by the external auditor to enable the preparation of the 
independent auditor’ s report, which is set out on pages 96 
to 99.
In preparing and finalising the 2015 Annual Report and 
Accounts the Committee considered a report on the actions 
taken by management in accordance with the FBU process 
and an FBU assessment undertaken by the subsidiary boards. 
This assisted the Committee in carrying out its own assessment 
and being able to advise the Board that it considered that the 
Annual Report and Accounts taken as a whole is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’ s performance, business 
model and strategy.

66 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 The Sustainability Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce the Sustainability Committee’s 
report on its annual activities. Sustainability is an integral part 
of Pennon’s strategy and the Group takes this responsibility 
very seriously in all its business and operational practices. 
Our investment and our commitment to high levels of service 
and performance will contribute to society’s needs – for 
water, energy and resource management – being met in the 
long term. 
The role of the Sustainability Committee is to bring together 
and review initiatives that drive sustainability, to approve 
targets and to monitor the progress made in achieving 
Pennon’s strategic sustainability objectives. Those objectives 
are set out on the following page. During the year the 
Committee reviewed its programme of work against the best 
practice framework published by Business in the Community 
(BitC), a leading business-led charity that promotes 
responsible business. We concluded that BitC’s key areas 
of sustainability (marketplace, workplace, community and 
environment) provided a useful structure for reviewing our 
programmes and the performance of both South West 
Water and Viridor as they work to achieve the highest 
standards of corporate responsibility.
On pages 10 and 11, we show how a sound approach to 
sustainability helps us to draw together the needs of society 
with the results of commercial success. To further underline 
these links, this year we have integrated our sustainability 
report with our strategic report and have provided 
additional detail within the South West Water and Viridor 
strategic reviews.
We are pleased to note the results in both businesses, which 
confirm sustainability is indeed integrated in all we do.

The Sustainability Committee works with the South West 
Water sustainability committee and the Viridor board, 
which direct sustainability activities for their respective 
organisations, to ensure that the Group’s sustainability 
objectives are met. The subsidiaries develop a range of 
targets as part of their business planning processes and 
monitor and report progress to their respective boards and 
committees throughout the year. 
As at 31 March 2015 South West Water had achieved 12 of 
its 14 targets for the year and Viridor had completed eight 
out of 12 of its targets. Further details will be provided in 
South West Water’s annual report and Viridor’s sustainability 
report, to be published in July 2015 and August 
2015 respectively.
The Sustainability Committee operates in the context of 
the requirement for companies to conduct their business 
in a responsible manner (in relation to environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) matters) while at the same time 
delivering strong financial performance and lasting value 
for shareholders and other stakeholders. The Sustainability 
Committee reviews and approves as appropriate the 
strategies, policies, management, initiatives, targets and 
performance of the Pennon Group companies in the areas 
of occupational health and safety and security, environment, 
workplace policies, responsible and ethical business 
practice, customer service and engagement, and the role of 
the Group in society.

Reporting and verification
In reporting on sustainability, the Company has sought to 
comply with the Guidelines on Responsible Investment 
Disclosure issued by the Association of British Insurers and 
now maintained by The Investment Association. 
Pennon’s sustainability performance and reporting has 
been audited by Strategic Management Consultants 
Limited (SMC), an independent management consultancy 
specialising in technical assurance in the utility sector. 
Pennon considers that SMC’s method of verification – 
which includes testing the assumptions, methods and 
procedures that are followed in the development of data 
and auditing that data to ensure accuracy and consistency 
– complements the best practice insight gained through 
South West Water’s and Viridor’s membership of Business in 
the Community.

The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee meets in accordance with an 
annual calendar to consider succession planning, equality 
and diversity reports and periodically as necessary to 
manage the Board appointment process and recommend to 
the Board suitable candidates for appointment as executive 
and non-executive directors to the Board and also to the 
boards of South West Water and Viridor.
It is the practice of the Committee, led by the Chairman, to 
appoint an external search consultancy to assist in Board 
appointments to ensure that an extensive and robust search 
can be made for suitable candidates.
During the year the Committee considered:
• its annual performance evaluation;
• the appointment of a new Non-executive Director;
• the appointment of a new Group Director of Finance;
• the appointment of a new Group Chairman (under the 
leadership of the Senior Independent Director and without 
the current Chairman being present); and
• reviewed diversity and equality policies and practice 
throughout the Group.
The appointment of the Non-executive Director was 
undertaken with the assistance of an external search 
consultant (Zygos), which had no other connection with 
the Company. 
An external search consultant was not engaged to assist 
with the recruitment of the Group Director of Finance, due 
to an exceptionally able internal candidate being available, 
or the recruitment of the new Group Chairman due to the 
Senior Independent Director being made aware of the 
availability of an outstanding candidate with appropriate 
waste management and utility experience.

Diversity policy
The Board’s diversity policy confirms that the Board is 
committed to:
• the search for Board candidates being conducted, and 
appointments made, on merit, against objective criteria 
and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board, including gender;
• satisfying itself that plans are in place for orderly 
succession of appointments to the Board and to senior 
management to maintain an appropriate balance of skills 
and experience within the Group and on the Board and 
to ensure progressive refreshing of the Board. In addition, 
within the spirit of Principle B.2 of the UK Code, the 
Board has endeavoured to achieve:
 a minimum of 25% female representation on the Board 
by 2015; and
 a minimum of 25% female representation on the 
Group’s senior management team by 2015.
As at 31 March 2015 and as disclosed with the Directors’ 
biographies on page 56, the Group had 25% female 
representation at Board level. While circumstances on 
occasion will result in changes in Board composition, the 
Board remains committed to maintaining and possibly 
exceeding the 25% level.
As well as its diversity policy, the Group has a number of 
policies in place embracing workplace matters, including 
non-discrimination and equal opportunities policies 
which are reported on separately on page 50, together 
with information regarding the gender breakdown of 
the workforce.
The Committee is required by the Board to review and 
monitor compliance with the Board’s diversity policy and 
report on the targets, achievement against those targets and 
overall compliance in the Annual Report each year.

72 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Dear Shareholder
Introduction
As Chairman of the Group’s Remuneration Committee and 
on behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2015. In 
accordance with the remuneration reporting requirements the 
report is in two parts:
• Directors’ remuneration policy – a summary of the 
policy on Directors’ remuneration which was approved 
by shareholders at the 2014 AGM. This is provided for 
information only as approval is not required and approval is 
not being sought for a revised policy at the 2015 AGM.
• Annual report on remuneration – contains the 
remuneration of the Directors for the year 2014/15 including 
the ‘single remuneration figure’ table providing a value for 
each element of remuneration for each Director, together 
with the details of the link between Company performance 
and remuneration during the year (pages 80 to 83). It 
also provides details of how our policy will be applied for 
2015/16. This section of the report together with this letter is 
subject to an advisory shareholder vote at this year’ s AGM.
Last year the Remuneration Committee was pleased to note 
that 97% and 96% of shareholders who voted approved the 
remuneration policy and the 2013/14 annual remuneration 
report respectively. The Committee appreciates the continuing 
support of its shareholders.
The membership and the role of the Remuneration 
Committee including how it has operated during the year 
is set out separately in this Governance and remuneration 
section on page 71.
Remuneration decisions
For 2015/16 salaries were increased by 3.36% for the 
Chief Executive, South West Water, reflecting market rates 
and performance in the year, and by 12.68% for the Chief 
Executive, Viridor, due to continuing on the glide path from 
a lower salary on appointment and having gained further 
experience together with performance in the role over the last 
year. This is in line with our approved policy on salaries on 
recruitment where salaries may be set at an initially lower level 
with the intention of providing potential for higher than usual 
increases over the following two years to reflect experience 
gained and performance in the role. Given that this two year 
period will have passed at the next salary review, we do not 
anticipate any further increases of this nature for Ian McAulay. 
The salary of the Group Director of Finance was not increased 
due to Susan Davy being appointed to the position towards the 
end of the 2014/15 year.
The bonus outturns for the Executive Directors for 2014/15 
reflect the achievements of the Group businesses in the 
year, the Company’s performance against corporate financial 
targets and the Executive Directors’ performance against 
individual targets. Half of the bonus is deferred into shares. 
Further details of targets, measures and performance are set 
out on pages 81 and 82.
As regards the Company’ s long-term incentive plan, the overall 
estimated outturn for awards vesting at the end of the three 
year period ending 31 March 2015 is 0% of the maximum 
100%. This reflects that the Company’ s total shareholder return 
is estimated to be below the comparator index performance 
and is expected to rank below the median of the FTSE 250.
Board changes
Neil Cooper was appointed as a Non-executive Director 
from 1 September 2014 and as the chairman of the Audit 
Committee. His fee was determined on the same basis as for 
the other Non-executive Directors.
David Dupont, Group Director of Finance, retired from the 
Board on 31 January 2015 following 23 years of service with 
the Company and 12 years as the Group Director of Finance. 
As a good leaver, the Committee awarded him a part-year 
bonus based on the predetermined performance measures 
and targets, but pro-rated for his period of employment in the 
year. His 2012, 2013 and 2014 deferred share awards are due 
to be released to him in accordance with the provisions of the 
deferred share element of the bonus plan. His 2015 award 
(in respect of his bonus for 2014/15) will be held for three years. 
Awards made in 2012 and 2013 under the long-term incentive 
plan were pro-rated for time and will be subject to performance 
measured at the vesting date. The award made in 2014 was 
forfeited due to Mr Dupont retiring before the year end.
On 1 February 2015 Susan Davy became Group Director of 
Finance and joined the Board. Her remuneration package is 
in line with those of the other Executive Directors, except that 
her salary has been set at an initially lower level with a view to 
providing for scope for increases depending on performance 
over the next two years. As Mrs Davy’ s appointment was a 
promotion within the Group (from being finance and regulatory 
director of South West Water) her pre-existing awards and 
contractual commitments will continue in accordance with their 
established terms. This is in accordance with the approved 
remuneration policy. No cash sign-on payments were made.
Finally in the year Sir John Parker was appointed as a 
Non-executive Director and as Deputy Chairman of the Board 
with effect from 1 April 2015. He was also appointed as the 
successor to Ken Harvey as Chairman following his retirement 
after the 2015 AGM. His fee was determined to be 50% of 
the Chairman’ s fee and will be increased to the same level as 
the current Chairman’ s fee when he becomes Chairman on 
1 August 2015.
Looking forward
During the year we considered the remuneration structure 
with the assistance of our independent remuneration 
consultants. In accordance with the new provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and good remuneration 
practice we decided to introduce explicit malus and clawback 
provisions under our Performance and Co-investment Plan 
for awards from 2015. We introduced similar provisions in our 
Annual Incentive Plan last year. 
For awards from 2015, we have also introduced a further 
two year holding period in respect of any shares which vest 
at the end of the three year performance period under the 
Performance and Co-investment Plan. This further aligns 
the interests of management with the longer-term success 
of the Company. No other changes have been made to our 
remuneration package. In particular all maximum opportunities 
will remain the same in 2015/16.
In conclusion I hope you find our report this year informative 
and that we can rely on your vote in favour of the annual 
report on remuneration.

Directors’ remuneration policy
Introduction
The remuneration policy set out in the 2014 Annual Report 
was approved by shareholders at the Company’s AGM on 
31 July 2014.
We are not seeking approval for our remuneration policy 
at the 2015 AGM. The intention is that approval of the 
remuneration policy will be sought at three year intervals in 
accordance with the remuneration reporting requirements, 
unless the Company wishes to make amendments to the 
policy prior to then.
The remuneration policy tables for Executive and 
Non-executive Directors are set out below for shareholder 
information. They have been reproduced as approved 
with the exception of updating to reflect Director 
changes; additional wording on malus, clawback and 
the holding period introduced in the year in the Group’s 
Performance and Co-investment Plan; and minor and 
inconsequential changes. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy is displayed on the 
Company’s website www.pennon-group.co.uk/about-us/
directors-remuneration-policy and is available upon 
request from the Group Company Secretary.

Description of framework 
used to assess performance
Base salary
Set at a competitive level to 
attract appropriate candidates 
to meet Company’s strategic 
objectives and to aid retention.
Salaries are generally reviewed 
annually and any changes 
are normally effective from 
1 April each year. In normal 
circumstances salary increases 
will not be materially different to 
general employee pay increases 
but there may be exceptions 
such as where there has 
been the recruitment of a new 
executive director at an initially 
lower salary.
When reviewing salaries the 
Committee has regard to the 
following factors:
• salary increases generally for 
all employees in the Company 
and the Group
• market rates 
• performance of the individual 
and the Company; and
• other factors it 
considers relevant.
There is no overall maximum.
None, although individual and 
Company performance are one 
of the factors considered when 
reviewing salaries.
Benefits
Benefits are provided that are 
consistent with the market and 
level of seniority and which aid 
retention of key skills to assist in 
meeting strategic objectives.
Benefits currently include the 
provision of a company vehicle, 
fuel, health insurance and life 
assurance. Other benefits may 
be provided if the Committee 
considers it appropriate.
In the event that an Executive 
Director is required to relocate, 
relocation benefits may 
be provided.
The cost of insurance 
benefits may vary from year 
to year depending on the 
individual’s circumstances.
There is no overall maximum 
benefit value but the 
Committee aims to ensure 
that the total value of benefits 
remains proportionate.
None.

Annual bonus
Linked to achievement of key 
performance objectives aligned 
to the strategy of the Company.
Annual bonuses are paid 
following finalisation of the 
financial results for the year 
to which they relate and paid 
usually three months after the 
end of the financial year.
A portion of any bonus is 
deferred into shares in the 
Company, which are normally 
released after three years. 
Normally 50% is deferred. 
Any dividends on the shares 
during this period are paid to 
the Directors.
The deferred bonus plan is 
operated in conjunction with the 
Company’s HMRC approved 
executive share option scheme 
(ESOS) on the basis that 
the pre-tax value of awards 
under both are the same as if 
the deferred bonus plan had 
operated alone.
For bonuses awarded in respect 
of the 2014/15 financial year 
and going forward malus and 
clawback provisions apply. 
These provisions permit net 
cash bonuses and/or deferred 
bonus shares to be forfeited, 
repaid or made subject to 
further conditions where 
the Committee considers 
it appropriate in the event 
of any significant adverse 
circumstances, including (but 
not limited to) a material failure 
of risk management, serious 
reputational damage, a financial 
misstatement or misconduct. 
Clawback may be applied 
for the period of three years 
following determination of the 
cash bonus.
The maximum bonus potential 
for each Director is 100% of 
base salary.
Performance targets relate 
to corporate and personal 
objectives, which are reviewed 
each year. Normally at least 
70% relates to financial targets 
or quantitative measures.
The measures, weighting and 
threshold levels may be adjusted 
for future performance years.
Following the financial year-end 
the Committee, with advice 
from the Chairman of the Board 
and following consideration 
of the outturn against target 
by the chairman of the Audit 
Committee, assesses to what 
extent the targets are met 
and determines bonus levels 
accordingly. In doing so the 
Committee takes into account 
overall Company performance 
and may adjust the bonus 
upwards or downwards for 
any specific factors such as 
exceptional outperformance 
or underperformance.

Long-term incentive plan (Performance and Co-investment Plan)
Provide alignment

and to longer-term 
Company performance.
Annual grant of conditional shares 
(or equivalent). Share awards vest 
dependent upon the achievement 
of specific performance conditions 
measured over a performance period of 
no less than three years.
A grant is only made if the Director 
has acquired or is due to acquire 
co-investment shares equivalent to 
one-fifth of the value of the award.
Dividend equivalents (including 
dividend reinvestment) may be paid on 
vested awards.
An ‘underpin’ applies which allows 
the Committee to reduce or withhold 
vesting if the Committee is not satisfied 
with the underlying operational and 
economic performance of the Company.
Introduced for 2015/16
For grants made from 2015 onwards 
malus and clawback provisions will 
apply which permit shares to be 
forfeited, repaid or made subject to 
further conditions where the Committee 
considers it appropriate in certain 
circumstances. The circumstances in 
which malus may be applied include (but 
are not limited to) material misstatement, 
serious reputational damage, or 
the participant’s misconduct. The 
circumstances in which clawback may 
be applied are material misstatement or 
serious misconduct. 
In addition a further two year holding 
period will apply in respect of any shares 
which vest at the end of the three year 
performance period.
Malus may be applied during the three 
year performance period and clawback 
may be applied up until the end of the 
holding period.
The maximum annual award is 
100% of base salary.
The current performance 
conditions are based on total 
shareholder return (TSR) with 
50% based on TSR against 
the peer group index (chosen 
because these companies are 
regarded as the Company’s 
key listed comparators) and 
50% based on TSR against 
constituents of the FTSE 250 
index (excluding investment 
trusts) (chosen because 
this is the FTSE index to 
which the Company belongs 
currently). No more than 
30% of maximum vests for 
minimum performance.
The ‘underpin’ evaluation 
includes consideration of 
environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors and 
safety performance as well as 
financial performance.
The Committee will keep the 
performance measures under 
review and may change the 
performance condition for future 
awards if this were considered to 
be aligned with the Company’s 
interests and strategic 
objectives. However, the 
Committee would consult with 
major shareholders in advance 
of any proposed material change 
in performance measures.
Pension
Provides funding for 
retirement and aids 
retention of key skills 
to assist in meeting 
the Company’s 
strategic objectives.
Defined benefit pension arrangements 
are closed to new entrants. Defined 
contribution pension arrangements have 
been available to new staff since 2008. 
A cash allowance may be provided as 
an alternative and/or in addition where 
pension limits have been reached.
The maximum annual pension 
contribution or cash allowance 
is 20% of salary. For Executive 
Directors who commenced 
employment prior to April 2013 
the maximum annual pension 
contribution or cash allowance is 
30% of salary.
Legacy defined benefit pension 
arrangements will continue to 
be honoured.

Annual report on remuneration
Introduction
This section sets out how the Company has applied its remuneration policy in the year, and details how the policy will be 
implemented for the year 2015/16. In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act, this section will be put to an 
advisory vote at the Company’s AGM which is scheduled to be held on 30 July 2015.
Operation of the remuneration policy for 2015/16
During 2014/15 the Committee further reviewed the incentive framework for Executive Directors. 
The key changes made were: 
• adjustment of the corporate performance objectives for the annual bonus to ensure 
that they were aligned with the areas of challenge in the strategy; 
• the introduction of malus and clawback arrangements in the Performance and 
Co-investment Plan in accordance with best practice; and
• the introduction of a two year holding period in respect of any shares which 
vest under the Performance and Co-investment Plan.
A summary of the specific remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors in 2015/16 is described below:
Base salary 2015/16 salaries are:
• Chris Loughlin: £400,000 
• Ian McAulay: £400,000
• Susan Davy: £325,000.
Chris Loughlin received a salary increase of 3.36%, reflecting market rates and performance, effective 
1 April 2015. Ian McAulay received a 12.68% increase to reflect his performance in the role after joining 
the Company. This is in line with the Committee’s approved policy on salaries on recruitment where 
salaries may be set at an initially lower level with the intention of providing potential for higher than 
usual increases over the following two years to reflect experience gained and performance in the role. 
Given that this two year period will have passed at the next salary review, it is not anticipated that there 
will be any further increases of this nature for Ian McAulay. Susan Davy, having been appointed on 
1 February 2015, did not receive an increase.
Pension and benefits No changes. Salary supplement cash allowance of between 20% and 30% from which is deducted the 
employer’s contribution to the Defined Benefit or Contribution pension schemes for the Directors.
Susan Davy, appointed on 1 February 2015 and having been promoted from within the Group, already 
received a pension benefit equivalent to 25% of salary, in respect of which there has been no change.
Annual bonus No change to maximum opportunity of 100% of salary. No change to operation of deferral. 50% 
of the bonus is delivered as deferred shares. No changes will be made to the overall performance 
measurement framework for the annual bonus for 2015/16. Minor amendments to the role-specific 
measures have been made to reflect goals for the year, as set out below:
• 30% EPS (before deferred tax and exceptional items) performance
• 30% personal strategic objectives
• 40% measures which are specific to the role including net debt, division operating profit, RoRE 
(Return on Regulated Equity), Totex (Total expenditure), performance and service improvements in 
South West Water (SWW), PBITDA plus JVs (profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation 
plus joint ventures) (Viridor).
More detail on the measures and weightings is provided on the following page. The objective was to 
ensure alignment to measures identified as key for each role with an appropriate balance between hard 
financial measures and objectives aligned to the strategic success of the business.
For bonuses from 2014/15 both malus and clawback apply as described in the summary of the 
remuneration policy report.
Performance and 
Co-investment Plan (PCP)
No change to maximum performance opportunity of 100% of base salary, awards being subject to 
co-investment of 20% of the award, and performance measures:
• 50% TSR vs FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts)
• 50% TSR vs a peer group index.
‘Underpin’ relating to overall Group performance.
For awards from 2015/16 both malus and clawback apply as described in the summary of the 
remuneration policy report.
In addition a further two year holding period will apply in respect of any shares which vest at the end of 
the three year performance period.
Shareholding guideline No change. 100% of salary to be built up in the first five years of joining.

Susan Davy
Susan Davy was Group Director of Finance for two months of the financial year. Consequently the majority of her annual 
bonus for the year (relating to 10 months of the financial year) was based on the targets set relating to her previous role in 
the Group. Bonus relating to the two month period was based on development in the role as new Group Director of Finance. 
The bonus outturn for the full 12 months was 93.6% of the total opportunity.
Performance and Co-investment Plan outturn for 2014/15
The PCP awards made on 3 July 2012, which are due to vest on 3 July 2015, are the awards included in the single figure 
table and currently it is estimated that the outturn will result in a zero vesting as set out in the table on the following page.
50% of the awards vest subject to the Company’s TSR performance measured against an index made up of the following six 
listed comparator companies. These companies were considered to be the Company’s key listed comparators:
• National Grid Plc 
• Shanks Group 
• Séché Environnement 
• Suez Environnement
• Severn Trent 
• United Utilities
The remaining 50% of the awards vest subject to the Company’s ranked TSR performance against the constituents of the 
FTSE 250 (excluding investment trusts).
The calculation of TSR performance over the three year performance period (being 1 April 2012 to 1 April 2015) for the PCP 
awards was undertaken by Deloitte LLP for the Committee.

 The accrued pension for Susan Davy is based on service to the year-end and final pensionable salary at that date. Since David Dupont is a pensioner member of 
Pennon Group’s pension schemes the accrued pension shown is the actual pension in payment as at 31 March 2015
David Dupont was a pensioner member of the Pennon 
Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements during the 
year. As such no further benefits were accrued and no 
employee or employer contributions were paid (other than 
the employer’s deficit reduction contributions) during the 
year. The increases in David Dupont’s accrued pension over 
the year are solely as a result of indexation of his pension as 
set out in the Schemes’ Rules. 
Susan Davy receives an overall pension benefit from the 
Company equivalent to 25% of her salary. She is a member 
of Pennon Group’s defined benefit pension arrangements 
and is entitled to normal retirement pension payable from 
age 65 of broadly 1/80th of Pensionable Remuneration for 
each year of Pensionable Service completed.
The employer’s contribution to the pension for Susan Davy is 
deducted from the overall pension allowance.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 
5% p.a. or RPI if lower for service accrued in the period up 
to 30 June 2014 and at a rate of 2.5% p.a. or CPI if lower for 
service accrued in the period after this date.
If a Director dies within five years of retiring a lump sum equal 
to the balance of five years’ pension payments is paid plus 
a spouse’s pension of one half of the member’s pension.

Director changes – additional information
Recruitment of Neil Cooper
Neil Cooper was appointed as a Non-executive Director 
with effect from 1 September 2014 and as chairman of 
the Audit Committee. His fee is in line with that of other 
Non-executive Directors.
Leaving arrangements – David Dupont  
(audited information)
David Dupont retired on 31 January 2015. This followed 
23 years of service with the Company and 12 years as the 
Group Director of Finance. The Committee determined that 
Mr Dupont’s retirement was a ‘good leaver’ circumstance. 
Consequently he received a performance related annual 
bonus, pro-rated for his period of employment in the year 
which remains subject to share deferral and his other 
outstanding deferred bonus awards are due to be released 
to him. Under the rules of the PCP his 2012 and 2013 PCP 
awards remain in force subject to performance conditions 
tested at the normal time and subject to pro-rating for time. 
His 2014 PCP award was forfeited due to his retirement 
being before the year-end.
Mr Dupont received no payment in lieu of notice or 
compensation for loss of office.
Recruitment of Susan Davy
Susan Davy joined the Board on 1 February 2015 as an 
Executive Director and as Group Director of Finance. 
Her remuneration package is in line with those of the other 
Executive Directors, except that her salary has been set 
at an initially lower level with a view to providing for scope 
for increases depending on performance over the next two 
years. She also has legacy pension arrangements which will 
continue to be honoured.
Recruitment of Sir John Parker
Sir John Parker was appointed as a Non-executive Director 
and as Deputy Chairman of the Board on 1 April 2015. 
His fee was determined to be 50% of that of the Chairman’s 
fee and is due to be increased to the same level as the 
current Chairman’s fee upon his taking up the appointment 
as Chairman on 1 August 2015. When appropriate for the 
efficient carrying out of his duties, he is provided with a driver 
and vehicle. He is entitled to expenses on the same basis as 
for other Non-executive Directors.
Outside appointments
Executive Directors may accept one board appointment in 
another company. Board approval must be sought before 
accepting an appointment. Fees may be retained by the 
Director. Currently, no Executive Directors hold outside 
company appointments other than with industry bodies or 
governmental or quasi-governmental agencies.
Non-executive Director fees and benefits
The Chairman’s and the other Non-executive Directors’ 
fees were increased by 2.5% for 2014/15 compared to the 
previous year following an assessment of the market and 
taking account of the time commitment of each Director.
The existing Chairman’s benefits comprise a company 
vehicle, fuel and private health insurance.
The policy for Executive Directors’ service contracts is to 
provide for 12 months notice from either side. 
Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment contain three 
months notice from either side and the current Chairman’s 
letter of appointment contains a 12 months notice period 
from either side. The letter of appointment of the new 
Chairman from 1 August 2015 contains a six month notice 
period from either side.
All Non-executive Directors are subject to annual re-election 
and are appointed for an initial three year term.
Copies of Directors’ service contracts and letters of 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.

Equivalent chief executive officer remuneration
As the Company does not have a Group CEO, the 
Committee has decided to provide historic single figure 
information in the form of the average remuneration of the 
Executive Directors. Their remuneration is considered to be 
the most appropriate to use for this exercise as they are the 
most senior executives in the Company.

Comparison of Executive Director remuneration 
to employee remuneration
The table below shows the percentage change between 
2013/14 and 2014/15 in base salary, benefits and annual 
bonus for the average of the Executive Directors and all 
employees. To enable comparison, the remuneration of 
the previous Chief Executive, Viridor, for 2013/14 has been 
included in the calculation of the percentage changes.
The percentage increase in average remuneration for 
employees is calculated using wages and salaries (excluding 
share-based payments) of £143.9 million (2013/14 
£134.3 million), analysed into the three components in 
the table and the average number of employees of 4,558 
(2013/14 4,451) both as detailed in note 13 to the Group 
financial statements.

(ii) This figure includes £112,000 related to buyout awards for Ian McAulay in 2013/14. Without this the change in annual bonus would have been -4.74%.
86 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Governance and remuneration
86 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 PCP awards were calculated using the share price at the 
date of grant (14 July 2014) which was £7.98 per share. 
Deferred bonus awards were calculated using the share 
price at the date of grant (27 August 2014) which was £8.21. 
The deferred bonus plan is operated in conjunction with the 
Company’s HMRC approved executive share option scheme 
(ESOS). This is on the basis that the aggregate pre-tax value 
of the awards made under both the annual bonus and the 
ESOS would be the same as they would have been if the 
bonus plan had operated alone. This is achieved by requiring 
that an amount of deferred shares, equal in value to any gain 
made on the exercise of ESOS options, is forfeited by the 
Directors at the end of the three year deferral period.
Directors’ shareholding and interest in shares
The Remuneration Committee believes that the interests 
of Executive Directors and senior management should 
be closely aligned with the interests of shareholders. 
To support this, the Committee operates shareholding 
guidelines. The Executive Directors are expected to build 
up a shareholding in the Company in accordance with the 
Company’s shareholding guideline which amounts to a 
shareholding interest equivalent to 100% of salary to be 
built up within the first five years of joining the Company at 
the rate of at least 20% per year by the end of each year. 
This level of shareholding is then expected to be maintained 
by each Director and is revalued each year in accordance 
with the then prevailing share price and the Executive 
Director’s salary.
The beneficial interests of the Executive Directors in the 
ordinary shares (40.7p each) of the Company as at 31 March 
2015 (or date of cessation, if earlier) and 31 March 2014 
together with their shareholding guideline obligation and 
interest are shown in the table below:

Governance and remuneration
92 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Introduction
This Directors’ report is prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and regulations made 
thereunder. It comprises pages 53 to 71 and 93 to 95 as 
well as the following matters which the Board considers 
are of strategic importance and, as permitted by legislation, 
has chosen to include in the strategic report rather than the 
Directors’ report:
• internal control and risk management systems (page 61 
of the governance report)
• likely future developments of the Company (pages 9, 19 
and 27 of the strategic report)
• important post-balance sheet events (page 33 of the 
strategic report and page 155 of the financial statements)
• all matters relating to sustainability, which include details 
of the Group’s carbon emissions (page 46 of the strategic 
report) and information relating to employee involvement 
(pages 18, 27 and 50 of the strategic report, as well as 
the disclosure below).
In addition, the Directors’ report includes the following 
disclosures (and any other disclosures) which are 
incorporated by reference:
• financial risk management (pages 110 to 112 of the notes 
to the financial statements)
• financial instruments (pages 108 and 128 of the notes to 
the financial statements).
Board of Directors
The Directors in office as at the date of this report (all of 
whom served during the year with the exception of Sir John 
Parker, who was appointed on 1 April 2015) are named 
on pages 56 and 57. In addition, Mr David Dupont, who 
occupied the position of Group Director of Finance, served 
as a Director during the year until his retirement from the 
Board on 31 January 2015. 
Financial results and dividend
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 21.82p per 
ordinary share to be paid on 2 October 2015 to shareholders 
on the register on 7 August 2015, making a total dividend for 
the year of 31.80p, the cost of which will be £129.5 million, 
resulting in a reduction in reserves of £3 million. The strategic 
report on pages 28 to 33 analyses the Group’s financial 
results in more detail and sets out other financial information.
Directors’ insurance and indemnities
The Directors have the benefit of the indemnity provisions 
contained in the Company’s Articles of Association 
(‘Articles’), and the Company has maintained throughout 
the year Directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for the 
benefit of the Company, the Directors and its officers. The 
Company has entered into qualifying third party indemnity 
arrangements for the benefit of all its Directors in a form 
and scope which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 and which were in force throughout 
the year and remain in force.
Employment policies and employee involvement
The Group has a culture of continuous improvement through 
investment in people at all levels within the Group. The 
Group is committed to pursuing equality and diversity in 
all its employment activities including recruitment, training, 
career development and promotion and ensuring there is no 
bias or discrimination in the treatment of people. In particular, 
applications for employment are welcomed from persons 
with disabilities, and special arrangements and adjustments 
as necessary are made to ensure that applicants are treated 
fairly when attending for interview or for pre-employment 
aptitude tests. Wherever possible the opportunity is 
taken to retrain people who become disabled during their 
employment in order to maintain their employment within the 
Group. Information regarding the Group’s workplace policies 
is provided on page 50.
The Board has a diversity policy and encourages gender 
diversity in particular. Further details of the Board’s diversity 
policy are set out in the report of the Nomination Committee 
on page 70, and information regarding the diversity of the 
workforce is provided on page 50.
Employees are consulted regularly about changes which 
may affect them either through their trade union-appointed 
representatives or by means of the elected staff council 
which operates in South West Water for staff employees. 
These forums, together with regular meetings with particular 
groups of employees, are used to ensure that employees 
are kept up to date with the business performance of their 
employer and the financial and economic factors affecting 
the performance of the Group. The Group also cascades 
information monthly to all employees to provide them with 
important and up to date information about key events and 
to obtain feedback from them. Further information about 
employment matters relating to the Group is set out on 
pages 18, 27 and 50 of the strategic report. 
The Group encourages share ownership among its 
employees by operating an HM Revenue & Customs 
approved Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan. 
Following shareholder approval at the 2014 AGM, these 
were amended to provide for the increased savings limits 
approved by government. At 31 March 2015 around 40% of 
the Group’s employees were participating in these plans.
Human rights
The Group is fully supportive of the principles set out in the 
UN Declaration of Human Rights, and the Group Ethics 
Policy outlines the high standards of employment practice 
with which everyone in Pennon Group is expected to 
comply. The Group also supports the International Labour 
Organisation’s core conventions for the protection and safety 
of workforces wherever they may be throughout the Group.

Governance and remuneration
94 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015 Going concern
Having considered the Group’s funding position and financial 
projections the Directors have a reasonable expectation that 
the Group has adequate resource to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ remuneration report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
Directors have prepared the Group and Company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the 
Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for the year.
In preparing these financial statements the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently
• make judgements and accounting estimates which are 
reasonable and prudent 
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and 
the Company; and enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements and the Directors’ remuneration report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, article 4 of the International Accounting 
Standards (IAS) Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and the Company and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on pages 56 and 57, confirms that, to the best of his or 
her knowledge:
i) The financial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the Group and of the Company.
ii) The strategic report (pages 4 to 51) and the Directors’ 
report (pages 53 to 95) include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business during the 
year and the position of the Company and the Group at 
the year end, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties they face.
iii) Following receipt of advice from the Audit Committee, 
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for the shareholders to assess the Group’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’ s website www.pennon-group.co.uk
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Statement as to disclosure of information to 
the auditor
i) So far as each of the Directors in office at the date of 
the signing of the report is aware, there is no relevant 
audit information of which the Company’s auditor is 
unaware; and
ii) each of the Directors has taken all the steps each Director 
ought to have taken individually as a Director in order 
to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information.
The Directors’ report consisting of pages 53 to 71 and 
93 to 95 was approved by the Board on 22 June 2015.

Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs 
as at 31 March 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year 
then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
• the Parent Company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance with 
the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 
2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
What we have audited
We have audited the financial statements of Pennon Group 
Plc for the year ended 31 March 2015 which comprise the 
consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, the Group and Parent Company 
balance sheets, the Group and Parent Company statements 
of changes in equity, the Group and Parent Company 
cash flow statements and the related notes 1 to 45. The 
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their 
preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial 
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of 
the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the Company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 95, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any 
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us 
in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of 
any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we 
consider the implications for our report.
An overview of the scope of the audit
Full scope locations are those in which we obtain audit 
coverage over all significant financial statement line items 
related to that location. Specific scope locations are those 
in which we obtain audit coverage over selected financial 
statement line items, which are determined based upon 
size and risk. The audit procedures in full and specific 
scope locations are performed by audit teams based in 
the corresponding locations. Other scope locations for 
which the financial statement line items are determined 
to be immaterial individually and in the aggregate based 
on both size and risk, are subject to analytical procedures 
performed by the Group audit team. The audit scopes 
we have adopted are set out below. During the year, the 
Senior Statutory Auditor visited key infrastructure assets 
and the head office of each full scope business where she 
attended meetings with management and engaged with the 
audit team on the planning and execution of our work. We 
included the full scope component teams in our Group audit 
planning briefing and interacted regularly with component 
teams where appropriate throughout the various stages of 
the audit.
Business Scope
Pennon Group Plc Full scope
Viridor Full scope
South West Water Full scope
Peninsula Insurance Limited Specific scope
All other entities Other scope
The three full scope components, over which we performed 
our audit procedures, represent the principal businesses 
within the Group’s operations and account for just under 
100% of the Group’s revenue and profit before tax and 95% 
of the Group’s total assets. The only change to the prior year 
is Peninsula Insurance Limited which has moved from ‘other’ 
to ‘specific scope’.

Financial statements and shareholder information Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
We identified the following risks that have had the greatest 
effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of 
resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the 
engagement team. For each risk identified, we have 
documented our response and audit procedures below and 
these are broadly consistent with the prior year:
Risk of material misstatement Our response to the risks of material misstatement included the 
following procedures
Valuation of goodwill (Group)
The value of goodwill is £339.3 million, as included in 
note 15. The recoverable value of the waste management 
business, to which goodwill belongs, is sensitive to 
changes in assumptions over future landfill volumes, 
power generation prices and discount rates. The Group’s 
annual assessment of the recoverable value requires 
judgement as to the future cash flow projections and the 
discount rates to be used. Audit Committee commentary 
is on page 64.
•  We validated management’s determination of cash generating units 
(CGUs), through a detailed review of whether they have independent cash 
flows 
•  We audited the underlying cash flow/ fair value models supporting the 
carrying value of Viridor assets (discussed below)
• We agreed input data into the goodwill impairment model and cash flow 
forecasts, to information from the Viridor business as audited by our 
Viridor component team, and performed sensitivity analysis over this data, 
including growth rates, volumes, costs and powergen prices
•  We audited the discount rate calculation applied at Group level, using our 
internal valuation experts to assist in our review of whether management’s 
assumptions are within an acceptable range based on comparative 
market data
•  We confirmed the clerical accuracy of the models
• We assessed whether disclosures made are in accordance with IFRS.
Valuation of non-current assets (Viridor)
The net book value of these assets is £945.3 million, as 
included in note 17. The Group is required to review the 
carrying value of assets when any impairment indicators 
are identified. In calculating the recoverable amounts, key 
assumptions are made by management over the cash 
flow forecasts, discount rates and grouping of assets into 
CGUs. Audit Committee commentary is on page 64.
•  We evaluated the cash flow forecasts and the key assumptions, 
agreeing assumptions made to supporting evidence, such as budgets 
and current performance, and using our internal valuation experts to 
assess management’s projection of future electricity prices and whether 
management’s discount rate assumptions are within an acceptable range 
based on comparative market data
• We compared the strategic plans with prior year plans and assessed 
changes in these plans over time and management’s ability to forecast
•  We evaluated the fair value calculations for any Fair Value Less Cost of 
Disposal (FVLCD) recoverable amounts
• We performed sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions, including 
growth rates, volumes, costs and powergen prices
• We reviewed the impairment model and tested it for clerical accuracy.
Landfill related provisions (Viridor)
Landfill related provisions of £193.0 million are recorded 
in note 32 and consist of aftercare, restoration and 
remediation provisions. 
Calculation of the aftercare provision involves significant 
judgement over the expected period of aftercare, the level 
of costs to be incurred and the discount rate to be used.
Key areas of estimation for the restoration provision 
include the expected restoration costs, the void space to 
be filled and timing of site closure.
Judgement over the remedial action required to comply 
with current environmental legislation, where breaches 
have been identified, is key for the remediation provision. 
Audit Committee commentary is on page 64.
• We evaluated the forecast costs in the models, agreeing these to 
supporting evidence such as budgets and current performance 
• We assessed the reasonableness of material judgements made, including 
expected gas generation and anticipated cost savings to detailed plans 
and current performance 
• We reviewed the reasonableness of key assumptions used in the 
calculation of the provisions, including the discount rates, inflation rates, 
void space and remaining lives of the sites to available market information
• We performed sensitivity analysis on these key assumptions 
• We reviewed the aftercare, restoration and remediation provision models, 
and ensured that the models are clerically accurate.

following procedures
Revenue recognition across the Group’s operations
The Group’s material revenue streams relate to the 
provision of water and wastewater services by South West 
Water and revenue generated from the renewable energy, 
recycling and waste management services provided by 
Viridor. ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of fraud 
relating to revenue recognition and for the Group this risk 
over revenue recognition specifically arises in the following 
judgemental areas:
South West Water
• Income from measured water services requires an 
estimation of the amount of unbilled charges at the 
year-end. This is calculated using a combination of 
system generated information, based on previous 
customer volume usage, together with management 
judgements as to the likely impact on usage of factors 
such as recent weather patterns.
Viridor
• Calculations of accrued income on waste management 
contracts and powergen revenue to be received involve 
estimation by management 
• Accounting for revenue from long-term service

South West Water
• We tested key controls linked to system generated information and 
around the estimation process
• We challenged the key assumptions and estimates made by management 
in recognising revenue 
• We understood the process for the supply of measured services, 
meter reading and related billing in order to challenge the completeness 
of adjustments to reflect the accrual or deferral of revenue. This included 
considering whether contract terms and conditions were met and revenue 
recognised at the correct time in accordance with IFRS
• We performed detailed analytical procedures by comparing revenue 
balances for the year against expectation and obtained support for 
significant variances
• We compared the accrued income to bills raised post year end for a 
sample of customers, and compared management’s history of estimating 
the accrued income to bills raised in the subsequent year
• In performing our journal testing, we paid increased attention to entries 
impacting revenue.
Viridor
• We challenged the key assumptions and estimates made by management 
in recognising revenue 
• For material items we re-performed the calculation to confirm the 
accuracy of the accrued income recorded by management
• In performing our journal testing, we paid increased attention to entries 
impacting revenue, particularly those raised close to the balance 
sheet date
• We assessed whether the revenue recognition policies adopted complied 
with IFRSs, in particular the requirements of IFRIC 12 and whether 
margins used to recognise revenue were appropriate
• We performed cut-off testing of invoices raised prior to and after the 
balance sheet date to ensure revenue has been recognised in the 
correct period.
Adequacy of the provision for doubtful debts 
(South West Water)
As shown in note 22, there is a provision of £86.8 million 
at the year-end against gross trade debtors of 
£282.5 million.
The South West Water provision is calculated using a 
combination of system generated information on historic 
debt recovery rates and management’s judgement of the 
future likely recovery rates. Audit Committee commentary 
is on page 64.
•  We tested controls over the integrity of data and the report utilised to 
generate the ageing and categorisation of debt within South West Water’s 
billing system
• We tested historic data on collection rates and how this data was used in 
the preparation of the bad debt provision
• We challenged the assumptions used by management in determining 
the amounts provided against the different categories and age of 
debt, by comparing these assumptions to historic collection rates and 
by considering the impact of changes in the methods adopted by 
management to collect debt.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions (Group)
The Company’s current tax liability of £52.2 million shown 
in note 27, includes £36.6 million in respect of open tax 
computations relating to prior years, where liabilities are 
yet to be agreed with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). 
The Company establishes provisions for individual tax 
items where the tax position is uncertain. Audit Committee 
commentary is on page 64.
• We inspected the latest correspondence between the Group and HMRC 
and reviewed details of any new enquiries that have been opened
• We reviewed and inspected any legal advice or opinion management have 
obtained in the period in relation to uncertain tax positions
• We reviewed the adequacy of disclosure in the annual report
• We obtained an updated view from treasury tax specialists as to HMRC’s 
current position on open matters
• We challenged the level of provision maintained for uncertain tax positions, 
in light of evidence obtained
• We tested whether the tax accounting and disclosures in note 9 complied 
with the requirements of IAS12 ‘Income Taxes’.
98 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements and shareholder information Our application of materiality 
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning 
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. 
For the purposes of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement we define 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, 
would be changed or influenced. We also determine a 
level of performance materiality which we use to determine 
the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately 
low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the 
financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined 
a magnitude for uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the financial statements as a whole. 
We determined materiality for the Group to be £10 million, 
which is the same as in the prior year, and is approximately 
5% of profit before taxation before exceptional items. This 
provided the basis for determining the nature, timing and 
extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and 
assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining 
the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment and 
being our first year audit, our judgement was that overall 
performance materiality for the Group should be 50% of 
materiality, namely £5 million. 
Audit work at individual components is undertaken based 
on a percentage of our total performance materiality. The 
performance materiality set for each component is based on 
the relative size of the component and our view of the risk 
of misstatement at that component. In the current year the 
range of performance materiality allocated to components 
was £1 million to £4.25 million.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £0.5 million. 
We also agreed to report differences below those thresholds 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both 
the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and 
in light of other relevant qualitative considerations.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the strategic report and the 
Directors’ report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report 
by exception 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or 
• is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement 
that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion:
• adequate accounting records have not been kept, or 
returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 95, in relation to 
going concern; and
• the part of the corporate governance statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the 10 provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

(a) Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost accounting basis (except for fair value items, principally acquisitions, 
transfers of assets from customers and certain financial instruments as described in accounting policy notes (b), (v) and (n) respectively) 
and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee as 
adopted by the European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. A 
summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation where changes have been made to previous 
policies on the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations in the year.
The going concern basis has been adopted in preparing these financial statements as stated by the Directors on page 95.
The new standards listed below, which were mandatory for the first time in the year beginning 1 April 2014, did not have a material impact 
on the net assets or results of the Group.
– IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. Under IFRS 10, subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group 
controls an entity when the Group has power over an entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with 
the entity and has the ability to affect these returns through its power over the entity.
 The new standard IFRS 10 has no financial impact on the Group.
– IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as joint ventures based on contractual 
rights and obligations each investor has rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement.
 Under IFRS 11, entities can no longer account for an interest in a joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method and must 
use the equity method in accordance with IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates’.
 The new standard IFRS 11 has no financial impact on the Group. All joint ventures continue to be recognised using the equity method.
– IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’. IFRS 12 sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under the two new 
standards noted above. The new standard requires additional disclosure in relation to subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements.
 The new standard IFRS 12 has no financial impact on the Group, although further disclosure of joint arrangements has been presented 
in these financial statements.
Other standards or interpretations which were mandatory for the first time in the year beginning 1 April 2014 did not have a material impact 
on the net assets or results of the Group.
Standards and interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material effect on the Group’s net assets or results, 
except the following set out below:
– IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, 
including the relaxation of certain hedging requirements. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It will replace the 
guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. The standard is effective for accounting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and is subject to EU endorsement.
– IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ relates to revenue recognition and establishes principles for reporting useful 
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from 
an entity’s contracts with customers. The standard will replace IAS 18 ‘Revenue’ and IAS 11 ‘Construction contracts’ and related 
interpretations. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and is subject to EU endorsement.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on the Group’s financial reporting, which is expected to result 
in increased disclosure of the Group’s revenue.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements include the results of Pennon Group Plc and its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and 
excluded from the date of disposal. The results of subsidiaries are consolidated where the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable 
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of joint 
ventures and associate undertakings are accounted for on an equity basis.
Intra-group trading, loan balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the purchase of subsidiaries. The excess of the value transferred to the seller 
in return for control of the acquired business, together with the fair value of any previously held equity interest in that business over the 
Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets, is recorded as goodwill.

(c) Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and inter-company sales, in the 
ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is recognised once the services or goods have been provided to the customer.
Income from main water and wastewater charges includes billed amounts for estimated usage and also an estimation of the amount of 
unbilled charges at the year-end based upon a defined methodology reflecting historical consumption and current tariffs.
Income from electricity generated from waste management landfill gas production during the year includes an estimation of the amount to 
be received under Renewables Obligation Certificates.
Accrued income from waste management contracts at the balance sheet date is recognised using management’s expectation of amounts 
to be subsequently billed for services rendered to the client in accordance with the terms of the contract.
Income from recycling activities within waste management includes amounts based upon market prices for recyclate products and industry 
schemes for waste electrical and electronic equipment (‘WEEE’ notes) and packaging volumes (‘PRNs’) processed.
Revenue from long-term service concession arrangements is recognised based on the fair value of work performed. Where an arrangement 
includes more than one service, such as construction and operation of waste management facilities, revenue and profit are recognised in 
proportion to a fair value assessment of the total contract value split across the services provided.
(d) Landfill tax
Landfill tax is included within both revenue and operating costs. 
(e) Segmental reporting 
Each of the Group’s business segments provides services which are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of the other 
business segments. The Group’s internal organisation and management structure and its system of internal financial reporting are based 
primarily on business segments. The reportable business segments comprise the regulated water and wastewater services undertaken by 
South West Water Limited and the waste management business of Viridor Limited. Segmental revenue and results include transactions 
between businesses. Inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
(f) Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation from the acquisition of subsidiary and joint venture undertakings represents the excess of the purchase 
consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, less any subsequent impairment charges.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the 
income statement and is not subsequently reversed. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination 
is allocated to each of the cash generating units or group of cash generating units, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the 
combination. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is 
monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill is allocated and monitored at the reportable operating segment level. Further details are 
contained in accounting policy (j).
When a subsidiary or joint venture undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of 
unamortised goodwill.
(g) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are recognised in relation to long-term service concessions contracts to the extent that future amounts to be 
received are not certain. 
Other intangible assets include assets acquired in a business combination and are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. 
Following initial recognition, finite life intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with the 
expense charged to the income statement through operating costs.
(h) Property, plant and equipment
i) Infrastructure assets (being water mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, pipelines and 
sea outfalls) 
Infrastructure assets were included at fair value on transition to IFRS, and subsequent additions are recorded at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment charges. Expenditure to increase capacity or enhance infrastructure assets is capitalised where it can be 
reliably measured, and it is probable that incremental future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The cost of day-to-day servicing of 
infrastructure components is recognised in the income statement as it arises.
Infrastructure assets are depreciated evenly over their useful economic lives, and are principally: 
Dams and impounding reservoirs 200 years
Water mains 40 – 100 years
Sewers 40 – 100 years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
ii) Landfill sites 
Landfill sites are included within land and buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes acquisition and development 
expenses. The cost of a landfill site is depreciated to its residual value (which is linked to gas production at the site post-closure) over its 
estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
2. Principal accounting policies Continued 
106 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements and shareholder information iii) Landfill restoration
Where the obligation to restore a landfill site is an integral part of its future economic benefits, a non-current asset within property, plant and 
equipment is recognised. The asset recognised is depreciated based on the usage of void space.
iv) Other assets (including energy recovery facilities, property, overground plant and equipment)
Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated evenly to their residual value over their estimated economic lives, and 
are principally:
Land and buildings – freehold buildings 30 – 60 years
Land and buildings – leasehold buildings
Over the estimated economic lives or the 
finance lease period, whichever is the shorter
Operational properties 40 – 80 years
Energy Recovery Facilities  
(including major refurbishments)
25 – 30 years
Fixed plant 20 – 40 years
Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 – 10 years
Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs which are incremental to the Group. Borrowing costs directly 
attributable to the construction of a qualifying asset (an asset necessarily taking a substantial period of time to be prepared for its intended 
use) are capitalised as part of the asset. Assets transferred from customers are recognised at fair value as set out in accounting policy (v).
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually, and adjusted if appropriate.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing sale proceeds with carrying amounts. These are included in the 
income statement.
(i) Leased assets
Assets held under finance leases are included as property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at commencement or 
the present value of the minimum lease payments, and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, 
whichever is the shorter. The corresponding liability is recorded as borrowings. The interest element of the rental costs is charged against 
profits using the actuarial method over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
(j) Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes 
in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which an asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). Value in use represents the 
present value of projected future cash flows expected to be derived from a cash generating unit, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate 
which reflects an assessment of the market cost of capital of the cash generating unit.
Impairments are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each 
reporting date.
(k) Investment in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recorded at cost, being the fair value of the consideration paid. Subsequently investments 
are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis annually or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be fully recoverable.
(l) Investment in joint ventures
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group exercises joint control. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method of accounting. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the 
joint venture at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the investment in the joint venture.
The carrying value of the Group’s investment is adjusted for the Group’s share of post-acquisition profits or losses recognised in the income 
statement and statement of comprehensive income. Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Group’s interest are not recognised unless 
the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to fund those losses.
(m) Cash and cash deposits
Cash and cash deposits comprise cash in hand and short-term deposits held at banks. Bank overdrafts are shown within 
current borrowings.

(n) Derivatives and other financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories:
i) Loans and receivables
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Following initial recognition, interest-bearing 
loans and borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the instruments are derecognised or impaired. Premia, discounts and other 
costs and fees are recognised in the income statement through the amortisation process.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability component of a convertible bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible 
bond. This amount is recorded as a liability on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on conversion 
or maturity of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the conversion option. This is recognised in shareholders’ equity.
ii) Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest receivable and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the original terms of the receivables.
iii) Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
iv) Financial assets arising from service concession arrangements
Where the provision of waste management services is performed through a contract with a public sector entity which controls a significant 
residual interest in asset infrastructure at the end of the contract, then consideration is treated as contract receivables, split between 
profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and the provision of finance which is recognised in notional interest within 
finance income.
v) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and cross-currency 
interest rate swaps to hedge risks associated with interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative instruments are initially 
recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported 
balance sheet.
The Group designates certain hedging derivatives as either:
– a hedge of a highly probable forecast transaction or change in the cash flows of a recognised asset or liability (a cash flow hedge) or
– a hedge of the exposure to change in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (a fair value hedge).
The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised to the income statement except for cash flow hedges which meet the conditions 
for hedge accounting, when the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is determined to be an effective hedge is 
recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the income statement. The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are 
subsequently recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is 
recognised in the income statement.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged 
and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of the relationship between the 
hedged item and the hedging instrument which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing 
is reperformed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Where a non-derivative transaction or series of transactions with the same counterparty has the aggregate effect in substance of a 
derivative instrument, the transaction or series of transactions shall be recognised as a single derivative instrument at fair value with 
associated movements recorded in the income statement.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is apportioned on a straight line basis between non-current and current assets or liabilities based 
on the remaining maturity of the hedging derivative.
Derivative financial instruments deemed held for trading, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are classified as a current asset or 
liability with any change in fair value recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group uses cross-currency swaps for some of its foreign currency denominated private placement borrowings. The swaps either 
have the effect of (i) converting variable rate foreign currency borrowings into fixed rate sterling borrowings, (ii) converting fixed rate 
foreign currency borrowings into fixed rate sterling borrowings, or (iii) converting fixed rate foreign currency borrowings into floating rate 
sterling borrowings. 
vi) Financial instruments at fair value through profit
Financial instruments at fair value through profit reflect the fair value movement of the hedged risk on a hedged item which has been 
designated in a fair value hedging relationship. The fair values of these financial instruments are initially recognised on the date the hedging 
relationship is entered into and subsequently remeasured at each subsequent balance sheet date. The gain or loss on remeasurement for 
the period is recognised in the income statement.
2. Principal accounting policies Continued 
108 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements and shareholder information (o) Taxation including deferred tax
The tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement, except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised in the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case the tax is also recognised in the 
statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Management periodically 
evaluates tax items subject to interpretation and establishes provisions on individual tax items where in the judgement of management the 
position is uncertain.
The Group includes a number of companies, including the parent company, which are part of a tax group for certain aspects of the tax 
legislation. One of these aspects relates to group relief whereby current tax liabilities can be offset by current tax losses arising in other 
companies within the same tax group. Payment for group relief is made equal to the tax benefit and amounts are included within the 
current tax disclosures.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and 
the tax base, except if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the 
time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be realised. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and expected to apply when the deferred tax liability is settled or the deferred 
tax asset is realised.
(p) Provisions
Provisions are made where there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that there will be 
an outflow of economic benefits to settle this obligation and a reliable estimate of this amount can be made. Where the effect of the time 
value of money is material, the current amount of a provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle 
obligations. The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as notional interest within finance costs.
The Group’s policies on specific provisions are:
i) Landfill restoration costs
Provisions for the cost of restoring landfill sites are made when the obligation arises. Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives 
access to future economic benefits, an asset in property, plant and equipment is recognised. Provisions are otherwise charged against 
profits based on the usage of void space.
ii) Environmental control and aftercare costs
Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period 
thereafter. Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the income statement on the basis 
of the usage of void space at the site. Further provisions required after the operational life of a site are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
iii) Underperforming contracts
Where the unavoidable costs of meeting a contract’s obligations exceed the economic benefits derived from that contract, the unavoidable 
costs, less revenue anticipated under the terms of the contract, are recognised as a provision and charged to the income statement. An 
impairment loss on any assets dedicated to that contract is also recognised as described in accounting policy (j). 
(q) Share capital and treasury shares
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Where the Company purchases the Company’s equity share capital (treasury shares) the consideration paid, including any directly 
attributable costs, is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or re-issued. Where such shares are subsequently re-issued, 
any consideration received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, is included in equity.
The Group balance sheet includes the shares held by the Pennon Employee Share Trust, relating to employee share-based payments, 
which have not vested at the balance sheet date. These are shown as a deduction from shareholders’ equity until such time as they vest.
(r) Dividend distributions 
Dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the 
Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when paid; final dividends when approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.
(s) Employee benefits
i) Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
Defined benefit pension schemes
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation 
at the end of the year less the fair value of plan assets. If the value of a plan’s assets exceeds the present value of its obligations, the 
resulting surplus is only recognised if the Group has an unconditional right to that surplus.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries who advise on the selection of Directors’ best estimates, using the 
projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash 
outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related 
pension obligation. The increase in liabilities of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes, expected to arise from employee service in 
the year, is charged against operating profit.
Changes in benefits granted by the employer are recognised immediately as past service cost in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in 
the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

Strategic 
overview
South West 
Water
Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Defined contribution scheme
Costs of the defined contribution pension scheme are charged to the income statement in the year in which they arise. The Group has no 
further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
ii) Share-based payment
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans for employees. The fair value of the employee services 
required in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
Fair values are calculated using an appropriate pricing model. Non-market-based vesting conditions are adjusted for in assumptions as to 
the number of shares which are expected to vest. 
(t) Pre-contract and development costs
Pre-contract and development costs, including bid costs are expensed as incurred, except where it is probable that the contract will be 
awarded or the development completed, in which case they are recognised as an asset which is amortised to the income statement over 
the life of the contract.
(u) Fair values
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on the market price to transfer the asset or liability at the balance sheet date in an orderly 
transaction between market participants.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book 
values. In the case of non-current bank loans and other loans, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by 
discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
(v) Transfers of assets from customers
Where an item of property, plant and equipment that must be used to connect customers to the network is received from a customer, 
or where cash is received from a customer for the acquisition or construction of such an item, that asset is recorded and measured on 
initial recognition at its fair value. The credit created by the recognition of the asset is recognised in the income statement. The period 
over which the credit is recognised depends upon the nature of the service provided, as determined by the agreement with the customer. 
Where the service provided is solely a connection to the network, the credit is recognised at the point of connection. If the agreement does 
not specify a period, revenue is recognised over a period no longer than the economic life of the transferred asset used to provide the 
ongoing service.
The fair value of assets on transfer from customers is determined using a cost valuation approach allowing for depreciation.
(w) Foreign exchange
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the 
income statement.
(x) Perpetual capital securities
Perpetual capital securities are issued securities that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as 
dividends and recognised directly in equity and as a liability at the time the Company becomes obligated to pay the periodic return. This 
reflects the nature of the periodic returns and repayment of principal being only made at the Company’s discretion. Any associated tax 
impacts are recognised directly in equity.
(y) Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that in the Directors’ view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a 
full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.
3. Financial risk management
(a) Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: liquidity risk, market risk (interest rate and foreign currency risk) and credit 
risk. The Group’s treasury function seeks to ensure that sufficient funding is available to meet foreseeable needs, maintains reasonable 
headroom for contingencies and manages inflation and interest rate risk.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group relate to liquidity, interest rate and credit counterparty risk.
These risks and treasury operations are managed by the Group Director of Finance in accordance with policies established by the Board. 
Major transactions are individually approved by the Board. Treasury activities are reported to the Board and are subject to review by 
internal audit.
Financial instruments are used to raise finance, manage risk, optimise the use of surplus funds and manage overall interest rate 
performance. The Group does not engage in speculative activity.
i) Liquidity risk
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities which are designed to ensure the Group has 
sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions equivalent to at least one year’s forecast requirements at all times. Details 
of undrawn committed facilities and short-term facilities are provided in note 28.
Refinancing risk is managed under a Group policy that permits no more than 20% of Group net borrowings to mature in any financial year.
The Group and South West Water have entered into covenants with lenders. While terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing 
(primarily based on South West Water Limited’s Regulatory Capital Value and Viridor Limited’s EBITDA) and interest cover.

(ii) Market risk
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates. The Group uses a combination of fixed rate 
and index-linked borrowings and fixed rate interest swaps as cash flow hedges of future variable interest payments to achieve this policy. 
At the year-end 72% (2014 62%) of Group net borrowings were at fixed rates (including at least 50% of South West Water’s borrowings 
fixed for the period to March 2016) and 18% (2014 18%) index-linked, after the impact of financial derivatives. The notional principal 
amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not therefore an exposure for the Group. 
These instruments are analysed in note 23.
The interest rate for index-linked debt is based upon an RPI measure, which is also used in determining the amount of income from 
customers in South West Water.
The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets upon which the net return fluctuates from market risk. Deposit interest receivable is 
expected to fluctuate in line with interest payable on floating rate borrowings. Consequently the Group’s income and cash generated from 
operations (note 38) are independent of changes in market interest rates.
For 2015 if interest rates on variable net borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax 
profit for the year and equity would have decreased/increased by £0.4 million (2014 £1.2 million), for the equity sensitivity fair value, 
derivative impacts are excluded.
For 2015 if RPI on index-linked borrowings had been on average 0.5% higher/lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit 
for the year and equity would have decreased/increased by £1.5 million (2014 £1.4 million).

statements Foreign currency risk occurs at transactional and translation level from borrowings and transactions in foreign currencies. These risks are 
managed through forward contracts, which provide certainty over foreign currency risk.
iii) Credit risk
Credit counterparty risk arises from cash and cash deposits, derivative financial instruments and exposure to customers, including 
outstanding receivables. Further information on the credit risk relating to trade receivables is given in note 22.
Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments. The Board has agreed a 
policy for managing such risk which is controlled through credit limits, counterparty approvals, and rigorous monitoring procedures. 
The Group has no other significant concentration of credit risk. The Group’s surplus funds are managed by the Group’s treasury function 
and are usually placed in short-term fixed interest deposits or the overnight money markets. Deposit counterparties must meet a credit 
rating threshold set by the Board of P1 (Moody’s) or A1 (Standard & Poor’s).
(b) Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group’s policy is to have a minimum of 12 months pre-funding of projected capital expenditure. At 31 March 2015 the Group had 
cash and facilities, excluding restricted funds, of over £1.5 billion, meeting this objective.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group seeks to maintain a balance of returns to shareholders through dividends and 
an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity for each business segment and the Group.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net borrowings divided by total capital. Net 
borrowings are analysed in note 39 and calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash deposits. Total capital is calculated as total 
shareholders’ equity plus net borrowings.
The gearing ratios at the balance sheet date were:

Net borrowings (note 39) 2,197.1 2,194.0
Total equity 1,354.1 1,197.6
Total capital 3,551.2 3,391.6
Gearing ratio 61.9% 64.7%
South West Water Limited is also monitored on the basis of the ratio of its net borrowings to Regulatory Capital Value. Ofwat’s optimum 
range for the K5 (2010-2015) regulatory period for gearing was 55%-65% and for K6 (2015-2020) Ofwat’s optimum gearing is set 
at 62.5%.

Regulatory Capital Value 2,928.0 2,958.8
Net borrowings 1,817.5 1,645.7
Net borrowings/Regulatory Capital Value 62.1% 55.6%
The Group has entered into covenants with lenders and, while terms vary, these typically provide for limits on gearing and interest cover.
The Group has been in compliance with its covenants during the year.
(c) Determination of fair values
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
• quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1)
• inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The Group’s financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures as analysed in note 23.
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by using 
valuation techniques. A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet 
date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated 
discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The carrying values, less impairment provision, of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair 
value of financial liabilities, principally environmental provisions, is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.

112 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements and shareholder information 4. Critical accounting judgements and estimates
The Group’s principal accounting policies are set out in note 2. Management is required to exercise significant judgement and make use 
of estimates and assumptions in the application of these policies. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and 
expectations of future events that management believe to be reasonable. However, given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual 
results could be different from the assumptions used.
Impairment of non-financial assets and goodwill
In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of an individual asset or assets 
grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). For the purposes of assessing 
impairment of goodwill, the waste management segment is considered an integrated business and this is the lowest level to which goodwill 
is allocated, monitored and tested by management.
Impairment calculations are based on projections of future cash flows for the cash generating unit and the use of a terminal value to 
incorporate expectations of growth after the period covered by specific plans. The cash flows are discounted by the weighted average cost 
of capital appropriate to the business activity which is reviewed on an annual basis.
If the cash flow or discount rate assumptions were to change because of market conditions, the level of impairment could be different and 
could result in the impairment being increased or reversed, in part or in full, at a future date. 
The principal assumptions used to assess impairment are set out in notes 15 and 17.
Impairment of intangible assets
The Group records all assets and liabilities acquired in business acquisitions, including goodwill, at fair value. Intangible assets which have 
an indefinite useful life, principally goodwill, are assessed at least annually for impairment.
The initial goodwill recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make estimations of future cash flows, terminal 
values and an assessment of the long-term pre-tax discount rate to be applied to those cash flows which reflects an assessment of the 
cost of capital of the cash generating unit.
Environmental and landfill restoration provisions
Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period 
thereafter. The period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site. Key 
factors are the type of waste, the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements 
specific to the site. The amounts expected to be incurred are based on landfill site operating lives, taking account of the anticipated decline 
in landfill activity. 
The provisions are based on latest assumptions reflecting recent historic data and future cost estimates.
The provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the 
Group’s obligations. A discount rate is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision. This is 
included in the income statement as a financial item within finance costs. 
As at 31 March 2015 the Group’s environmental and landfill restoration provisions were £193.0 million (2014 £190.5 million) (note 32).
Where a restoration provision gives access to future economic benefits, an asset is recognised and depreciated in accordance with the 
Group’s depreciation policy. As at 31 March 2015 these assets had a net book value of £17.9 million (2014 £20.8 million) (note 17).
Retirement benefit obligations
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at 
intervals of not more than three years. The last such valuation of the main scheme was as at 31 March 2013.
The pension cost and liabilities under IAS 19 are assessed in accordance with Directors’ best estimates using the advice of an independent 
qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation. The assumptions are based on member data supplied to the actuary 
and market observations for interest rates and inflation, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management. The mortality 
assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2013 actuarial tables with an allowance for future longevity improvement. 
The principal assumptions used to measure schemes’ liabilities, sensitivities to changes in those assumptions and future funding 
obligations are set out in note 30.
Taxation
The Group current income tax provision of £52.2 million (note 27) reflects management’s judgement of the amount of tax payable for fiscal 
years with open tax computations where liabilities remain to be agreed with HM Revenue & Customs. Management periodically evaluates 
items detailed in tax returns where the tax treatment is subject to interpretation. The Group establishes provisions for individual tax items 
where the tax position is assessed as uncertain. 
Service concession arrangements
Consideration from public sector entities for the operation of waste management service concessions is treated as contract receivables 
or other intangible assets, depending upon the right to receive cash from the asset. Consideration relating to contract receivables is 
split between profit on the construction of assets, operation of the service and provision of finance recognised as interest receivable. 
Management’s allocation between these three elements is assessed to reflect external market conditions according to the type of 
service provided.

Landfill costs
The estimation of landfill reserves is of particular importance in assessing landfill costs since the projected cost of a landfill site is 
depreciated over its estimated operational life taking into account the usage of void space and gas production at the site post-closure. In 
estimating the operational life of a landfill site, consideration is given to the expected ongoing decline in the landfill market. Where Viridor 
plans or has constructed a competing energy recovery facility at certain existing landfill sites, the void which consequently is no longer 
expected to be used is excluded from the calculation of operational life. The estimates of landfill reserves are regularly reviewed and 
updated during the financial year for usage and other events (for example site extensions). Estimates are also subject to physical review by 
external advisers.
A number of factors impact on the depreciation of landfill reserves including the available void space, future capital expenditure and 
operating costs. The assumptions are revised as these factors change.
The estimate of gas production at landfill sites post-closure reduces the depreciation of landfill reserves. An assessment is undertaken for 
individual sites of the historic profile of gas production during landfilling activity and the projected generation post-closure according to the 
type of waste contained in the landfill and expected profile of gas production over time.
Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenue at the time of delivery of services. Payments received in advance of services delivered are recorded as 
a liability.
South West Water raises bills and recognises revenue in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established 
by the Periodic Review price-setting process. For water and wastewater customers with water meters, revenue recognised is dependent 
upon the volume supplied including an estimate of the sales value of units supplied between the date of the last meter reading and the 
year-end. Estimated usage is based on historic data, judgement and assumptions.
Viridor estimates income from certain contractual revenue streams based on tonnages, cost and historic data which are dependent on 
agreement with the customer after the delivery of the service. 
Provision for doubtful debts
At the balance sheet date each subsidiary evaluates the collectability of trade receivables and records provisions for doubtful debts based 
on experience including comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write-off history. 
The actual level of debt collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery. As at 31 March 2015 the Group’s current trade 
receivables were £282.5 million, against which £86.8 million had been provided for impairment (note 22). 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those that in the Directors’ view are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a 
full understanding of the Group’s financial performance.

(b) Landfill environmental provisioning has been reassessed £6.7 million lower reflecting lower expected restoration and aftercare costs, 
partly offset by a reduction in discount rate.
(c) A small number of contracts have been assessed as underperforming. On this basis a provision of £11.0 million has been established.
(d) The profitability of a small number of landfill energy sites has been impacted by higher than anticipated site costs and lower than 
expected volumes due to site specific circumstances. As a result, a net exceptional impairment charge of £24.3 million has been 
recognised to write down the carrying value of landfill energy property, plant and equipment. Included in the net charge are impairment 
reversals of £9.2 million.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to include all dilutive potential ordinary 
shares. The Group has two types of dilutive potential ordinary shares – those share options granted to employees where the exercise price 
is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year; and the contingently issuable shares under the 
Group’s Performance and Co-investment Plan and the deferred shares element of the Annual Incentive Bonus Plan, to the extent that the 
performance criteria for vesting of the awards are expected to be met.

more useful comparison on business trends and performance, since deferred tax reflects distortive effects of changes in corporation tax 
rates and the level of long-term capital investment. Earnings per share have been calculated:

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) expected to benefit from that 
business combination. All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment and this is the lowest level at 
which goodwill is monitored and tested.
Impairment testing of goodwill 
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen. 
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment, to which goodwill is allocated, is determined based on value-in-use 
calculations which, under IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”, require the use of base cash flow projections that reflect reasonable and 
supportable assumptions with specific restrictions on the estimates to be used. These include limitations on reflecting cash flows to 
take account of future cost restructuring, or improvement or enhancement of asset performance. Uncommitted projects are excluded. 
Discount rates are required to be derived independently of the Group’s capital structure and reflect management’s prudent estimate of a 
rate that investors would require if they were to choose a similar investment.
The base cash flow projections have been derived by prudently adjusting key assumptions underlying the Group’s detailed budget and 
strategic plan projections. These cover a period of seven years and are prepared as part of the annual planning cycle. This period is 
believed to lead to a more realistic estimate of future cash flows than five years. 
These plans are based on detailed market-by-market forecasts of projected volumes, prices and costs for each business activity. 
These forecasts reflect, on an individual operational site basis, numerous assumptions and estimates. The key assumptions include 
anticipated changes in market size and volumes; recyclate prices; energy selling prices; gate fees; the level of future landfill tax; and cost 
inflation. Management has determined the value assigned to each assumption based on historical experience, market surveys, industry 
analysis and current legislation. For business activities with an indefinite life a terminal growth rate has been used. 
The key assumptions which management has applied to the cash flow projections include:
Assumption Basis for assumption
Discount rate 
Pre-tax discount rates used range from 7.5% to 10%  
(across the segment’s business activities).
Discount rates have been determined based on an estimate of the 
waste management segment’s weighted average cost of capital 
adjusted for the different risk profiles of the segment’s business 
activities to the extent that the cash flows have not already been 
adjusted. Investments in joint ventures reflect an expected equity 
return only.
Long-term growth rates
0.5% applied to overheads beyond the period of the 
detailed projections.
2.5% applied to other cash flows beyond the period  
of the detailed projections.
Ongoing efficiencies and benefits from economies of scale.
Based on forecasts of growth in waste management markets and the 
UK economy.
Using management’s cash flow projections on the above basis, the value-in-use of the waste management business exceeds the carrying 
amount by £561 million (‘headroom’). The headroom relative to the Company’s investment in the waste management business (note 20) is 
£320 million. A reasonably possible change, with all other variables held constant, of a 0.5% increase in discount rates, or a 1.5% increase 
in long-term real growth rate of overheads, or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate of other cash flows, or a 5.0% reduction in 
overall net cash flows would reduce headroom by £151 million, £46 million, £49 million and £108 million respectively.

Service concession arrangements, once available for use, are amortised over the useful life of each contract. The average remaining life, 
once in use, is 25 years (2014 25 years).
Customer contracts are amortised over the useful life of each contract which at acquisition ranged between two and 15 years. 
The weighted average remaining life is three years (2014 four years).
Patents are amortised over their estimated useful lives which at acquisition was 13 years. The average remaining life is three years (2014 
four years).
The carrying values of other intangible assets are reviewed annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying 
amounts may not be fully recoverable.
The principal assumptions used to assess impairment are set out in note 17.
During the year borrowing costs of £1.4 million have been capitalised on qualifying assets, at an average rate of 4.1%.

statements Impairment testing for property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets
Property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when any indicators of impairment are 
identified. Most of the individual assets do not generate independent cash flows and as a result, for the purposes of impairment reviews, 
the assets are grouped into cash generating units (CGUs). The CGUs of the waste management segment comprise individual sites which 
constitute the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or group of assets. 
The carrying value of these individual sites is compared to the recoverable amount of the CGUs, which is based predominantly on 
value-in-use. Value-in-use calculations use the same base cash flow projections used for testing goodwill (note 15) and are derived by 
adjusting the Group’s detailed budget and strategic plan which cover a period of seven years and are approved by the Board annually. The 
key assumptions are the same as for the impairment testing of goodwill (note 15). 
For certain CGUs the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the fair value less costs to sell of the underlying assets using 
external and internal valuations of property and equipment and management’s estimate of disposal costs.
Net impairment charges of £24.3 million (2014 £42.9 million) for property, plant and equipment has been identified in the waste 
management segment relating to CGUs in landfill activities, reflecting higher than anticipated landfill energy site costs and lower than 
expected volumes due to site specific circumstances. Included in the net charge are impairment reversals of £9.2 million. 
The total recoverable value of CGUs impaired in the year, including cash flows from both assets and liabilities, is below zero (2014 below 
zero). The total recoverable value of CGUs where there has been an impairment reversal in the year is £16.0 million.
For the purposes of disclosing the results of the impairment review the CGUs have been grouped together by business activity as each 
CGU within a business activity exhibits a similar risk profile. The key assumptions in the Group’s detailed budget and strategic plan are the 
same as those used for testing goodwill (note 15). The assumptions applied to these cash flow projections are:
Assumption Basis for assumption
Discount rate
The pre-tax discount rate used for landfill is 9%. Discount rates have been determined based on an estimate of the waste 
management segment’s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the 
different risk profiles of the segment’s business activities to the extent that the 
cash flows have not already been adjusted. 
Long-term growth rates
0.5% applied to overheads beyond the period of the 
detailed projections.
2.5% applied to other cash flows beyond the strategic plan 
period up to the end of the life of the assets on projected 
volumes. 
Ongoing efficiencies and benefits from economies of scale.  
Based on forecasts of growth in waste management markets and  
the UK economy.
Using management cash flow projections, a 1.5% increase in real long-term growth rate of overheads, or a 0.5% increase in discount rate, 
or a 0.5% reduction in the long-term growth rate of other cash flows, or a 5% reduction in overall net cash flows, with all other variables 
held constant, would not have a material impact on the impairment charge.

Trade receivables include accrued income relating to customers with water metered budget plans.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair value.
There is no concentration of credit risk in trade receivables. The Group has a large number of customers who are dispersed and there is 
no significant loss on trade receivables expected that has not been provided for. The Group has created IAS 39 portfolio provisions, but 
cannot practicably identify which receivables specifically are the ones impaired. It is Group policy to consider a receivable in a portfolio to 
which an impairment has been allocated on a collective basis as not being impaired for the purposes of IFRS 7 disclosures until the loss 
can be specifically identified with the receivable.

The fair value of hedging derivatives is split between current and non-current assets or liabilities based on the maturity of the cash flows.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from hedging relationships was £nil (2014 £nil).
Interest rate swaps, primarily cash flow hedges, and fixed rate borrowings are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure 
at least 50% of Group net borrowings are at fixed rate. At 31 March 2015 72% of Group net borrowings were at fixed rate (2014 62%).
At 31 March 2015 the Group had interest rate swaps to swap from floating to fixed rate and hedge financial liabilities with a notional value 
of £1,103.0 million and a weighted average maturity of 4.4 years (2014 £1,563.0 million, with 3.7 years). The weighted average interest rate 
of the swaps for their nominal amount was 2.1% (2014 2.7%).

Viridor Group Governance Financial 
statements Derivatives deemed held for trading includes a derivative with a fair value of £3.6 million (2014 £2.4 million) which does not qualify for 
hedge accounting under IAS 39, but is designed to improve the Group’s overall interest rate performance. This derivative arises from a 
combination of non-derivative instruments entered into during the year that when combined result in a derivative instrument. Included in 
the derivative instrument is a £200 million floating interest rate-linked loan from Peninsula MB Limited to the Company and a fixed rate 
£200 million obligation due to the Company from Peninsula MB Limited. This derivative has an expected life of 12 years. 
Valuation hierarchy
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:
• quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1) 
•  inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or 
indirectly (that is, derived from prices) (level 2)
• inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) (level 3).
The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (level 2, for example over-the-counter derivatives) is determined by 
using valuation techniques. A variety of methods and assumptions are used based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet 
date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated 
discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The Group’s financial instruments are valued principally using level 2 measures:

rates. The fair value of such financial instruments is not significantly sensitive to unobservable inputs.

Included above are accrued finance charges arising on obligations under finance leases totalling £132.8 million (2014 £127.3 million), of 
which £2.9 million (2014 £6.9 million) is repayable within one year.
Within obligations under finance leases, South West Water Limited has utilised finance lease facilities of £180.0 million for certain water 
and wastewater business property, plant and equipment which are secured by bank letters of credit issued by United Kingdom financial 
institutions. These letters of credit, covering the full period of the finance leases, are renewable between the financial institutions and South 
West Water Limited at five-yearly intervals, the next being March 2016.
The period for repayment of certain leases includes an agreement to deposit with the lessor group amounts equal to the difference 
between the original and revised payments due. The accumulated deposits, £70.7 million at 31 March 2015 (2014 £60.1 million), are being 
held to settle the lease liability over the period from the end of the original lease term. The deposits are subject to a registered charge given 
as security to the lessor for the balance outstanding.
The period for repayment of certain other existing leases includes an agreement to deposit with the lessor group amounts equal to the 
difference between the original and revised payments due. The accumulated deposits, £115.8 million at 31 March 2015 (2014 £104.0 million), 
are being held to settle the lease liability at the end of the lease term, subject to rights to release by negotiation with the lessor.

During the year the Group operated a number of defined benefit pension schemes and also a defined contribution section within the 
main scheme.
The assets of the Group’s pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds. The trustees of the funds are required to act 
in the best interest of the funds’ beneficiaries. The appointment of schemes’ trustees is determined by the schemes’ trust documentation. 
The Group has a policy for the main fund that one-half of all trustees, other than the Chairman, are nominated by members of the 
schemes, including pensioners.
Defined contribution schemes
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes were £5.4 million (2014 £4.5 million).

Assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions at 31 March were:
2015 
%
2014 
%
2013 
%
Rate of increase in pensionable pay 2.9 3.4 3.4
Rate of increase for current and future pensions 2.9 3.2 3.4
Rate used to discount schemes’ liabilities and expected return on schemes’ assets 3.35 4.30 4.35
Inflation 2.9 3.4 3.4
Mortality
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and 
experience. The mortality assumption uses a scheme-specific calculation based on CMI 2013 actuarial tables with an allowance for future 
longevity improvement.
The average life expectancy in years of a member having retired at age 62 on the balance sheet date is projected as:
2015 2014 2013
Male 25.0 24.9 25.0
Female 27.2 27.1 27.0
The average life expectancy in years of a future pensioner retiring at age 62, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is projected as:
2015 2014 2013
Male 26.4 26.3 25.9
Female 29.5 29.4 28.3

Through its defined benefit pension plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:
Asset volatility
The liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; 
if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold a significant 
proportion of growth assets (equities and diversified growth funds) which are expected to 
outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, but can give rise to volatility and risk in the 
short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored such that it is suitable with the 
schemes’ long-term objectives.
Changes in bond yields
A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the schemes’ liabilities, although this will be 
partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes’ bond holdings.
Inflation risk
The majority of the schemes’ benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will 
lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are 
in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected 
by or loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase 
the deficit.
Life expectancy
The majority of the schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, 
so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities.

142 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report 2015
Financial statements and shareholder information In conjunction with its investment advisers, the trustees have structured the schemes’ investments with the objective of balancing 
investment returns and levels of risk. The asset allocation for the main scheme has three principal elements:
• holdings of cash funds and bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and reflects market movements 
in the schemes’ liabilities
•  a proportion of equities, with fund managers having freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns
•  investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes’ assets in alternative asset classes which give the potential for diversification 
(currently property and diversified growth).
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation 
method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected increases in pensionable pay.
The future cash flows arising from the payment of the defined benefits are expected to be settled primarily in the period between 15 and 
40 years from the balance sheet date.
The last triennial actuarial valuation of the principal defined benefit scheme was at 31 March 2013. The Group has made a deficit recovery 
contribution of £11.0 million to the main scheme during the year (2014 £nil million). The Group monitors funding levels on an annual basis 
and expects to pay total contributions of around £12 million during the year ended 31 March 2016.
31. Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 20% (2014 20%).
Movements on deferred tax were:

(Credited)/ charged to equity (6.1) 16.7 (1.6) 0.7
Liabilities/(assets) at 31 March 235.9 227.1 (3.0) (1.3)
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable 
that these assets will be recovered.
The majority of the Group’s deferred tax liability is expected to be recovered over more than one year.
The majority of the Company’s deferred tax asset is expected to be recovered over more than one year.
All deferred tax assets and liabilities within the same jurisdiction are offset.
The deferred tax balance was reduced in 2014 by a credit of £34.1 million to recognise the changes in the rate of corporation tax enacted 
on 17 July 2013 to reduce the rate from 1 April 2014 from 23% to 20%. From 1 April 2014 2% of the reduction took place, followed by a 
further 1% reduction from 1 April 2015.

Environmental and landfill restoration provisions are incurred during the operational life of each landfill site and for a considerable period 
thereafter. The period of aftercare post-closure and the level of costs expected are uncertain and can vary significantly from site to site. Key 
factors are the type of waste, the speed at which it decomposes, the volume of leachate requiring treatment and regulatory requirements 
specific to the site. Environmental and landfill restoration provisions are expected to be substantially utilised throughout the operational 
life of a site and for landfill sites within 60 years of closure. The provisions have been established assuming current waste management 
technology based upon estimated costs at future prices which have been discounted to present value.
Other provisions comprise principally of underperforming contracts and restructuring provisions. Underperforming contracts are provided 
for at the net present value of the operating losses of the underperforming contracts and are to be utilised over the remaining period of the 
contract to which they relate. The restructuring provision relates principally to severance costs and will be utilised within one year.

Employee share schemes
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share plans for the benefit of employees. Details of each plan are:
i) Sharesave Scheme
An all-employee savings related plan is operated that enables employees, including Executive Directors, to invest up to a maximum of £250 
per month for three or five years. These savings can then be used to buy ordinary shares, at a price set at a 20% discount to the market 
value at the start of the savings period, at the third, fifth or seventh year anniversary of the option being granted. Options expire six months 
following the exercise date and, except for certain specific circumstances such as redundancy, lapse if the employee leaves the Group 
before the option exercise period commences.

Beware of share fraud
The following is taken from the 'Beware of share fraud' leaflet 
produced by the Financial Conduct Authority:
Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure 
investors into scams.
They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or 
non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an 
upfront payment.
While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this 
way you will probably lose your money.
How to avoid share fraud
1. Keep in mind that firms authorised by the Financial Conduct 
Authority (FCA) are unlikely to contact you out of the blue 
with an offer to buy or sell shares.
2. Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person 
and firm contacting you and then end the call.
3. Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk 
to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by 
the FCA.
4. Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, 
copying its website or giving you false contact details.
5. Use the firm’s contact details listed on the Register if you 
want to call it back.
6. Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have 
contact details on the Register or you are told they are out 
of date.
7. Search the FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms at  
www.scamsmart.fca.org.uk.
8. Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised 
firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman 
Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
9. Think about getting independent financial and professional 
advice before you hand over any money.
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
5,000 people contact the Financial Conduct Authority about share 
fraud each year, with victims losing an average of £20,000
Report a scam
If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud 
reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams where you can find out more 
about investment scams.
You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action 
Fraud on 0300 123 2040.

Chairman’s Introduction
Overview
In the UK, the trading momentum 
established during the first half of the 
year continued through the second 
half with the improvement in organic 
growth supplemented by the fine full 
year performances from the businesses 
acquired during the previous year. Of 
particular satisfaction was the manner 
in which the UK businesses responded 
during the final quarter of the year, with 
like for like growth of 3.9%, delivering 
another strong performance on top of 
the impressive result achieved during 
the final quarter of 2013.
On the Continent, when measured 
in local currency, the revenue 
performance from our French business 
was slightly ahead of last year whilst our 
Dutch businesses achieved reasonable 
progress in what continues to be a 
difficult market. The businesses in both 
territories registered an improvement 
in underlying earnings. However, the 
market weakness evident in the first 
half in Switzerland continued during 
the second half resulting in a further 
reduction in annual revenue and profit. 
As was the case during the first half, 
the decline in the Swiss performance 
was sufficient to weaken the collective 
result from our Continental businesses 
which was down quite markedly on the 
previous year.
Whilst the result from our Continental 
businesses in recent years has been 
disappointing, the group’s overall 
result for the year, once again, 
provides further evidence in support 
of the board’s decision to commit to 
additional investment to expand and 
improve our facilities as exemplified 
by the project to extend the Coleshill 
national distribution hub which 
was completed and became fully 
operational in January 2014.
The commitment to investment, along 
with the decision to continue with our 
strategy and maintain our structure, 
has positioned the group in a place 
where it can quickly and profitably 
take advantage of an improvement in 
market activity.
Earnings and dividend
Earnings per share increased by 16.7% 
to 28.6p compared with last year’s 
underlying result of 24.5p mainly as a 
result of the group’s profit before tax 
of £30.3 million, improving by 14.6% on 
last year’s underlying profit before tax 
of £26.4 million.
The board is proposing to increase the 
final dividend by 15.5% from 10.65p to 
12.30p resulting in a total dividend for 
the year of 17.50p, which represents 
an increase of 14.4% on 2013. The final 
dividend, if approved by shareholders 
at the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”), will be paid on 1 July 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at close of 
business on 5 June 2015.
Governance and board
We continue to promote a culture 
of openness and transparency 
and encourage participation and 
contribution from all our board 
members. The board recognises the 
value derived from good governance 
and the setting of high standards 
and the confidence this brings to 
our shareholders, management, 
employees, suppliers and customers.
Employees and shareholders
Once again, our employees’ 
attitude, determination and focused 
contribution have been pivotal to the 
continued success of the group. 
Thank you to all our employees across 
the group for their dedication and hard 
work and our shareholders for their 
insightful observations and continuing 
support.
Dick Peters
Chairman
5 March 2015 
It is pleasing to be able to report that the group  
has made good progress during the year,  
delivering a further increase in revenue and 
improvement in profitability.

Chief Executive’s Review
Our strategy
The group continues to follow a 
strategy focused on developing its 
floorcovering distribution business in 
the UK and Continental Europe and 
improving the all round service offering 
it provides to its customers.
The group’s size and structure provides 
a unique competitive advantage 
allowing it to deliver a range of 
benefits, including continuous product 
development, wide product diversity, 
extensive marketing support and next 
day distribution services, all of which 
are aimed at supporting and enhancing 
its customers’ market position.
The development of the group’s overall 
business is achieved by operating each 
individual business on an autonomous 
basis and encouraging the managers 
of each individual business to develop 
their own individual trading style, 
albeit within a well developed and 
consistently applied framework of 
operational and financial control.
This diverse business structure, 
particularly in the UK, covering the 
retail and commercial sectors, gives 
the group substantial reach across 
floorcovering markets and provides 
suppliers with a flexible channel for the 
sales, marketing and distribution of 
their products.
In addition, the structure has allowed 
the group to be active with a wide 
and diverse product portfolio across 
a significant proportion of the 
floorcovering market and has, to a 
degree, insulated the business from the 
downside risk arising from contracting 
or static markets.
Each individual business is supported 
by the group’s commitment to 
continued investment in people, 
product, marketing, distribution 
facilities, service centres and IT. This 
structural investment, in conjunction 
with the development of the identity of 
each individual business, has enabled 
us to bring together the benefits of a 
market facing culture delivering the 
latest selling, marketing and product 
initiatives with a comprehensive and 
sophisticated logistics operation.
Ultimately, the total investment 
has underpinned the growth and 
performance of each business, thus 
enabling the group to establish itself 
as Europe’s leading floorcovering 
distributor.
Performance
One of the group’s key performance 
objectives is aimed at achieving growth 
in market share. We drive this growth 
by setting each of our individual 
businesses, in conjunction with the 
businesses’ management teams, an 
annual growth parameter, which is 
collectively set to outperform the 
anticipated underlying growth in the 
market.
Once again, it is pleasing to record that 
the growth in UK revenue during 2014, 
as has consistently been the case for a 
number of years, outperformed growth 
in the UK floorcovering market, with the 
like for like growth of 5.9% exceeding 
the estimated market growth of 2.4%.
The increases in like for like revenue 
derived from our residential and 
commercial product in the UK were 
broadly similar, with residential 
up by 5.8% on the previous year 
and commercial up by 6.2%. The 
revenue mix between residential and 
commercial floorcoverings in the UK 
has generally remained at the same 
level for a number of years and 2014 
maintained the balance at 68% and 
32% respectively.
On the Continent, adverse economic 
headwinds continue to influence 
performance and the overall trading 
result has registered further decline 
during the year. However, we still 
believe that more can be made of 
the opportunities to develop each 
individual business notwithstanding 
the market issues in each individual 
territory. On a brighter note, gross 
margins are being protected and costs 
managed diligently. As ever, additional 
revenue would transform the operating 
fortunes of these businesses.
During the year, we have maintained 
our investment in people, marketing, 
infrastructure and the promotion, 
support and development of each 
of our individual business identities. 
We continue to provide extensive 
marketing support to our customers 
and, through our well trained and 
knowledgeable sales teams, seek 
to gain an increasing share of their 
business. In addition, our teams are 
also focused on prospecting for new 
customers and business opportunities.
The group continues to follow a strategy focused on 
developing its floorcovering distribution business in 
the UK and continental Europe and improving the all 
round service offering it provides to its customers.
14 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Investments
Over the five-year period from 2010 to 
2014 we have used the group’s balance 
sheet strength, allied with its positive 
cash flow, to invest £36.2 million in 
property, plant and equipment, with 
a further £18.0 million expenditure 
forecast for 2015 and 2016. This level of 
capital expenditure has been running, 
on average, at a rate of 1.5 times 
depreciation.
The investment in infrastructure has 
been and is aimed at supporting our 
expansion plans, as illustrated by our 
intention to construct a new distribution 
facility in Ipswich, and enables us to 
manage our supply chain and inventory 
requirements more efficiently, as 
demonstrated by the recent extension 
to the Coleshill distribution hub.
Once the Ipswich distribution facility 
is fully operational, the group will 
have a well invested portfolio of four 
national distribution hubs and 14 
regional distribution centres in the UK 
as well as four distribution centres on 
the Continent. These facilities should 
be able to satisfy the group’s capacity 
requirements and growth expectations 
for a number of years and the 
requirement for further investment in 
additional or replacement distribution 
facilities ought to fall away. 
During recent years we have 
supplemented our distribution network 
in the UK with a number of service 
centres with the aim of improving 
customer service by making product 
more readily available. This type of 
investment is particularly helpful for 
customers who prefer to collect their 
product needs as opposed to relying 
on our delivery service.
During the year we continued to 
expand the number of service centres 
we operate across the UK and they now 
number 27. The provision of a customer 
collection point is also offered within 
our distribution centres, thereby 
bringing the number of collection 
points, or trade counters, in the UK 
to 42. There are still some locations 
where we do not currently have a 
presence and that would benefit from 
the opening of a service centre and we 
anticipate expanding our coverage in 
the future, subject to the availability of 
suitable sites.
Acquisitions
We intend to continue to utilise our 
capital resource to augment the 
group’s organic growth with further 
acquisitions. We have a history of 
quickly and successfully integrating 
small bolt-on acquisitions into our 
existing structure, achieving overhead 
synergies and an earnings enhancing 
performance.
During the year we completed the 
acquisition of two small bolt-on 
businesses, one of which, RPS, was 
transferred into our existing distribution 
facility in Nottingham and the other, 
Myttons, has provided us with the 
opportunity to establish a service 
centre in Norwich. During January 2015 
we added another business, Matty’s 
Wholesale Carpets, and integrated its 
operations into our distribution facility 
in Coleshill. Unlike a number of recent 
acquisitions where the businesses 
acquired have been losing market 
position, Matty’s Wholesale Carpets 
has been a very successful business 
and should prove to be immediately 
earnings enhancing.
The acquisitions completed during 
2013 are now operationally integrated 
and contributing an earnings enhancing 
performance to the group’s profitability.
Prospects
The momentum created through 
2014 has continued into January and 
February, where strong like for like 
growth in the corresponding period last 
year has been surpassed.
As we enter March, our UK businesses 
are well placed to take advantage 
of improving market conditions with 
a comprehensive array of product 
launches and marketing initiatives.
Whilst our businesses in Continental 
Europe continue to experience difficult 
markets, we are confident that the 
Group, overall, will achieve further 
progress during the year.

Business Model
Supply chain management
Headlam distributes a wide range of products, 
sourced from a variety of floorcovering suppliers 
located around the globe, to its customer base 
who, in the main, are independent floorcovering 
retailers and contractors.
Robust structure creating value  
for the long term
This structure permits broad access to 
floorcovering markets, allows the group to 
react swiftly to emerging opportunities and 
assists with managing downside risks when 
trading environments are challenging. Whilst 
each business is encouraged to adopt an 
entrepreneurial style, they are operated within 
a well developed and consistently applied 
framework of operational and financial control.
   Read more on how we manage our risks  
(see pages 28 and 29)
Key resources in place
Headlam’s collection of businesses, assembled 
over many years, has allowed the group to 
continually outperform the floorcovering market 
through various economic cycles. This has been 
very evident in recent years when conditions 
have proved to be particularly demanding and 
during which time the group has consistently 
maintained its ability to achieve an increased 
market share.

is operated on an autonomous basis by local management

management teams to develop the individual identity, market 
presence and profitability of the business for which they are 
responsible.

Strong relationships delivering consistent

Essential to the group’s ongoing success are its strong 
relationships with suppliers, which have developed over many 
years, at both senior level and within each of our operating 
businesses. The collaborative effort that exists between our 
senior and individual management teams and suppliers is 
aimed at ensuring that our businesses remain at the forefront of 
all new products introduced into our particular markets.
We have a clear and straightforward business model  
which is aimed at delivering to our customer an enhanced

STRA TEGIC REPORT 23786.04   Proof Two  19-03-15
The principal characteristic of the floorcovering 
market is its maturity and as such, a vast majority of 
transactions relate to refurbishment.
Overview
The principal characteristic of the floorcovering 
market is its maturity and as such, a vast majority 
of transactions relate to refurbishment. Market size 
tends to be dictated by factors relating to consumer 
and business confidence and tend to be underpinned 
by a healthy residential housing market and a buoyant 
economy.
Due to the well documented events which occurred 
during 2008 and the subsequent contraction in the 
UK economy, the UK floorcovering market contracted 
by 20.7% during 2008 to 2011, with a modest recovery 
during 2012 of 1.5%, broadly flat during 2013 and 
estimated further growth of 2.4% during 2014.
How we service the market
The UK operating structure is based on five business 
sectors each aimed at maximising market penetration 
and supporting different aspects of the floorcovering 
market.
Our regional and national multi-product businesses 
provide a comprehensive residential and commercial 
product range and extensive geographical coverage.
The regional commercial businesses focus on strong 
relationships with suppliers and a high level of 
localised service for their customers. 
Our residential specialist businesses supply medium 
to premium residential carpet on a national basis and 
the commercial specialist businesses, which have 
a national presence, provide a range of products 
servicing various aspects of the commercial market.
Our business in France operates from two distribution 
centres and 21 service centres, whereas the 
businesses in Switzerland and the Netherlands each 
operate from a single distribution centre. All five 
businesses on the continent offer an extensive range 
of products providing full national coverage across 
their respective countries.

Financial Review
Revenue
During the year, group revenue increased by £32.2 million to £635.2 million. As shown in the table below, UK 
turnover comfortably outperformed the underlying market, which was estimated to have grown by 2.4%. The 
Continental performance was a story of further contraction, which when translated into sterling amounted to a 
7.3% decline during the year, albeit when measured in constant currency the reduction was less severe at 2.2%.

UK 548,393 509,340 39,053 7.7

Translation Effect (4,757) – (4,757) –
Group 635,242 603,051 32,191 5.3
The UK growth was attributable to a solid like for like performance amounting to 5.9% during the year coupled 
with a contribution from acquisitions, which in total amounted to £14.9 million of which £9.2 million was an 
incremental increase on the previous year.
Gross margin
The group’s gross margin declined during the year from 30.1% to 30.0%. Whilst pricing competition continues 
to be a factor in all our markets, the characteristics of this competitive environment have not changed 
appreciably compared with the prior year. Product mix remains broadly constant from one year to the next and 
the slight decline in the year is more a factor of the Continental European businesses, which collectively enjoy 
a slightly higher margin compared with the UK, contributing less to the 2014 performance compared with 2013.
Expenses
Distribution and administrative expenses increased by £151,000 during the year. However, as illustrated below, 
when the non-underlying items arising in 2013 relating to the impairment of intangible and tangible fixed 
assets, which totalled £5,352,000, are added back, the year on year increase amounts to £5,503,000 or 3.6%.

Expenses for the year ended 31 December 2014 159,078

Less: Non-underlying items (5,352)
Adjusted 2013 expenses 153,575
Year on year increase excluding non-underlying items 5,503
The two key components of the increase were the incremental expenses arising because of the acquisitions, 
which amounted to £1,807,000 and a £4,438,000 rise in employee costs occurring primarily as a result of 
performance related incentive awards. 
UK turnover comfortably outperformed the underlying 
market, which was estimated to have grown by 2.4%.

Operating profit
Operating profit for 2014 increased by 13.7% 
compared with the operating profit for 2013 after 
adjusting for the non-underlying items. The operating 
margin for 2014 increased to 5.1% compared with 
4.6% achieved in the prior year after adjusting for the 
non-underlying items.

2014 operating profit 31,462

Add back: Non-underlying items 5,352
Adjusted 2013 operating profit 27,680
Year on year operating profit increase 
excluding non-underlying items 3,782
Earnings and dividend
Basic earnings per share for 2014 of 28.6p improved 
by 16.7% on the underlying basic earnings of 24.5p 
for 2013. The result was derived from a 14.6% increase 
in profit before tax augmented by a reduction in the 
effective tax rate during the year which reduced from 
23.25% to 21.5%.
Total dividends paid and proposed for 2014 have 
increased by 14.4% from 15.3p to 17.5p. Dividend 
cover remains at just above 1.6 times.
Employee benefits
The liability attaching to employee benefits is as 
follows:
2014  
£000
2013 
£000
Current liabilities 2,933 2,842
Non-current liabilities 18,803 12,780
Total 21,736 15,622
The year on year increase in the deficit of £6,114,000 
represents 39.1% deterioration over the course of 
twelve months. The key driver behind the change 
is the escalation of liabilities in both the UK and 
Swiss defined benefit pension plans which, in both 
arrangements, have been driven by falling bond 
yields.

Financial Review
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operating activities
Net cash flow from operating activities increased 
during the year by £3.2 million from £24.0 million to 
£27.2 million with the contributory factors shown in 
the table below.
£000
2013 net cash flow from operating 
activity 24,027
Operating profit 3,782
Depreciation 115
Profit on asset disposals 147
Share based payments 404
Working capital (1,274)
Interest paid 88
Taxation (13)
Additional pension contributions (83)
27,193
As can be seen from above, the two principal 
contributors to the year on year movement are the 
increase in operating profit of £3.8 million and the 
additional working capital investment of £1.3 million. 
During the year the additional pension contributions 
which fund the UK defined benefit pension plan 
amounted to £3.0 million. Following the triennial 
actuarial valuation of the UK plan at 31 March 2014, 
the additional contributions for 2015 will be £3.0 
million but for 2016 they will fall to £2.1 million and 
thereafter increase annually at a rate of 3.3% until 
further review as part of the triennial valuation in 2017.
Cash flows from investing and financing 
activities
The table below summarises the cash flow 
movements from investing and financing activities 
during the year. Whilst the overall cash outflow from 
the activities was broadly the same in 2013 and 
2014, the difference amounting to £0.5 million, the 
emphasis in the two years was quite different. During 
the year investing activity was considerably reduced 
compared with 2013, giving rise to a positive cash 
flow variance of £9.1 million. However, financing 
activity centred on the reduction of borrowings giving 
rise to an increased cash outflow of £9.6 million.

In isolation, 2014 is an illustration of the group’s 
capacity to reduce its requirement for debt as the 
need for investment in large capital projects comes to 
the end of its current cycle.

Funding and going concern
The group maintains sufficient banking facilities to fund its operations and investments and, as at 31 December 
2014, the utilisation of the group’s total facilities was as shown in the table below. 73.2% of the group’s facilities 
were undrawn.

Having reviewed the group’s resources and a range of likely out-turns, the directors believe there are 
reasonable grounds for stating that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future and it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the group’s financial 
accounts.

Key Performance Indicators
The following measures are used to assess the group’s 
progress towards its medium term strategic objectives.
Like For Like Revenue Growth
Gross Profit Margin
Underlying Operating Profit Margin
Measurement
Like for like revenue growth measures 
changes in revenue in the current 
year compared with the previous year. 
The measure excludes the effects of 
acquisitions and movement in working 
days and currency.
Why
The group’s medium term growth 
objective is to achieve an increase in 
like for like revenue which exceeds the 
growth in the floorcovering market 
in the territories in which it operates, 
thereby maintaining growth in market 
share.
Measurement
The ratio of gross profit to revenue.
Why
Gross profit margin is a primary 
indicator of business performance and 
market competitiveness. A movement in 
gross margin generally reflects a change 
in the business product mix or market 
pricing or a combination of both.
Measurement
Underlying operating profit margin is 
determined by adding back finance 
income and expense and non-
underlying items to profit before tax 
and then measuring as a percentage of 
revenue.
Why
The majority of the group’s operating 
costs are fixed and therefore changes 
in operating profit margin provide a 
measure of operating efficiency and 
the effects of incremental profitability 
arising from an increase in revenues.

Underlying Earnings Per Share 
R
Return on Capital Employed
Credit Taken by UK Customers and  
Receivables Impairment Loss Percentage
Measurement
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated 
by reference to post tax profit divided 
by the weighted average number of 
issued shares during the year.
Underlying EPS is calculated by 
adjusting for non-underlying items.
R  We use this measure as one of the key 
components of executive remuneration – see 
table on pages 55 to 57.
Why
EPS and EPS growth are widely used 
measures of company performance.  
EPS growth forms the basis of the 
group’s current dividend policy since the 
board anticipates dividend growth to be 
broadly in line with the growth in EPS.
Measurement
Return on capital employed is derived 
from underlying operating profit divided 
by the simple average of the net assets 
after adjusting for cash and borrowings 
at the start and end of the year.
Why
Return on capital employed provides 
an indication of whether the group’s 
activities are creating value for its 
shareholders.
Measurement
Credit taken is calculated by reference 
to trade receivables net of impairment 
provisions expressed as a proportion 
of current and prior months’ revenue 
inclusive of VAT. The receivables 
impairment loss percentage is 
calculated by expressing the annual 
impairment loss as a percentage of 
revenue.
Why
These two indicators provide a regular 
check on the financial health of 
independent customers.

Managing our Risk
The group’s business, results and financial condition are 
influenced by a range of risks and uncertainties, a number of 
which remain beyond the control of the board. 
Area of risk Description Potential impact Mitigation
Market demand A significant proportion of the 
group’s revenue arises from trade 
with independent retailers and 
flooring contractors. The activity 
levels within this customer base are 
determined by consumer demand 
created through residential property 
refurbishment or moves, new 
residential housing developments 
and a wide range of commercial 
refurbishment and building 
projects.
Periods of economic recession 
that create reduced consumer 
confidence or contraction in the 
construction industry and changes 
in trends and preferences all have 
the potential to affect market 
activity and demand for products 
supplied by the group. This risk has 
been a feature of the floorcovering 
markets since 2008 in the territories 
where the group has traded. Each 
of these markets has contracted 
significantly and is either exhibiting 
continuing contraction or, in the 
case of the UK, signs of modest 
recovery.
Market activity is monitored daily 
in each individual business and 
collectively at group level. This 
visibility allows prompt response 
to factors adversely affecting 
trading. Furthermore, since the 
group’s principal activities are 
supply and distribution, the group 
has the ability to react quickly 
to market changes. In addition, 
the development of a range of 
regional, national and specialist 
businesses provides the group 
with broad market penetration 
and the capability to manage the 
downside risk arising from a market 
contraction.
Competitor risk The group operates across four 
geographical markets, each of 
which has a number of similar 
trading characteristics. Within 
each market, the group competes 
directly with a variety of regional 
and national distributors and 
manufacturers selling directly to its 
customer base and indirectly with 
multiple retail chains.
The emergence of a competitor 
with a strong business model could 
undermine the group’s growth 
objectives.
The group seeks to sustain its 
competitive position by maintaining 
close relationships with its supplier 
and customer base. Substantial 
and continued investment in 
management and facilities, an 
extensive product offering, a 
knowledgeable selling resource, 
product availability, IT, efficient 
material handling and logistics 
enables the group to continue to 
improve its market position.
Technology The software platform is a vital 
component of the group’s operating 
strategy, underpinning the delivery 
of operational objectives and 
providing the framework for the 
maintenance of financial control. 
Given its importance, any 
prolonged system failure has 
the potential to adversely affect 
business performance.
Each business has its own 
dedicated hardware and failure 
in one will not interrupt another. 
Furthermore, the group operates 
well defined backup procedures 
and has contingency plans in place 
to enable swift recovery from a 
failure of this nature.
28 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The board reviews key risks and controls and, whilst the 
following highlights some of the key risks that have or 
could affect the business, it is not an exhaustive analysis of 
the threats that may affect or influence the conduct of the 
business.
Area of risk Description Potential impact Mitigation
People The group’s ability to deliver 
continued success is very 
dependent upon its people. 
An inadequate pool of suitably 
qualified and talented people can 
disrupt business development and 
undermine the group’s ability to 
deliver sustainable growth.
Recruitment, training and 
development are aimed at ensuring 
the group has suitably skilled and 
qualified people to meet the current 
and future operational needs of 
its businesses. Furthermore, the 
group is committed to creating 
opportunities for individuals to 
progress their careers.
Employee benefits The costs associated with funding 
the group’s defined benefit plans 
could increase due to a decline in 
investment returns and bond yields, 
inflation pressures and increased 
mortality. 
An increasing deficit could result 
in the need to provide increased 
financial support.
As a result of the triennial actuarial 
valuation of the UK plan undertaken 
at 31 March 2011, the group agreed 
to maintain its deficit reduction 
contributions until December 
2015, at which point the plan 
deficit should have been removed. 
However, whilst the finalisation of 
the 2014 valuation is expected to 
be completed soon, the likely hood 
is that a plan deficit will persist, 
albeit at a slightly lower level of 
£10,883,000 and that additional 
contributions will continue over the 
medium term.
Legislation and 
regulation
The group’s operations are 
regulated by a variety of laws and 
regulations, the principal ones 
relating to health and safety, 
the environment, employment, 
commerce, corporate, financial 
reporting and taxation. 
Failure to comply could lead to 
serious civil or criminal proceedings, 
causing disruption to the group’s 
operations and leading to financial 
loss and reputational damage.
The group manages its obligations 
through a framework of set policies 
and procedures and, where 
appropriate, engages the services 
of competent third-party advisers.

Our Responsibilities
With the aim of consistently improving the social, 
environmental and economic issues within our control 
or influence throughout the business and our supply 
network, we are committed to managing the business in a 
socially responsible way. We also recognise that the proper 
management of such matters makes good business sense and 
can result in strategic, commercial and reputational benefits.
Policy
Our policy towards Corporate Social 
Responsibility (“CSR”) is subject 
to periodic review to ensure that it 
continues to meet the needs of the 
markets and communities in which we 
operate. In recognising the importance 
of CSR issues, we seek to encourage 
and facilitate positive management 
behaviour in alignment with the group’s 
business strategy. This includes the 
morale and welfare of our employees, 
the satisfaction of our customers and 
our impact on the environment. 
Social and environmental factors are 
considered by individual businesses 
and at a group level. We manage 
relationships with stakeholders and 
communicate with them through a 
variety of channels. These include the 
AGM, annual and interim reporting and 
announcements through a regulatory 
news service for matters relating to 
trading and the development of the 
business, all of which are available on 
our website at www.headlam.com. 
Additionally, in order to assist with 
their understanding of the business 
and to ensure that the board is aware 
of their views and concerns, meetings 
are held with our major institutional 
shareholders.
People
Equal opportunities
Our policy is that all employees 
should have access to employment 
opportunities, irrespective of age, 
gender, ethnic origin, religion or 
disability. Consideration is given to 
applications for employment, having 
due regard to the particular aptitudes 
and abilities of the applicants and to 
our responsibilities under the Disability 
Discrimination Act. Where practicable, 
subject to the nature of our activities, 
employees who develop a disability 
during employment are given the 
opportunity to retrain for alternative 
employment. Our recruitment, 
training and development processes 
are designed to ensure that we have 
suitably skilled and qualified employees 
to meet the operational needs of the 
business. We also participate in work 
experience placement schemes. We are 
committed to developing the potential 
of our people, offering opportunities 
for employees to develop and grow 
and periodically reviewing succession 
planning processes. Employee turnover 
remains low resulting in a stable 
employee base.
Communications
The continued success of our 
business relies on good relations 
and communications with employees 
and on the provision of a safe and 
environmentally sound workplace, 
which complies with applicable 
laws and regulations, providing 
an environment in which people 
can flourish and succeed. Our 
employees’ wellbeing and professional 
development is a key element 
to recruiting and retaining high-
performing individuals. 
Our people seek to deliver their best 
for the business, which, combined 
with a fair and responsible way of 
doing business, generates a common 
ambition to add value. We expect 
employees to respect confidential 
information, company time and assets, 
and believe in open and honest 
communication, fair treatment and 
equal opportunities, all of which 
support the fundamental principles of 
good governance.
We encourage the involvement and 
participation of employees in matters 
that affect their interests through 
formal and informal meetings, and 
value their communication with 
management, both senior and at the 
business unit. Employees continue 
to be informed on matters affecting 
them and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the 
group. Eligible employees are able to 
benefit from the group’s performance 
through participation in share schemes, 
including a savings-related share 
scheme. Considering it important 
for its employees to make provision 
for their retirement, the group offers 
opportunities for participation in 
retirement plans, also providing death 
in service benefits through a group life 
assurance scheme. 
Training
Employees are encouraged to 
take advantage of our training and 
development opportunities, which 
is an important part of our strategy 
for success. Training is delivered 
through internal resources, a significant 
proportion of which is on a one-to-
one basis, and external providers. In 
2015 we have continued the bespoke 
training programme for our managers 
and sales representatives, further detail 
of which has been provided earlier in 
this Annual Report. 
30 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
We require our employees to act ethically and 
responsibly in accordance with the policies and 
procedures within our employment handbook, which 
covers our policies on ethics, bribery, fraud and 
whistleblowing. Utilising the services of an external 
trainer, continuing professional competence training 
for commercial vehicle drivers was undertaken during 
the year with further training scheduled for 2015.
Our externally sourced driver training team continues 
to deliver the driver Certificate of Professional 
Competence (CPC) to all of our commercial drivers 
ensuring that the statutory requirement of 35 hours’ 
CPC training for every driver by September 2014 
was achieved, a total of 408 drivers each receiving 
seven hours’ training in 2014. Training is facilitated 
using our distribution facilities with course material 
including customer service, health and safety, hazard 
perception, city safe and highway code. The 2015 
training programme is following a similar approach to 
that in 2014 albeit with different subject matter. We 
continue to offer the opportunity for class 2 driver 
training to drivers where changes in business need 
require a heavy goods vehicle to be used.
Health and safety
The health and safety of employees and individuals 
likely to be affected by our business, including 
contractors, customers, staff and members of the 
public where appropriate, is treated with the utmost 
importance. We are committed to developing and 
maintaining a positive and effective health and 
safety culture. It is our policy to seek to ensure that 
the group’s operations are carried out at all times 
in compliance with the relevant health and safety 
guidance in the jurisdictions in which we operate.
Our health and safety policy, which is endorsed by the 
board, is tailored to each of our business operations 
and the circumstances in which they operate. It 
is amended to reflect changes in procedures and 
processes and any modifications to our control and 
inspection procedures. The board receives a detailed 
presentation on health and safety issues, covering 
each trading location, on an annual basis, with interim 
updates as considered necessary. These include 
comments on improvements following inspections of 
the UK businesses undertaken by our advisers. Each 
of the UK businesses receives an updated bespoke 
comprehensive health and safety manual for use

Our Responsibilities
as a source of information, guidance 
and training together with a set of 
compliance documentation at least 
once a year. Each of our businesses 
has a Health and Safety Committee 
comprising representatives from the 
various business departments. These 
meet on a periodic basis and are 
coordinated by the on-site health and 
safety manager. Management teams 
are encouraged to create a supportive 
health and safety culture and recognise 
the value of employee participation.
The report to the board includes our 
businesses in Europe, which operate 
in accordance with the health and 
safety legislation and inspection 
practices in their respective countries. 
Inspections undertaken by our third-
party adviser form the basis on which 
we determine our standards and are 
continually reviewed and improved. 
Additional inspections are undertaken 
where changes to operations have 
occurred or new premises occupied. 
These are complemented by annual 
inspections of racking systems 
carried out by independent externally 
appointed assessors and, in the UK, risk 
inspections undertaken by our insurers 
at several of our businesses.
Health and safety is an important part 
of employee induction, at which time 
we ensure that all employees are aware 
of our policies and of the commitment 
that is expected of them towards 
their safety. Managers, to whom the 
day-to-day responsibility for health 
and safety is delegated and who are 
best placed to monitor and control 
safety, are guided and supported 
by our third-party advisers in risk 
assessment techniques. Job-specific 
training, including periodic refresher 
training, is supported by good practice 
guides which set out the important 
features associated with many aspects 
of the roles and duties undertaken 
by employees. Good practice guides 
are reviewed annually to ensure they 
remain relevant to the business; they 
include an awareness of impending 
changes in relevant legislation and 
other specialist subjects. The local 
business managers with responsibility 
for health and safety have completed 
the Institute of Occupational Safety and 
Health “Managing Safely” course.
Our businesses maintain good 
relationships with health and safety 
and environmental health regulators 
with positive and prompt responses to 
any findings or observations following 
compliance inspections. In 2014 there 
were 9 reportable incidents, compared 
to 18 in 2013, none of which had 
resulted in a serious injury or fatality. All 
reportable accidents are investigated 
and in the minority of instances where 
improvement is required, changes are 
implemented in a timely manner. There 
were no prosecutions for breaches 
of health and safety or enforcement 
actions in the year.
Containment and inspection regimes 
in higher risk areas, such as fuel 
and lubrication stores, compressors 
and fork lift truck battery charging 
areas, are kept under review; fire risk 
protection has been improved, training 
and awareness increased and special 
containers sited at least five metres 
from the main buildings for the storage 
of flammable products. Bespoke 
provision for such aspects of the 
business are incorporated within the 
design of the new distribution facilities.
Environmental
As a wholesale distributor of 
floorcoverings operating from 
distribution facilities in the UK, France, 
Switzerland and the Netherlands, we 
are not a significant consumer of water, 
electricity or gas.
Water
Water consumption arises 
predominantly in respect of employee 
welfare and commercial vehicle 
washing. The majority of our water 
charges are in respect of water 
supplied and used. We encourage our 
drivers to keep the commercial vehicles 
clean and tidy. To assist them, we have 
a combination of jet wash machines 
and, at four of the distribution facilities 
from which a significant number of 
commercial vehicles operate, specialist 
truck washes. Each truck wash utilises 
100% recycled water, helping with 
conservation. 
We seek to reduce charges by 
analysing invoices received in respect 
of water, through the installation 
of water meters and by reducing 
consumption through repair, renewal 
or installation of equipment to improve 
efficiency. 
Our water consumption in 2014 was 
consistent with the 32,660 cubic metres 
consumed in 2013.
Electricity
Electricity consumption is 
predominantly in respect of fork lift 
truck battery charging, the operation 
of specialist cutting tables used to 
cut lengths from full and part rolls 
of broadloom products, associated 
mechanical handling and compressed 
air equipment, office and warehouse 
lighting and office equipment. 
Modern and energy efficient 
construction techniques and products 
are incorporated when we invest in new 
facilities or undertake refurbishment or 
repair works, which are more efficient, 
automatically switching off during 
periods of inactivity. Photovoltaic 
panels, installed on the roof of the 
Coleshill facility during the year, 
are operational and generating an 
estimated 46,000 kWh of electricity. 
Consideration will be given to further 
similar installations following a period 
of evaluation. Future construction 
projects will similarly incorporate 
intelligent lighting systems and, where 
practical, renewable energy solutions. 
During the year we used the improved 
information arising following the 
installation of automated meters to 
seek reductions in consumption.
The actual cost of electricity and gas 
in 2014 amounted to 0.2% of revenue, 
which is the same as in the prior year. 
32 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Gas
Gas is consumed predominantly in respect of office 
heating and very limited localised radiant heating 
above work stations on the cutting tables located 
within the distribution centre. The installation of a 
sophisticated heating control system in the recently 
constructed Coleshill facility has resulted in lower 
consumption. Consideration will be given to installing 
such control systems in other premises if considered 
viable.
Owing to the nature of our business and with our 
proactive approach when planning and developing 
new facilities, we believe that our activities generally 
have a low impact on the environment, with no 
environmental legal or compliance issues arising 
during the year.
Carbon reporting
We are required to report on all the measured 
emissions sources under The Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 
2013. Data has been collected in accordance with the 
Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency 
Scheme. Conversion factors for electricity, gas and

The increases have been incurred in respect of 
volume related factors.
In late March 2014 a trans-shipping facility in 
Aberdeen became operational, facilitating improved 
efficiency in deliveries to the north east of Scotland, 
resulting in reduced fuel costs and, as a consequence, 
lower CO

 emissions.
Commercial and motor vehicles are replaced 
respectively on a five- and three-year basis, in doing 
so improving operational efficiencies and reducing 
operating costs and vehicle emissions. All of our 
commercial vehicles comply with Euro 5 emission 
standards which, when introduced, further reduced 
the levels of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen 
oxide and particulate emissions. Euro 6 will be 
binding for the registration of new commercial and 
motor vehicles from September 2015. Euro 6 more 
than halves the amount of nitrogen oxides that a 
diesel car can emit with a cap of 80mg/km. New 
commercial and motor vehicles delivered to us since 
October 2014 have been compliant with Euro 6 
emission standards. We periodically review our fleet 
requirements to ensure the optimum design to 
maximise capacity and improve aerodynamics. 
Waste
The waste arising from our operations is 
predominantly protective plastic packaging, 
cardboard poles and boxes and wooden pallets. The 
cardboard poles from the centre of full rolls, part rolls 
and cut lengths of carpet and vinyl delivered to our 
customers are later collected and re-used until no 
longer fit for purpose. 
We continue to increase the percentage that we 
recycle baling plastics and cardboard, and stacking 
unwanted pallets for dispatch to specialist re-
processing agents, when it is economic to do so. This 
has reduced the quantity of our waste going to landfill 
sites. Guidance on waste management is issued to 
the managers of the individual businesses to increase 
awareness of the need to control and reduce waste. 
Where possible, wrapping and packing materials are 
sourced from manufacturers using a high proportion 
of recycled materials.

Corporate Governance Report
CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
On behalf of the board, we are pleased to present the 
Corporate Governance Report for the year ended  
31 December 2014.
The stewardship and governance of your company is the responsibility of the board of directors, part of which includes the 
setting of the company’s strategic aims and values. Additionally it oversees the executive management, who carry out the 
operational running of the business, and reports to shareholders on the company’s performance in compliance with the 
revised requirements of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) to make the Annual Report fair, balanced 
and understandable. The company is also required to comply with corporate governance rules contained in the FCA 
Disclosure and Transparency Rules as well as certain related provisions in the Companies Act 2006.
We continue to believe that our board has the diversity and mix of skills, experience, independence and knowledge required 
in order for the company to be able to discharge its responsibilities successfully.
We seek through this report to explain how, through the membership and work of the board and its committees, the 
approach to ensuring board members have an appropriate understanding of the business and how the board considers its 
effectiveness, your company is directed and controlled. The report also explains the executive direction and control and our 
corporate governance structures and procedures which continue to change in response to changes in the rules that are in

Corporate Governance Report
The directors bring strong judgement to the board’s 
deliberations and the size, diversity and balance of skills and 
experience of the board is considered appropriate for the 
requirements of the business.
Board of directors
The board is collectively responsible to shareholders for the proper management and success of the group. Its role is to 
provide entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of control which:
•	 enables risks to be assessed and managed;
•	 sets strategic aims;
•	 ensures that the necessary financial and human resources are in place to meet its objectives and reviews management 
performance;
•	 sets the group’s values and standards; and
•	 ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and others are understood and met.
As at 31 December 2014 the board consisted of two executive directors, Tony Brewer, Group Chief Executive, and Steve 
Wilson, Group Finance Director, and three independent non-executive directors, Dick Peters, Chairman, Mike O’Leary and 
Andrew Eastgate.
The board is supported in its role by the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, all of which have written terms 
of reference, the details of which are set out below.
The directors’ roles and membership of the committees are as set out on pages 36 and 37 in the directors’ biographies. 
The biographies also document each director’s significant other commitments and any changes to these commitments that 
occurred during the year.
Directors’ attendance during the year at board meetings is set out on page 42, and meetings of the Audit, Nominations and 
Remuneration Committees is given in the relevant committee report.
The board considers that it is beneficial for the executive directors to hold an external directorship to broaden their 
experience and normally this would be limited to one company. With effect from 31 January 2014, Steve Wilson was 
appointed a non-executive director of Conviviality Retail Plc.
The board considers the balance achieved between executive and non-executive directors during the year was appropriate 
and effective for the control and direction of the business.
The roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are clearly divided and periodically reviewed by 
the board. Whilst collectively they are responsible for the leadership of the group, the Chairman’s primary responsibility 
is for leading the board and ensuring its effectiveness. The Group Chief Executive is responsible for implementing 
strategy, running the businesses in accordance with the objectives and policies agreed by the board and for the executive 
management of the group.
The Chairman communicates frequently with the non-executive and executive directors, and the non-executive directors 
have the opportunity to meet with and discuss any issues or concerns with the Chairman at any time throughout the year. 
Matters that are not specifically reserved for the board and its committees under their terms of reference or for shareholders 
in general meeting are delegated to the Group Chief Executive.
Through the Nominations Committee, the board ensures that plans are in place for the succession of the executive and non-
executive directors.
40 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The board maintains overall control of the group’s affairs through a schedule of matters reserved for its decision which are 
periodically reviewed. These include, but are not limited to:
•	 setting group strategy; •	 approval of the business objectives and annual plan;
•	 corporate governance; •	 financial reporting and controls;
•	 risk management; •	 acquisitions and disposals;
•	 board composition; •	 authority limits for capital and other expenditure;
•	 succession planning; •	 material treasury matters; and
•	 committee terms of reference; •	 health and safety.
•	 changes to capital structure and dividend policy;
The directors bring strong judgement to the board’s deliberations and the size, diversity and balance of skills and experience 
of the board are considered appropriate for the requirements of the business. The board believes that all three non-executive 
directors are independent of management and free from any business or other relationship that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of independent and objective judgement. In making this determination the board has considered whether 
each director is independent in character and judgement and whether there are relationships or circumstances which are 
likely to, or could, affect the director’s judgement. Mike O’Leary, who served as the Senior Independent Director throughout 
the year, is available to shareholders if they have concerns which are not resolved through the normal channels of the 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director, or for which such contact is inappropriate. The non-executive 
directors do not participate in any bonus, share option or pension scheme of the company. They are initially appointed for a 
three-year term and, subject to review and re-election, can serve up to a maximum of three such terms.
In order to fulfil their duties, procedures are in place for directors to seek both independent advice and the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the board, through the Chairman, on all governance 
matters.
The non-executive directors periodically meet without the Chairman present, and also meet with the Chairman without 
management present.
All directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment by the board. Under the 
articles of association of the company, each of the directors is required to retire by rotation at least once every three years. 
Details of the directors retiring and seeking re-election at the forthcoming AGM are given to shareholders in the Notice of 
AGM.
Board information, induction, training and professional development
The board has a rolling agenda which is regularly updated in respect of specific topics that affect the group including:
•	 governance and best practice guidelines;
•	 risk management;
•	 finance and operational performance;
•	 business development initiatives;
•	 health, safety and environmental matters; and
•	 legal and regulatory developments.

GOVERNANCE 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The board reviews the key activities of the business, receiving papers and presentations from executives and senior 
management generally a week in advance of the meeting. The Company Secretary is responsible to the board in respect of 
board procedures and is available to individual directors. In conjunction with the Chairman, the Company Secretary ensures 
that information distributed to the board is sufficient, clear and accurate, circulated in a timely manner, and is appropriate 
to enable the board to discharge its duties. All directors are equally accountable for the proper stewardship of the group’s 
affairs. However, the non-executive directors have a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the 
executive directors are fully discussed and critically examined. 
This enables the directors to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole, while having 
regard to, among other matters, the interests of employees, the fostering of business relationships with customers, suppliers 
and others, and the impact of the company’s operations on the communities and environment in which the business 
operates.
Board meetings and attendance
The board usually meets nine times a year at times that ensure the latest operating information is available for review and 
sufficient focus can be given to matters under consideration. During the year there is ample opportunity for the Chairman to 
meet with the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present, should this be deemed appropriate. 
In addition, directors have contact between meetings and, on occasions, visit trading locations in order to maintain contact 
with the group’s business. A record of directors’ attendance at board meetings held during the year is set out below and 
committee meeting attendance is given in the relevant committee report.
Tony Brewer 9/9
Stephen Wilson 9/9
Dick Peters 8/9
Mike O’Leary 9/9
Andrew Eastgate 9/9
In addition to the nine principal board meetings held during 2014 there were two meetings which approved the 2014 Interim 
and 2013 Annual Report and Accounts. These meetings are constituted by a committee of the board formed for that sole 
purpose comprising the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, having considered the views of the whole board 
beforehand.
Directors’ interests and indemnity arrangements
At no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contract of significance with the company or any of 
its subsidiary undertakings, other than a third-party indemnity provision between each director and the company, and service 
contracts between each executive director and the company. The company has purchased and maintained throughout the 
year directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors. The directors also have the benefit of the 
indemnity provision contained in the company’s articles of association. This provision extends to include the directors of 
Headlam Group Pension Trustees Limited, a corporate trustee of the company’s occupational pension schemes, in respect 
of liabilities that may attach to them in their capacity as directors of that corporate trustee. These provisions were in force 
throughout the year and are currently in force. Details of directors’ remuneration, service contracts and interests in the shares 
of the company are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Procedures are maintained by the board whereby potential conflicts of interests are reviewed regularly. These procedures 
have been designed so the board may be reasonably assured that any potential situation where a director may have a direct 
or indirect interest which may conflict, or may possibly conflict, with the interests of the company are identified and, where 
appropriate, dealt with in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the company’s articles of association. The board has 
not had to deal with any conflict during the period.
Corporate Governance Report

Induction and training
The induction of newly appointed directors includes background information about the group, directors’ responsibilities, 
board meeting procedures, a number of other governance-related issues and procedures for dealing in company shares. 
A briefing on the general group strategy, including visits to group businesses, is provided by the Group Chief Executive. 
Training and development in the year took various forms, including visits to group businesses and attendance at courses 
run by professional bodies on various commercial and regulatory matters. Directors receive regular updates appropriate 
to the business throughout the year aimed at developing and refreshing their knowledge and capabilities. All directors are 
considered to be suitably qualified, trained and experienced so as to be able to participate fully in the work of the board. To 
assist with the independent conduct of their function and, if required, in connection with their duties, a process is in place for 
the non-executive directors to obtain professional advice at the company’s expense.
Performance evaluation
The Code recommends that an evaluation of the effectiveness of the board and its committees is conducted annually and 
that this process is externally facilitated at least every third year. This year, for the first time, the evaluation process was 
externally facilitated, having been carried out internally in prior years.
The evaluation, conducted by KPMG, involved a questionnaire designed to assess current board processes and procedures, 
its composition, allocation of priorities and management of risk with the aim of assisting the Chairman in framing the future 
focus of the board. 
A report was prepared for the board on its effectiveness, the conclusion of which was that the board was sound, well-rounded 
and very functional and that the board operated effectively. The atmosphere is collegiate but appropriately challenging 
and there are no significant areas of concern. Whilst the report highlighted the quality of information to shareholders, it was 
recognised that improvements could be made. Accordingly, Buchanan’s were appointed to undertake a shareholder audit, 
following evaluation of which they were appointed to undertake financial and investor relations support. The review also 
identified areas for the board to consider, including induction training and development of board members, the balance 
between monitoring past performance and considering the future of the business, focus on the execution of strategy and 
consideration of succession planning, recruitment and culture.
The board is of the opinion that each director continues to make an effective and valuable contribution and demonstrates 
commitment to their role.
Fair, balanced and understandable assessment
In accordance with the Code’s requirement that the board should consider whether the Annual Report and Accounts, taken 
as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, reviews are undertaken by the finance team as part of the year-end process. 
The board receives drafts of the Annual Report and Accounts to allow sufficient time to review and provide an opportunity for 
challenge and discussion, ahead of approving the final documents. In addition, the external auditor reviews the consistency 
between the narrative reporting and financial disclosures.
Communication with shareholders
The company places considerable importance on communication with shareholders. When reporting to shareholders, the 
board aims to present a balanced and understandable assessment of the group’s financial position and prospects, reporting 
twice a year, when its half year and full year results are announced and respectively an interim and annual report is issued 
to shareholders. Additionally as necessary, the company issues a trading update in advance of the interim and final results 
announcements. Further information regarding business developments is available to investors on the group’s website:  
www.headlam.com.
The company has an ongoing programme of dialogue and meetings between the executive directors and institutional 
investors and analysts which cover strategy, trading and market conditions. Contact with the major shareholders is principally 
maintained by the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. During the year a number of meetings were 
held at certain of our businesses with the aim of providing shareholders with increased exposure to our operations and 
management. The Chairman ensures that the views of shareholders are communicated to the board as a whole.

GOVERNANCE 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director have met with the company’s brokers during the year to ensure 
they are aware of the current views of major shareholders and of any material issues they may have. These reports include 
summaries on the market’s reaction to results announcements and the subsequent meetings between management and 
investors. External brokers’ reports on the company are circulated to all directors. Whilst the Senior Independent Director and 
the other non-executive directors are invited to attend presentations to analysts and institutional shareholders, in particular 
the annual and interim results presentations, they did not attend any meetings with shareholders in the year. In February 
2015, Buchanan was appointed financial and investor relations adviser with the objective of improving communication with 
stakeholders. 
Board committees
The board has established Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees to oversee and debate important issues of 
policy and assist in attending to its responsibilities, with terms of reference that each comply with the provisions of the Code 
and are available on written request from the Company Secretary at the registered office or on the company’s website. The 
roles of the established Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees, whose membership is comprised of the three 
independent non-executive directors, with the Group Chief Executive additionally serving on the Nominations Committee, 
are set out below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and was chaired by Andrew Eastgate. The Company 
Secretary acts as secretary to the committee. Dick Peters is a chartered accountant with considerable financial and audit 
experience and, for the purposes of the Code, is considered by the board to be independent and to have recent and 
relevant financial experience.
Further information on the activities of the committee is given in the Audit Committee Report on pages 47 to 52 which 
should be read in conjunction with this report.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and was chaired during the year by  
Mike O’Leary.
It establishes, on behalf of the board, the remuneration policy, approves specific arrangements for the Chairman and the 
executive directors, and reviews and comments upon the proposed arrangements for senior management so as to ensure 
consistency within the overall remuneration policy and group strategy. Further information on the activities of the committee 
is given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 53 to 67 which should be read in conjunction with this report.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report also describes how the principles of the Code are applied in respect of remuneration 
matters and includes a statement on the company’s policy on directors’ and senior managers’ remuneration, benefits, share 
scheme entitlements and pension arrangements. The committee has an agenda linked to events in the group’s financial 
calendar, normally meeting at least twice a year, including meetings before the annual and interim results announcements.
The committee met twice in the year, the three members each attending all meetings, during which it discharged its 
responsibilities as set out in its terms of reference and schedule of business for the year. The Chief Executive may, by 
invitation, attend Remuneration Committee meetings, except when his own remuneration is discussed. During the period 
no director was – and procedures are in place to ensure that no director is – involved in deciding or determining their own 
remuneration. A resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report will be proposed at the AGM.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee is comprised of the three non-executive directors and the Group Chief Executive and was 
chaired during the year by Mike O’Leary.
The committee leads the process for identifying, and makes recommendations to the board on, candidates for appointment 
as directors and Company Secretary, giving full consideration to succession planning and the leadership needs of the 
group. It also makes recommendations to the board on the composition and Chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees. It keeps under review the structure, size and composition of the board, including the balance of skills, 
knowledge, experience and independence of the non-executive directors, and makes recommendations to the board with 
regard to any changes.
Corporate Governance Report
44 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The committee meets when required and met twice in the year, with all members in attendance. Only members of the 
committee are entitled to be present at meetings but other directors may be invited by the committee to attend. The board 
has agreed the procedures to be followed by the committee in making appointments to the various positions on the board 
and as Company Secretary.
The committee has access to such information and advice, both from within the group and externally, at the cost of 
the company, as it deems necessary. This may include the appointment of external executive search consultants, where 
appropriate. No director is involved in any decisions regarding their re-appointment or re-election.
New directors are appointed by the board and, in accordance with the company’s articles of association, they must be 
elected at the next AGM to continue in office. Existing directors retire by rotation in accordance with article 89 of the articles 
of association which requires them to retire from office and, if eligible for re-appointment, stand again at the third AGM at 
which they were appointed or last re-appointed.
Items discussed by the committee during the year to enable it to discharge its duties in accordance with its terms of 
reference included the proposals to re-elect Steve Wilson and Dick Peters under the retirement by rotation provisions. 
The committee, in conjunction with the board, receives updates from the Group Chief Executive on succession and 
development planning for senior positions within the group. Changes to directors’ commitments are reported to the 
committee as they arise and are considered on their individual merits. Appointments to the committee are made by the 
board.
Risk management and internal controls
The board recognises that the management of risk through the application of a consistent process is essential to ensuring 
a robust system of internal control. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the company have been identified in the 
Managing our Risk report on pages 28 and 29.
The group’s risk management processes seek to ensure sustainable development throughout the conduct of its business in a 
way which:
•	 satisfies its customers;
•	 maintains proper relationships with suppliers and contractors;
•	 provides a safe and healthy workplace;
•	 develops environmentally aware processes;
•	 minimises the cost and consumption of increasingly scarce resources; and
•	 maintains a positive relationship with the communities in which it operates.
The systems are designed to meet the group’s particular needs and to manage rather than eliminate risks, by their nature, 
providing reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The measures taken, including 
physical controls, segregation of duties and reviews by management, are considered by the board to provide sufficient and 
objective assurance.
The board maintained its process of hierarchical reporting and review during the year in order to evaluate the effectiveness 
of the group’s systems of financial and non-financial controls. A comprehensive series of operating and financial control 
procedures applying to all businesses has been developed and the group finance team perform monthly reviews to verify 
that the businesses are complying with the prescribed operating and financial control procedures. Additionally, the board 
reviews risk management arrangements and the Audit Committee receives reports from the external auditor on matters 
identified in the course of its statutory audit work.
These procedures provide a documented and auditable trail of accountability, the results of which are periodically reviewed 
for completeness and accuracy. These procedures allow for successive assurances to be given at increasingly higher levels 
of management through to the board. Planned corrective actions are monitored for timely completion. The board has not 
identified any failings or weaknesses, or been advised of any, which it has determined to be significant during the course 
of its review of the system of internal control. There were in addition no changes in the group’s internal controls or financial 
reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the group’s systems of internal control.

A comprehensive planning system includes detailed reviews at all business and formal reviews and approval of annual 
plans by the board. Actual performance is measured on a monthly basis against plan and prior year, including a detailed 
explanation of significant variances. Revenue, gross margin and cash flow are reported on a daily basis against plan and prior 
year. The control procedures operated by the group are designed to ensure complete and accurate accounting for financial 
transactions and to limit the potential exposure to fraud. Guidelines for capital expenditure and investment appraisal include 
annual plans, detailed appraisal and review procedures, authority levels and due diligence requirements when businesses are 
acquired and the acquisition or disposal of a business requiring formal board approval.
These detailed reviews are an important aspect of management reporting in the identification of new and emerging risks. 
An ongoing process of risk management and internal control in accordance with the Code has been in place for the financial 
year under review and up to the date of this report, the careful management of risk considered to be a key activity in 
delivering business opportunities.
The ethos of the group, delegation of responsibility and other control procedures together with accounting policies and 
procedures are communicated through the group and employment handbook, supported by the group’s anti-bribery 
policy. The integrity and competence of personnel is assessed during the recruitment process and monitored throughout 
employment.
The group promotes a high standard of health and safety management at all levels supported by training programmes at 
operating businesses. Group health and safety rules are monitored and audited to promote a high level of awareness and 
commitment, with individual businesses assessed on a periodic basis. Remedial solutions are implemented where necessary, 
action plans and progress being monitored and reported.

Significant issues considered by the committee
After discussion with both management and the external auditor, the committee determined that the key risks of 
misstatement of the group’s financial statements related to:
•	 impairment of goodwill;
•	 impairment of property; and
•	 inventory valuation.
These issues were discussed with management during the year and with the external auditor at the time the committee 
reviewed and agreed the external auditor’s group audit plan and also at the conclusion of the audit of the financial 
statements.
Impairment of goodwill
As more fully explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the group’s principal non-financial assets are grouped into cash 
generating units (“CGUs”) for the purpose of assessing the recoverable amount.
The group’s CGUs represent individual operating businesses, either in the UK or in Continental Europe. As set out in note 12 
to the financial statements, all CGUs to which goodwill is allocated, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS, are tested 
for impairment on an annual basis.
This year, the impairment reviews for the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated did not result in an impairment loss. The review 
in 2013 recognised an impairment loss, details of which are set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
In performing their impairment tests, management determined the recoverable amount of each CGU and compared this 
to the carrying amount. Management reported to the committee the results of its impairment assessment, noting to the 
committee that future cash flows for each CGU had been estimated based on the most up to date business forecasts or 
actual financial results and discounted using discount rates that reflected current market assessments of the time value of 
money and risks specific to the assets. Management highlighted to the committee how they arrived at the key assumptions 
to estimate future cash flows for the CGUs, specifically future growth rates and discount rates.
Management also brought to the attention of the committee the sensitivity analysis to be disclosed in note 12 to the financial 
statements with regard to the recoverable amount of the CGUs’ goodwill.
The committee interrogated management’s key assumptions to understand their impact on the CGUs’ recoverable amounts. 
The committee was satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of CGUs to which 
goodwill is allocated had been appropriately scrutinised and challenged and were sufficiently robust. 
Impairment of property
As set out in note 11 to the financial statements, the carrying value of freehold and long leasehold property in the group’s 
statement of financial position as at 31 December 2014 amounted to £93.4 million.
As set out in note 1 to the financial statements, the group has a policy of formally assessing the market value, using 
independent, external valuation experts, of the UK property portfolio every three years. The valuation performed in 2013 
indicated that the carrying value of the entire portfolio exceeded the market value by £15.2 million. Market value equates to 
fair value as defined by the Valuation – Professional Standards 2014 published by The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Across the portfolio there were circumstances where the market values of individual properties were higher or lower than 
the carrying value, dependent on the condition and location of each individual property. Where the carrying value of a 
property exceeded the market value, management considered this to represent an indicator of impairment and accordingly 
performed an impairment review for each CGU to which those properties belonged. The outcome of the impairment reviews 
indicated that the carrying value of those CGUs was supported by their ongoing value in use, and accordingly, no impairment 
adjustment was required.

The review in 2013 recognised an impairment loss in respect of the Netherlands, details of which are set out in note 4 to the 
financial statements.
In performing their impairment tests, management determined the recoverable amount of each CGU and compared this to 
the carrying amount. Management reported the results of its impairment assessment to the committee, noting that future 
cash flows for each CGU had been estimated based on the most up to date business forecasts or actual financial results and 
discounted using discount rates that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to 
the assets. Management highlighted to the committee how they arrived at the key assumptions to estimate future cash flows 
for the CGUs, specifically future growth rates and discount rates.
The committee interrogated management’s key assumptions to understand their impact on the CGUs’ recoverable amounts. 
The committee was satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining the recoverable amount of the relevant 
CGUs had been appropriately scrutinised, challenged and were sufficiently robust. The committee was further satisfied with 
the impairment disclosures set out in note 4 to the financial statements.
Inventory valuation
As set out in the statement of financial position, inventory amounts to £116.6 million and represents the group’s second-
largest asset class. Inventory is held across a broad and diverse product range which is subject to a risk that changes in 
consumer tastes and demand result in some inventory lines becoming slow-moving or obsolete, such that the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying value.
The committee discussed the group’s management of its inventory position and gave careful consideration to the 
gross carrying value and related provisions. Management explained to the committee that the process of determining 
the appropriate valuation of inventory entailed close monitoring of inventory levels, review of the ageing profile and 
consideration of inventory sold for less than its carrying value. These three measures are reported to senior management on 
a monthly basis by individual businesses. Management use this information to determine the provisions to be made against 
inventory.
The committee reviewed the valuation basis and challenged management’s assumptions. 
Other matters considered by the committee
Valuation of employee benefit liabilities
In the UK, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan, further details of which are set out in note 20 to the financial 
statements. At 31 December 2014, the scheme had assets of £86.9 million and liabilities, measured on an IAS 19 basis, of 
£106.3 million, with a net deficit of £19.4 million.
As set out in note 1 to the financial statements, the plan liabilities are calculated by estimating the amount of benefit that 
employees have earned for their service in current and future periods. This estimation requires making certain assumptions, 
notably in relation to inflation rates, mortality rates and the discount rate to apply to determine present value. The selection 
of these assumptions is subjective and small changes in these assumptions can materially impact the net IAS 19 deficit 
reported in the statement of financial position. The assumptions adopted by management are set out in note 20 to the 
financial statements.
In selecting the assumptions, management took advice from the group’s external actuary and considered the 
appropriateness of this advice in light of the specific circumstances of the UK plan. Management highlighted to the 
committee how they arrived at the key assumptions.
The committee reviewed management’s assumptions and were satisfied that they had been appropriately scrutinised, 
challenged and were robust. The committee also reviewed the sensitivity analysis set out in note 20 to the financial 
statements and consider it to be appropriate.
The committee also considered the views and procedures of the external auditor, which entailed a benchmarking of 
management’s assumptions with the external auditor’s own expectations. 
Audit Committee Report
50 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Misstatements
Management reported to the committee that they were not aware of any material misstatements or immaterial misstatements 
made intentionally to achieve a particular presentation. The external auditor reported to the committee the misstatements 
that they had found in the course of their work and no material amounts remain unadjusted. The committee confirmed that it 
was satisfied that the external auditor had fulfilled their responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and reports from management and consulting, where necessary, with the external 
auditor, the committee was satisfied that the financial statements appropriately addressed the critical judgements and key 
estimates, both in respect to the amounts reported and the disclosures. The committee was also satisfied that the significant 
assumptions used for determining the value of assets and liabilities had been appropriately scrutinised, challenged and were 
sufficiently robust.
Internal audit
In accordance with the Code, the committee has undertaken an assessment of the need for a group internal audit function. 
The committee considers that the group’s control systems and associated procedures are adequate for the business and 
therefore does not currently propose to introduce a group internal audit function. The committee will continue to keep the 
matter under review.
External audit
The committee reviews annually the appointment of the external auditor and, based on the committee’s recommendation, 
the board agreed to recommend to shareholders at the AGM in 2014 the re-appointment of the external auditor for a period 
of one year. The current overall tenure of the external auditor dates from 1992. Any decision to open the external audit to 
tender is taken on the recommendation of the committee. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the company’s 
current choice of external auditor.
Following a review of KPMG’s performance and independence in 2014, including compliance with rules on non-audit services, 
the committee was satisfied with the external auditor’s effectiveness and independence and has recommended to the board 
that KPMG be re-appointed as the company’s external auditor for the year ending 31 December 2015. The committee 
will continue to review the performance of the external auditor on an annual basis and consider their independence and 
objectivity taking into account all appropriate guidelines.
The committee assessed the ongoing effectiveness of the external auditor and audit process on the basis of meetings with 
executive directors. In reviewing the independence of the external auditor, the committee considered a number of factors 
which included the standing, experience and tenure of the external audit partner, the nature and level of services provided by 
the external auditor and confirmation from the external auditor that it had complied with relevant regulatory requirements.
The committee has the specific task of keeping the nature and extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditor 
under review in order to ensure that objectivity and independence are maintained. The external auditor has processes in 
place to ensure independence is maintained when providing non-audit services and has written to the committee confirming 
that, in its opinion, they remain independent within the meaning of the regulation on this matter and their professional 
standards.
In addition, the fees and objectivity of the external auditor were considered by the committee. The committee recognises 
that there are occasions when it is advantageous to use the external auditor to undertake non-audit services, where they are 
best placed to do so. The policy states that non-audit fees paid to the external auditor should not exceed 250% of the audit 
fee, except in the case of significant events. The Chairman of the committee is required to authorise non-audit work above a 
pre-agreed threshold. A breakdown of audit and non-audit fees is provided in note 3 to the financial statements.
The committee has independent access to the external auditor and the external auditor has direct access to the Chairman 
of the committee outside formal committee meetings. At each meeting there is an opportunity for the external auditor to 
discuss matters with the committee without executive management being present.

Audit tender
The committee has reviewed the changes to the Code introduced by the FRC in September 2012 in respect of the Guidance 
to Audit Committees that encourages the external audit contract to be tendered for at least every ten years.
Based on internal assessments of the efficiency and effectiveness of the audit, the committee is satisfied with the quality of 
the work undertaken by the external auditor and to date, has considered a tender process unnecessary.
Furthermore, the committee seeks to balance the benefits of audit personnel continuity with the need to maintain 
independence by agreeing staff rotation policies with the auditor. Whilst KPMG has been an external auditor to the group 
since 1992, audit partner rotation every five years maintains objectivity and independence without the need and expense 
arising from a tender process. The last audit partner rotation occurred during 2011.
The committee recommends that shareholders appoint KPMG LLP as the group’s external auditor, in accordance with 
resolution 5 set out in the Notice of AGM, and authorises the directors to determine their remuneration, as set out in 
resolution 6.
Summary
The committee has concluded, as a result of its work during the year, that it has acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and fulfilled its responsibilities. The Chairman of the committee will be available at the AGM to answer any 
questions on the work of the committee.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
THE CHAIRMAN’S ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear shareholder
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, which sets out the remuneration policy 
for the directors of Headlam and the amounts earned in 
respect of 2014.
As reflected by the voting outcomes at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 May 2014, it is pleasing to report on the 
strong level of support and engagement from shareholders, the resolution seeking approval for the directors’ remuneration 
policy receiving support from over 91% of the votes cast. We consulted with shareholders before finalising the policy and will 
continue to do so as the remuneration policy is reviewed and developed in future years. 
Headlam’s remuneration policy has been designed to incentivise performance through effective and appropriate reward. 
Levels of remuneration must allow the company to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executive managers and link their 
rewards to business performance, aligning their interests with those of shareholders.
Given the continuing challenges of the economic environment, the Committee continues to exercise a responsible approach 
to executive pay, key decisions on executive pay, including increases to salary and bonus payments, being made after 
consideration of similar decisions affecting all employees. There were no general increases to employees’ base salary in 2014, 
which similarly applied to the executive directors. 
The committee is committed to delivering clarity and transparency of reporting whilst continuing its independent role, 
bringing logic and challenge to the process of setting remuneration. As its Chairman, I will be present at the AGM to answer 
any questions.
The committee considered the incentive arrangements that had applied in 2014 when reviewing the appropriateness of the 
remuneration framework for 2015. It noted that on review in 2014, the maximum award in respect of the annual performance 
related bonus scheme was reduced from 150% to 125% of base salary, the relative outperformance required remaining the 
same. Reflecting the trading performance in the year, an award of 102% of base salary was made in respect of the annual 
performance related bonus scheme. 
The maximum award in respect of the long term incentive award was also reduced, from 200% to 75% of base salary. 
Examination of current business strategy and guidelines for executive remuneration led to the conclusion that the existing 
framework remains appropriate. An award was made in the year to the executive directors under the co-investment plan, by 
reference to 25% of base salary.
There have been no increases in directors’ base salary for 2015 and the committee is not proposing any changes in respect of 
the annual bonus or other benefits for 2015. A general increase of 2.5% was, however, made to employees in January 2015.
The committee remains satisfied that overall progress has continued to be delivered and an assessment of progress included 
a review of the 2014 financial statements and took into account the reporting of the auditor to the Audit Committee.
The committee will continue to monitor the appropriateness and effectiveness of its policy with particular regard to 
legislative changes, market developments and business strategy and performance.
Aware of changes in the UK Corporate Governance Code, during 2014 the company adopted malus provision into the 
co-investment plan rules and clawback provisions in respect of variable pay. The committee recognises shareholders’ 
concerns and expectations on executive pay, recent practice demonstrating that the committee approaches such issues with 
appropriate sensitivity.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
The information provided in this part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report is not subject to audit.
Introduction
This report is on the activities of the committee for the year ended 31 December 2014. It sets out the company’s 
remuneration policy and remuneration details for the executive and non-executive directors. It has been prepared in 
accordance with Schedule 8 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 
2008 as amended in August 2013 (“Regulations”).
The report is split into three main areas, these being:
•	 the statement by the Chairman of the committee;
•	 the policy report; and
•	 the annual report on remuneration.
The policy report was subject to a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM and, after receiving positive shareholder 
support, the policy took effect from the conclusion of the AGM. The annual report on remuneration provides details on 
remuneration in the year and includes other information required by the Regulations. It will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the 2015 AGM.
The Companies Act 2006 requires auditors to report to the shareholders on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and to state if, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Regulations. The parts of the annual report on remuneration that are subject to audit are identified as such. The statement by 
the Chairman of the committee and the policy report are not subject to audit.
POLICY REPORT
This part of the report sets out the company’s policies on directors’ remuneration which were adopted by shareholders at 
the 2014 AGM and took effect from the conclusion of the AGM. It will be subject to approval by shareholders by an ordinary 
resolution every three years, or sooner where the policy is revised.
The remuneration policy applied in the current year is that approved at the 2014 AGM under the new requirements. This will 
be adhered to for the next two years, the objectives of which continue to be:
•	 to ensure that the business strategy is supported by the remuneration structure;
•	 to ensure that the remuneration structure motivates the executive directors to succeed and rewards them appropriately 
for their contribution to the attainment of the group’s strategic objectives;
•	 to maintain motivation for future achievement through reward schemes based on performance;
•	 to facilitate the building and retention of a high calibre and focused team;
•	 to align the executive directors’ interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide 
opportunity to build meaningful shareholdings in the company; and
•	 to facilitate effective succession planning.
In order to encourage and reward enhanced business performance and shareholder returns, the committee considers that a 
substantial proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration should be variable and performance related. The committee 
is satisfied that the incentive structure does not raise governance issues by inadvertently motivating or encouraging 
irresponsible or reckless behaviour.
In deciding that the current remuneration strategy remains appropriate for 2015, the committee has taken into account the 
group’s performance over the last year and the current economic environment. The remuneration policy will continue to be 
monitored and reviewed by the committee to ensure that the remuneration structure and associated performance measures 
remain appropriately aligned with the group’s strategic objectives.
The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the executive directors are and will continue to be reviewed annually by the 
committee. When reviewing base salaries, the committee takes account of the current economic climate, challenges facing 
the business and pay environment for employees in general.
54 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The committee is committed to open dialogue and receives periodic feedback from major shareholders and shareholder 
representatives which is considered as part of its annual review of remuneration policy and, if any material changes to the 
remuneration policy are contemplated, the committee would seek the views of major shareholders about these in advance.
The committee considers that in making smaller but more frequent awards under the long term incentive schemes, each 
subject to the attainment of specific performance targets over a three-year period, it further aligns the interests of directors 
with those of shareholders. During the year the committee did not consult with shareholders.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The principles which the company would apply when agreeing the various components of a remuneration package for 
the appointment of a new director would typically be to use the policy detailed in the table above to determine the 
executive directors’ ongoing remuneration package. In determining appropriate remuneration, the committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors including the quantum and nature of remuneration to ensure the arrangements are in the 
best interests of the company and its shareholders.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
58 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Contracts in respect of the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Finance Director are on a rolling 12-month basis. 
These were entered into on 11 October 2005 and are terminable by either the director or the company subject to 12 months’ 
written notice.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements but instead are appointed for an initial period of three years 
by letter of appointment which is terminable by either party subject to one month’s notice, for which no compensation 
is payable. At the end of the initial period, the company discusses with the non-executive director whether they wish to 
renew their appointment and if it is in the best interests of the company for their appointment to be renewed. Such renewal 
would normally be for a further period of three years and subject to the same termination conditions. All appointments and 
subsequent re-appointments are subject to approval by shareholders.
The executive directors’ contracts and non-executive directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
registered office of the company during normal business hours on each business day.
The principles on which the determination of benefits on loss of office will be approached are summarised below.
Provision Treatment on loss of office
Payment in 
lieu of notice
Payments to executive directors upon termination of their contracts will be equal to base salary plus the 
value of core benefits for the duration of the notional notice period. Benefits may include but are not 
limited to legal fees.
Annual bonus Payments to current executive directors upon the company terminating their contracts, other than in 
bad leaver cases such as gross misconduct, dishonesty, bankruptcy or failure to perform duties, will 
be equal to the average performance related bonus calculated by reference to the two immediately 
preceding financial years. The committee will, though, take note of the circumstances of their departure 
and their contribution to the business during the period in question. Any bonus amounts paid, as 
estimated by the committee, will typically be pro-rated for time in service to termination and will, 
subject to performance, be paid at the usual time. Contracts for future appointees will not include 
bonus within the termination provisions.
CIP Any award under the CIP would be determined based on the leaver provisions contained within the 
CIP rules. For good leavers, CIP awards will usually vest at the ordinary vesting point, be subject to 
performance conditions and be pro-rated for time. Good leavers are participants who leave as a result 
of fatality, ill health, injury or disability. In other circumstances CIP awards will lapse upon the cessation of 
employment. The committee retains the discretion to accelerate vesting and to waive pro-rating for time.
Change of 
control
Upon a change of control, incentive awards will usually vest and be subject to performance conditions 
and pro-rated for time. The committee reserves the discretion to waive pro-rating for time.
Mitigation Payments upon the termination of executive directors’ contracts will be equal to base salary and other 
benefits for the duration of the notice period together with the average performance related bonus 
calculated by reference to the immediately preceding financial years. It is the company’ s policy that any 
payments made to a director in the event of termination reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination 
and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, consideration is given to making compensation payments in instalments and is conditional 
on the leaver’s employment and earnings status. Full compensation, due to being a long–standing 
employee of the company, may however be merited in the event of unilateral termination of employment.
External appointments of executive directors
The board believes that experience of other companies’ practices and challenges is valuable both for the personal 
development of its executive directors and for the company. It is therefore the company’s policy to allow each executive 
director to accept one non-executive directorship of another company, provided that there is no conflict of interest, although 
the board retains the discretion to vary this policy. Fees received by executive directors in respect of external non-executive 
appointments are retained by the individual director. Steve Wilson was appointed as a non-executive director of Conviviality 
Retail Plc with effect from 31 January 2014.

Non-salary benefits The taxable value of benefits received in the period. These are car benefit, car fuel 
benefit and private medical insurance.
Performance related pay The amount of performance related bonus received in the period.
Pension related benefits There was no provision.
Share-based incentive schemes The value of CIP awards that vest in respect of the financial period and the value of SAYE 
options granted in the financial period.
Individual elements of remuneration
Base salaries and fees
Base salaries for individual executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee and are set with reference to 
individual performance, experience and responsibilities as well as with reference to similar roles in comparable companies. 
For 2014, there was no increase in executive directors’ base salaries, which was in line with the average salary increase across 
the group.
For 2015, there is similarly no increase to executive directors’ base salary, which is at variance to the 2.5% average salary 
increase across the group.

Performance related pay
Payments are calculated based upon achievement or exceeding a pre-set target for group profit before tax. For 2014, 
executive directors could earn a bonus equivalent to 75% of base salary on attainment of on-target performance which 
increased on a broadly linear basis up to a maximum of 125% of base salary for achieving a performance of 18% or more 
above the target. If actual performance is 90% of the financial target, a bonus of 10% of base salary will be awarded, 
however a bonus is not awarded for performance below 90% of target. Performance targets are set at the challenging levels 
of previous years with performance based upon group profit. The committee considers that the performance targets are 
commercially sensitive and should therefore remain confidential to the company.
Share-based incentive schemes
The committee recognises the importance of share incentives in recruiting and retaining directors and employees, on whose 
performance the success of the company depends. The share incentive arrangements also provide a key link between 
rewards to executive directors and senior executive management and the achievement of a sustained improvement in long 
term financial performance.
Shareholders have approved the following share-based incentive schemes:
•	 Headlam Group Sharesave Scheme 2012
•	 Headlam Group Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2008
•	 Headlam Group Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 2008 (“ESOS”)
•	 Headlam Group Performance Share Plan 2008 (“PSP”)
•	 Headlam Group Co-Investment Plan 2008 (“CIP”)
The committee intend to use the CIP as the principal incentive vehicle for executive directors, with awards being made on 
an annual basis. Whilst awards have been made under the CIP , the committee has not yet implemented either the PSP or 
the ESOS and does not intend to do so during 2015. Details of the schemes will be disclosed in the event of an award being 
made under these schemes or plans.
Headlam Group Sharesave Scheme 2012
Employee share ownership is encouraged and, with the exception of non-executive directors, all employees are eligible to 
participate in the scheme. Options granted under the scheme may not normally be exercisable until the option holder has 
completed their three or five year savings contract, monthly savings currently being a minimum of £5 and a maximum of  
£500. Options may be granted at a price which represents a discount to market price at the date of grant of up to 20%.  
On 8 May 2014, options were granted over 472,330 shares to 353 employees, including the executive directors, for savings 
terms of either three or five years at an option price of 381p per share, representing a 20% discount to the average market 
price of the three days immediately preceding the award.
Headlam Group Co-Investment Plan 2008 (the “CIP”)
Participants may be invited, at the discretion of the committee, to take not less than 15% and up to 37.5% of their annual 
bonus in the form of shares, the number of shares allocated being calculated by reference to the net value of the bonus 
after deduction of income tax and employees’ national insurance. If an annual bonus award is not achieved in any year 
and therefore not available for investment in the CIP , the committee may permit participants to invest alternative funds but 
subject to a maximum of 50% of any bonus paid in the preceding year. In addition, instead of investing a bonus award or 
other funds, the participant may utilise shares already held and previously acquired in the market, however this may only 
apply to awards up to an aggregate value equating to one times base salary.
Participants are granted awards in the form of matching shares. The maximum value of the matching share award is twice 
the value of the shares that would have been acquired with the gross bonus award. It is currently intended that awards will 
be satisfied by the transfer of shares from an employee share trust, such shares having been acquired by the trust on the 
market to the extent required. Subject to the satisfaction in full or part of the relevant performance targets, an award will be 
exercisable between three and ten years after the award date.
Performance targets are measured over a fixed period of three years, beginning not earlier than the year in which an award 
is made, with 80% of the award determined by EPS growth targets and 20% by TSR targets as measured by reference to the 
FTSE Small Cap Index, of which the company was formerly a constituent member.
Directors’ Remuneration Report
62 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
CIP awards made to the executive directors on 1 April 2014 were subject to growth in performance conditions over a three 
year period, 80% in respect of EPS and 20% in respect of TSR. Awards vest on a sliding scale. If EPS growth is less than 3%, 
none of the EPS tranche shall vest, with 50% becoming exercisable if EPS growth over the three-year period is equal to 3%; 
and for 100% of an award to vest, EPS growth must be equal to or exceed 6%, with straight-line vesting between 50% and 
100%. 
With respect to TSR, vesting is determined by reference to the company’s relative position to the FTSE Small Cap indices. 
None of the TSR tranche shall vest if the company is ranked below the median level, with 50% vesting if the company is 
ranked at or immediately above the median level and 100% vesting if the company is ranked within the top quartile, with 
straight-line vesting between 50% and 100%.
The extent to which the CIP award granted in October 2012 will vest will not be determined by the committee until October 
2015.
On 8 May 2014, savings related share options under the Headlam Group Sharesave Scheme 2012 were granted to the 
executive directors. 
No share-based awards were made to the non-executive directors in the year. 
The Remuneration Committee approved amendments to the rules of the Company’s Co-Investment Plan, inserting malus 
(withholding) and clawback (recovery) provisions to take account of changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code in 
effect for financial years beginning on or after 1 October 2014, market practice and corporate governance best practice. In 
accordance with the amendments, malus and clawback may be applied, at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion, until 
the third anniversary of relevant award shares becoming vested matching shares, in circumstances where there has been 
a material misstatement of the Company’s audited financial results, circumstances justifying the summary dismissal of an 
awardholder or where the Remuneration Committee in its reasonable opinion determines that any act or omission of the 
awardholder has caused or is reasonably expected to cause a material injury to the business interests or reputation of the 
Group, or that such action would be appropriate having regard to any other circumstances that involve the Group and/or the 
awardholder.
Dilution
The committee is aware of, and supports, the ABI guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors compliance with these 
requirements. The committee included provisions which limit the number of newly issued shares which can be granted in a 
ten-year period to 10% of the issued share capital under all employee schemes and 5% under the discretionary share plans.
As at the date of this report, the company’s usage of shares against the limits detailed above in respect of the all employee 
schemes was 2% of the issued share capital and in respect of grants under discretionary plans was 0.4% of issued capital. It is 
the committee’s intention that options exercised under the SAYE scheme and the two executive share option schemes will be 
satisfied by shares held in treasury. With regard to the CIP , the committee will instigate market purchases of shares, through 
a trust, taking account of the likelihood of performance targets being met and also potential lapsing of awards because of 
leavers.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 21 to the financial statements.
Pension related benefits
No executive director has received any pension benefit during the current or prior year.
Payments to past directors
No payments were made to past directors in the current or prior year.
Payments for loss of office
No payments were made to directors in the current or prior year.
Statement of directors’ shareholding and share interests (audited)
In order to align their interests with the company’s shareholders, the committee is keen to encourage executive directors to 
increase their shareholdings in the company. An executive director is required to have a beneficial, including family, interest 
in the shares of the company excluding matching share awards granted in respect of the CIP equivalent in value to their 
annual base salary. Newly appointed directors are expected to build their interest over a five-year period. Executive directors’ 
shareholdings throughout the year complied with the shareholding requirement holding in excess of 100% of base salary.

Performance graph
The graph below shows value at 31 December 2014 of £100 invested in the company on 1 January 2009 compared to the 
value of £100 invested in the FTSE Small Cap index, making the assumption that dividends are reinvested to purchase 
additional equity.
The FTSE Small Cap index has been selected as a comparator due to the company formerly being a constituent member 
within the household goods and textiles sector. This allows comparison of the company’s performance against the 
performance of the index as a whole.

Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
The remuneration policy that will be applied in practice in the current year is the same as the policy that has previously been 
approved. There are no significant changes proposed.
Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors’ remuneration
The committee comprises the three independent non-executive directors and met three times during the year, with all 
three members present at each meeting. By invitation, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director may attend 
meetings. No one attending a committee meeting may participate in discussions relating to their own terms and conditions 
of service or remuneration.
The committee is responsible for selecting the framework and policy for executive directors’ remuneration and determining 
the remuneration packages for the executive directors and Chairman. In doing so, it takes note of any major changes in 
employee benefit structures throughout the group and ensures that executive director remuneration practice is consistent 
with any such changes. It is also responsible for monitoring the level and structure of remuneration for senior executive 
management and approving bonus payments.
Committee members regularly attend specialist seminars and events on the subject of remuneration and review data and 
surveys from a variety of published sources with particular reference to the scale and composition of the total remuneration 
packages to executives. No payments were made in the last fiscal year to external consultants for advice or data. The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committee.

Principal activities
The principal activities of the group are wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and distribution of floorcovering 
and certain other ancillary products. The principal activity of the company is that of a holding company and its principal 
trading subsidiaries are listed on page 134. Further details of the group’s activities and future plans are set out in the Chief 
Executive’s Review on pages 14 to 15.
Results and dividends
The results for the year and financial position at 31 December 2014 are shown in the Consolidated Income Statement on 
page 81 and Statements of Financial Position on page 83.
An interim dividend of 5.20p per share (2013: 4.65p) was paid on 2 January 2015 to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 5 December 2014. The directors propose a final dividend of 12.30p per ordinary share (2013: 10.65p), to be 
paid on 1 July 2015 to shareholders on the register of members at the close of business on 5 June 2015, the associated ex-
dividend date being 4 June 2015.
This would bring the total dividend for the year to 17.50p per ordinary share (2013: 15.30p). The payment of the final dividend 
is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).
Directors and officers indemnity insurance
The articles entitle the directors of the company, to the extent permitted by the Companies Act 2006, to be indemnified out 
of the assets of the company in the event that they suffer any expenses in connection with certain proceedings relating to the 
execution of their duties as directors of the company. In addition, and in common with many other companies, the company 
has insurance in favour of its directors and officers in respect of certain losses or liabilities to which they may be exposed due 
to their office.
Directors’ conflict of interests
No director had, at any time during the period under review, any interests in any contract with the company or any of its 
subsidiaries, a position which was unchanged at 5 March 2015.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors shall be not less than three and not more than eight in number, although the company may by ordinary 
resolution vary these numbers. Directors may be appointed by the company by ordinary resolution or by the board, a director 
appointed by the board holding office only until the next AGM of the company after their appointment, at which they are 
then eligible to stand for election.
There were no changes to the board in the year and no other person has acted as a director of the company during the year. 
The company’s Articles of Association (“articles”) give directors power to appoint and replace directors. They also provide 
that each director shall retire from office and shall be eligible for re-appointment at the third AGM after the general meeting 
at which they were appointed or last re-appointed.
Accordingly, Steve Wilson and Dick Peters, who both retire by rotation, and being eligible, offer themselves for re-election 
at the forthcoming AGM. In proposing their re-election, the board confirms to shareholders that following evaluation, each 
of these individuals’ performance continues to be effective and they have expressed a willingness to continue in their roles. 
The company does not seek to comply with the provision in the UK Corporate Governance Code which requires the annual 
re-election of all directors.
The directors propose a final dividend of 12.30p per ordinary 
share to be paid to shareholders on 1 July 2015.

Change of control
The company has entered into certain agreements that may take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of 
the company following a takeover bid. The significant agreements in this respect are the group’s term loan and certain 
of its employee share schemes. The group’s term loan facilities include a provision such that, in the event of a change of 
control, the lender may cancel all or any part of the facility and/or declare that all amounts outstanding under the facility are 
immediately due and payable by the company.
Outstanding options granted under the SAYE scheme may be exercised within a period of six months from a change of 
control of the company following a takeover taking place.
Matching share awards granted under the 2008 CIP may, proportionate to the performance period, vest within a period of six 
months from a change of control of the company. At the end of such period, awards will lapse and cease to be exercisable to 
the extent not exercised.
Details regarding directors’ service agreements are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
Fixed assets
A consideration of the market value of the group’s tangible fixed assets is detailed in note 1 of the financial statements.
Acquisitions
Details of acquisitions made in the year are set out in note 24.
Employees
The group recognises the value of its employees and seeks to create an energetic, dynamic and responsive environment in 
which to work. The company maintains a policy of employing the best candidates available in every position, regardless of 
gender, ethnic group or background, and is committed to fair and equal treatment. It places considerable importance on 
communications with employees which take place at many levels through the organisation and by a variety of means on both 
a formal and informal level.
Reward is linked to business plans and targets, thereby giving employees the opportunity to share in the financial success of 
the group. In keeping with the structure of the business, this policy is applied locally, and as a result, staff of all levels regularly 
benefit from achieving local targets.

Where existing employees become disabled, it is the group’s policy, wherever practicable, to provide continuing employment 
under normal terms and conditions and to provide training, career development and promotion wherever appropriate, 
and the group gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment from disabled persons. Further details of 
arrangements relating to employees are described in Our Responsibilities on pages 30 to 33, and the average number of 
employees and their remuneration are shown in note 5 to the financial statements.
The company has communicated an internally operated whistleblowing policy and procedure to employees. 
The policy enables them to report any concerns on matters affecting the group or their employment without fear of 
recrimination, and reduces the risk of malpractice taking place and remaining unreported. In addition, the group does not 
tolerate matters of discrimination or harassment and bullying, and policies and procedures are in place for reporting and 
dealing with these matters.
Employees are encouraged to own shares in the company and the group operates an HMRC Approved Savings Related 
Share Option Scheme (SAYE). Those employees who choose to take up the option to purchase shares in the company may 
enter into a savings arrangement for either a three- or five-year period, with the option price determined by reference to 
the share price at the date of grant. On exercise the shares are purchased by the employee free of income tax and national 
insurance although capital gains tax rules apply.
The company considers that diversity, including gender diversity, is essential to good business and measures are in place 
to ensure all appointments are made on merit. Currently there are no female directors out of a total of five board members. 
Without seeking to set a specific goal for female representation on the board, the company is committed to maintain 
diversity, including gender diversity, appropriate to and reflecting the nature and strategic aims of the company. This similarly 
applies to women in leadership positions in the company.
As at 31 December 2014 we had 2,192 employees of which 18% are female. The significant majority of our employees work 
regular full time hours with a minority working flexible hours.

Charitable contributions 
Charitable donations made during the year in support of charitable causes in the local communities in which the group 
operates, nationally and those of interest to employees amounted to £32,323 (2013: £36,722). In addition, employees

Subject to the provisions of the articles and the Companies Acts, shares may be issued with such rights or restrictions as the 
company may by ordinary resolution determine or, if the company has not so determined, as the directors may decide. There 
are however no restrictions on the transfer of securities in the company, except that certain restrictions may from time to time 
be imposed by law or regulation, for example, insider trading laws, and pursuant to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority (the Listing Rules), whereby certain employees require the approval of the company to deal in the company’s 
shares.
The company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 
AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and Accounts and the group and parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under 
that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and 
applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis. 
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each 
of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: 
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
•	 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU; and 
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the 
parent company will continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent 
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and 
enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They have general responsibility for 
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and 
other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations. 
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the 
company’s website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts and 
the financial statements 
Each of the directors of Headlam Group plc confirms that to the best of his knowledge: 
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards and contained in this 
Annual Report and Accounts, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
•	 the Strategic Report, included in this Annual Report and Accounts, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and 
•	 the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Independent Auditor’s Report
TO THE MEMBERS OF HEADLAM GROUP PLC ONLY
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Headlam Group Plc for the year ended 31 December 2014 set out on pages 81 
to 133. In our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2014 and of the group’s profit for the year then ended; 
•	 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•	 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows:
Carrying amount of goodwill (£10.0 million): 
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 (accounting policy) and pages 98 and 104 (financial disclosures).
•	 The risk – The determination of the recoverable amount of goodwill is a key judgement area as small changes in 
assumptions, notably in respect of the 2015 cash flow forecasts (e.g. forecast sales volume and gross profit margins), 
forecast growth and discount rates, can result in materially different outcomes. This is particularly true of the goodwill 
allocated to the Belcolor AG CGU in Switzerland where macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the removal 
of the fixed exchange rate between the Swiss Franc and the Euro, could continue to adversely affect the performance and 
competitiveness of the business going forward resulting in an impairment of goodwill.
•	 Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others, critically assessing the key assumptions 
applied by the group in determining the recoverable amounts of each cash-generating unit (CGU) and testing the 
integrity of the group’s discounted cash flow model. In particular, we evaluated the appropriateness and year-on-year 
consistency of the underlying assumptions used in determining the cash flows; we considered the appropriateness of 
the growth assumptions applied, compared forecast cash flows to those currently being achieved by the CGUs, and 
challenged the group’s justification for using any cash flows in their forecast that were higher than our expectations based 
on current levels adjusted for known or probable changes in business environment. We used our own valuation specialist 
to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rates applied to the CGUs in the UK and Switzerland. We 
performed our own sensitivity analysis, including assessing the effect of a reasonably possible reduction in growth rates 
and forecast cash flows. We also considered whether the group’s disclosures regarding the sensitivity of the outcome of 
the impairment review to changes in key assumptions appropriately reflected the subjectivity in the valuation. 
Carrying amount of freehold property (£88.1 million): 
Refer to page 49 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 (accounting policy) and pages 98 and 102 (financial disclosures).
•	 The risk – The group holds a number of freehold properties which are used for trading purposes (as distribution 
branches) in the UK and in Continental Europe. The carrying amount of the freehold property represents original cost 
less accumulated depreciation. The aggregate carrying value of the property portfolio exceeds its current market value 
indicating that there is a risk that the carrying amount of the property may be impaired. 
•	 Our response – Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing the carrying value of the group’s freehold 
properties to recent external market valuations prepared for the group by an independent expert. We used our own 
valuation specialist to assist us in evaluating the external market valuations, including assessing whether the most recent 
valuation remains an appropriate reflection of year end market value. Where the carrying amount of a property exceeded 
the external market valuation we assessed the directors’ estimate of the value to be recovered from the ongoing use 
of the property within the cash-generating unit to which it belongs, including testing the integrity of the model used to 
determine its value in use. We evaluated the appropriateness and year-on-year consistency of the underlying assumptions 
used in determining the cash flows; we considered the appropriateness of the growth assumptions applied and 
compared the forecast cash flows to those currently being achieved by the CGUs. We used our own valuation specialist 
to assist us in evaluating the discount rates applied. We also performed break even analysis in relation to key assumptions 
and considered whether the group’s disclosures regarding the outcome of the impairment review were appropriate.
78 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Carrying amount of inventory (£116.6 million): 
Refer to page 50 (Audit Committee Report), page 91 (accounting policy) and page 108 (financial disclosures).
•	 The risk – The group holds a significant amount of inventory across a broad and diverse product range which is subject 
to a risk that changes in consumer tastes and demand could result in some products becoming slow-moving or obsolete, 
such that they could not be sold or could only be sold for sales prices that are less than the current carrying value. This 
means there is inherent subjectivity and estimation required in determining the level of inventory provision required. 
•	 Our response – Our audit procedures in this area included, among others, assessing the adequacy of the group’s 
provisions against inventory. We evaluated the appropriateness of the group’s assumptions used in determining the 
provision by considering the carrying amount and ageing profile of inventory as well as the historic value of inventory sold 
at a loss or written off. We used our own IT specialist to perform data analytics to determine the accuracy of the ageing 
profile of inventory by extracting data from the group’s accounting system and reproducing the aged inventory report. 
We also considered the adequacy of the group’s disclosures about the degree of estimation involved in arriving at the 
provision. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.8 million (2013: £1.9 million), determined with 
reference to a benchmark of group profit before taxation (of which it represents 5.9% (2013: 8.9%)). The prior year materiality 
represented a higher percentage of group profit before tax as materiality for that year was calculated by reference to 
underlying group profit before tax, which was before a significant, non-recurring, impairment charge.
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected misstatements exceeding £90,000, in addition to other 
identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
Of the group’s 11 reporting components, we subjected five to audits for group reporting purposes. These audits covered 
98% of group revenue, 98% of group profit before taxation and 94% of group total assets. The group audit team instructed 
component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information 
to be reported back. The group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £0.2 million to  
£1.4 million, having regard to the size and risk profile of the group across the components. 
The group audit team visited 15 locations in the UK and France. Telephone conference meetings were also held with the 
component auditors in Switzerland. At these visits and meetings, the findings reported to the group audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group audit team was then performed by the component 
auditor.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified
In our opinion: 
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; 
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and 
•	 the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 45 and 46 with respect to internal control 
and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures is consistent 
with the financial statements.

been received from branches not visited by us; or 
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Reporting entity
Headlam Group plc (the “company”) is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Statement of compliance
Both the company’s financial statements and the group’s financial statements have been prepared and approved by the 
directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“adopted IFRS”). On 
publishing the company’s financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the company is taking 
advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related 
notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The company and group financial statements were authorised for issuance on 5 March 2015.
Basis of preparation
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements of the company and the financial 
statements of the group are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all years presented, unless 
otherwise stated.
Judgements made by the directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial 
statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed below.
(a) Measurement convention
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the company’s functional currency. All financial 
information presented in pounds sterling has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
The company and group financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis with the exception of derivative 
financial instruments and pension scheme assets, both of which are stated at fair value. Non-current assets held for sale are 
stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In determining the appropriate basis of preparation 
of the financial statements the directors are required to consider whether the group can continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future.
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Chairman’s Statement on page 4 and Chief Executive’s Review on pages 14 and 15. 
The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial 
Review on pages 22 to 25. In addition, note 23 to the financial statements includes the group’s objectives, policies and 
processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through its banking facilities. The group’s long term banking 
arrangements run to March 2017; its level of committed funds are £40 million. The group also has short term uncommitted 
facilities at £35 million, which are renewable on an annual basis. 
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial 
statements.
(b) Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of 
the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision 
and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date that may give rise to a material 
adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The group is committed to investing in new facilities where existing facilities fail to provide satisfactory customer service 
in a cost effective manner. When construction on a new facility commences, the existing facility is marketed for sale and 
this action can on occasion give rise to an adverse difference between carrying value and market value. At the Statement 
of Financial Position date, the assets have been reported at their carrying value. Market values are formally assessed for all 
properties on a triennial basis and compared with the carrying values.
At the latest review, carried out at 31 December 2013, the 2014 carrying value of UK freehold and long leasehold land and 
buildings would have exceeded market value (on an existing use basis) by £15,240,000. The directors consider that the 
carrying value of the UK freehold and long leasehold land and buildings is supported by their ongoing value in use within the 
business. An impairment review has been undertaken on the portfolio each year. No impairment was considered necessary in 
2014 or 2013. 
A review of the properties held in Continental Europe has been undertaken and no impairment was considered necessary 
for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: resulted in an impairment provision for the group’s property held in the 
Netherlands, see note 4).
Goodwill impairment
The outcome of the group’s annual impairment test for goodwill is dependent on the forecast cash flows of each cash-
generating unit together with key management assumptions including profit growth and discount rates. There was no 
impairment considered necessary for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: impairment of the goodwill held for the 
group’s French subsidiary LMS SA, see note 4). No impairment resulted from the annual impairment test for 2014 and 2013 in 
the UK.
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised at the Statement of Financial Position date based on the assumption that there is a high 
expectation that the asset will be realised in due course. This assumption is dependent on the group’s ability to generate 
sufficient future taxable profits.
Inventory
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is calculated based on the ageing profile and 
consideration of inventory sold for less than its carrying value.
Employee benefits
The deficit relating to the group’s defined benefit plans is assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19 and after taking 
independent actuarial advice. The principal assumptions are set out in note 20. The amount of the deficit is dependent on 
plan asset and liability values and the actuarial assumptions used to determine the deficit. 
The assumptions include asset growth rates, pension and salary increases, price inflation, discount rate used to measure 
actuarial liabilities and mortality rates.
(c) Impact of newly adopted accounting standards
There have been no significant changes in accounting policies or any material impact on the group financial statements 
arising from the adoption of new accounting standards and interpretations in 2014.
88 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
(d) IFRS not yet applied
The following standards and interpretations, which were not effective as at 31 December 2014 and have not been early 
adopted by the group, will be adopted in future accounting periods:
•	 International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ (effective 1 January 2017)
•	 International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9 ‘Financial instruments’ (effective 1 January 2018)
None of the standards above are expected to have a material impact on the group.
Basis of consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries which together are referred to as the 
“group”. The company’s financial statements present information about the company as a separate entity and not about its 
group.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control exists when the group has power over an entity, is exposed or has 
rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over 
the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the group’s financial statements from the date that control 
commences until the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated in the group’s financial statements.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Statement of Financial Position date are translated at the 
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Financial statements of foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial 
Position date. 
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate 
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign subsidiaries are taken directly to the translation reserve and 
reflected as a movement in the statement of comprehensive income.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen after 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are 
presented as a separate component of equity.
Foreign currency exposure
Note 23 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the group and risks in relation to foreign exchange 
movements.
Derivative financial instruments
The group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and its interest rate risk exposures. Derivatives 
are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in the income statement when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described 
below.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Cash flow hedges
Changes in the fair value of the derivative hedging instrument designated as a cash flow hedge are recognised directly 
in equity to the extent that the hedge is effective. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are 
recognised in the income statement. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or 
is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. When the hedged item is a non-financial asset, 
the amount recognised in equity is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when it is recognised. In other cases the 
amount recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or 
loss. 
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on third-party valuations. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by 
discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates for 
a similar instrument at the measurement date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their market price at the Statement of Financial Position date, being 
the present value of the forward price. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value of forward exchange contracts 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of self-
constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset 
to a working condition for its intended use. Self-constructed assets begin to be depreciated from the date they become 
available for use.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items 
of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis. The annual rates applicable are:
Freehold and long leasehold properties – 2%
Short leasehold properties – period of lease
Motor vehicles – 25%
Office and computer equipment – 10%–33.3%
Warehouse and production equipment – 10%–20%
Land is not depreciated. 
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from 
disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on 
acquisition of subsidiaries. In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents 
the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired.
Following the requirements of IFRS 3 revised, transaction costs associated with acquisitions and movements in contingent 
consideration are recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not 
amortised but tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indicator that the unit may be impaired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the 
amount recorded under UK GAAP which was broadly comparable save that only separable intangibles were recognised and 
goodwill was amortised. This is in accordance with IFRS 1.
90 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Other intangibles
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 
losses. Intangible assets recognised as a result of a business combination are stated at fair value at the date of acquisition 
less cumulative amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets 
unless such lives are indefinite. 
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each Statement of 
Financial Position date. Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful 
lives of customer lists are deemed to be between one and 24 months. 
Non-current assets held for sale
A non-current asset is classified as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale rather than 
through continuing use, it is available for immediate sale and sale is highly probable within one year.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets and disposal groups are measured at the lower of previous carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell with any adjustments taken to the income statement. The same applies to gains and 
losses on subsequent remeasurement.
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially stated at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses. Debts 
are provided for, the credit loss allowance, on specific receivables in full as soon as they are known to be “bad” or it becomes 
apparent that payment is “doubtful”.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes 
expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. Net realisable 
value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, 
selling and distribution. 
Allowances for inventory losses are determined by reference to each individual product and are calculated by assessing the 
age and quantity of each individual product.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and 
form an integral part of cash management of both the company and group are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.
Impairment
The carrying amounts of the group’s assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each Statement 
of Financial Position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s 
recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount for goodwill is estimated at each Statement of Financial Position date.
For the purposes of impairment testing assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash 
flows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its 
recoverable amount.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. 
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of assets, with the exception of the group’s receivables, is the greater of their fair value less cost to 
sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a 
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of the group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated 
future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate, i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial 
recognition of these financial assets. Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
Reversals of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer 
exist and there had been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that 
would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and then are stated at amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial 
recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value 
being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised where the group constructs qualifying assets. All other borrowing costs are written off to the 
income statement as incurred.
Borrowing costs are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Employee benefits
The company and the group operate both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in 
independent trustee-administered funds. The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
Defined contribution plans
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as 
incurred.
Defined benefit plans
The group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of future 
benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to 
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The liability discount rate is the yield at the 
Statement of Financial Position date using AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of 
the group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
92 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is 
recognised as an expense in the income statement immediately. 
To the extent that any benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised directly in the income statement.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the group’s obligation in respect of a scheme are recognised 
immediately in reserves and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the group, the asset recognised is limited to the present value of any future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The group operates a UK defined benefit pension plan and a defined benefit plan in Switzerland. In the UK, there is no 
contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between the participating 
subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer. 
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by a 
professionally qualified actuary.
Share-based payment transactions
The company and group operate various equity-settled share option schemes under the approved and unapproved 
executive schemes and savings-related schemes.
For executive share option schemes, the option price may not be less than the mid-market value of the group’s shares at the 
time when the options were granted or the nominal value.
Further details of the share plans are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 62 to 63.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the 
period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the award. The fair value is measured at grant date and 
spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the 
options were granted. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that 
vest except where forfeiture is due only to market conditions such as share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
When options are granted to employees of subsidiaries of the company, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an 
employee expense in the financial statements of the subsidiary undertaking together with the capital contribution received. 
In the financial statements of the company, the options granted are recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings 
with a corresponding increase in equity.
Repurchase of share capital
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, net of any tax effects is 
recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction 
from total equity. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase 
in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from retained earnings.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration, net of trade discounts and excludes 
intra-group sales and value added and similar taxes. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks 
and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer (which is the date on which goods are received by the 
customer), the amount of revenue can be reliably measured and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the 
transaction will flow to the group.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Lease payments
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
group. All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of fair value at the date of 
acquisition or the present value of the minimum lease payments. The capital element of outstanding finance leases is 
included in financial liabilities. The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the income statement at a constant period 
rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the 
lease. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Net financing costs
Net financing costs comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities, finance leases, interest 
receivable on funds invested, foreign exchange gains and losses and gains and losses on hedging instruments as outlined in 
the accounting policy relating to derivative financial instruments and hedging described above.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. 
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established.
The group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for the period by applying the discount 
rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then net defined benefit 
liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contributions and 
benefit payments.
Dividends
Interim and final dividends are recognised when they are paid or when approved by the members in a general meeting. Final 
dividends proposed by the board and unpaid at the end of the year are not recognised in the financial statements. 
Taxation
Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates 
to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted 
at the Statement of Financial Position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial 
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary 
differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised.

2 SEGMENT REPORTING
The group has 55 operating segments in the UK and five operating segments in Continental Europe. Each segment 
represents an individual trading operation, and each operation is wholly aligned to the sales, marketing, supply and 
distribution of floorcovering products. The operating results of each operation are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating 
Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Group Chief Executive. Discrete financial information is available for each 
segment and used by the Group Chief Executive to assess performance and decide on resource allocation.
The operating segments have been aggregated to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics, with relevance 
to products and services, type and class of customer, methods of sale and distribution and the regulatory environment in 
which they operate. The group’s internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the operating 
segments on the basis of the differing economic characteristics in the UK and Continental Europe and accordingly present 
these as two separate reportable segments. This distinction is embedded in the construction of operating reports reviewed 
by the Group Chief Executive, the board and the executive management team and forms the basis for the presentation of 
operating segment information given below.

The group presents underlying measures of performance in order to better reflect the financial performance of the group 
over time.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
In the Netherlands, management obtain an annual market value of the property for local rates purposes. The latest valuation 
obtained in 2013 indicated the carrying value of the property exceeded its market value. Management considered this to 
represent an indicator of impairment and therefore performed an impairment review to establish the value in use for the 
Dutch cash-generating unit (“CGU”) which represents an operating segment. The future cash flows used in the value in use 
calculation were based on forecast operating results per the 2014 approved business plan with a growth rate assumption of 
2.5% over a period of five years. These were discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 9.4%. 
The outcome of the impairment review concluded that the carrying value of the assets of the Dutch CGU were less than their 
recoverable amount by £2,155,000 which was not less than the amount by which the market value of the property exceeded 
its carrying value. This is a reflection of the ongoing challenging market conditions in the Netherlands. As a consequence, 
a £2,155,000 impairment loss has been recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 and 
disclosed as a non-underlying item. Non-underlying items are not attributable to reportable segments. If they were, the 
impairment would be attributable to the Continental Europe segment.
At 31 December 2014 a further impairment review was conducted. This review demonstrated that the carrying value was 
supported and as such no further impairment has been recognised.
Impairment of goodwill
In line with the requirements of IAS 36, impairment reviews are required to be completed annually for CGUs to which 
goodwill is allocated. In performing these impairment reviews management assesses the value in use for each CGU based on 
actual reported results for 2013 with a growth rate assumption of 0% over a period of five years. These were discounted at a 
pre-tax discount rate of 9.4%.
The outcome of the impairment review concluded that the carrying value of the assets of the LMS CGU in France, which 
represents an operating segment, were less than their recoverable amount by £3,197,000, equivalent to the goodwill 
attributed to the CGU. This is a reflection of the ongoing challenging market conditions in France. As a consequence, 
a £3,197,000 impairment loss has been recognised in the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2013 and 
disclosed as a non-underlying item. Non-underlying items are not attributable to reportable segments. If they were, the 
impairment would be attributable to the Continental Europe segment.
At 31 December 2014 a further impairment review was conducted. This review demonstrated that the carrying value was 
supported and as such no further impairment has been recognised.

Cumulative impairment losses recognised in relation to goodwill is £3,197,000 (2013: £3,197,000). 
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill (“CGU”)
Goodwill is attributed to the businesses identified below for the purpose of testing impairment. These businesses are the 
lowest level at which goodwill is monitored and represent operating segments.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are as follows:
Reported

Belcolor AG Continental Europe 3,342 3,342
Other UK 954 954
    10,013 10,013
Impairment
Each year, or whenever events or a change in the economic environment or performance indicates a risk of impairment, 
the group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units. 
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or CGU to their recoverable amount. The 
recoverable amount represents the higher of the CGU’s fair value less the cost to sell and value in use. Where the recoverable 
amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results. During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no 
impairment charge resulting (2013: an impairment charge on goodwill attributable to the LMS CGU was necessary, see note 4).
104 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Value in use was determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of the CGU on a basis 
consistent with 2013, and applying the following key assumptions.
Key assumptions
Cash flows were projected based on actual operating results, the approved 2015 business plan and management’s 
assessment of planned performance in the period to 2019. For the purpose of impairment testing the cash flows were 
assumed to grow into perpetuity at a rate of 2.5% beyond 2019.
The main assumptions within the operating cash flows used for 2015 include the achievement of future sales volumes and 
prices for all key product lines, control of purchase prices, achievement of budgeted operating costs and no significant 
adverse foreign exchange rate movements. These assumptions have been reviewed in light of the current economic 
environment.
The directors have estimated the discount rate by reference to an industry average weighted average cost of capital. This 
has been adjusted to include an appropriate risk factor to reflect current economic circumstances and the risk profile of the 
CGUs. A pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.7% (2013: 9.5%) has been used for impairment testing, adjusted to 
9.8% (2013: 9.4%) for Continental Europe to reflect the differing risk profile of that segment. The pre-tax discount rate has 
been applied to the pre-tax cash flows. 
The CGUs in the UK have similar characteristics and risk profiles, and therefore a single discount rate has been applied to 
each UK CGU. Similarly, the directors view the CGUs in Continental Europe as having consistent risk profiles and therefore a 
single risk factor has been applied. The CGUs in Continental Europe operate under a different regulatory environment and 
this is therefore reflected in the risk factor used to determine the discount rates in the UK and Continental Europe.
Sensitivity analysis
The two key assumptions made by the directors are the discount rate used and the growth rate beyond 2019. 
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to both of these assumptions and neither a 1% increase in the discount 
rate or a 1% reduction in the growth rate which the group considers to be reasonable possible changes would result in any 
impairment. 
For Belcolor, the group considers a reasonable change to the assumptions could be greater than 1%. However, this would 
require one of the following changes to assumptions for an impairment to be triggered: 
•	 The discount rate would need to be increased to 12.6% and the growth rate reduced to 1%; or
•	 A sustained reduction in cash flows of 32%.
Goodwill attributed to the LMS CGU was impaired during the year ended 31 December 2013, see note 4.

18 OTHER INTEREST-BEARING LOANS AND BORROWINGS
This note provides information about the contractual terms of the group’s and company’s interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings. 
On 8 March 2012 the group refinanced the terms of its banking facilities. The refinancing increased the availability of 
committed facilities from £30 million to £40 million, and extended the availability to four years. On 15 January 2013 an option 
was taken to extend this by an additional year in line with the facility agreement and the renewal date is now March 2017. 
Uncommitted facilities were maintained at £35 million, renewable on an annual basis. 
For more information about the group’s and company’s exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, see note 23.

retirement and death benefits to members. The majority of members are entitled to receive pensions from age 65, equal to 
either 1/50 or 1/60 of final salary for each year of service that the employee provided, depending on which section of the plan 
the member is part of.
The plan is a registered scheme under UK legislation and is contracted out of the State Second Pension. The plan is legally 
separated from the company and assets are held independently of the company’s finances. 
The plan is subject to the scheme funding requirements outlined in UK legislation.
The company has a right to a refund of any surplus in the plan if the plan winds up, after payment of expenses, members 
benefits and any enhancements to the members’ benefits as the Trustee sees fit. In addition, if the assets of the plan exceed 
the estimate by the actuary of the cost of buying out the benefits of all beneficiaries with an insurance company, including 
the associated expenses, and the plan is not being wound up, then the company may request a payment of the excess funds. 
There have been no payments made to the company out of the plan’s assets over the year, and so no additional liability has 
been recognised on the balance sheet.

The plan was established from 11 February 1983 under trust and is governed by the plan’s Trust Deed and Rules dated 
29 March 2000. The Trustee of the plan comprises two employee representatives and four employer representatives. The 
Trustee of the plan is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants. The Trustee is responsible for the 
operation and the governance of the plan, including making decisions regarding the plan’s funding and investment strategy 
in conjunction with the company.
The ultimate cost of the plan to the company will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. Many 
of the assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost of the plan may be higher (or lower) 
than disclosed.
The plan exposes the company to actuarial risks such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, market (investment) risk and 
currency risk. The risk to the company is that the assumptions underlying the disclosures, or the calculation of contribution 
requirements, are not borne out in practice and the cost to the company is higher than expected. This could result in higher 
contributions required from the company and a higher deficit disclosed. More specifically, the assumptions not being borne 
out in practice could include:
•	 The return on the plan assets being lower than assumed, resulting in an unaffordable increase in the required company 
contribution rate.
•	 Falls in asset values not being matched by similar falls in the value of liabilities. 
•	 Inflation being higher than that assumed, resulting in an increase in the value of the members’ benefits and therefore a 
higher cost to the plan.
•	 Unanticipated future changes in mortality patterns leading to an increase in the plan’s liabilities. Future mortality rates 
cannot be predicted with certainty. 
•	 The potential exercise of options against the plan, for example taking early retirement or exchanging a portion of pension 
for a cash lump sum.
There have been no amendments, curtailments or settlements made to the plan during 2014.
The plan’s investment strategy is to invest broadly 90% in return seeking assets and 10% in matching assets, mainly 
government bonds. This strategy reflects the plan’s liability profile and the Trustee’s and company’s attitude to risk. The 
matching fund seeks to match the return achieved on the liabilities.
The plan’s investments include interest rate and inflation hedging.
The plan holds a number of annuity policies which match a portion of the pensions in payment.
The scheme is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the company at rates advised 
by professionally qualified actuaries. The last scheme funding valuation of the plan was as at 31 March 2011 and revealed a 
funding deficit of £11,543,000. The 2014 valuation is expected to be finalised soon and is expected to show a slightly lower 
deficit of £10,883,000.
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary in the 2011 valuation were: increase in salaries 4.9%; increase of 
pensions in payment 3.4%; discount rate before retirement 6.4%; discount rate after retirement 4.65%; and inflation 3.4%. 
Assets were taken at their audited market value at the valuation date.
In the recovery plan dated 29 July 2011 the company has agreed to pay contributions of £238,687 per month as at  
31 December 2014, increasing by 3.2% each 1 April, with the view to eliminating the shortfall by 31 December 2015. The 
latest actuarial valuation was due on 31 March 2014 but is yet to be finalised; this opportunity will be used to reassess the 
recovery plan.
In accordance with the recovery plan, payments were made to the plan during 2014 of £2,835,000. The company is expected 
to pay contributions of £4,190,000 over the next accounting period. This includes £2,925,000 for payments under the recovery 
plan and £1,265,000 for the accrual of benefits.
In addition to the recovery payments, company contributions as at the date of the last valuation have been fixed at 24.7% of 
pensionable salaries at that date, with no allowance made in respect of subsequent leavers. This represented an additional 
contribution amounting to £162,000 during 2014 (2013: £166,000).
In addition, the company is expected to meet the cost of administrative expenses and insurance premiums for the plan.

The liabilities of the plan are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the plan over 
the next 60 years or more. The weighted average duration of the liabilities is approximately 20 years.
During 2010, the UK Government announced a move to adopting Consumer Price Inflation (“CPI”) rather than Retail Price 
Inflation (“RPI”) as the basis for inflation assumptions underpinning retirement benefit obligations. The directors have 
considered this change and associated guidance. Having taken advice, the company has determined that RPI remains 
the appropriate basis for measuring its obligations, such that the change announced has had no impact on the group’s 
retirement benefit obligations.
Swiss defined benefit plan
The plan provides occupational retirement, disability and survivors’ benefits. The members are entitled to receive pensions 
from age 64 (female) or 65 (male), equal to the old age savings balance multiplied with a conversion rate of 6.8% for the 
mandatory part of the savings balance and 5.85% for the part beyond the mandatory part. The minimum interest rate on old 
age savings has legally been fixed. 
The company is affiliated to the Columna Collective Foundation Client Invest. The plan is legally separated from the 
company. The executive body of the collective foundation is the board of trustees, which is elected directly by the insured 
of the affiliated companies/occupational benefits funds and functions independently of AXA. Its members include employer 
and employee representatives from a wide range of occupations and companies of different sizes. The board of trustees’ 
responsibilities include, among other things, supervising compliance with legal provisions and issuing the regulations that 
govern the various activities. The company elects an occupational benefits fund commission (OBC). The Foundation was 
established on March 20, 1974 by Credit Suisse Ltd. 
The collective foundation is reinsured for risk benefits with AXA Winterthur Life insurance company. 
The plan exposes the company to the market (investment) risk. The risk to the company is that return on assets may be lower 
than legally required. This could result in higher contributions required from the company and a higher deficit disclosed. 
There have been no amendments, curtailments or settlements made to the plan during 2014.
The occupational benefits fund commission (OBC) defines the investment strategy; the affiliated occupational benefits fund 
itself bears the investment risk. The investments are managed with Credit Suisse. 
The last (provisional) scheme funding valuation of the plan was as at 31 December 2014 and revealed cover ratio of 118.74% 
(overfunding). This overfunding is appropriate to Swiss legislation and cannot be considered in the context of IAS 19. 
According to Swiss rules there is no need to evaluate the scheme using assumptions for future changes of salary increase, 
benefit increase or inflation. 
The last IAS 19 valuation at year-end 2014 revealed a funding deficit of £2,059,000. The group is expected to pay £595,000 for 
future service costs over the next accounting period. 
The liabilities of the plan are based on the current value of expected benefit payment cash flows to members of the plan over 
the next 50 years or more. The weighted average duration of the liabilities is approximately 18 years.

Defined benefit obligation
In the UK there is no contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between 
the participating subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer. 
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by 
a professionally qualified actuary. The company recognises a cost equal to its contributions payable for the period net of 
amounts recharged in relation to the group deficit to the participating subsidiary companies.

20 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued
At 31 December 2014, the group had other long term employee benefits of £287,000 (2013: £800,000). During the year ended 
31 December 2013, the group provided for equalisation costs on the UK defined benefit plan of £524,000 within other long 
term employee benefits. The estimated impact of the change in the equalisation window for the year ended 31 December 
2014 is to increase the liabilities by approximately £670,000, therefore this has been incorporated within the UK defined 
benefit plan liability rather than a separate disclosure. The group operated an employment indemnity scheme in connection 
with a foreign subsidiary undertaking to provide for lump sum cash payments due to employees retiring on their normal 
retirement date. The present value of the retirement indemnity obligation at 31 December 2014 is £287,000 (2013: £276,000).
Total group pension costs
Included within the total staff costs as disclosed in note 5 are costs relating to the group’s defined contribution plans. The 
pension cost for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the plans and amounted to £2,587,000 (2013: 
£2,362,000). Contributions amounting to £157,000 (2013: £156,000) in respect of December 2014 payroll were paid in January 
2015.
The total group cost of operating the plans during the year was £3,733,000 (2013: £4,737,000) and, at 31 December 2014, 
there was an amount of £296,000 (2013: £301,000) owed to the plans, being employer and employee contributions due for 
December 2014, which was paid in January 2015.
21 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Group and company
Executive directors and executive management currently participate in executive share option schemes. The option price 
may not be less than the greater of the mid-market value of the group’s shares at the time when the options were granted 
or the nominal value. Options granted under the 1998 Inland Revenue approved scheme are normally exercisable between 
the third and tenth anniversaries of their date of grant, subject to the movement of the group’s basic earnings per share 
exceeding RPI over the relevant period.
Options granted under the 1998 unapproved scheme are normally exercisable between the third and seventh anniversaries 
of their date of grant. Awards are subject to the movement of the group’s basic earnings per share exceeding RPI between 
3% and 5% per annum respectively over the relevant period.
Additionally, the group operates a savings-related share option scheme (“Sharesave scheme”) which is open to 
employees subject to eligibility criteria determined by the directors prior to each option grant. The most recent grant 
was on 8 May 2014 when employees with over one month’s service were invited to participate. 
The group also operates a 2008 HMRC approved scheme, a 2008 unapproved scheme, the Headlam Group Performance 
Share Plan 2008 and the Headlam Group Co-Investment Plan 2008. Further details of these schemes and plans are given in 
the Remuneration Report on pages 62 and 63.

The weighted average share price for options exercised during the year was 414.3p (2013: 367.7p).
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 0.0p to 420.0p and a weighted average 
contractual life of 2.5 years.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share 
options granted. In order to estimate the fair value of the services received the company uses an appropriate option pricing 
model, either the Black–Scholes or the Monte Carlo option pricing model.
It is expected that the options will be exercised as soon as they reach maturity. 
The expected volatility is based on historic volatility calculated over the weighted average remaining life of the share options.

Reserves
Other reserves
Other reserves as disclosed on the Statement of Financial Position comprise the capital redemption reserve, translation 
reserve, cash flow hedging reserve and treasury reserve. For the company this also includes a special reserve.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of shares repurchased and cancelled during 2007.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of 
foreign subsidiaries.
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow 
hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Treasury reserve
The treasury reserve comprises the cost of the company’s shares held by the group.
Special reserve
The special reserve arose on the issuance of shares in connection with acquisitions made by the company in earlier years. 
23 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The main financial risks arising in the normal course of the group’s business are credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risks 
arising from interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. This note presents information about the group’s exposure to 
each of the above risks, the group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risks and the group’s 
management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these financial statements.
Credit risk and credit quality 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations and arises principally from the group’s trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset and as at the Statement of 
Financial Position date, in the directors’ opinion there were no significant concentrations of credit risk likely to cause financial 
loss to the group. 
The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations 
are performed on all new customers requiring credit and these are frequently reviewed by management to limit exposure. 
Businesses must obtain central approval from executive directors or senior executive management for credit limits in excess 
of £10,000. The group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The credit control procedures described above, coupled with the diversified nature of the group’s trade receivables, lead the 
directors to believe that there is limited credit risk exposure and that the credit quality of these assets is robust.
Other receivables comprise amounts due to the group which historically have been received within three months of the year 
end. The directors have considered the inherent risk profile of other receivables at the year end and are of the view that this 
historical experience will prevail for the foreseeable future and accordingly consider the credit quality of these assets to be 
robust.
Cash and cash equivalents represent deposits with reputable financial institutions in the UK and Continental Europe and 
hence, the directors consider the credit quality of cash and cash equivalents to be robust.

Based on historic default rates, the group believes that no general impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade 
receivables, however, the group provides fully for specific debts when required. During the year the group’s impairment loss 
as a percentage of revenue amounted to 0.17% (2013: 0.25%).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when 
due, with sufficient headroom to cope with abnormal market conditions. As at 31 December 2014 cash and cash equivalents 
covered the amounts of borrowings maturing in the next 12 months with a net positive liquidity of £47,385,000 (2013: 
£47,259,000). Details of the total facilities that the group has access to are given in note 18.

The value of the group’s and company’s financial liabilities as detailed above at 31 December 2014 and 2013 were not 
materially different to the carrying value. Fair values were calculated using market rates, where available. Where market 
values are not available, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using prevailing interest 
rate curves. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the Statement of 
Financial Position date.

Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are derivatives at fair value through the income 
statement. The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. All transactions in derivative financial instruments 
are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Interest rate risk
The company and group are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on their borrowings and cash deposits. Borrowings are 
principally held in sterling and euros at both fixed and floating rates. Deposits are in sterling, euros and Swiss francs at 
floating rates. 
Floating rate borrowings are linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate and Euribor Over Night Index Average. The 
group adopts a policy of reviewing its floating rate exposure to ensure that if interest rates rise the effect on the group’s 
income statement is manageable. In accordance with this policy, and in order to manage its exposure to UK interest rates, 
the group entered into two interest rate swaps in 2012 to fix £20 million of its sterling denominated borrowings. These 
interest rate swaps were designated as a hedging instrument and accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with the 
requirements of IAS 39. The cash flows will occur over the period to 8 March 2016.
126 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
The fair value of these interest rate swaps are included in the Statement of Financial Position as a £132,000 derivative liability 
(2013: £87,000).

Foreign currency risk
The group and company are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates arising from transaction currency cash flows 
and the translation of the results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily 
the euro, Swiss franc and US dollar.
The group and company use forward exchange contracts to hedge their foreign currency transactional risk. A future foreign 
currency contract would be entered into where there was a known requirement for the currency due to planned imports 
that are not invoiced in the functional currency of the acquiring company. These forward exchange contracts would have 
a maturity of less than one year after the Statement of Financial Position date. The group also enters into foreign currency 
contracts at spot rate where the amounts are not frequent or material. Gains and losses on currency contracts recognised as 
an asset as at 31 December 2014 amounted to £2,000 (2013: liability of £122,000).
For the 12-month period to 31 December 2014, 3.8% (2013: 7.3%) of the group’s operating profit was derived from overseas 
subsidiaries and at 31 December 2014, 16.0% (2013: 18.8%) of the group’s net operating assets related to overseas subsidiary 
operations. Hedge accounting, following the adoption of IFRS, has not been applied to these operations.
The group and company do not use derivatives other than as described above.

Sensitivity analysis
A 10% weakening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased/(decreased) profit or 
loss by the amounts shown below; there is no equity effect. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest 
rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2013.

A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite effect 
on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Fair values hierarchy
The financial instruments carried at fair value are categorised according to their valuation method. The different levels have 
been defined below:
•	 Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•	 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly, 
as prices or indirectly, derived from prices.
•	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The group has two interest rates swaps used for hedging which were fair valued in accordance with level 2 for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 (2013: level 2) and forward currency contracts which were fair valued in accordance with level 2 
(2013: level 2). 
128 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
Fair values
The carrying amounts shown in the Statement of Financial Position for financial instruments are a reasonable approximation 
to fair value.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents
Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturity of the instrument.
Borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values. Where market values are not available, fair values 
have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts denominated 
in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Capital management
The group views its finance capital resources as primarily comprising share capital, bank loans and operating cash flow.
The board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to 
sustain future development of the business. The board closely monitors its shareholder base, dividend yield and earnings per 
share. In the medium term the group aims to maintain a dividend cover of 1.7 times.
The board encourages employees of the group to hold the company’s ordinary shares. The group operates a number of 
employee share option schemes. In previous years the company has acquired a number of its own shares under a share 
buy-back programme, and some of these shares have been used for issuing shares under the group’s various share option 
incentive schemes. 
Certain of the company’s subsidiaries are required to maintain issued share capital at levels to support capital adequacy 
requirements prevailing in the legislative environment in which they operate.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends made payable  
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
On 8 March 2012, the group completed a refinancing of its banking facilities. The new facilities comprise a £40 million 
committed facility and a £35 million uncommitted facility. This represents an increase in total available facilities of £10 million. 
The uncommitted facility, coupled with cash generated from operations, is used to fund the group’s ongoing working capital 
requirements. The committed facility is in place to support the group’s strategic investment plans.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2014 and 31 December 
2013.

24 ACQUISITIONS 
On 2 July 2014, a group subsidiary company acquired the business and certain assets of Kalm Investments Limited.
Kalm Investments has two trading entities: RPS Flooring based in Mansfield and Mytton Flooring based in Norwich, both 
being suppliers to independent floorcovering retailers in their areas. Cash consideration was paid of £331,000. Since its 
acquisition the businesses have contributed revenue of £1,458,000 and a loss of £22,000 to the Consolidated Statement of 
Comprehensive Income for the year ended 31 December 2014. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2014 group 
revenue would have been an estimated £638.3 million and profit after tax would have been an estimated £23.9 million.

The book value of receivables given in the table above represents the gross contracted amounts receivable. At the 
acquisition date the entire book value of receivables was expected to be collected.
No goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of the business and certain assets of Kalm Investments Limited. The intangible 
assets on acquisition were attributed to customer order books.
Following acquisition, it is the group’s normal practice to implement its operational and financial procedures and standard IT 
systems.
Furthermore, acquired businesses gain access to the group’s extensive product ranges and benefit from enhanced sales 
and marketing investment. These changes typically enable acquired businesses to enhance the service provided to their 
customers and ultimately, develop and grow.
Whilst acquired customer order books are a key component at the point of acquisition, this position quickly dissipates 
during the post acquisition period. The dynamic and renewable nature of this class of asset is the reason the group elects to 
amortise it over a period of one to 24 months, the precise period being dependent upon the size of the acquired business.
On 28 March 2013, a group subsidiary company acquired the trade and assets of Hall’s Floorings Limited, a distributor 
of residential floorcovering, based in Edmonton, north London, and a supplier to independent floorcovering retailers 
throughout most of England. Cash consideration of £521,000 was paid. Since its acquisition the business has contributed 
revenue of £5,146,000 and a loss of £24,000 to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year ended  
31 December 2013. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2013 group revenue would have been an estimated  
£610 million and profit after tax would have been an estimated £14.9 million.

On 29 November 2013, a group subsidiary company acquired the trade and assets of Roger Fell Limited (Fells Carpets), 
a distributor of residential floorcovering throughout the north of England, for a cash consideration of £1,453,000. The primary 
reason for this acquisition is for the group to enhance its position in the north of England. Since its acquisition the business 
has contributed revenue of £455,000 and a loss of £27,000 to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 
the year ended 31 December 2013. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2013 group revenue would have been 
an estimated £609.5 million and profit after tax would have been an estimated £14.9 million.

8. Authority to allot shares
(a) that the directors be generally and unconditionally authorised pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 
(the “Act”) to allot shares in the company, and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares 
in the company, up to an aggregate nominal amount of £620,000 for a period expiring (unless previously renewed, 
varied or revoked by the company in general meeting) at the end of the 2016 AGM (or, if earlier, at the close of 
business on 30 June 2016), and save that the company may before such expiry make an offer or agreement which

(b) that, subject to paragraph (c), all existing authorities given to the directors pursuant to section 551 of the Act be

before the expiry of the authority pursuant to which such offer or agreement was made. 
9. Disapplication of pre-emption rights

directors, the directors be generally empowered pursuant to section 570 and section 573 of the Act to allot equity securities 
(as defined in section 560 of the Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 9 in this Notice, as if section 
561 of the Act did not apply to the allotment.
This power:
(a) expires (unless previously renewed, varied or revoked by the company in general meeting) at the end of the 2016 
AGM if passed (or, if earlier, at the close of business on 30 June 2016), save that the company may, before such 
expiry, make an offer or agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry

136 23786.04   Proof Three  25-03-15
(b) shall be limited to:
(i) the allotment of equity securities in connection with an issue to holders of ordinary shares of 5p in the capital of 
the company in proportion (as nearly as may be practicable) to their existing holdings and to people who hold 
other equity securities, if this is required by the rights of those securities or, if the directors consider it necessary, 
as permitted by the rights of those securities and so that the directors may impose any limits or restrictions and 
make any arrangements which they consider necessary or appropriate to deal with treasury shares, fractional 
entitlements, record dates, legal, regulatory or practical problems in, or under the laws of, any territory or any 
other matter; and 
(ii) the allotment of equity securities for cash otherwise than pursuant to paragraph 9(b)(i) up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £213,000.
This power applies in relation to a sale of shares which is an allotment of equity securities by virtue of section 560(3) of the Act 
as if, in the first paragraph of this resolution, the words “pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 9 in this Notice” 
were omitted.
10. Authority to purchase own shares

company, subject to the following conditions:
(a) the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased is 8,536,000;

Explanatory Notes to the Proposed Resolutions
This year’s AGM will be held at the group’s distribution facility at Gorsey Lane, Coleshill, Birmingham B46 1JU on Thursday  
21 May 2015 at 10.00 a.m.
A description of the resolutions that will be proposed at the meeting is set out below.
Resolutions 1 to 8 inclusive are proposed as ordinary resolutions which means that for each of these resolutions to be passed, 
more than half the votes cast must be cast in favour of the resolution. Resolutions 9 to 11 inclusive are proposed as special 
resolutions, which means that for each of those resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be 
cast in favour of the resolution.
Resolution 1 – Annual Report and Accounts
The company is required by law to present to shareholders at the AGM its audited accounts and the directors’ and 
independent auditor’s reports for the financial year ended 31 December 2014. Shareholders are invited to vote to receive and 
adopt the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Resolution 2 – Declaration of dividend
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 12.30p on each of the ordinary shares entitled thereto, which 
together with the interim dividend of 5.20p, gives a total dividend of 17.50p for the year ended 31 December 2014. Subject 
to approval of the declaration of the final dividend at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 1 July 2015 to the holders of 
ordinary shares whose names are recorded on the register of members at the close of business on 5 June 2015.
Resolution 3 – Re-election of Steve Wilson as a director
Steve Wilson is retiring by rotation in accordance with the company’s articles and is offering himself for re-election by 
shareholders. Under the articles of association, directors are required to retire every three years. Steve was appointed an 
executive director in December 1991 at which time he became Group Finance Director. Steve was formerly non-executive 
Chairman of Synergy Healthcare plc, from which he resigned in September 2010 and, was appointed a non-executive director 
of Conviviality Retail Plc in January 2014. The board believes that Steve Wilson should be re-elected and makes such a 
recommendation to shareholders.
Resolution 4 – Re-election of Dick Peters as a director
Dick Peters is retiring by rotation in accordance with the company’s articles and is offering himself for re-election by 
shareholders. Under the articles, directors are required to retire every three years. Dick was appointed a non-executive 
director in December 2005 at which time he joined the Nominations, Audit and Remuneration Committees, becoming 
Chairman of the Audit Committee. On 1 September 2013 Dick was appointed Chairman following the resignation of Graham 
Waldron, at which time he resigned as Audit Committee Chairman. The board believes that Dick Peters should be re-elected 
and makes such a recommendation to shareholders.
Resolution 5 – Appointment of auditor
The company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the company, to 
hold office until the end of the next such meeting. This resolution proposes the appointment of an auditor. KPMG LLP has 
expressed its willingness to continue in office.
Resolution 6 – Agreement of auditor remuneration
In addition to the company’s requirement to appoint an auditor, shareholder authority is sought for the directors to 
determine the remuneration to be paid to the auditor for the period of appointment.
Resolution 7 – Directors’ Remuneration Report
Shareholders are being asked to approve the 2014 Directors’ Remuneration Report, which gives details of the directors’ 
remuneration for the period ended 31 December 2014 and is set out on pages 53 to 67 of the company’s Annual Report and 
Accounts. Whilst the payment of remuneration to the directors is not dependent on the passing of the resolution, the board 
will take the vote into account when considering the future development and operation of the company’s remuneration 
policy and practice. As required by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, KPMG LLP have audited those 
parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report capable of being audited and their report can be found on pages 78 to 80 of the 
Annual Report and Accounts.

SPECIAL BUSINESS – RESOLUTIONS 8 TO 11
Resolution 8 – Authority to allot shares
Shareholders are being asked to pass the necessary resolution to grant to the directors a general authority, for the purpose 
of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, to allot relevant securities. With due regard to the ABI guidelines and to 
comments received from shareholders, the proposed general authority, similar to last year, is to allot up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £620,000 representing 12,400,000 ordinary shares (15% of the company’s ordinary share capital (excluding 
treasury shares) in issue at 5 March 2015). As at 5 March 2015, the company held 1,296,517 treasury shares, which represented 
approximately 1.5% of the company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury shares), which the company can cancel or hold 
for sale or use to meet the obligations under the company’s employee share schemes. 
This authority will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2016, or, if earlier, on 30 June 2016. The directors consider 
that this authority is desirable to allow the company to retain flexibility, although they have no current intention of exercising 
this authority except in connection with the company’s employee share schemes.
Resolution 9 – Disapplication of pre-emption rights
Shareholders are being asked to pass a resolution to empower the directors to allot equity securities, or sell treasury shares, 
for cash as if section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 (which gives shareholders certain pre-emption rights on the issue of 
shares or rights to subscribe for or convert securities into shares) did not apply to any such allotment. The resolution allows 
the issue or sale of shares of up to an aggregate nominal amount of £620,000 representing 12,400,000 ordinary shares in 
respect of rights issues and other issues pro rata to existing entitlements, and also allows issues or sales for cash (other than 
in relation to a rights issue) limited to shares having an aggregate nominal amount of £213,000 (5% of the company’s ordinary 
share capital in issue at 5 March 2015). The authority will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2016 or, if earlier, 
on 30 June 2016.
The directors confirm that they have no present intention of exercising this authority.
In accordance with The Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles available at www.pre-emptiongroup.org.uk, the 
directors also confirm their intention that no more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the company (excluding treasury 
shares) will be issued for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis during any rolling three-year period.
Resolution 10 – Purchase of own shares
The directors believe that it is in the interests of the company and its members to continue to have the flexibility to purchase 
its own shares and this resolution seeks authority from members to do so. The directors intend only to exercise this authority 
where, after considering market conditions prevailing at the time, they believe that the effect of such exercise would be 
to increase the earnings per share and be in the best interests of shareholders generally. The effect of such purchases 
would either be to cancel the number of shares in issue or the directors may elect to hold them in treasury pursuant to the 
Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations 2003 (“the Regulations”). The Regulations enable 
certain listed companies to hold shares in treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them, following a purchase of own shares 
by a company in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Shares held in treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used to satisfy share options and share awards under 
a company’s employee share scheme. Once held in treasury, a company is not entitled to exercise any rights, including the 
right to attend and vote at meetings in respect of the shares. Further, no dividend or other distribution of the company’s 
assets may be made to the company in respect of the treasury shares.
This resolution renews the authority given at the AGM held in 2014. The authority is in respect of 10% of the company’s 
issued ordinary share capital as at 5 March 2015 and will lapse at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2016 or, if earlier, 
on 30 June 2016. The resolution specifies the maximum and minimum prices at which the shares may be bought. If the 
company buys any of its shares under the authority proposed by resolution 11, the board will decide at the time whether 
to cancel them immediately or hold them in treasury. The purchase of shares will be dependent on market conditions and 
will also take into account the cash generated in the business and other investment opportunities that may arise over time. 
During the year the company made no purchases of its own shares.
Details of share options outstanding and treasury share movements including details of own shares acquired by the company 
are shown respectively in notes 21 and 22 to the Financial Statements.

Explanatory Notes to the Proposed Resolutions
Resolution 11 – Shareholder Rights Directive
This will be proposed as a special resolution to approve the holding of general meetings, other than AGMs, on 14 days’ 
notice. Although the company’s articles currently permit this, the Shareholder Rights Directive requires a shareholder 
resolution to be passed to authorise general meetings to be held on 14 days’ notice. Without the passing of resolution 
11, the minimum notice period under the regulations would be 21 days. If resolution 11 is passed by the shareholders, 
the regulations would only allow the company to call a general meeting on 14 days’ notice if it were to make a system of 
electronic voting available to its shareholders in respect of the meeting in question. The directors consider it to be in the best 
interest of shareholders to pass resolution 11, which is a repeat of the same resolution passed at the AGM in 2014, in order 
to prevent being constrained by the regulations implementing the directive. It will be necessary for a similar resolution to be 
put to shareholders at each subsequent AGM. It is intended that this flexibility will only be used for non-routine business and 
where merited in the interests of shareholders as a whole.

Explanatory Notes to the Notice of Meeting
Notes 1 to 17 below give further explanation as to the proxy, voting and attendance procedures at the AGM.
1. Entitlement to appoint proxies
A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled to appoint a proxy or proxies to attend, speak and vote 
instead of him.
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise 
the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a member of the company. 
Appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting. To appoint more 
than one proxy, a member must complete a photocopy of the enclosed proxy card or obtain additional forms from our 
registrars, Capita Asset Services, telephone 0871 664 0300 (calls cost 10p per minute plus network charges). Lines are open 
8.30 a.m. – 5.30 p.m. Monday to Friday. Please also indicate by ticking the relevant box if the proxy appointment is one of 
multiple appointments being made.
Multiple proxy appointments should be returned together in the same envelope. Enter in the box provided the number of 
shares in relation to which your proxy is authorised or leave the box blank to authorise your proxy to act in relation to your full 
voting entitlement.
2. Appointing proxies
To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed 
(or a notarially certified copy of such power or authority) must reach Capita Asset Services, Proxies Department, The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent, BR3 4TU not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting. A form of 
proxy is enclosed with this Notice.
3. Electronic proxy appointment through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do 
so by using the procedures described in the CREST manual (available via www.euro-clear.com/CREST). CREST personal 
members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their 
behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a 
“CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s (“Euroclear 
UK & Ireland”) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction 
given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 
RA10) by the latest time for the receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 2 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by CREST application host) from which 
the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time 
any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other 
means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK 
and Ireland does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timing and 
limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of CREST proxy instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member, or sponsored member, or has appointed 
a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be 
necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, 
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST systems and timing.
The company may treat as invalid a CREST proxy instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
4. Joint holders
In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be 
accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. For this purpose seniority is determined by the order in 
which the names of the holders stand in the register of members in respect of the joint holding.

the request. The company must forward the statement to the company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes the

Warning to shareholders – boiler room scams
We have been made aware of our shareholders receiving unsolicited telephone calls from companies offering to buy 
Headlam shares at a substantial premium to the prevailing market price for a large shareholder intending to make a takeover 
bid. These callers, who can be extremely persuasive and persistent, are usually based overseas and are commonly known as 
“boiler room scams”. Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited investment advice or approach to buy or sell 
shares… if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
If you receive an unsolicited investment approach, you should:
•	 Confirm the name of the person calling and the organisation they represent.
•	 Check that they are registered with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) by calling 0800 111 6768 or by visiting  
www.fca.org.uk and contact the firm using the details on the register.
•	 Report the matter to the FCA by calling 0800 111 6768 or by visiting www.fca.org.uk.
Please note that if you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme. Further information on this or similar activity can be found on the FCA website  
www.moneymadeclear.org.uk. If you have any queries, please contact the Company Secretary.

We have made some 
important changes to our 
management in 2015 and 
laid the groundwork for 
further performance 
improvements as we  
tackle some near -term 
challenges.”
Ian Davis
Chairman
Rolls-Royce is a business in transition. 
The next few years are going to be very 
important as we capitalise on our 
outstanding portfolio of products and 
services and the £76.4bn order book 
that supports them. Underpinning this 
journey will be significant changes to 
our business. Warren East, our new 
Chief Executive, will talk more about 
these in the Strategic Report.
During this period of transition we should 
not forget the core strengths of the business. 
Our products, technologies and customer 
relationships have been further strengthened 
as a result of focused investment and the 
continued hard work of our teams. The 
sustained strong growth in our order book 
shows that our customers recognise the 
value Rolls-Royce delivers.
The fundamentals of our business are 
unchanged. We are investing today, as we 
have for many years, in building a strong 
installed base of mission-critical industrial, 
marine and aerospace power systems. Our 
market share, particularly in powering large 
civil airliners, will grow significantly over the 
next ten years providing a cash generative, 
sustainable platform from which to further 
develop the business. Investing today to 
secure that future is essential.

after a long career at GKN and BAE Systems. 
Lewis Booth, a US resident and an independent 
Non-executive Director since 2011 has 
indicated his intention to relinquish his 
responsibility as Senior Independent Director 
once a successor has been appointed. He will 
continue as Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
Dame Helen Alexander, an independent 
Non-executive Director since 2007 , will be 
stepping down from the Board after the AGM 
in May 2016 having completed her nine-year 
term. At that time she will be succeeded as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
by Ruth Cairnie, who joined the Board in 
September 2014. On behalf of the Board 
I would like to thank Dame Helen for her 
dedicated service to the Company. She has 
been a wise and insightful member of the 
Board and her well-judged advice and 
leadership of our Remuneration Committee 
have been highly valued by her colleagues.
Rebuilding trust and confidence
In the first months since his appointment last 
July, Warren has made an enormous impact 
on the business with a clear, well-structured 
review. This has examined the strengths and 
weaknesses of our businesses and highlighted 
the critical investment priorities required 
to develop our competitive advantages and 
market position. I have also been pleased 
by the steps he and his team have taken 
to improve communication to our investors. 
While it is early days, I believe his approach 
has been well received and has laid good 
foundations from which we can rebuild trust 
and confidence in the business.
Looking forward
2016 will be another challenging year for 
Rolls-Royce. As Warren sets out in his review, 
we are doing a great deal within the business 
to ensure we successfully transition over the 
next few years to a more strongly profitable 
and cash-generative future. The Group is well 
positioned to grow strongly on the back of 
innovative, market-leading technology. We do 
have some near-term challenges but the 
fundamentals of the business remain strong, 
underpinned by a record order book and 
some great people across the organisation.
Ian Davis
Chairman
11 February 2016
At the same time, we are facing some 
challenges in key markets, particularly in 
Marine, and are managing a major change 
in product mix within Civil Aerospace, which 
has a direct impact on how we recognise 
revenues and profits. This meant we took the 
decision to undertake a major restructuring  
of the business. Warren’s recent review of 
operations, unanimously supported by  
the Board, highlighted a number of areas 
where, over time, costs have grown in an 
unsustainable way. This clearly needs to 
change. We have approved a plan to reduce our 
fixed cost base by £150m to £200m per annum 
and simplify the way we manage the business. 
Shareholder payments
The pace of investment required to transform 
the business creates near-term pressure 
on free cash flow. At the same time, we need 
to sustain a healthy balance sheet to ensure 
we have the financial flexibility to maintain 
a strong investment-grade credit rating. 
As a result, the Board is recommending 
that the payment to shareholders is halved 
in cash terms at the full year and the next 
half year. We recognise the importance 
of a healthy ‘dividend’ to our shareholders. 
Subject to short-term cash needs, we intend to 
review the payment so that it will be rebuilt 
over time to an appropriate level. This reflects 
the Board’s long-standing confidence in the 
strong future cash generation of the business.
As a result, the proposed final payment 
for 2015 is 7 .1p per share, 50% of the final 
payment made for full year 2014. It is further 
proposed that the interim payment for 2016 
will also be reduced to 50% of the prior year.
Corporate governance
2015 has proven to be a strong test of our 
governance processes and, while we will

class engineering business
take away several important learnings from 
different events, I have been impressed by  
how your Board and senior management at 
Rolls-Royce have performed at a difficult time. 
This has not been an easy year for the 
Company, its employees, investors or other 
stakeholders. We have had to communicate 
some challenging messages both internally 
and externally about our market outlook, 
our performance and, very importantly, the 
essential changes we will be making to cut 
waste and restore confidence in the business.
We have not taken our eye off some of the 
historic issues that have undermined confidence 
in the business in the past. Concerns about 
bribery and corruption involving intermediaries 
in overseas markets remain subject to 
examination by the Serious Fraud Office and 
other authorities and these investigations 
are not yet complete. We have done much to 
address the root of these problems and this 
work is being continually reinforced to ensure 
we all meet the high standards expected of us.
Board developments
During the year there have been a number of 
important changes to the Board. On 22 April 
we announced that John Rishton had decided 
to retire as Chief Executive on 2 July, to be 
succeeded by Warren East. At the AGM on  
8 May James Guyette, President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Rolls-Royce North 
America, retired and stepped down from the 
Board. John Neill also stood down at the AGM 
after six years as a Non-executive Director. 
Irene Dorner, formerly CEO and President  
of HSBC USA, joined the Board in July.  
Alan Davies, Chief Executive of Rio Tinto’s 
Diamonds and Minerals division, and Sir Kevin 
Smith, the former Chief Executive of GKN, the 
multinational automotive and aerospace 
business, both joined the Board from 
1 November. In February 2016, Sir Kevin 
assumed Chairmanship of the Science & 
Technology Committee. 
Irene brings a wealth of international expertise, 
particularly in risk management and 
operational performance. Alan, as well 
as having a strong financial background, 
brings relevant experience in transforming 
operational performance and driving cultural 
change through a complex global organisation, 
together with a deep knowledge of China and 
other key emerging markets. Sir Kevin also 
brings recent Asian experience together with 
significant aerospace industry knowledge, with

Strategic Report 
Chairman’s statement TRANSFORM
In the context of challenging trading 
conditions our overall performance 
for the year was in line with the 
expectations we set out in July 2015. 
It was a year of considerable change 
for Rolls-Royce: in our management, 
in some market conditions and in our 
near -term outlook. At the same time, 
there were some important 
constants: the underlying growth 
of our long-term markets, the quality 
of our mission-critical technology and 
services, and strength of customer 
demand for these, which are reflected 
in our growing order book. While we 
have some near -term challenges, 
these constants provide us with 
confidence in a strong, profitable, 
cash-generative future.”

Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review REVIEW OF 2015  
AND BUSINESS 
TRANSFORMATION
Performance in 2015
Our performance in 2015 was broadly in line 
with our early expectations, with Marine 
markets causing most of the weakness. 
At the same time we have continued to 
invest in products and services to support 
our customers and reinforce the long-term 
strength of our order book, valued at 
£76.4bn at the year end, up 4% on 2014. 
Group revenue was broadly unchanged on 
a constant currency basis with good growth 
in Civil Aerospace offsetting weaknesses 
in Marine. The combination of some difficult 
market conditions, sustained engineering 
investment and high fixed costs led to 
underlying profit before finance charges 
and tax 11% being lower at £1,492m. 
Civil Aerospace delivered an underlying 
profit before finance charges and tax of 
£812m (2014: £942m). Defence Aerospace 
delivered £393m (2014: £366m), Power 
Systems £194m (2014: £253m) and Marine 
£15m (2014: £138m). Nuclear delivered £70m 
(2014: £50m). More detail on each business 
is included in the Business review.
After underlying financing costs of £60m 
(2014: £61m), underlying profit before tax 
was £1,432m (2014: £1,620m). Excluding the 
benefit of a one-off intellectual property 
settlement of £58m, triggered by the 
third-party acquisition of a former business 
partner, and a favourable £19m R&D credit 
benefiting our Nuclear business, underlying 
profit before tax would have been £1,355m, 
in line with the lower half of the 2015 
guidance range set out in July 2015.
After an underlying tax charge of £351m 
(2014: £388m) and adjusting for non-
controlling interests, underlying profit 
for the year was £1,080m (2014: £1,226m). 
With an average 1,839 million shares in 
issue, underlying earnings per share were 
58.7p (2014: 65.4p).
Reported profit before tax was £160m 
(2014: £67m), compared to an underlying 
profit before tax of £1,432m (2014: £1,620m). 
A full reconciliation of headline to underlying 
profit can be found in note 2 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Free cash flow of £179m was materially 
higher than our third quarter expectations, 
reflecting strong cash collections at the end 
of the year from a number of key customers, 
a better than expected overall working 
capital performance and the non-recurring 
cash settlement arising from the intellectual 
property agreement mentioned above. 
Some of this positive variance is likely to 
reverse early in 2016. 
A more detailed review of financial 
performance is included in the

Performance in 2015
Customer
Placing the customer at the heart of our 
organisation is key. We listen to our 
customers, share ideas, really understand 
their needs and then relentlessly focus on 
delivering our promises.
Innovation
This is our lifeblood. We continually innovate 
to remain competitive. To drive innovation, 
we create the right environment – curious, 
challenging, unafraid of failure, disciplined, 
open-minded and able to change with pace. 
Most importantly, we ensure our innovation 
is relevant to our customers’ needs.
Profitable growth
By focusing on our customers and offering 
them a competitive portfolio of products 
and services, we create the opportunity to 
grow our market share. We have to make 
sure that we are not just growing, but 
growing profitably. That means ensuring 
our costs are competitive. We look after our 
cash and we win right.

Announced initial findings of a 
detailed operational review
Our strategic priorities for 2015 remained 
largely consistent throughout the year, with 
a clear focus on the customer, innovation 
and on driving long-term profitable growth. 
However, with short-term market conditions 
around us changing, it has been appropriate 
to review these priorities as we look to the 
next three or four years.
Since July 2015, we have been conducting 
a review of operations and presented the 
initial conclusions in November 2015. 
As part of this we shared our views on the 
strengths and weaknesses of our business 
portfolio and updated management’s 
future focus and priorities around delivery 
and transformation.
Positive market developments 
continue to drive long-term growth
The long-term positive market trends for our 
leading power systems remain unchanged 
despite some near-term uncertainties that 
are expected to impact small aerospace 
engine production volumes and service 
activity on older widebody engines over the 
next couple of years. The trends driving 
demand for growth in large passenger 
aircraft, corporate jets and maritime activity 
remain strong; in particular a growing 
aspirational and mobile middle-class, 
particularly in Asia, and globalisation in 
business, trade and tourism. In addition, 
capacity constraints at the airframe 
manufacturers and a strong underlying 
demand for newer, more fuel efficient 
aircraft, should provide resilience to 
manufacturing schedules over the next few 
years as the industry transitions to new 
airframes during a strong replacement cycle.
The most significant short-term challenge 
that has emerged in 2015 relates to the 
changing demand for our Trent 700 engine 
as Airbus transitions production from old to 
new airframes. This has had a knock on 
effect on both demand for and pricing of the 
remaining engines to be delivered. Once 
completed, we will benefit from an exclusive 
position with the new Trent 7000 on the 
A330neo. In the near-term the profit impact 
of this transition is negative; the impact of 
lower pricing and gross margin is 
exacerbated by the accounting effects of 
changes within our large engine aerospace 
product mix as we transition to a portfolio 
increasingly comprising ‘unlinked’ platform 
positions. However, the roll-out of new 
engines will significantly grow our market 
share and the installed base of new engines 
will deliver strong aftermarket revenues for 
decades to come.
We recognise that these changes have been 
exacerbated by market uncertainty as to the 
impact of TotalCare accounting on our 
financial statements. As a result, we are 
increasing our financial disclosure to present 
a simpler narrative that will more clearly 
describe how the key drivers of performance 
translate into our financial results and aid 
transparency and understanding. These are 
included in the Business review.

Strategic focus going forward
The review has led us to recast our priorities 
for 2016 onwards. As before, the overarching 
theme continues to be developing our 
products, services and order book to drive 
long-term profitable growth. We will do this 
by focusing on three common themes across 
all our businesses:
•  investing in and developing engineering 
excellence;
•  driving a manufacturing and supply 
chain transformation which will embed 
operational excellence in lean, lower-cost 
facilities and processes; and
•  leveraging our installed base, product 
knowledge and engineering capabilities 
to provide customers with outstanding 
service through which we can capture 
aftermarket value long into the future.
Our ability to deliver these priorities will be 
enhanced by a major transformation of our 
organisation; to simplify our processes and 
management structure, to add pace to our 
decision making and execution, and to 
provide space to develop our people and 
create a stronger, high performance culture.
These themes will become the cornerstones 
of our operational priorities going forward. 
Clear areas for business 
improvement
The review of operations also highlighted 
a number of opportunities to drive further 
performance improvements over and above 
the extensive restructuring programmes 
already underway. As we grew as an 
organisation we embedded costs and 
complexity in the business which, in periods 
of significant investment and product 
transition like now, are impacting our 
performance. But the higher costs also 
present a significant opportunity; to simplify 
what we do and sustainably reduce the cost of 
management, creating a more streamlined, 
resilient and sustainable business.
   Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 11
Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review / Review of 2015 Major new transformation 
programme creating meaningful 
cost savings
The objective of our new transformation 
programme is to simplify the organisation, 
streamline senior management, reduce 
fixed costs and add greater pace and 
accountability to decision making. Our 
target is to deliver incremental gross cost 
savings of between £150m and £200m per 
annum, with the full benefits accruing from 
the end of 2017 onwards. 
In the last two months, we have already 
announced a 20% reduction in the top two 
layers of senior management with further 
reductions planned for 2016 and onwards. 
This has included removal of the divisional 
structure. To date we have already identified 
around 50%, or £75-100m, of targeted cost 
savings with a related exceptional 
restructuring charge of £75-100m. Around 
£30-50m of the initial savings should be 
achieved in 2016 with the full run rate 
benefiting 2017. Further actions are 
underway to quantify the additional savings 
needed to reach our goals, together with the 
related costs which we expect to take in 2017.
To ensure we remain focused, we have set 
up a transformation team which will drive 
change to simplify processes and activities 
across the Group to deliver sustainable 
performance improvements. The new team 
will ensure other restructuring programmes 
maintain progress. They will also help 
develop the comprehensive range of key 
performance indicators needed to support 
the changes we are looking to make inside 
the business. Several measures around site 
level productivity and aerospace engine unit 
costs have already been adopted within the 
business. These and other measures will be 
important indicators of the changing 
culture around productivity, cost reduction, 
investment efficiency and process waste. 
Details on new measures will be set out in 
further announcements.
Restructuring initiatives started 
prior to November continue to make 
good progress 
During 2014 and 2015 restructuring initiatives 
were started, largely focused on our operational 
footprint within Aerospace and Marine.
In 2015, we consolidated our Civil Aerospace 
repair and overhaul activities, enabling the 
closure of sites in Brazil and the UK, along 
with further rationalisation of our UK 
manufacturing footprint. To date, nearly 
80% of the targeted 2,600 Civil and Defence 
Aerospace headcount reductions have been 
completed, with an 11% reduction in our 
2013 operational footprint.
In May 2015, we announced a Marine 
restructuring programme to make significant 
reductions in both manufacturing footprint 
and headcount (by 600) and generate £25m 
in annual savings from 2016 onwards. This 
included work to consolidate our footprint 
and increase lower-cost country sourcing. 
At the start of October 2015, we announced 
an additional programme of restructuring, 
focused largely on back-office administrative 
functions. This will lead to a further 400 
reduction in headcount.
Good progress has been made overall, 
with related headcount reductions across 
Aerospace and Marine totalling 2,500 
by the end of 2015.

Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review / Review of 2015 Outlook for 2016
Our outlook for 2016 is unchanged from that 
set out in November 2015. On a constant 
currency basis, Group revenue for 2016 is 
expected to be marginally lower than that 
achieved in 2015, partially reflecting the 
pricing and volume effects in Civil Aerospace 
and the continued weakness in offshore 
marine markets. Overall, the net profit 
trading headwinds discussed in previous 
announcements are unchanged at around 
£650m compared to our underlying profit 
before financing, excluding £58m intellectual 
property settlement included in ‘Other’ 
and £19m research and development (R&D) 
credit which benefited Nuclear.
Individual outlooks are provided for each 
business in the Business review.
Transforming our US operations
In October 2015, we confirmed the 
decision to invest nearly US$600m in 
modernising our manufacturing base 
in Indianapolis, US.
This investment is the largest by 
Rolls-Royce in the US since we purchased 
the Allison Engine Company in 1995.
The new facility is part of a five-year 
modernisation plan and the investment 
is in line with the Group’s ongoing 
commitment to consolidate operations 
and significantly reduce operational costs. 
The new facility will be a state-of-the-art 
manufacturing centre that combines 
modern production systems and machinery 
together with a highly-skilled workforce.
We currently employ around 4,000 
people in Indianapolis, where engines 
are designed, assembled and tested for 
US defence aircraft, civil helicopters, 
regional and business jets and power 
systems for US naval vessels.
Looking further ahead
The successful roll-out of new engines, 
led in particular by the Trent XWB, Trent 1000 
and Trent 7000, together with a growing 
aftermarket, is expected to drive significant 
revenue growth over the next ten years 
as we build toward a 50% plus share of the 
installed widebody passenger market. 
While the impact of the transition to the 
Trent 7000 has reduced Trent 700 deliveries, 
and will hold back Civil Aerospace profit 
in the near term, we are confident that the 
important investments we are making 
to transition our production will create 
a strong platform to drive customer service, 
improved margins and strong cash flows.
Our 2014 and 2015 initiatives to reduce 
manufacturing and back office costs within 
Aerospace and Marine are on track to reduce 
costs by £145m by the end of 2017.
In addition, we have made a good start to 
the transformation programme that will add 
pace and simplify our business, and create 
incremental enduring cost savings of between 
£150m and £200m per annum from the end 
of 2017 onwards. These initiatives will make 
us a more efficient and resilient business. 
At the same time, we will continue to invest 
appropriately to strengthen our engineering 
and operational excellence and aftermarket 
products and services. We have started the 
journey that will return the Company to its 
long-term trend of profitable growth.
Below 
Our re-developed facilities in Indianapolis 
will cover 1.5 million square feet when 
complete.

Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review / Strategic priorities Our business model is to capture value from 
markets for high-performance power. We do 
this by developing advanced, integrated power 
and propulsion systems and providing long-term 
aftermarket support and delivery of outstanding 
customer services.
Our long-life products operate in challenging 
environments where they are expected to deliver 
sustained levels of differentiated performance. They 
deliver value to customers through outstanding power 
or other performance capabilities, together with greater 
fuel efficiency and mission-critical reliability. This is 
often combined with a flexible service offering to best 
suit each customer’s operating needs.
We make significant investments in advanced 
technology and engineering programmes to deliver 
market-leading products. We seek to recoup our 
investment through developing superior products, 
many of which are selected for use on major multi-year 
programmes. We benefit from increasingly cost-efficient 
manufacturing as production levels rise, and by 
securing strong aftermarket revenues. In certain 
markets we strengthen our customer relationships 
typically through long-term service agreements where 
we commit to deliver exceptional standards of service, 
including high levels of product operational availability. 
This provides significant value to customers and in 
return we achieve long-term predictable revenues.
By growing our installed base of power systems over 
time and leveraging our aftermarket service activities, 
we enhance revenue, profit and cash flow. Cash flow is 
then invested to support future product development 
and technology programmes to drive growth while 
providing good shareholder returns.

OUR FUTURE  
CREATING WORLD-
CLASS TECHNOLOGY
In 2015, we invested £1.2bn in gross R&D, 
which includes funding from governments 
and other bodies. £831m was from our 
own funds. As a result, we applied for 
626 patents during the year . It is this 
investment that creates the intellectual 
property we then develop and embed 
in our products.
We leverage our own scientific and 
engineering talent globally to create 
world-class technology and also partner 
with leading academic institutions. This 
ensures we benefit from the knowledge 
of renowned experts in their fields, and 
get the best value from our investment.
We seek to attract and retain the best 
and brightest engineers. We then create 
a culture of innovation that allows them 
to develop their skills. We encourage 
all employees to contribute to our 
Innovation Portal via the Company 
intranet. In 2015, this generated well over 
1,000 ideas from which we conducted 
dozens of challenges.

BUSINESS REVIEW 
CIVIL  
AEROSPACE
OPERATIONAL  
REVIEW
Overall, underlying revenue for Civil Aerospace 
grew 3% on a constant currency basis (up 1% 
at actual rates) with steady growth in services 
(up 9% at constant rates, including a £189m 
one-off benefit discussed below) which more 
than offset the reduction in original 
equipment (down 3% at constant rates). 
Second-half growth was particularly strong 
as the business improved original equipment 
delivery performance on a number of 
programmes, notably in corporate jets.
Original equipment revenues from 
widebody engines: linked and other reduced 
11% reflecting a slow-down in linked Trent 
700 deliveries for the Airbus A330 ahead of 
the introduction of the Trent 7000 for the 
A330neo, together with reduced sales of 
linked Trent 900 engines for the Airbus A380, 
partly offset by increased linked Trent 1000 
engine sales for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. 
In addition, sales of spare engines to joint 
ventures generated revenue of £189m 
(2014: £138m).
Original equipment revenues from unlinked 
widebody engines increased by 29%, largely 
a result of an increase in unlinked Trent XWB 
and other Trent engine deliveries.
The 17% increase in widebody services 
revenue was mainly driven by increased 
flying hours from our growing fleet of 
installed Trent 700, Trent 900 and Trent 1000 
engines and a £189m one-off benefit 
resulting from refining the basis for taking 
account of risk in our forecasts of future 
revenue on long-term contracts. This was 
partially offset by lower utilisation of some 
of our more mature engine types, notably 
the Trent 500 and Trent 800.
Summary
The Civil Aerospace business is a major manufacturer of aero engines 
for the commercial large aircraft and corporate jet markets. We power 
35 types of commercial aircraft and have more than 13,000 engines 
in service around the world.

Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review / Business review
Within our corporate engine business we had 
good revenue growth from our BR725 engine 
which powers the Gulfstream G650 and 
G650ER. This was offset by lower volumes 
for our other products due to weaker demand 
from Chinese, Russian and Brazilian customers. 
As a result, corporate original equipment 
revenues declined 1%. Despite a reduction in 
new corporate engine deliveries, our installed 
base of corporate jet engines continued to 
grow, contributing to a 13% increase in 
services revenues from these products.
Services revenues from our regional jet 
engines declined 14%, reflecting 
retirements and reduced utilisation of 
relevant fleets by North American operators.
On the V2500 programme, original 
equipment revenues declined 9% due to 
reduced demand from International Aero 
Engines (IAE) for V2500 modules to power the 
Airbus A320ceo, reflecting a mix change in 
engine types powering the aircraft ahead 
of the introduction of the A320neo. Despite 
continued growth in the installed base of 
engines, services revenues on the V2500 were 
down 1% overall reflecting a combination 
of fewer overhauls, lower spare parts sales 
and reduced engine flying hours.
Overall gross margins for Civil Aerospace were 
22.0% (2014: 24.5%). The year-on-year reduction 
in margin of £139m reflected the lower 
proportion of linked T rent 700 engine sales, 
weaker corporate jet engine volumes and a 
declining regional aftermarket, partially offset 
by £16m higher gross margin contribution 
from sales of spare engines to joint ventures 
(£67m in 2015 compared to £51m in 2014). 
In addition, these factors were partially 
offset by a number of contract accounting 
adjustments and reversals of impairments 
and provisions.
The in-year benefit of retrospective long-term 
contract accounting adjustments as expected 
was a net positive of £222m (2014: total benefit 
of £150m). Of this, £189m was a one-off benefit 
resulting from refining the basis for taking 
account of risk in our forecasts of future 
revenue. In 2012, it was agreed with the Group 
Audit Committee that a comprehensive review 
would be completed during 2015. The new 
enhanced methodology should better reflect 
risk, current experience and expected 
long-term performance. Other long-term 
contract accounting adjustments totalled a net 
benefit of £33m (2014: total benefit of £150m). 
This comprised a retrospective charge of £107m 
(2014: benefit of £90m), reflecting reduced 
customer fleet utilisation, mainly in respect of 
the T rent 500 and T rent 800, other commercial 
changes and technical risks, offset by the 
benefit of £140m (2014: benefit of £60m) 
from life-cycle cost improvements.
Full-year performance also benefited 
from the reversal of previously recognised 
impairments on contractual aftermarket 
rights (CARs) and release of a related 
provision with a profit of £65m being 
recognised (2014: impairment charge of 
£19m). This reflected a significantly more 
positive outlook for future maintenance 
costs for a Trent 1000 launch customer 
which enabled the reversal of a previous 
impairment. This also resulted in the 
capitalisation of £22m of 2015 CARs that 
would otherwise have been impaired.
Costs below gross margin were £5m lower 
than the previous year. Within this, R&D 
charges were £64m higher, reflecting 
increased spend on key programmes, 
particularly in respect of the T rent 1000 TEN, 
the T rent 7000 and the T rent XWB-97 . 
These engines, now in their final stages 
of preparation before flight testing, are 
due to enter service in 2017 and 2018. They 
represent a significant advance on previous 
T rent designs, providing substantial fuel 
burn improvements. The T rent 7000 and 
T rent XWB-97 programmes have yet to reach 
a point at which their costs can be capitalised. 
In addition, following its successful entry 
into service, continuing investment in the 
T rent XWB-84 engine can no longer be 
capitalised. Investment also increased to 
develop future corporate jet engine technology.

* The methodology basis for the allocation of Civil Aerospace revenues on linked TotalCare contracts between original equipment and aftermarket has been reviewed and 
amendments made to reflect better the commercial substance of the combined contracts. Historically, the allocation has resulted in original equipment revenue and 
aftermarket revenue reflecting the contractual terms rather than the commercial substance of the contracts. The 2014 figures have been restated on the same basis; 
the impact was an increase in original equipment revenue of £198m and an equal decrease in aftermarket revenue 24 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s review Business review
The R&D charge was reduced by £94m 
(2014: £71m) by the recognition of entry fees 
receivable from risk and revenue sharing 
arrangements (RRSA).
Underlying corporate, administration and 
other costs were £14m higher. Restructuring 
costs were £75m lower reflecting the 
significant charges taken in 2014.
As a result, profit before financing and tax 
was 14% down, reflecting a combination of 
lower overall gross margins, increased R&D 
and reduced restructuring costs. T aking 
account of foreign exchange effects, 
underlying profit before financing and tax 
was £812m (2014: £942m).
Trading cash flow before working capital 
movements improved year-on-year by £48m, 
despite the headline drop in underlying 
profit before financing of £130m and the 
higher level of CARs additions. This is largely 
due to a reduced level of property, plant and 
equipment additions and a lower spend on 
certification costs and participation fees. 
The £286m year-on-year difference in 
working capital movements was largely due 
to differences in the timing of payments 
to suppliers and increased draw down 
of deposits in 2015.
Investment and business 
development 
Order intake of £12.8bn in 2015 for Civil 
Aerospace was £1.1bn up on the previous 
year. As a result, the order book closed at 
£67 .0bn, up £3.8bn or 6% on the previous year.
Significant orders during the year included 
our largest ever order by value to provide 
Trent 900 engines and TotalCare service 
support for 50 Airbus A380s for Emirates 
worth $9.2bn of which $6.1bn is recognised 
within the order book. Other major orders 
included Trent 1000 engines to power 21 
Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft and 
long-term TotalCare support for Air China 
and Ethiopian Airlines, and a $2.4bn order 
for engines and services with HNA Group.
Engineering excellence remains 
the cornerstone of our value to 
Civil Aerospace customers 
Several important engineering milestones 
were achieved during 2015. For widebody 
engines, the focus has been on completing 
the development and testing of the new 
Trent 1000 TEN and the Trent XWB-97. 
The results of initial tests on both engines 
are broadly in line with expectations. 
In December 2015, the Trent XWB-97 flew 
for the first time and has since undergone 
rigorous testing in a number of conditions. 
The Trent 1000 TEN has also completed 
several major milestones. In addition,

time and is now being put through its paces 
with a series of rigorous tests.
For corporate jets, developments in the year 
were more modest. Strong orders for the 
BR725 have sustained steady original 
equipment volumes as the new Gulfstream 
G650ER entered service, despite a 
weakening market. Failure in past years 
to secure new positions on some important 
new corporate jet platforms contributed 
to a weak order intake in the year which 
will impact future volumes and revenues 
adversely. As part of our technology 
strategy, investments are being made 
to secure future opportunities and regain 
its position as the leading provider to the 
important market of large-cabin, 
long-range corporate jets.
Investing in new aerospace supply 
chain capabilities to help drive 
operational excellence
As part of the supply chain transformation 
underway in the business, several 
important new facilities were completed 
during the year. These included the opening 
of our Advanced Blade Casting Facility in 
Rotherham, UK, which will halve the time 
it takes to manufacture turbine blades, and 
an expansion of our Trent XWB production 
centre in Derby. We also announced plans 
to invest in our facility in Inchinnan to 
create a new Centre of Competence for 
manufacturing aerofoils and established 
a joint venture with Liebherr to develop 
manufacturing capability and capacity 
for the power gearbox for our UltraFan™ 
demonstrator programme.
Strengthening our aerospace 
aftermarket service offering
During 2015, we broadened our service 
offering and strengthened our support 
network to provide customers with greater 
choice, flexibility and capability at all 
stages of the engine lifecycle, supporting 
a growing installed base.
This included making improvements to our 
Trent service network which will result in 
increased competition among our Approved 
Maintenance Centres (AMCs) and the 
announcement of our first independent 
AMC, Delta TechOps. We have also set up a 
global network of Customer Service Centres, 
bringing us closer to our customers, 
working in their time-zones.
We launched a new service, SelectCare™, 
which fits between our comprehensive 
TotalCare and general maintenance, repair 
and overhaul services, where customers 
contract for individual shop visit support. 
At the same time, we announced American 
Airlines as the launch customer. We also 
announced our first customers for TotalCare 
Flex®, a new service targeting owners and 
operators of more mature engines. Cathay 
Pacific, AerCap, South African Airways and 
BMI Regional chose the service for Trent 800, 
Trent 500 and AE 3007 engines.
Civil Aerospace outlook
As we set out in November 2015, we believe 
the long-term outlook for Civil Aerospace 
remains very good, led by a strong widebody 
order book for fuel efficient engines. Key to 
the long-term success of the business is 
converting this exceptional order book into 
a large installed base of engines that meet 
customer demands for safe, reliable, efficient 
operation while driving profitable engine 
flying hour revenues. The next few years will 
be very important as we ramp up production 
of new engines – in new, efficient facilities – 
and invest in the development of future 
engine platforms that will benefit the order 
book from 2020 onwards. As a result, until we 
gain additional aftermarket scale, or complete 
our industrial transformation and improve 
unit costs and cash margins, the business will 
continue to be a net investor of cash.
Over the next few years the transition 
from ‘linked’ to ‘unlinked’ contracts creates 
a headwind to reported profit but no 
change to cash flows.
In the future, an increasing proportion 
of our new engines will be sold to the 
airframer on a sole-source basis, 
in particular the new Trent XWB and 
Trent 7000 for use on the Airbus A350 
and A330neo respectively. As a result, 
a significantly larger proportion of our sales 
in the future will be accounted for on an 
‘unlinked’ basis. While this does not change 
cash flows, it does change the timing of 
when profit is recognised across the OE and 
aftermarket contracts. Under ‘unlinked’ 
accounting, the engine sale and aftermarket 
contracts are accounted for separately. 
This typically results in lower upfront 
profit recognition on engine delivery, 
with significantly higher proportion of 
profit in the aftermarket period. This is in 
comparison to ‘linked’ accounting, where a 
blended margin is applied across the engine 
sale and aftermarket contracts. 
Near-term conditions in some segments 
remain challenging. We continue to expect 
our Civil Aerospace business to underperform 
2015 underlying profit before finance and 
tax by around £550m. The significant 
headwinds related to Trent 700 volume 
reductions and the non-recurrence of a 
number of one-off benefits seen in 2015 
remain broadly unchanged. In addition, 
we still expect to see weaker demand for 
new corporate jets and declines in demand 
within our regional jet aftermarket. The 
aftermarket benefit of higher levels of 
engine deliveries and increased installed 
thrust is expected to be largely offset by 
the underutilisation of older large engines. 
However, the business will benefit from 
reduced costs from the restructuring 
initiatives started in 2014.
We now expect the T otalCare net asset to grow 
from £2.2bn and peak at around £2.5bn, 
allowing for a more positive demand outlook 
for our ‘linked’ accounted engines and the 
benefit of further life-cycle cost improvements 
now being seen in engine performance.

Market dynamics
•  Overall there has been a slowdown in all major 
geographical markets for new aircraft orders 
reflecting a period of higher than normal order 
placement for new airframe products in recent 
years (principally Airbus A350 and A330neo, 
and Boeing 787 and 777X).
•  Long-term growth in the number of widebody 
aircraft in the global fleet has historically been 
strongly correlated to global GDP growth.
•  Asia and the Middle East are strong drivers of 
growth, correlating to their regional GDP growth.
•  Historically, growth has recovered quickly 
following major economic shocks.
•  Our current share in the widebody engine 
market is at 31% of the installed widebody 
passenger fleet and is expected to reach 
50% early in the next decade.
•  Older widebody aircraft are experiencing 
reduced utilisation by certain airlines, in 
particular Boeing 777s and Airbus A340s.
•  The re-engining of the A330, announced in 
summer 2014, reduced Trent 700 sales ahead 
of the new Trent 7000 entering service in 2017 
as the sole source engine for A330neo.
•  Over 90% of Rolls-Royce large engine fleet is 
covered by our TotalCare service agreements.
•  We are the market leader in large business jet 
aircraft engines, with 55% market share of the 
large/very large business jet market in 2015.
•  Over 65% of Rolls-Royce business jet engines 
are covered by our CorporateCare® service 
agreements.
•  Demand for large business jets is related 
to global economic growth and increases 
in the number of high net-worth individuals; 
the sector has historically been fairly resilient 
to financial shocks.
•  The current business jet market is slowly 
recovering in the US (our largest market), but is 
currently going through a slowdown elsewhere 
due to political tensions and customer 
anticipation of new models about to enter into 
service. Overall, this sector is expected to grow 
faster than global GDP in the long term.
•  In the regional sector, aftermarket demand 
for engines on 50-70 seat aircraft is reducing 
as aircraft approach the end of their lives.
Competition
•  GE is the main competitor supplying engines 
in the widebody sector. In 2015, deliveries of 
engines for widebody passenger aircraft were 
split Rolls-Royce 38%, GE 54%, Pratt & Whitney 
2%, and Engine Alliance 6%.
•  Rolls-Royce is well positioned on all Airbus 
widebody airliner programmes and competes 
with GE on the Boeing 787 family.
•  Rolls-Royce is the sole engine provider on the 
Airbus A350 XWB family where 775 aircraft 
have been ordered so far.
•  GE is the sole engine provider on the 
Boeing 777X aircraft, scheduled to enter into 
service in 2020 where 306 have been ordered 
so far.
•  In large business jets the main competition 
is GE, Pratt & Whitney and Safran; in 2015 the 
GE-Honda joint venture entered the market 
in very low thrust engines.
•  Rolls-Royce has 3,100 powered business jets 
flying, representing 55% market share of the 
large/very large business jet fleet.
Business risks 
•  If we experience a major product failure in 
service, then this could result in loss of life and 
critical damage to our reputation. 
•  If an external event or severe economic 
downturn significantly reduces air travel, then 
our financial performance may be impacted. 
•  If our airframer customers significantly delay 
their production rates, then our financial 
performance may be impacted.
•  If we fail to achieve cost reductions at the 
necessary pace, then our ability to invest in future 
programmes and technology may be reduced.
•  If we experience significant pricing pressure 
from increased competitor challenge in our 
key markets, then our financial performance 
may be impacted.
•  If we suffer a major disruption in our supply 
chain, then our delivery schedules may be 
delayed, damaging our financial performance 
and reputation.
•  If there are significant changes to the 
regulatory environment for the airline industry, 
then our market position may be impacted.

MARKET REVIEW
Rolls-Royce is one of the world’s leading 
civil aero-engine manufacturers with 
particular strengths in engines for civil 
widebody aircraft and large business jets, 
underpinned by our strength and 
continued investment in technology.
We are market leaders in the large business 
jet fleet market powering aircraft from most 
of the main airframers. We have a strong 
market position on widebody aircraft 
produced by the world’s two major 
airframers: Boeing and Airbus, who are 
broadly consistent in forecasting traffic 
growth (Revenue Passenger Kilometres) 
of approximately 5% CAGR over the next 
20 years. In the engine market for 
narrowbody aircraft, we continue to supply 
some parts and services for the IAE V2500 
engine family.     Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 27

Chief Executive’s review / Business review
Key Rolls-Royce differentiators
•  Barriers to entry are extremely high in the civil 
sector. We invest heavily to maintain market 
leading technologies and system level 
integration capabilities to deliver the best 
engine performance for our customers. 
We offer a wide range of aftermarket services 
which provide flexible and cost-effective 
options to our customers and build long-term 
customer relationships.
Opportunities 
•  Our position and long-term prospects in the 
widebody sector are strong across our T rent family.
•  The Trent XWB has successfully completed its 
first year in service and the new Trent XWB-97 
engine made its first test flight in November 
2015 and is on schedule to enter into service 
in 2017.
•  The new Trent 7000 is scheduled to enter 
into service in 2017 on the A330neo. We have 
sole source on this platform which will replace 
the A330, on which we are one of three 
engine providers. 
•  We will be introducing the new Trent 1000 TEN 
in 2017 for the Boeing 787 . On the 787 , Rolls-Royce 
engines have been selected for 42% of the 
current order book. 
•  A potential significant new entrant into the 
civil sector is China’s COMAC which is developing 
a narrowbody aircraft for entry into service 
towards the end of the decade. COMAC is also 
planning a joint programme with Russia’s UAC to 
develop a widebody aircraft, targeting entry into 
service around 2025. We remain in close dialogue 
with COMAC and UAC to understand their plans 
and whether their widebody programme 
presents an opportunity for Rolls-Royce. 
•  Our business jet market share is likely to fall 
in the medium term with the success of new 
entrants into the large/very large sector, 
but the market remains attractive and we 
will continue to invest to improve our position 
and retain leadership.
Exemplary year for Trent XWB
On 15 January 2016, the world’s 
most efficient aero engine 
completed its first year in service. 
The Trent XWB on the A350 XWB 
airliner achieved the milestone 
in style having delivered 
outstanding performance over its 
first 12 months of operation, with 
launch customer Qatar Airways.
The engine lived up to its credentials in 
terms of being the most efficient engine 
ever and the Trent XWB also managed to 
claim the crown of being the most reliable 
engine with a dispatch rate of 99.83%.
Designed as the next generation of  
medium-/long-haul airliners, the A350 is 
an all-new family of aircraft from Airbus. 
The Trent XWB engine represents the 
largest single element of our £76.4bn 
order book by some margin. Over 1,500 
of the engines have been ordered by more 
than 40 airlines, from important existing 
customers and from new Rolls-Royce 
customers all over the world.

OPERATIONAL  
REVIEW
Underlying revenue at £2,035m was 5% lower 
on a constant currency basis (down 2% at 
actual exchange rates). Lower original 
equipment volumes for helicopters and 
trainers were partially offset by growth 
in LiftSystem™ volumes. Aftermarket 
revenues reflected lower volumes on 
helicopter spares partially offset by higher 
revenues related to long-term service 
agreements for UK combat aircraft.
Despite the reduced revenues, gross margin 
improved to 28.5%. Lower helicopter volumes 
and lower margins on some transport 
contract extensions were offset by higher 
LiftSystem volumes and increased 
retrospective margin improvements of 
£101m (2014: £53m) on existing long-term 
contracts. These relate to various combat 
platforms, where overall profitability has 
been improved by changed flying patterns 
and lower service costs, including 
approximately £40m (2014: £nil) due to 
one-off contract and scope variations.
Overall R&D costs were £20m higher in 2015 
reflecting increased investment in new 
programmes. Restructuring costs were 
lower due to reduced level of severance costs 
and lower costs related to changing our 
operational footprint.
Underlying profit before financing of £393m 
was 4% up on the prior year on a constant 
currency basis, reflecting the lower volumes, 
the one-off margin improvements, increased 
R&D charges and lower restructuring 
charges. As a result, operating margin 
improved by 170 basis points to 19.3%.
Summary
We are a leading engine maker for the military transport 
market and the second largest provider of defence aero-engine 
products and services globally. Defence has 16,000 engines 
in service with 160 customers in over 100 countries.
Key highlights
  Underlying revenue 5% lower; revenues 
impacted by weaker helicopter and 
trainer volumes, partially offset by 
higher combat original equipment sales.
  Underlying profit before financing

Chief Executive’s review / Business review
Long term, it remains essential that we have 
a cost-efficient supply chain to support the 
profitable growth of our business in a 
competitive market. To support future 
business competitiveness we initiated 
a major $600m investment in the upgrading 
of our Indianapolis facility, which will bring 
a combination of cost reductions, 
operational efficiencies and greater 
development capabilities for defence 
technologies. This investment recognises 
the importance of the US market and our 
strong position there.
Defence Aerospace outlook
The long-term outlook for Defence Aerospace 
remains positive with good opportunities to 
capitalise on its strong positions in transport 
and patrol and combat. Investment in 
developing new advanced technologies 
will be a feature of R&D for the next few 
years as the business ensures it can compete 
for new opportunities.
The outlook for revenues in 2016 remains 
steady. Operating profit will be adversely 
impacted by the lower level of expected 
long-term contract benefits in 2016, 
together with higher R&D and operational 
restructuring costs.
Free cash flow from Defence Aerospace is 
expected to remain strong in the longer 
term, reflecting the high proportion of 
aftermarket revenues. However, in the 
coming year free cash flow is expected to be 
lower reflecting the increased cost of 
investment and the run out of costs on key 
UK programmes where deposits have been 
received in advance of delivery.

development
Overall, the Defence order book declined 5%, 
in large part reflecting the 2014 benefit of the 
significant multi-year order for engines to 
power C-130J aircraft. With a major focus 
within defence budgets on cost control, 2015 
saw significant interest in availability-based 
service contracts and also on offering efficiency 
upgrades. New contracts included an extension 
of the UK’s Hercules Integrated Operational 
Support contract and commitment to the UK’s 
Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme. 
After successful first flights on US ‘Hurricane 
Hunter’ P-3 aircraft in May, we received strong 
international interest including an initial USAAF 
order for the T56 3.5 technology insertion kit 
upgrade delivering both fuel saving and 
performance benefits for an engine 
programme which has been in existence for 
over 50 years.
Outside the UK and US markets, our 
particular focus has been on positioning 
ourselves to be competitive for forthcoming 
combat programmes. We had success in 
South Korea in conjunction with Airbus, 
with the contract being awarded to power 
the A330 tanker fleet with Trent 700 
engines, as well as agreeing an order for our 
largest ever number of engines – a ten-year 
order with Robinson to supply at least 1,000 
RR300 engines.   30 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s review Business review
Market dynamics
•  Defence budgets are expected to show modest 
growth, flat in real terms in the US and UK, 
partially offset by growth in other emerging 
markets.
•  Western customers are seeking to reduce and 
minimise costs by delaying or deferring 
purchases, improving asset availability and 
extending lifecycles of aircraft/engines.
•  Increasing levels of economic affluence and 
political tension in the Asia Pacific and 
Middle East regions are leading to increases 
in both original equipment and services spend.
•  Revenue has historically been broadly balanced 
between original equipment sales and 
aftermarket services, biased towards the latter. 
Business risks 
•  If we experience a major product failure 
in service, then this could result in loss of life 
and critical damage to our reputation.
•  If global defence spending experiences 
a further downturn, then our financial 
performance may be impacted.
•  If we do not continue to invest to improve 
the performance and cost of our products, 
then we may lose market share.
•  If we suffer a major disruption in our supply 
chain, then our delivery schedules may be 
delayed, damaging our financial performance 
and reputation.
•  If we do not secure new applications, then our 
capabilities may be eroded in the long term.
Opportunities 
•  The UK’s FCAS potentially a joint programme 
with France, presents a longer-term combat 
opportunity to Rolls-Royce.
•  Our LiftFan™ system for the F-35B is only just 
entering service and we expect to deliver over 
400 systems in the next 20 years.
•  Emerging markets, such as India, Turkey 
and South Korea are inviting bids on new 
combat aircraft. We estimate a potential 
of over 300 aircraft for these programmes.
•  In transport, we believe the Airbus A400M 
transport aircraft and V-22 Osprey have 
overseas sales opportunities. 
•  We see strong growth potential for increased 
service provision to the military and we 
are well positioned with programmes such 
as MissionCare®.
Key Rolls-Royce differentiators
•  We are investing heavily in technology, 
integration capabilities and facility 
modernisation to deliver capable, affordable 
engines for our customers. Additionally, 
we leverage our large installed base and strong 
services capabilities to provide superior and 
affordable service solutions.
MARKET REVIEW
Rolls-Royce is a market leader in defence 
aero engines for military transport aircraft 
and has strong positions in other sectors, 
including combat, trainer aircraft and 
helicopters. We are pursuing new 
opportunities emerging in Asia and the 
Middle East to mitigate flat defence 
budgets in the established North American 
and European markets.
Competition
•  GE, Pratt & Whitney, Honeywell and Safran 
are the main competition in our sectors.
•  In Europe, large defence programmes tend 
to be addressed by consortia of two or more 
companies due to the political environment. 
Examples include our collaboration with ITP , 
MTU and Safran on the TP400 engine for the 
Airbus A400M and with GE Avio, ITP and 
MTU on the EJ200 engine for the 
Eurofighter Typhoon.
•  We support/lead sales campaigns globally on 
behalf of Eurojet for export sales opportunities 
of Eurofighter Typhoon. 
•  Barriers to entry are high and we do not 
envisage the competitive landscape changing 
significantly in the near future.

Chief Executive’s review / Business review
The Lockheed Martin C - 130J is one of the most 
reliable and versatile transport aircraft in the 
world (the KC - 130J being the tanker version). 
Powered by the Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine, 
the C-130J family of aircraft follows on from 
the original, venerable, C-130, which is still 
giving sterling service all over the world 
with its Rolls-Royce T56 powerplants.
In fact, Rolls-Royce has breathed further life 
into the T56 by developing a new version 
of the engine which is delivering significant 
fuel savings and which the Group believes 
will see the T56 continue in service for many 
years to come. In December 2015, we 
announced that Rolls-Royce was one of three 
companies to benefit from a £369m contract 
to support the RAF’s C-130 fleet.
The C - 130J has also seen developments 
beyond its transport and refuelling role. 
One of the lessons learned in Afghanistan 
was the constant demand for airborne video 
surveillance and the requirement for a 
‘ quick strike’ weapon to help protect troops 
on the ground. The US Marine Corps turned 
to the KC - 130J. The aircraft can loiter in the air 
for over ten hours thanks to the performance 
of its AE 2100 engines and so they armed it 
with a quick strike weapon that would not 
affect the core mission of aerial refuelling. 
In its tanker role, the aircraft has the ability 
to refuel both low-speed helicopters and 
high-speed jet aircraft by changing the

OPERATIONAL  
REVIEW
Underlying revenue of £2,385m was 3% lower 
on a constant currency basis (12% lower at 
actual rates). Original equipment revenue 
was 5% lower, reflecting weaker oil & gas 
markets and weaker governmental demand 
which peaked in 2014. This was partially 
offset by an improved luxury yacht demand 
and some recovery in our sections of the 
construction and agriculture market where 
new emissions regulations increased 
demand. Underlying service revenues were 
up 3% despite some weakness in spare parts 
sales in North America and Europe.
Gross margins were slightly lower at 26.6% 
(2014: 27.3%) reflecting a change in product 
mix and lower overall volumes as expected.
Underlying profit declined 15% as a result 
of the lower gross margins. On a constant 
currency basis costs below gross margin 
were unchanged.
Summary
Power Systems is a leading provider of high- and medium-speed 
reciprocating engines, complete propulsion and drive systems, distributed 
energy solutions and fuel injection systems. The business serves the 
marine, naval, land defence, rail, mining, oil & gas, construction & 
agriculture and power generation markets through its core brands MTU, 
MTU Onsite Energy, Bergen and L ’Orange. 
Key highlights
  Underlying revenue 3% lower; weaker 
original equipment partially offset

The energy segment generated an increased 
order intake in 2015 reflecting good growth 
in gas gensets, particularly in Asia. In 
addition, the easing of the trading embargo 
with Iran is enabling the business to secure 
a good foothold in the country. As a result, 
we enjoy a strong market position within 
back-up power, particularly for larger 
mission-critical applications, which is 
a growing market. Recent notable orders 
came from Kuwait, Turkey and Bangladesh 
for the provision of back-up power 
for hospital modernisations and continuous 
power for a steel mill.
Power Systems outlook
The outlook for Power Systems remains 
steady. The business finished the year 
with a healthy order book for many of its 
key markets. As a result, while some markets 
remain difficult, we continue to expect 
the business to deliver modest growth 
in revenue and profit in 2016.

Investment and business 
development
Our Power Systems business serves a variety 
of markets ranging from marine, industrial, 
construction & agriculture to defence and 
power generation. This diversity enabled 
the business to mitigate some of the weak 
environment, particularly that linked to oil 
and commodities.
2015 order intake was £2.5bn (2014: £2.6bn) 
with the closing order book broadly unchanged 
at £1.9bn. Within this, the defence sector 
demonstrated greater resilience with a 
combination of a higher proportion of 
long-term service contracts together with the 
winning of the first order worth approximately 
€80m from the British Army for 589 MTU diesel 
engines for the new Scout Specialist Vehicle.
Within the broad range of industrial 
applications, while a number of markets 
deteriorated through the year, there was 
positive news. This included contract wins 
from a Chinese company for 232 MTU Series 
4000 engines for freight locomotives bound 
for South Africa, and further orders for 
luxury yacht engines. An extension to our 
longstanding co-operation with Daimler 
was also agreed for the development 
of a new range of industrial engines, 
which comply with new EU off-highway 
regulations for reduced soot emissions. 34 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

MARKET REVIEW
The markets served by Power Systems 
are driven by global megatrends such 
as increasing population growth, rising 
energy, resource and food demand, 
increasing and stricter emissions legislation 
and government defence budgets. Despite 
the current market downturn in some of 
our markets, most noticeably in oil & gas 
and offshore, we expect long-term recovery 
in these and continuous growth in all 
of our markets. We estimate that 
Power Systems ‘off-highway’ reciprocating 
engine markets offer an opportunity 
of £650bn.
Competition
•  Fragmented competitor landscape in 
‘off-highway’ engine markets which varies 
depending on specific market segments – 
many players although a few dominate. 
•  Continuing industry consolidation results 
in strong, large scale and integrated players.
•  Expansion of western competitors in our 
specific core engine markets.
•  Competition from Asia increasingly focusing 
on higher power ranges where MTU operates. 
•  While traditional competition has been limited 
to engine suppliers, solution providers are 
becoming more relevant.    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 35
Strategic Report 
Chief Executive’s review / Business review
During 2015, Rolls-Royce completed further 
trials on its hybrid drive power system, the 
result of five years of pioneering work. 
A conventional MTU railway PowerPack 
combines all the individual elements needed 
for power and efficiency into a single 
functional unit mounted on a supporting 
frame. MTU has delivered more than 6,000 
of these PowerPacks to the rail industry.
The MTU hybrid PowerPack combines the 
benefits of a conventional diesel system 
with an electric propulsion module, energy 
storage and propulsion control system.
The basic idea of hybrid rail technology is 
that the kinetic energy initially generated by 
the diesel engine is recovered via an electric 
motor operating as an electric brake. This 
energy is stored chemically in a powerful 
battery for later use.
The recovery of the kinetic energy in braking 
mode is extremely energy- and cost-efficient, 
particularly in stop-and-go situations on 
local public transport lines where there are 
a large number of stops and on inclined rail 
sections on hilly terrains.
In 2015, for the first time, MTU performed 
its own tests on a hybrid train. During the 
tests, fuel consumption was shown to be 
reduced by more than 23% compared 
to straightforward diesel mode. Under 
optimum conditions, MTU believes fuel 
savings of 25% or more are possible.
High-efficiency power for trains

energy-saving combination of a 
conventional diesel engine and 
an electric drive system. 36 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

MARINE
OPERATIONAL  
REVIEW
Underlying revenue of £1,324m was 16% lower 
on a constant currency basis (down 23% at 
actual rates). Within this, original equipment 
revenues were 19% down at £773m. Service 
revenues were more robust, although still 
declined 10%. This reflected weaknesses 
in offshore and merchant, as ship owners 
deferred overhaul and maintenance on the 
back of reduced utilisation of their vessels.
As a result of the revenue weaknesses, price 
pressure and cost under-recovery, gross 
margins declined 500 basis points to 19.6% 
and overall gross margin was £260m, £139m 
lower than in 2014. As a result, with only 
modest reductions to date being achieved 
in corporate, administration and other costs, 
underlying profit was £15m, 94% down 
on a constant currency basis.
Around £15m of restructuring charges 
were incurred in 2015 and excluding these, 
underlying profit declined 83%. In the first 
half we took a non-underlying charge 
of £69m for the impairment of goodwill 
on two of our businesses owing to a less 
favourable business outlook, partly driven 
by the impact of market deteriorations 
on our offshore businesses.
Summary
Marine is a leading provider of complex and integrated propulsion and 
handling systems to the maritime offshore, merchant and naval markets. 
The product offering ranges from individual items of equipment 
to integrated systems and flexible mission-critical solutions, including 
complete vessel designs. The business has more than 4,000 customers. 
Seventy naval forces and over 30,000 commercial vessels use our equipment.
Key highlights
  Underlying revenue down 16%; weak 
offshore markets impacting both OE 
and aftermarket revenues.
  Underlying profit before financing down 
94%; significant reduction in gross 
margin, led by lower volumes, and higher 
restructuring costs only partially offset 
by reduced commercial and 
administration costs.
  Challenging outlook for 2016; led  
by reduced demand in offshore  
oil & gas markets.
  Launched two restructuring programmes 
in 2015 focused on manufacturing 
footprint and back-office functions; 
expected benefits to start to accrue 
from 2016 onwards.

ship equipment for a dive support vessel.  
We also saw demand from non-oil related 
sectors such as wind farm support and 
fishing trawlers.
Activity within our target merchant sectors 
was subdued, but we made progress in our 
strategy of developing markets for offshore 
derived technologies within specialist areas 
such as azimuth propulsion systems for 
double-ended ferries. We also delivered Asia’s 
first LNG-powered tug and the first of two 
all-gas powered cargo vessels for a Norwegian 
transport company.  
The naval business was focused on further 
development work and deliveries against 
contracts in both the UK and US. These 
included the first DDG 1000 multi-mission 
destroyer class for the US Navy and the world’s 
largest, gas turbine engines, the MT30 for the 
UK’s two new aircraft carriers. We also signed 
a contract to supply MT30s for operation 
on the first three of the Royal Navy’s new 
Type 26 Global Combat Ship.
Product development work within the 
business included expanding the range 
of permanent magnet-based propulsion 
systems, as well as spearheading research 
into our pioneering ship intelligence 
technology focused on data-driven value-
added services.
Marine outlook
Overall the outlook for Marine remains 
cautious. We expect that the market will 
continue to be hit by low oil prices which 
will impact on demand for our products 
and services. As a result we will sustain our 
cost reduction programmes, focusing on 
manufacturing facilities, supply chain 
and overhead costs, in order to drive a more 
competitive business while also adapting 
to volume risks. 
As set out in November 2015, we expect the 
net impact of weak trading conditions and 
cost saving initiatives to result in 2016 profits 
being between £75m and £100m lower 
than those achieved in 2015. As a result, 
the business is expected to be significantly 
loss making in 2016.

Investment and business 
development
The focus in 2015 has been on repositioning 
the Marine business to reflect the very 
challenging market environment and outlook.  
During the year, we also announced a number 
of restructuring programmes that will in total 
lead to the loss of around 1,000 employees 
in operations and back-office functions as 
we shrink our Northern European footprint, 
reduce indirect headcount, and consolidate 
manufacturing activity. This will deliver 
projected cost savings of £65m per annum 
from 2017 onwards and create a business 
better able to compete in an increasingly 
cost-conscious market place which is 
geographically shifting towards Asia.
Overall, the Marine order book declined 26% 
during the year, mainly reflecting a very weak 
offshore market, particularly in Northern 
Europe. Orders for new vessels, projects 
and services were all sharply lower than 2014 
and as a result order intake was only £997m, 
45% down on the previous year.
The offshore market was extremely weak 
reflecting a low oil price and reduced capital 
expenditure within the upstream oil 
exploration and related services sectors. 
T argeted investment in R&D and improving 
our Asian position saw progress later in the 
year with two major orders from China. These 
comprised an equipment contract for nine 
tug supply vessels and a package of advanced  38 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

Market dynamics
•  Increasing environmental legislation 
and system efficiency requirements.
•  Population growth is leading to an increasing 
energy and resources demand for cargo and 
passenger transportation in the long term.
•  Increasing global and regional trade and 
transport of goods with effects on short-
sea shipping.
•  Strong shift from traditional markets towards 
Asia, both in shipbuilding and operation.
•  Geopolitics and an increasing multipolar world 
results in increasing defence expenditures 
especially in emerging markets which 
stimulates demand for naval vessels.
•  Increased technology requirements for harsher

•  Currently significant challenges in offshore 
markets due to low oil prices and weak 
investment signals.
Business risks 
•  Markets: significant reduction in oil price 
creates pressure in the offshore market with 
all customer groups seeking to reduce costs 
and capital commitments.
•  Order delays and cancellations impact our 
revenue, cash and profit but also put our supply 
chain under financial stress.
•  Competition: competitors react to a depressed 
market by cutting costs, pricing aggressively 
and partnering with other players.
•  Business continuity: the main risk is our key 
suppliers remaining solvent. We monitor and 
manage this to ensure no supplier has critical 
mass and maintain business continuity plans for 
these risks and other operational risks such as IT.
•  Technology: failure to invest in the right 
technologies to meet customer demand 
in the future.
•  Risk of product failure in the field resulting 
in the need for intervention to rectify the issue 
with financial consequences.
Opportunities 
•  Capture value on more advanced vessels 
in offshore.
•  Grow in tugs, ferries and workboats and 
short-sea shipping in merchant segments.
•  Continue to leverage the joint value proposition

NUCLEAR
OPERATIONAL REVIEW
Underlying revenue increased 9% on a 
constant currency basis, led by growth 
in both original equipment and services. 
In particular, growth in submarine activities 
was strong. Revenue growth for our 
instrumentation and controls businesses 
was also good, particularly in Europe. 
Despite the growth in revenue, gross margin 
declined by 240 basis points to 16.2% or 
£111m. This was largely due to increased 
costs on a number of projects with lower 
margin. Gross margin was also impacted by a 
reclassification of site costs from commercial, 
administration and other of around £7m. 
This favourably benefited costs below gross 
margin which also benefited from lower 
R&D charges as a result of an R&D credit 
of £19m which covered the current and the 
two previous years. Excluding this, underlying 
profit before tax was £50m, in line with the 
prior year. After the release, underlying profit 
of £70m is 40% up on the prior year.
Investment and business 
developments
The order book fell around 13%, reflecting 
delivery of our long-term contracts across 
both submarines and civil nuclear businesses. 
New orders were biased to the second half 
of the year, benefiting from the expansion 
of our business reach and capabilities.
Our civil nuclear business focuses on 
multi-year projects and specialist services 
for what is a growing global industry. 
We were selected as preferred bidder by 
EDF to work on heat exchangers and waste 
treatment for the Hinkley Point C project in 
the UK and we were selected by Hitachi to be 
part of the Wylfa power station delivery team, 
the second nuclear power station scheduled 
in the UK’s new-build programme. We also 
won a contract to supply safety measurement 
systems for the entire French fleet of 900MW 
reactors. These mandates help to further 
consolidate our significant position in the 
European marketplace and position us well 
to seek further opportunities for partnerships 
in growing nuclear markets. 
Summary
Nuclear is a leader in propulsion system design and development for the 
Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet and is the sole provider and technical 
authority, managing all aspects of plant design, safety, manufacture, 
performance and through-life support.
In civil nuclear we provide nuclear reactor vendors and utility operators 
with integrated, long-term support services and solutions spanning the 
whole reactor lifecycle, from concept design through to obsolescence 
management and plant-life extension. Safety-critical systems have been 
supplied to around 50% of the global nuclear power plants in service. 
We have been a key player in the nuclear industry for more than 50 years.
Key highlights
  Underlying revenue 9% higher; strong 
service revenues led by increased 
submarine work.
  Underlying profit before financing 
unchanged, excluding the benefit from a 
£19m R&D credit; volume benefit offset 
by lower margins.

In the US our acquisition of R.O.V. Technologies 
Inc. in March 2015 expanded our nuclear 
services portfolio, bringing complementary 
Boiling Water Reactor expertise and 
broadening our existing Pressurised Water 
Reactor remote inspection capability.
Our submarine activities have concentrated 
on delivering against long-term contracts for 
the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, 
including delivery of the nuclear propulsion 
system to power HMS Artful, the third 
Astute-class submarine, which was launched 
in August 2015. Our work on the Vanguard 
class included work on a refuelling 
programme and also the first successful 
upgrade to the reactor control and 
instrumentation update for HMS Vengeance. 
At the Naval Reactor Test Establishment, 
HMS Vulcan, the PWR2 test facility reactor 
was safely shut down having completed its 
prototyping role. Development work on the 
new PWR3 power plant for the Successor 
submarine fleet continues with contract 
extensions agreed in preparation ahead of 
the government final investment decision.
Nuclear outlook
The outlook for Nuclear remains steady. Both 
submarines and civil nuclear enjoy long-term 
secure aftermarket revenues. While business 
development opportunities remain modest 
in the near-term, new power plants for the 
Successor together with long-term 
opportunities to develop relevant products 
for civil nuclear applications should provide 
incremental growth.
MARKET REVIEW
All respected global energy forecasts predict 
that nuclear power will continue to play 
a significant role in providing low-carbon, 
continuous and secure power. The demand 
for mission-critical equipment, systems and 
engineering services and the associated 
reactor support services for the civil nuclear 
market is forecast to be £360bn over the next 
20 years.
Market dynamics
•  Population growth and improved living 
standards in emerging markets are driving 
a rise in demand for electricity.
•  Within the future energy mix, low-carbon 
energy is expected to increase, with nuclear 
energy accounting for a significant share. 
•  Growth in nuclear power generation is 
predominantly driven by non-OECD countries; 
strong growth is expected especially in China.
•  Solid growth in mature markets based 
on current operations and plant life extensions.
Competition
•  In civil nuclear the competitor landscape is 
fragmented and comprises reactor vendors, 
original equipment manufacturers, multi-skilled 
companies and nuclear operators in service.
•  Plant operators increasingly outsource 
service activities.
Business risks 
•   Delivery: failure to meet customer expectations 
or regulatory requirements.
•  Markets: if nuclear markets do not grow as 
anticipated due to external or other political 
events then business will be diminished.
•  Customer strategy: if programmes are cancelled 
as a result of strategic decisions, such as 
abandonment of the UK nuclear deterrent, 
or vertical integration by reactor vendors, 
then future revenues will be diminished.
•  If we experience a major product failure 
in service, then this could result in loss of life 
and critical damage to our reputation.
•  If we suffer a major disruption in our supply 
chain, then our delivery schedules may be 
delayed, damaging our financial performance 
and reputation.
Opportunities 
•  Increasing the pace of growth of the civil 
nuclear business.
•  Focusing on growth regions beyond current 
core markets.
•  Strengthening our position with the rapidly 
growing importance of China in the civil 
nuclear market.
•  Capturing a higher share of the nuclear service 
market through extension of our geographic reach.
Key Rolls-Royce differentiators
•  Unique key technology capability in defence 
and civil nuclear with substantial credibility 
(more than 50 years’ experience); broad mix 
of offerings over the whole lifecycle; reactor 
independent portfolio, capable of global reach.

During the year our order book increased by 
£2.7bn to £76.4bn. Key orders included our 
record single order from Emirates for 200 
Trent 900 engines which contributed $6.1bn 
to the order book. Throughout the year new 
order intake in our Marine business was 
very weak, driven by significant market 
deterioration in offshore. Overall, orders 
were lower in Defence and Nuclear, 
although we view the prospects for these 
businesses as unchanged, reflecting 
long-term orders won in previous years.
Consistent with the plans we laid out in November 2015, we have enhanced 
the financial disclosures for all our reporting segments to include gross margin, 
R&D and other costs below gross margin, as well as restructuring charges. 
In addition, within Civil Aerospace we have provided additional revenue 
segmentation and a trading cash flow breakdown. These disclosures apply 
to both 2014 and 2015 and should help further analysis of trading performance.

Underlying Group revenue declined 1% 
in 2015 compared to 2014 on a constant 
currency basis. This reflects a 5% decline 
in revenue from original equipment, partially 
offset by a 4% increase in services revenue, 
led by Civil Aerospace. By business on a 
constant currency basis, Civil Aerospace 
revenue increased 3%, Defence Aerospace 
revenue decreased 5%, Power Systems revenue 
decreased 3%, Marine revenue decreased 16% 
and Nuclear revenue increased 9%.
Underlying profit before financing of £1,492m 
(2014: £1,681m) was 11% lower on a constant 
currency basis, led by a significant reduction in 
Marine profit, driven by weak offshore markets 
in particular. Civil Aerospace was down 
year-on-year, although performance was 
helped by around £222m of retrospective 
benefits (2014: £150m) led by refining the basis 
for taking account of risk in our forecasts of

Net debt
The Group is committed to maintaining 
a robust balance sheet and a strong, 
investment-grade credit rating, which it 
believes are important when selling products 
which will be in service for decades. Standard 
& Poor’s updated its rating in January 2016 
to A/negative outlook and Moody’s 
maintained a rating of A3/stable.
At the end of 2015, the Group’s net cash 
balance reduced from £666m to a net debt 
position of £111m, reflecting the £179m 
positive free cash inflow, share repurchases 
totalling £414m and shareholder payments 
of £421m. Other items include residual 
payments related to the divestment of the 
Energy business and non-cash foreign 
exchange movements. On 6 July 2015, we 
announced that we had curtailed the share 
buyback associated with the Energy business 
sale at the to-date total of £500m, including 
the shares purchased in 2014. During the 
year we refinanced our revolving credit 
facility, increasing it to £1.5bn, and issued 
two new US bonds, totalling US$1.5bn.

2015 and increased recognition of entry fees.
Underlying financing charges were £60m 
(2014: £61m). Underlying profit before tax 
was £1,432m (2014: £1,620m). The underlying 
tax charge was £351m, with an effective tax 
rate of 24.5% (2014: 24.0%).
Free cash flow
Cash capital expenditure in 2015 reduced 
to £479m (2014: £616m), largely reflecting 
lower spend on new aerospace facilities. 
Cash taxes were £160m (2014: £265m 
excluding Energy). The cash cost of defined 
benefit pension schemes in excess of the 
earnings charge was £46m (2014: £154m 
excluding Energy).
Overall, the free cash inflow for the year 
was £179m (2014: inflow of £447m, adjusted 
for Energy). The significant decline from 2014 
primarily reflects lower trading margins 
and adverse working capital movements.

year was slightly higher than expectations.
future revenue on long-term contracts, and the 
reversal of previously recognised impairment 
on contractual aftermarket rights (CARs) and 
release of a related provision. Defence 
Aerospace delivered an improved year-on-year 
profit which included one-time contract 
benefits, led by contract extensions and 
reduced long-term costs. Power Systems was 
down year-on-year in line with our 
expectations on a constant currency basis 
as the business managed well within a 
number of weaker markets. Marine, as 
expected, was sharply lower, reflecting the 
weak oil & gas offshore sector and Nuclear was 
in line, after excluding the positive R&D credit.
The R&D charge increased 11% over 2014 on 
a constant currency basis, largely reflecting 
ongoing investments in Civil Aerospace for 
the T rent 1000 TEN and T rent XWB-97 , together 
with higher spending on the Trent 7000 
and corporate jet programmes. In addition, 
we increased investment in future technology 
demonstrator programmes and improved 
emissions solutions for Power Systems 
applications. In addition, capitalisation of R&D 
declined significantly largely due to the entry

exc Energy Mark-to-market adjustments are principally 
driven by movements in the GBP:USD 
exchange rate which moved from 1.56 to 1.48 
during 2015.
Movements in other financial instruments 
relate entirely to financial risk and revenue 
sharing arrangements. The put option on 
the non-controlling interest in Power 
Systems was exercised in 2014, so this had 
no impact in 2015.
The effects of acquisition accounting 
in accordance with IFRS 3 are excluded 
from underlying profit so that all businesses 
are measured on an equivalent basis.  
Impairment of goodwill principally relates 
to the Marine business. 
Costs associated with the substantial 
closure, or exit from, a site, facility or activity 
are classified as exceptional restructuring 
and excluded.
Profits and losses arising on acquisitions 
and disposals during the year are excluded.
Net financing on post-retirement schemes 
is excluded from underlying profit.
Appropriate tax rates are applied to these 
adjustments, the net effect of which was an 
increase of £275m in the reported tax charge 
(2014: £237m increase, including a £64m 
reduction in the amount of recoverable 
advance corporation tax recognised).
The 2014 reported results also included 
£142m relating to discontinued operations.
Underlying income statement
The ‘Other’ category in the segmental analysis 
includes residual retained assets relating to 
the Energy business which were not included 
in the sale to Siemens in 2014 and a one-off 
intellectual property settlement of £58m. 
The value of these is not material to the Group.
Underlying profit before financing and 
taxation is discussed in the Business review 
on pages 22 to 41.
Underlying financing costs were stable 
versus 2014. An increase in net interest 
of £13m was offset by changes in other 
underlying financing costs. An underlying 
foreign exchange gain of £34m is included, 
arising from realised gains on foreign 
exchange contracts settled to translate 
overseas dividends into sterling. 
Underlying taxation was £351m, an 
underlying tax rate of 24.5% compared with 
24.0% in 2014.
Underlying EPS was lower reflecting the 
reduction in underlying profit after tax, 
partially offset by a reduction in the 
average number of shares as a result 
of the share buyback.
At the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 
2016, the Directors will recommend an issue 
of 71 C Shares with a total nominal value 
of 7 .1p for each ordinary share. Together with 
the interim issue on 4 January 2016 of 92.7 
C Shares for each ordinary share with a total 
nominal value of 9.27p; this is the equivalent 
of a total annual payment to ordinary 
shareholders of 16.37p for each ordinary share. 
Further details are included on page 178.
Reported results
Consistent with past practice and IFRS 
accounting standards, the Group provides both 
reported and underlying figures. We believe 
underlying figures are more representative 
of the trading performance, by excluding 
the impact of year-end mark-to-market 
adjustments, principally the GBP:USD hedge 
book. In addition, financing of post -retirement 
benefits, effects of acquisition accounting and 
impairment of goodwill are also excluded. 
Adjustments between underlying profit and 
reported profit in the income statement are set 
out in more detail in note 2 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements. This basis of presentation 
has been applied consistently.
Balance sheet
Intangible assets (note 9) represent 
long-term assets of the Group. These assets 
decreased by £159m in the year, with 
additions of £408m being more than offset 
by amortisation of £407m, impairments to 
goodwill of £75m (including £69m Marine 
impairment reported in the first half) and 
exchange losses of £134m (largely relating 
to euro-denominated intangible assets 
arising from the acquisition of Rolls-Royce 
Power Systems AG).
The CARs balance increased by £156m to 
£405m. The increase included £50m arising 
from the reversal of previously recognised 
impairments. During the year, following 
analysis of the first major overhauls of 
Trent 1000 engines, the recoverable amount 
of certain CARs has been reassessed. This 
demonstrated that aftermarket cash flows 
from these engines are better than originally 
assumed, arising from both operational and 
contractual performance improvements. 
Accordingly, cumulative impairments prior 
to 2015 of £50m have been reversed. 
This has resulted in the capitalisation of 
£22m of CARs in 2015 that would otherwise 
have been impaired, including £16m 
recognised in the interim results.

with IAS 19. While the corporate bond yields 
used to measure the liabilities remained 
broadly stable, gilt yields which are the 
principal driver of asset valuations 
increased, reducing the value of the assets.  
The schemes adopt a low risk investment 
strategy that reduces funding volatility 
(for which both assets and liabilities are 
measured on a gilt basis); interest rate 
and inflation risks are largely hedged and 
the exposure to equities is around 9% 
of scheme assets.
The increase in overseas schemes arose largely 
due to higher discount rates in Germany and 
the US. 
Provisions (note 18) largely relate to 
warranties and guarantees provided to 
secure the sale of OE and services. The 
decrease is largely a result of the utilisation 
of warranty and restructuring provisions. 
Net financial assets and liabilities (note 17) 
include the fair value of derivatives, 
financial RRSAs and C Shares. The increase 
in liabilities primarily reflects the impact 
on the US$ hedge book of the GBP:USD 
exchange rate falling to 1.48 from 1.56 at 
the beginning of the year.
The Group hedges transactional foreign 
exchange exposures to reduce volatility. 
The most significant exposure is net US$ 
income. The US$ hedge book increased 
by 12.5% to US$28.8bn, which represents 
around five years of net exposure and has 
an average book rate of £1 to US$1.59.
Net TotalCare assets relate to long-term 
service agreement contracts in the Civil 
Aerospace business, including the flagship 
services product TotalCare. These assets 
represent the timing difference between the 
recognition of income and costs in the income 
statement and cash receipts and payments.
The net asset increased in 2015 by £406m 
(2014: £463m), reflecting accounting for 
new ‘linked’ engines of £521m (2014: £588m) 
and retrospective TotalCare accounting 
adjustments of £222m (2014: £150m) taken 
in the year, offset by cash flows and other 
items of £337m (2014: £275m).
Customer financing facilitates the sale of OE 
and services by providing financing support 
to certain customers. Where such support is 
provided by the Group, it is almost exclusively 
to customers of the Civil Aerospace business 
and takes the form of various types of credit 
FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Carrying values of intangible assets are 
assessed for impairment against the present 
value of forecast cash flows generated by 
the intangible asset. The principal risks 
remain: reductions in assumed market 
share; programme timings; increases in unit 
cost assumptions; and adverse movements 
in discount rates. Other than noted above, 
there have been no significant impairments 
in 2015.
Property, plant and equipment (note 10) 
increased by £44m. Capital expenditure 
of £494m was largely offset by depreciation 
of £373m, disposals of £34m and foreign 
exchange movements of £32m.
Investments in joint ventures and associates 
(note 11) increased modestly, principally 
as the share of retained profit exceeded 
dividends received.
Net post-retirement scheme (deficits)/
surpluses (note 19) decreased by £632m, 
comprising a reduction of £692m in the 
UK and an increase of £60m overseas.  
The reduction in UK schemes is principally 
due to relative movements in assumptions 
used to value the underlying assets and 
liabilities in the UK schemes in accordance

Pensions: contributions to defined benefit 
pension schemes in 2015 reduced by £63m, 
which included a reduction in the UK deficit 
funding payments of £36m and the non-
recurrence of discretionary increase 
contributions of £33m. The total operating 
charge increased by £43m largely due to past 
service credits of £8m in 2015 compared to 
£31m in 2014. Funding of defined benefit 
schemes is expected to be similar in 2016.
Shareholder payments: the reduction 
reflects the fact that no dividend was 
paid by Power Systems to Daimler AG 
(2014: £76m), offset by an increase in the 
redemption of C Shares of £15m.
Discontinued operations in 2015 reflect a 
sales price adjustment of £42m paid in 2015 
on the 2014 disposal of the Energy business 
and wind-down costs.
and asset value guarantees. These exposures 
produce contingent liabilities that are 
outlined in note 18. Contingent liabilities 
represent the maximum aggregate 
discounted gross and net exposure in respect 
of delivered aircraft, regardless of the point in 
time at which such exposures may arise. 
During 2015, the Group’s gross exposure on 
delivered aircraft reduced by £119m, mainly 
due to guarantees expiring.
Summary funds flow
Movement in working capital includes an 
increase in the net TotalCare asset of £406m 
and a reduction in the amount of net 
customer deposits of £143m. The reduction 
in customer deposits is largely in the Marine 
business as a result of lower order intake in the 
offshore market and lower government spend. 
Expenditure on property, plant and 
equipment and intangible assets: the 
decrease reflects reductions in additions to 
property, plant and equipment (£174m), 
participation fees and certification costs 
(£86m) and capitalised development costs 
(£45m), offset by increased expenditure on 
contractual aftermarket rights (£68m) and 
foreign exchange movements of £51m.

Description Why we measure it How we have performed 
STEM
Reach 6 million people 
through our STEM 
education programmes 
and activities by 2020
We aim to inspire future generations 
in Science, Technology, Engineering and 
Mathematics (STEM) through education 
outreach programmes and activities that 
demonstrate the life-long opportunities 
that STEM careers can offer.
Our programmes reached 1.6 million people 
worldwide in 2015, 70% of whom were actively 
engaged in one or more STEM activity. Many 
programmes were aimed at groups currently 
under-represented in engineering careers, 
reflecting our commitment to encouraging 
greater diversity in the workplace. 
Employee wellbeing
All sites to achieve our 
employee health and 
wellbeing LiveWell 
accreditation by 2020
Our goal is to enhance the personal health and 
wellbeing of our people to help them reach 
their full potential. The Rolls-Royce LiveWell 
accreditation programme will help to create a 
culture where healthy choices are encouraged 
and rewarded, including; smoke-free site 
policies, healthy food choices and exercise 
facilities. Sites are also required to establish 
local employee wellbeing committees with 
annual objectives.
During 2015, all sites were required to complete 
an initial LiveWell accreditation gap analysis. One 
site, Bristol UK, met the criteria for accreditation 
and was awarded the LiveWell award. The 
introduction of our Global Smoke Free Campus  
policy in 2016 will enable more sites to obtain  
LiveWell accreditation.
Employee engagement

Trent engine family
to meet the ACARE  
Flightpath 2050 goals
The Advisory Council for Aviation Research 
and Innovation in Europe (ACARE) has set 
challenging goals for aviation to meet by 
2050. These include developing technologies 
and procedures to:
•  Reduce aircraft CO
2
 emissions  
by 75% (per passenger kilometre)
•  Reduce noise by 65%
•  Reduce oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) by 90%.
This is all relative to a typical new aircraft 
produced in 2000. 
This chart shows the  
improved efficiency  
levels of each generation  
of Trent engine from the  
Trent 800 onwards.
Improving emissions

MTU Series 4000 C&I 
engines
to meet future emissions 
regulations
Our MTU Series 4000 C&I engines meet the 
strictest current regulations for NO x and 
particulates reduction. This is achieved 
through field-tested and proven technology 
such as two-stage turbocharging and 
exhaust gas recirculation. We continue to 
invest in product R&D to meet future 
emissions regulations.

Better business
Description Why we measure it How we have performed 
Ethics
All employees to complete 
year-on-year Global Code 
of Conduct certification 
and mandatory ethics 
training
Our Global Code of Conduct sets out the 
ethical principles that underpin our values 
and the way we do business. It also provides 
guidance on how to apply these principles 
in everything we do.
During the year, 100% of our managers have 
certified that they have access to, understand 
and will comply with our Global Code of Conduct. 
Our ethics training continued to require 
managers to lead ethical discussions around 
dilemmas with their teams. During 2015, 97% of 
employees completed dilemma-based training. 
Energy 
Reduce energy use in our 
operations and facilities  
by 30%, normalised by 
revenue, by 2020 
(excluding product test and 
development) 
Understanding our energy use helps us to 
identify inefficiency and opportunities for 
improvement across our global operations 
and activities. Upgrading existing facilities 
and investing in energy efficient technology 
helps us to reduce energy consumption 
and cost. 
We continue to invest in energy efficient 
technology to reduce our energy consumption 
and cost. Our energy use in 2015 was 
112 MWh/£m. This represents a decrease 
of 3% compared to 2014. We have invested 
in upgrading lighting systems, variable speed 
drives and voltage optimisation. We have also 
introduced more efficient cooling systems. 
GHG emissions
4
 
Reduce greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions in our 
operations and facilities 
by 50%, absolute, by 2025 
(excluding product test and 
development) 
Investing in renewable energy sources and 
other opportunities to reduce our GHG 
emissions reduces cost and mitigates risk 
associated with energy price volatility. 
Our total GHG emissions for 2015, excluding 
product test and development, was 455 ktCO
2
e. 
This represents an 8% reduction from 2014. 
We continue to drive energy efficiency and 
have developed a number of low carbon and 
renewable energy projects across our global 
facilities. These include combined heat and 
power, tri-generation power systems and solar. 
Waste
Reduce total solid and liquid 
waste in our operations and 
facilities by 25%, normalised 
by revenue, by 2020
We recognise that improving the 
environmental performance of our 
operations contributes to profitable growth. 
The four principal waste streams that 
contribute to our waste production are: 
recyclable solid wastes; liquid wastes sent 
for disposal; recyclable metals; and solid 
wastes sent for landfill.
We have seen a modest reduction in the amount 
of waste that we dispose of from our sites. 
Our total solid and liquid waste, normalised 
by revenue, was 4.31 t/£m in 2015. 
This represents a 3% reduction compared to 
2014. New programmes launched in 2015 and 
continuing into 2016 are expected to accelerate 
waste reduction across our global operations. 
Recycling
Zero waste to landfill  
in our operations and 
facilities, by 2020
(excluding hazardous waste)
We are committed to both increasing our 
recycling rates and achieving zero waste to 
landfill from our manufacturing and office 
facilities. We are concentrating on the 
recycling of metals and packaging. 
Hazardous waste will continue to be 
managed in a safe and controlled manner.
The amount of waste sent to landfill has increased 
from 6,700 tonnes in 2014 to 7 ,200 tonnes in 2015. 
This is due in part to an increase in waste from 
our Power Systems business and improved waste 
reporting across the Group. Since 2009, we have 
reduced our waste to landfill by 3,000 tonnes 
and remain confident that more sites will achieve 
zero waste to landfill.
Safety 
Reduce total reportable 
injury (TRI) rate to 0.3 per 
100 employees by 2020, 
to achieve first quartile 
performance 
We are dedicated to providing a safe and 
healthy place of work for all our employees, 
contractors and visitors to our facilities and 
wherever they may work on our behalf. 
Our TRI rate deteriorated in 2015 to 0.82, 
compared to 0.64 in 2014. This is primarily 
due to the inclusion of Power Systems data and 
improved reporting of safety incidents across the 
Group. We continue to focus our improvement 
programmes on high consequence activities 
in accordance with our risk profile, for example 
electrical safety and process safety management.
Suppliers
All suppliers aligned  
to our own ambitions: 
all suppliers agree 
adherence to the Global 
Supplier Code of Conduct 
by 2016
Our Global Supplier Code of Conduct sets 
out the minimum standards of behaviour 
and practices we require of our suppliers. 
We work to align them to our own 
ambitions in ethics, and support suppliers 
in managing their energy and waste, and 
in completing submissions to the CDP. 
We released a revision to our Global Supplier 
Code of Conduct at the start of 2015. Our terms 
of business now include agreement to the Code, 
which makes our compliance expectations clear. 
75% of our suppliers have now contractually 
agreed adherence. We plan to launch strategic 
supplier monitoring programmes in 2016.

Description Why we measure it How we have performed 
Order book
+4%
The order book provides an indicator of future business. 
We measure it at constant exchange rates and list prices 
and include both firm and announced orders. In Civil Aerospace, 
it is common for a customer to take options for future orders 
in addition to firm orders placed. Such options are excluded from 
the order book. In Defence Aerospace, long-term programmes 
are often ordered for only one year at a time. In such 
circumstances, even though there may be no alternative engine 
choice available to the customer, only the contracted business 
is included in the order book. Conservatively, we only include the 
first seven years’ revenue of long-term aftermarket contracts.
The order book grew by 
£2.7bn. An increase 
of £3.8bn in Civil Aerospace 
was offset by a reduction of 
£0.4bn in Marine, reflecting 
the current weak market 
conditions.

Order intake is a measure of new business secured during 
the year and represents new firm orders, adjusted for the 
movement in the announced order book between the start and 
end of the period. Any orders which were recorded in previous 
periods and which are subsequently cancelled, reducing the 
order book, are included as a reduction to intake. We measure 
order intake at constant exchange rates and list prices and, 
consistent with the order book policy of recording the first seven 
years’ revenue of long-term aftermarket contracts, include the 
addition of the following year of revenue on long-term 
aftermarket contracts.
An increase of £0.9bn

- 1% excluding FX
Monitoring of revenue provides a measure of business growth. 
Underlying revenue is used as it reflects the impact of our 
FX hedging policy by valuing foreign currency revenue at the 
actual exchange rates achieved as a result of settling FX contracts. 
This provides a clearer measure of the year-on-year trend.
The reduction reflects 
a 9% reduction in OE 
revenue, offset by a 
3% increase in services 
revenue. Marine revenue 
fell by 23%, reflecting the 
weak market conditions.

Net R&D expenditure

6.2%
This measure reflects the need to generate current returns 
as well as to invest for the future. We measure R&D as the 
self-funded expenditure before both amounts capitalised in 
the year and amortisation of previously-capitalised balances. 
We expect to spend approximately 5% of underlying revenues 
on R&D although this proportion will fluctuate depending on 
the stage of development of current programmes. We expect 
this proportion will reduce modestly over the medium term. 
The increase is largely 
due to changes in net 
capitalisation, reflecting 
the phasing of new Civil 
Aerospace programmes, 
in particular the 
Trent XWB-84 and the 
Trent 1000 TEN.

52 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s review Key performance indicators Non-financial KPIs
As we undertake significant restructuring, reorganisation and transformation, it is imperative that we do not lose focus on our customers, 
and that we ensure our employees are fully engaged in the transformation. So for 2016, we are introducing two non-financial measures to the 
Annual Performance Related Award relating to customers and employees. In line with our remuneration policy, financial performance will still 
be required for any payout, as the non-financial measures will be subject to achieving a profit before taxation threshold.
Description How performance is measured
Customer satisfaction This is measured by the percentage of ‘on-time to purchase order’ and includes measures for new equipment, 
spare parts, equipment repair and overhaul. This is tracked Group-wide in our scheduling and order 
fulfilment system.
Employee engagement This is measured through our Employee Opinion Survey which produces a composite engagement score. 
The targets will be based on absolute scores.
Description Why we measure it How we have performed 
Capital expenditure  
as a proportion of 
underlying revenue
3.7%
To deliver on its commitments to customers, the Group 
invests significant amounts in its infrastructure. All proposed 
investments are subject to rigorous review to ensure that they 
are consistent with forecast activity and will provide value 
for money. We measure annual capital expenditure as the cost 
of property, plant and equipment acquired during the period 
and, over the medium term, expect a proportion of around 4%.
Expenditure reduced 
to £494m (2014: £668m)

the major investment in 
Civil Aerospace facilities 
nearing completion.

Underlying profit

-11%
We measure underlying profit before financing on a basis 
that shows the economic substance of the Group’s hedging 
strategies in respect of the transactional exchange rate and 
commodity price movements. In particular: (a) revenues and 
costs denominated in US dollars and euros are presented on the 
basis of the exchange rates achieved during the year; (b) similar 
adjustments are made in respect of commodity derivatives; and 
(c) consequential adjustments are made to reflect the impact 
of exchange rates on trading assets and liabilities and long-term 
contracts on a consistent basis.
The reduction reflects 
the reduction in revenues 
and the Group’s high level 
of fixed costs, which the 
transformation 
programme is addressing.

In a business requiring significant investment, we monitor

in net funds/debt during the year, before movements 
arising from payments to shareholders, acquisitions and 
disposals, and FX. 
The reduction reflects 
the lower profits and the

Chief Executive’s review / Key performance indicators PRINCIPAL RISKS
and functions and the detail of risks that meet 
the Group threshold are subject to review and 
challenge by the Executive Leadership T eam 
(EL T) and the Board during their risk reviews. 
This includes monitoring the status of 
mitigation actions, adequacy of controls and 
any incidents that have occurred since the last 
review. Risks are also captured during the 
strategy and business planning activities to 
inform the development of the principal risks.
The Board, assisted by the EL T , has carried out a 
robust assessment of, and reviewed our 
appetite for , the principal risks facing the 
Group. These include those that threaten the 
business model, future performance, solvency 
and liquidity. These reviews have been 
complemented by financial scenario modelling 
of our principal risks which is also used to 
support our viability statement on page 57 .

committee, undertakes periodic in-depth 
reviews of our principal risks in which it 
assesses our material controls and the 
effectiveness of our risk management and 
mitigation activities. 
Business units and functions are accountable 
for identifying and managing risk in line with 
the Group risk management policy. Business 
continuity plans are in place to mitigate 
continuity risks.
The Group’s enterprise risk team, led by the 
Director of Risk, is responsible for disseminating 
risk policy and processes and co-ordinating the 
effective operation of the RMS. Progress of 
actions to mitigate risks and the adequacy 
of risk controls are also now regularly reviewed 
by the sector audit committees.
Joint ventures constitute an increasingly large 
part of the Group’s activities. Responsibility for 
risk and internal control in joint ventures lies 
with the managers of those operations. We seek 
to exert influence over such joint ventures 
through board representation. Management 
and internal audit regularly review the activities 
of these joint ventures. 
The Board is aware that the effectiveness of risk 
management is highly dependent on behaviours, 
as a good process does not automatically lead 
to a good outcome. Our ethics and compliance 
improvement programme, aimed at securing 
compliance with our ethical standards, and the 
Global Code of Conduct are reinforcing the 
values and behaviours required, which in turn 
will continue to strengthen our risk 
management culture.
Principal risks
During the year , the Board and EL T focused on 
the principal risks and the actions and controls 
in place to manage them. 
This involved: discussing changes to the risks; 
reviewing the risk indicators for principal risks; 
and hearing from management about how 
risks will be managed.
This ongoing review of risks has resulted in 
a further principal risk being added this year : 
talent and capability. This risk has been added 
to reflect the significant transformation 
agenda ahead and our future growth 
requirements and plans.
Management of principal risks
Our risk framework ensures that risks are identified, managed and communicated at every level of the Group.

Risk management
Risk management is built into our daily 
activities and is an integral part of how we 
work: from our engineering design, through 
to engine production, servicing and how 
we run our operations.
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk 
management and internal control system and 
reviewing its effectiveness. The system is 
designed to identify and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and to provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. More information about 
our internal control system can be found in the 
Audit Committee report on page 95.
Our risk management system (RMS) helps 
us make better decisions and to deal with 
problems if they occur. It is implemented 
through: a Group-wide framework mandated 
in the Group risk management policy; 
a network of trained risk management 
facilitators; and a software tool.
In 2015, we performed a comprehensive review 
of our RMS and are implementing 
a programme of work to enhance our RMS 
which will continue to be embedded 
throughout 2016. This activity is sponsored by 
the General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer 
and is regularly reviewed by the Audit 
Committee. The enhancements touch all areas 
of our RMS including: categorisation, 
governance, operating model, reporting and 
infrastructure. 
Our RMS is designed so that principal risks can 
be identified from multiple sources. Key 
bottom-up risks are identified by businesses

Competitive position
The presence of large, financially strong 
competitors in the majority of our markets 
means that the Group is susceptible 
to significant price pressure for original 
equipment or services, even where our 
markets are mature, or the competitors 
are few. Our main competitors have 
access to significant government funding 
programmes, as well as the ability 
to invest heavily in technology and 
industrial capability.
• Accessing and developing key technologies and service offerings which differentiate 
us competitively (see Engineering and innovation on page 18).
• Focusing on being responsive to our customers and improving the quality, delivery and reliability 
of our products and services.
• Partnering with others effectively.
• Driving down cost and improving margins (see Chief Executive’s review on page 12).
• Protecting credit lines.
• Investing in innovation, manufacturing and production, and continuing governance of 
technology programmes (see Engineering and innovation on page 18 and Science & Technology 
Committee report on page 103).
• Maintaining a strong balance sheet to enable access to cost-effective sources of third-party funding.
• Understanding our competitors.
This principal risk is subject to review by the Board.

Political risk
Geopolitical factors that lead to an 
unfavourable business climate and 
significant tensions between major trading 
parties or blocs which could impact the 
Group’s operations. For example: explicit 
trade protectionism, differing tax or 
regulatory regimes, potential for conflict, 
or broader political issues. 
• Where possible, locating our facilities and supply chain in countries with a low level of political 
risk and/or ensuring that we maintain dual capability.
• Diversifying global operations to avoid excessive concentration of risks in particular areas.
• The international network of Rolls-Royce and its business units proactively monitoring 
local situations.
• Maintaining a balanced business portfolio with high barriers to entry and a diverse customer 
base (see Chief Executive’s review on page 8).
• Proactively influencing regulation where it affects us.
This principal risk is subject to review by the Board.

Major programme delivery
Failure to deliver a major programme 
on time, within budget, to specification, or 
technical performance falling significantly 
short of customer expectations, or not 
delivering the planned business benefits, 
would have potentially significant adverse 
financial and reputational consequences, 
including the risk of impairment of the 
carrying value of the Group’s intangible 
assets and the impact of potential litigation. 
• Major programmes are subject to Board approval (see Additional financial information on page 176).
• Reviewing major programmes at levels and frequencies appropriate to their criticality 
and performance, against key financial and non-financial deliverables and potential risks 
throughout the programme’s life cycle (see Additional financial information on page 176).
• Conducting technical audits at pre-defined points which are performed by a team that 
is independent from the programme.
• Requiring programmes to address the actions arising from reviews and audits and monitoring 
and controlling progress through to closure.
• Applying knowledge management principles to provide benefit to current and future programmes.
This principal risk is subject to review by the Board.

Compliance 
Non-compliance by the Group with 
legislation or other regulatory requirements 
in the regulated environment in which it 
operates (eg. export controls; offset; use of 
controlled chemicals and substances; and 
anti-bribery and corruption legislation) 
compromising our ability to conduct 
business in certain jurisdictions and 
exposing the Group to potential reputational 
damage, financial penalties, debarment from 
government contracts for a period of time, 
and/or suspension of export privileges or 
export credit financing, any of which could 
have a material adverse effect.
• Taking an uncompromising approach to compliance.
• Operating an extensive compliance programme. This programme and the Global Code 
of Conduct are disseminated throughout the Group and are updated from time to time to ensure 
their continued relevance, and to ensure that they are complied with, both in spirit and to the 
letter. The Global Code of Conduct and the Group’s compliance programme are supported by 
appropriate training (see Safety & Ethics Committee report on page 102).
• Strengthening of the ethics, anti-bribery and corruption, compliance and export control teams.
• A legal team is in place to manage any ongoing regulatory investigations.
• Implementing a comprehensive REACH compliance programme. This includes establishing 
appropriate data systems and processes, working with our suppliers, customers and trade 
associations and conducting research on alternative materials.

Market and financial shock
The Group is exposed to a number of market 
risks, some of which are of a macro-economic 
nature (eg. foreign currency, oil price, 
exchange rates) and some of which are more 
specific to the Group (eg. liquidity and credit 
risks, reduction in air travel or disruption 
to other customer operations). Significant 
extraneous market events could 
also materially damage the Group’s 
competitiveness and/or creditworthiness. 
This would affect operational results or the 
outcomes of financial transactions.
• Maintaining a strong balance sheet, through managing cash balances and debt levels 
(see Financial review on page 42).
• Providing financial flexibility by maintaining high levels of liquidity and an investment 
grade credit rating.
• Sustaining a balanced portfolio through earning revenue both from the sale of original 
equipment and aftermarket services, providing a broad product range and addressing 
diverse markets that have differing business cycles (see Chief Executive’s review on page 8).
• Deciding where and what currencies to source in, and where and how much credit risk is 
extended or taken. The Group has a number of treasury policies that are designed to 
hedge residual risks using financial derivatives (foreign exchange, interest rates and 
commodity price risk).

PRINCIPAL RISKS CONTINUED
56 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s review Principal risks Introduction
Rolls-Royce operates an annual planning 
process which includes strategic (greater 
than five years), medium-term (five year) 
and short-term (one year) financial forecasts, 
based on the inputs from each of the 
businesses. These plans and risks to their 
achievement are reviewed by the Board 
as part of its strategy review and budget 
approval processes. Once approved these 
plans are cascaded throughout the Group 
and are used as the basis for monitoring 
our performance, incentivising employees 
and providing external guidance 
to our shareholders.
The processes for identifying and managing 
the principal risks are described on pages 54 
to 56. As also described there, the risk 
management process, and in consequence 
the going concern and viability statements, 
are designed to provide reasonable but not 
absolute assurance.
Going concern
The going concern assessment considers 
whether it is appropriate to prepare the 
financial statements on a going concern basis.
As described on page 177 , the Group meets 
its funding requirements through a mixture 
of shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings, 
bonds and notes. At 31 December 2015, the 
Group had borrowing facilities of £5.1bn and 
total liquidity of £5.0bn, including cash and 
cash equivalents of £3.2bn and undrawn 
facilities of £1.8bn. £419m of the facilities 
mature in 2016.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
into account reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, show that the Group has 
sufficient financial resources. The Directors 
have reasonable expectations that the 
Company and the Group are well placed to 
manage business risks and to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future (which accounting standards require to 
be at least a year from the date of this report) 
and have not identified any material 
uncertainties to the Company’s and the 
Group’s ability to do so.
On the basis described above, the Directors 
consider it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated 
financial statements (in accordance with the 
‘Guidance on Risk Management, Internal 
Control and Related Financial and Business 
Reporting’ published by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2014).
Viability
The viability assessment considers solvency 
and liquidity over a longer period than 
for the purposes of the going concern 
assessment above. Inevitably, the degree 
of certainty reduces over this longer period.
In making the assessment, severe but 
plausible scenarios have been considered 
that estimate the potential impact of each 
of the principal risks arising over the 
assessment period, for example: the loss of 
a key element of the supply chain; the impact 
on aircraft travel of a global pandemic; or, 
a failure to achieve planned cost reductions. 
The scenarios assume an appropriate 
management response to the specific event, 
but not broader mitigating actions which 
could be undertaken, which were considered 
separately. The impacts of these scenarios 
were overlaid on the medium-term forecast 
to assess how the Group’s liquidity and 
solvency would be affected.
The assessment took account of the Group’s 
current funding, forecast requirements and 
existing committed borrowing facilities. 
It assumed that existing facilities could be 
refinanced as they mature. There are modest 
maturities over the first three years of the 
medium-term forecast with more significant 
maturities in 2019 and 2020. 
On the basis described above, the Board 
confirms that it has a reasonable expectation 
that the Company will be able to continue in 
operation and meet its liabilities as they fall 
due over the next five years, consistent with 
the period of the medium-term forecast.
In making this statement, the Directors have 
made the following key assumptions:
• that maturing facilities will be refinanced. 
The Group currently has access to global 
debt markets and expects to be able to 
refinance these facilities on commercially 
acceptable terms. The Group’s medium- 
and long-term financing plans are 
designed to allow for periods of adverse 
conditions in world capital markets but 
not a prolonged (say 12 month) period 
where debt markets were effectively 
closed to the Group;
• that in the event of multiple risks 
occurring and having a particularly severe 
effect on the Group, all potential actions, 
such as constraining capital spending 
and reducing or suspending payments 
to shareholders, would be taken on a 
timely basis. The Group believes it has 
the early warning mechanisms to identify 
the need for such actions and the ability 
to implement them on a timely basis 
if necessary; 
• that implausible scenarios, whether 
involving multiple risks occurring at the 
same time or the impact of individual 
risks occurring that cannot be mitigated 
by management actions to the degree 
assumed, do not occur. For instance, 
whilst the Directors have considered 
a scenario where cost reductions are 
not achieved and a major programme 
is delayed, they have not considered it 
plausible that any other of the key risks 
would crystallise in a way that would 
create a worse outcome over the five-year 
assessment period.

Current directorships and 
business interests
• Unitas Capital, senior adviser
Career, skills and experience
Sir Kevin joined Unitas Capital in 2012 
and served as partner and chairman 
of its operating advisor group until 
October 2015. He was chief executive 
officer of GKN plc until 31 December 
2011, having led GKN’s Aerospace 
division from 1999 to 2003. Before 
joining GKN, he spent nearly 20 years 
with British Aerospace (BAe plc), 
becoming group managing director of 
BAe’s New Business division. Sir Kevin 
served as a non-executive director 
of Scottish and Southern Energy plc 
between June 2004 and July 2008.
He was knighted in 2006 for services 
to industry and is a fellow of the 
University of Central Lancashire, The 
Royal Aeronautical Society and The 
Chartered Institute of Management.  
In its stewardship of Rolls-Royce, the Board 
recognises that excellence in corporate 
governance is essential in order to generate and 
protect value for our investors. This requires 
continuous focus but is particularly important 
in times of change and transformation. It is not 
just a matter of ensuring compliance with the 
latest regulatory guidance; strong corporate 
governance is the over -arching principle which 
gives management the confidence to run 
a sustainable business within an agreed 
framework of strategic direction and risk 
appetite. It sets the right tone to drive 
appropriate conduct and behaviour across 
all that we do. 
This year we have taken steps to improve the 
frequency and quality of our interactions 
with major shareholders and will continue 
to work on this. You can read more about 
this activity on page 68.
Early in the year we adopted and published 
on our website a new Board governance 
document that recognises the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 
(the Code). It contains the terms of reference 
of our principal Board committees and the 
matters reserved to the Board, and was 
further updated by the Board to reflect best 
practice in December 2015.
However, we did not stop at Code 
compliance. Our governance improvement 
work went much deeper this year by steering 
and supporting an update of internal 
governance arrangements at executive and 
operational levels. As a result, a new internal 
governance framework document is being 
rolled out to employees in 2016 to provide 
a clear and common understanding about 
how Rolls-Royce works and what is expected 
across the key governance areas. You can 
read about this important milestone project 
in the Nominations & Governance 
Committee report on page 73. 
The following Board committees met for 
the first time under their new mandates:
•  the Nominations & Governance 
Committee, with an expanded remit 
to provide more dedicated time and focus 
on corporate governance in addition to 
traditional nominations matters;
•  our combined Safety & Ethics Committee, 
created as a dedicated and focused 
oversight forum in acknowledgement 
of the critical emphasis we place on:
 –  promoting the highest standards 
of ethical behaviours throughout our 
organisation and with our partners,
 –  the safety of our products and our 
workforce which can be jeopardised 
by inappropriate behaviours as well 
as other factors, and 
 –  the continuing development of a 
sustainable, socially and 
environmentally responsible business;
•  the new Science & Technology 
Committee, formed to provide greater 
oversight of the Group’s innovation 
strategy and the direction of research, 
technology and development activities 
taking into account scientific and 
technological trends.
I led a review that resulted in some 
changes to the composition of our 
committees during 2015. The changes 
reflected the diversity of skills and 
experience amongst our Non-executive 
Directors (including those who joined the 
Board during 2015) and the value that 
they could each bring to the particular 
work of the committees. More 
information on the experience of our 
Directors is contained in the Nominations 
& Governance Committee report 
on page 71. Our current committee 
memberships are set out on pages 58 
to 61 and on page 65, and you can read 
about the remit and work of each 
committee during the year in the reports 
which follow on pages 69 to 104. 
The Board is satisfied that all committees 
are working effectively to deliver strong 
oversight and governance over their 
respective areas of responsibility, and are 
reporting appropriately to the Board, in 
accordance with their terms of reference.
The Board and each of its committees 
have also worked during the year to 
implement the recommendations made 
by Independent Audit in its 2014 Board 
effectiveness review. Independent Audit 
returned to conduct a follow-on survey 
and review in 2015 of how this work had 
progressed. You can read more about this 
on page 66. This was a useful 
independent assessment of 
improvements made throughout the year 
and also served to identify further areas 
for our continued focus into 2016.

Directors’ Report 
Corporate governance CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED
Appointments and re-appointments
We refreshed the composition of the Board with the appointment 
of three new Non-executive Directors; Irene Dorner, Alan Davies and 
Sir Kevin Smith. Warren East, who was previously a Non-executive 
Director, became the Chief Executive in July. Details of the 
appointment process are set out in the Nominations & Governance 
Committee report on pages 70 and 71.
Board induction and development
Newly appointed Directors follow a tailored induction programme, 
facilitated by the Company Secretary, which includes dedicated time 
with Group executives and scheduled trips to a variety of business 
sites. All Directors are encouraged to visit the Group’s facilities and to 
undertake additional training. Details are set out in the Nominations & 
Governance Committee report on page 72, which includes information 
on Warren East’s induction into the role of Chief Executive.
Independence of the Non-executive Directors
The Board conducts a review of the independence of the Non-executive 
Directors every year, based on the criteria in the Code and following 
consideration by the Nominations & Governance Committee as 
detailed on page 73. This review was undertaken in December 2015 
and the Board concluded that all the Non-executive Directors 
remained independent in character and judgement.
The Code does not consider the test of independence to be appropriate 
to the chairman of a company. However, Ian Davis did meet the Code’s 
independence criteria upon his appointment as Chairman in May 2013. 
His other external commitments are described on page 58.
We are satisfied that, based on the Directors’ current declared 
interests, the Board will comply with the Financial Reporting 
Council’s (FRC) forthcoming independence requirements 
on the maximum number of external directorships.
Board evaluation
The Board and its committees undertake an annual evaluation of their 
performance. At least once every three years this is conducted by 
external consultants. In 2014, the evaluation was conducted by 
Independent Audit who returned in 2015 to conduct a follow-up review 
of progress made. During the year, the Company subscribed to an online 
service from Independent Audit which was used to support the Board’s 
review. Independent Audit also acted as an external sounding board in 
support of the Company’s review of its internal governance, risk 
management, controls and assurance frameworks and in supporting 
an online survey of the effectiveness of the external audit process. 
Independent Audit does not have any other connection to the Company. 
The original Board evaluation included; a review of Board and 
committee papers; interviews with Directors and others who have 
significant interaction with the Board or its committees including 
external auditors and remuneration advisors; and observations 
of a number of the meetings. In 2015, Independent Audit were engaged 
to conduct a follow-up review of progress towards the 2014 
recommendations. This was not a full independent board evaluation 
assessment but, as an externally-facilitated review, it involved the 
Directors completing an online, tailored, self-assessment questionnaire 
and Independent Audit speaking with the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive and each of the Board committee chairs. Independent Audit 
also observed the November Board and Audit Committee meetings 
with a review of the papers for those meetings. The meetings observed 
were heavily focused on the Company’s revised financial outlook, 
resulting in the market update given on 12 November 2015.
Independent Audit presented the results of the 2015 follow-up 
review to the Board in December 2015. In the context of 2015 having 
been a particularly challenging year for the Company and its 
shareholders, Independent Audit noted that progress had been 
made in certain areas, including the Board’s overall composition 
and clearer risk management processes. 
There were several areas identified as needing further attention. 
These were generally related to making the most effective use 
of the Board’s time, and included:
• making sure the Board’s discussions and agenda focus on and align to 
the transformation agenda and near -term priorities;
• ensuring that the Board devotes sufficient time to support this 
focus through discussion, and minimises lengthy management 
presentations;
• drawing out clear conclusions from Board discussions more 
effectively to guide management activity;
• giving due time and attention to people development, 
talent and succession; and
• better use of metrics and risk reporting in Board papers.
Having gone through the effectiveness review described above, and 
acknowledging the disappointing and difficult financial position that 
dominated discussions at the November Board and Audit Committee 
meetings, with the consequential market update, the Directors are 
satisfied that the Board and each of its committees operated 
effectively during 2015. Nonetheless, based on Independent Audit’s 
observations, the Board is continuing to work on actions to improve 
its effectiveness for the future.
Lewis Booth, as the Senior Independent Director, led the Board’s 
annual review of the Chairman’s performance. Lewis obtained input 
from each of the Directors individually and then led a review at the 
Board meeting in December (without the Chairman present). The 
Board unanimously agreed that the Chairman’s performance 
continued to be very strong through a difficult year for the Group, 
with him showing particular leadership and commitment in the 
process to select and appoint a new Chief Executive and further 
Non-executive Directors. The Board noted the Chairman’s exceptional 
level of dedication to his role and to his engagement with the other 
Directors in keeping them informed and soliciting their views.
66 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Corporate governance Executive Leadership Team (ELT)
The ELT is an executive-level forum of the Group’s most senior leaders, 
chaired by the Chief Executive. It helps to develop, implement and 
monitor strategic and operational plans, considers the continuing 
applicability, appropriateness and impact of risks, leads the Group’s 
culture and aids the decision making of the Chief Executive in 
managing the business. Following the initial results of the Chief 
Executive’s operational review announced in November, the ELT 
membership was restructured under the oversight of the 
Nominations & Governance Committee to reflect the transformation 
agenda. The current ELT composition is set out on page 61.
Directors’ indemnities and insurance
In accordance with the Articles, and to the extent permitted by law, 
the Company has entered into separate deeds of indemnity with its 
Directors, which were in force during the financial year and remain 
in force at the date of this report. The Company also maintains 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance cover for its Directors and 
officers. This cover also extends to directors of subsidiary companies.
Internal control and risk management
In developing our internal governance framework we looked at how 
the Company’s risk management and internal control systems work 
together. You can read about our risk management system on 
page 54 and details of our internal control system are in the Audit 
Committee report on page 95. As noted on page 54, these systems 
are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure 
to achieve objectives and so can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The 
Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems, 
including controls in relation to the financial reporting process, 
for the year under review and to the date of this report. The Board 
confirms that the Group continues to be compliant with the standards 
in the Code and with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) 
Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules in this regard. 
Financial reporting
The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual 
budget approved by the Board. Revised forecasts for the year are 
reported at least quarterly. Actual results, at both a business and 
Group level, are reported monthly against budget and variances are 
kept under scrutiny. Since his appointment in November 2014, the 
Chief Financial Officer has undertaken an in-depth review of our 
management reporting and budgeting processes to ensure that 
they fully provide what we need, taking into account the size and 
shape of the Group and the structure of our operations.
Financial managers are required to acknowledge in writing that 
their routine financial reporting is based on reliable data and that 
results are properly stated in accordance with Group requirements. 
In addition, for annual reporting, business presidents and finance 
directors are required to confirm that their business has complied 
with the Group’s finance manual.
International Advisory Board (IAB)
The IAB meets annually with the Board in order to provide 
perspective and to guide strategy development through discussions 
on the geo-political and global economic landscape that may 
present risks or opportunities to the Group’s current or future 
activities. The members of the IAB during the year were as follows:

Directors’ Report / Corporate governance
Shareholder engagement
The Board recognises and values the importance of building strong 
investor relations through a proactive communication programme. 
During 2015, various steps have been taken to improve performance 
in this area. These have included strengthening our investor relations 
function with the addition of experienced professionals and 
enhancing our disclosure and transparency through improved 
reporting. In addition, the frequency of meetings with investors has 
significantly increased under the new management team. As a result, 
we have also been proactive in obtaining an understanding of 
shareholder views on key matters affecting the Group and have 
incorporated these into our Board deliberations around strategy, 
performance improvement and governance. In addition, we have 
benefited from a review of investor opinion undertaken by an 
independent investor representative body towards the end of the year.
Our Investor Relations department plays a key role in building 
stronger, clearer discussions with current and potential investors 
and the sell-side analysts that help inform them. During the year, 
the team have undertaken an extensive investor relations 
programme involving formal events, smaller group and one-on-one 
investor meetings. The purpose of the larger events is to highlight 
particular issues, themes or announcements that the Group believes 
develop a better understanding of the business or which warrant 
further explanation or clarification. The events also provide 
opportunities for shareholders to meet members of the senior 
management team. The one-to-one and group meetings provide 
an opportunity for investors to ask more detailed questions that can 
improve individual knowledge or clarify areas of misunderstanding. 
This is a critical process in ensuring market participants make 
decisions based on a consistent understanding of the information 
available. In this way, shareholders should be able to consistently 
and fairly value the Group’s businesses.
As a matter of best practice, the Chairman and Senior Independent 
Director, together with other members of the Board, make 
themselves available to meet with investors at their request 
and regularly attend key investor relations events. 
During the year, it has been necessary to provide material updates 
on performance and expectations to the market alongside regular 
results communications. This included a capital markets 
presentation in London on 24 November 2015, attended by over 
200 investors and analysts. At the same time, the team have held 
over 500 one-to-one and group meetings, led by the Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Officer, the Director of Investor Relations or 
members of the Investor Relations team. In addition, the Chairman 
has undertaken 20 meetings or detailed discussions with investors, 
five at their request. Lewis Booth, our Senior Independent Director, 
has met with a further six investors, two at their request. Both the 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director, together with other 
members of the Board, attended various formal meetings, including 
the capital markets presentation on 24 November 2015.
In early 2016, Dame Helen Alexander, as chair of the Remuneration 
Committee, consulted with a number of investors on proposed 
changes to the 2016 annual bonus and Performance Share Plan 
(PSP). You can read more about this in the Remuneration Committee 
report on pages 74 to 76.
The Group’s website rolls-royce.com contains up-to-date 
information for shareholders, including an online version of the 
Annual Report, share price information, news releases, 
presentations to the investment community and information on 
shareholder services. It also contains factual data about the Group’s 
businesses, products and services.
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
All holders of ordinary shares may attend the Company’s AGM at 
which the Chairman and Chief Executive present a review of the key 
business developments during the year. This year’s AGM will be held 
at 11.00am on 5 May 2016 at the East Midlands Conference Centre, 
University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RJ. 
Shareholders can ask questions of the Board on the matters put to 
the meeting, including the Annual Report and the running of the 
Company generally. All Directors are invited to attend each AGM. 
Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, all committee chairmen 
will be present to take questions at the AGM.
The Company intends to send the AGM notice and any relevant 
related papers to shareholders at least 20 working days before 
the meeting. The AGM notice will be available to view on the 
Group’s website.
A poll is conducted on each resolution at the AGM and at all other 
Company general meetings. Shareholders have the opportunity 
to cast their votes in respect of proposed resolutions either in 
person at the general meeting, or by appointing a proxy to vote on 
their behalf. Proxy appointments can be made either electronically 
or by post. Following the AGM, the voting results for each resolution 
are published and made available on our website.

  Three new independent Non-executive Directors appointed
  Board governance document adopted and published
  Development of internal governance framework
Introduction
In January 2015, the Nominations 
Committee’s remit was widened to include 
governance issues and was renamed the 
Nominations & Governance Committee. 
This committee is now responsible for 
advising the Board on governance best 
practice, ensuring that the Group policies 
are appropriate and for keeping the 
composition and balance of the Board and 
senior executive team under review. The 
committee also has responsibility for the 
identification of the future composition 
needs of the Board in light of the business 
strategy and for maintaining the Group’s 
position on diversity and inclusion. 
The committee reports to the Board on 
Directors’ conflicts and regularly reviews 
the Non-executive Directors’ 
independence.
The committee has been allocated 
responsibility on behalf of the Board for 
overseeing the Group’s principle risk 
relating to talent and capability.
Principal responsibilities
The key areas of responsibility of the 
committee are:
  to review the structure, size and 
composition (including skills, knowledge, 
experience and diversity) of the Board and 
its committees, to ensure that it remains 
appropriate, and to make recommendations 
to the Board of any changes;
  to consider and formulate succession 
plans for Directors and senior executives;
  to evaluate any conflicts of interest that 
the Directors may have;
  to review the Board’s diversity policy 
and its implementation;
  to report to the Board on the Company’s 
corporate governance practices and 
procedures to ensure that they remain 
appropriate for a group of the size and 
complexity of Rolls-Royce, taking account 
of best practice principles;
  to oversee the induction plans 
for Directors;
  to review the results of the annual Board 
performance evaluation;
  to review the independence of the 
Non-executive Directors; and 
  to conduct an annual evaluation of the 
Chief Executive.
Committee members and attendance
The members of the committee are shown 
on pages 58 to 61 and their attendance 
is shown on page 65. The Chief Executive 
may attend meetings of the committee 
by invitation.
The committee met nine times during 
2015 and focused in particular on the 
composition of the Board resulting in the 
appointments of three new Non-executive 
Directors and the appointment of a new 
Chief Executive. The committee also 
oversaw the restructuring of the ELT.

Liaison with ValueAct, a major shareholder, and 
consideration of its request for a seat on the Board.
A constructive dialogue was established with ValueAct and 
the committee initiated a nomination process to consider the 
proposed candidacy. This process continued into 2016.
Conflicts of interest Directors are required to declare any potential or actual 
conflicts of interest that could interfere with their ability 
to act in the best interests of the Group. 
The committee considered the schedule of Directors’ conflicts 
of interests and recommended that the schedule be approved 
by the Board. 
Reviewed its own 
terms of reference
Evaluation of how well the members and the committee 
operated during the year.
The committee reviewed and updated its terms of reference. 
In November 2015, it reviewed whether it had undertaken all the 
work required under its terms of reference and concluded that 
it had done so.
Principal risk
A principal risk to the business is the inability to attract, retain and 
incentivise sufficiently talented individuals to deliver our strategy. 
The committee is responsible for reviewing talent and capability 
management and it held two sessions during 2015 which looked 
at the processes to develop and maintain talent. These discussions 
focused around the need to reconfigure the ELT and resulted 
in its new composition to deliver business transformation, 
as shown on page 61.
Board composition
The committee reviews the balance and composition of the Board, 
its committees and the senior executive team on a regular basis. 
This review is not just to identify current needs, but also to consider 
longer term succession planning. To this end a sub-committee of the 
Nominations & Governance Committee was formed in February 2015 
to look specifically at contingency planning for senior positions. 
This sub-committee reported back to the committee in February 2015 
and in April 2015, when the committee considered the appointment 
of a new Chief Executive.
70 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Committee reports Nominations & Governance Committee At the start of the year, the committee discussed James Guyette’s 
wish to retire and recommended to the Board that he step down at 
the end of the 2015 Annual General Meeting. As part of the Board 
evaluation carried out in 2014, the current Board mix was discussed 
and it had been agreed that, subsequent to James leaving the Board, 
his role as CEO & President of Rolls-Royce North America would 
no longer be a Board position, although his successor would still 
be a member of the Executive Leadership Team. 
In early 2014, the committee had carried out work with Korn Ferry on 
succession planning. Korn Ferry provides services of this nature, 
including the recruitment of senior executives, for the Group but 
does not have any other relationship with the Group. When, in 2015, 
John Rishton indicated his desire to retire as Chief Executive, 
Korn Ferry’s work was revisited by a sub-committee of the 
Nominations & Governance Committee. This sub-committee 
comprised the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director and three 
other independent Non-executive Directors. Specific criteria for 
the role were drawn up and approved by the full committee and a 
comprehensive international search was undertaken with assistance 
from Korn Ferry. This search identified a small number of suitable 
candidates, each of whom was assessed against the objective 
criteria. The members of the Nominations & Governance Committee 
met each of the candidates on the shortlist and, as a result of this 
process and following formal meetings with the remaining Board 
members, Warren East was confirmed as the preferred candidate.
Warren has been a Non-executive Director of Rolls-Royce since 
January 2014 and he was CEO of ARM Holdings from 2001 to 2013. 
On becoming Chief Executive of Rolls-Royce on 3 July 2015, Warren 
stepped down from the Audit, Nominations & Governance and 
Science & Technology Committees.
The Chairman led the evaluation of Warren’s performance as 
Chief Executive, including obtaining the individual views of the other 
Directors and certain members of the ELT, before a discussion at the 
committee’s meeting in December 2015. It was recognised that in his 
first few months in the role Warren had made a strong start. He 
very quickly identified the need for improvements in operational 
performance and cost reduction, set the priorities and communicated 
these effectively both internally and with investors, and is reshaping the 
leadership team to support the transformation agenda.
The committee started the process for recruiting additional Non-
executive Directors during 2014 by considering the areas of expertise 
that should be added to the Board. An external search consultant was 
appointed and a wide range of high calibre independent candidates 
was considered and a number of interviews were carried out.
As a result of this process, Irene Dorner joined the Board as a 
Non-executive Director in July 2015 and joined the Audit Committee, 
the Safety & Ethics Committee and the Nominations & Governance 
Committee. Irene has considerable international and risk 
management experience and is a powerful advocate for diversity 
and inclusion in the workplace. 
The committee considered that strengthening the level of financial 
and technical accounting knowledge on the Board would be beneficial 
and, again following the process outlined above, Alan Davies joined 
the Board as Non-executive Director with effect from 1 November 
2015 and joined the Audit and Nominations & Governance 
Committees. Alan is a fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
in Australia. As well as his strong financial background which includes 
serving as CFO of Rio Tinto’s iron ore division, Alan brings with him a 
wealth of leadership experience, including transforming operational 
performance and driving cultural change through a complex global 
organisation. He has deep knowledge of China and key emerging 
markets. Alan’s appointment also adds further expertise in safety 
and operations to the Rolls-Royce Board.
Dame Helen Alexander will be stepping down from the Board after the 
AGM in May 2016, having served on the Board for nine years. At that 
time, she will be succeeded as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee by Ruth Cairnie. Being mindful of the need for progressive 
refreshing of the Board and committees, the committee recommended 
to the Board the appointment of a further Non-executive Director 
in 2015 to ensure that there was scope for an orderly hand over.
Sir Kevin Smith was appointed on 1 November 2015 as a 
Non-executive Director, joining the Remuneration, Nominations & 
Governance and Science & Technology committees. Sir Kevin was a 
full-time partner at Unitas Capital, a leading Asian private equity 
firm, having served for nine years as CEO of GKN plc, the global 
engineering and manufacturing company. Before then, Sir Kevin 
spent nearly 20 years with British Aerospace (BAE plc). In February 
2016, Sir Kevin was appointed as chairman of the Science & 
Technology Committee. Kevin’s knowledge of Asia and of complex 
technological and engineering companies is extremely relevant to 
Rolls-Royce and we look forward to his contribution.
In February 2016, Lewis Booth indicated his intention to relinquish his 
responsibility as Senior Independent Director once a successor has been 
appointed. Lewis will continue as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Details of the Non-executive Directors’ experience are on pages 58 to 61.
MWM Consulting was engaged as the search consultant for the 
new Non-executive Directors. The committee set out the particular 
skills required in its brief, and this resulted in the appointment of 
Irene, Alan and Sir Kevin. MWM does not provide any other services to, 
and is not otherwise connected with, the Company. 
Each of the Directors continues to be effective and able to devote 
sufficient time to the business of the Company and the Board 
will continue to keep its composition under review.
Succession planning and diversity 
The Board fully recognises and embraces the benefits of diversity 
throughout the Group as it brings a broader and more rounded 
perspective to decision making. Increasing diversity influences our 
approach to succession planning and training and development. 
The percentage of women on the Board has increased to 29% 
(2014: 21%).
We believe a wide range of people and experiences is beneficial 
to achieving a high performance culture and enables innovation 
helping us to deliver excellence. Rolls-Royce is a founder patron 
of the FTSE 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Programme which aims 
to widen the pool of eligible female board candidates.

COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Directors’ Report / Corporate governance Directors’ Report 
Warren East received a comprehensive induction when he was 
appointed as Chief Executive. Before he took over as Chief Executive, 
Warren met with a number of key customers, suppliers and partners. 
He also spent several weeks visiting Rolls-Royce sites and meeting the 
senior personnel as well as Board members. In gaining an understanding 
of the business challenges, he listened to feedback from most areas 
of the business. Since joining, Warren has conducted town hall meetings 
at sites he has visited and introduced a blog on the Group’s intranet 
which has been well received as it opens up a constructive dialogue 
with employees on the issues that affect the businesses.
In 2015, the training programme was improved to ensure that all 
Directors had the opportunity to visit our operations. We regard 
visits by Board members to our operating sites as an important part 
of continuing education as well as an essential part of the induction 
process. They help Directors understand the business through direct 
experience of operating processes with employees at different 
levels. This also gives the Non-executive Directors the chance to 
spend time with their fellow Directors in a less formal setting, 
which helps them to understand the concerns of their colleagues. 
In 2015, Irene Dorner and Sir Kevin Smith visited operational sites 
in Derby, UK and Irene visited production sites in the US (Indianapolis 
and Crosspointe); Ian Davis spent time with the supply chain team 
in Derby, UK and visited customers and suppliers in Japan, Singapore, 
Dubai and Washington, DC. Ruth Cairnie visited Friedrichshafen, 
Germany and Singapore, and Dame Helen Alexander visited our 
operations in Alesund, Norway. The members of the Audit Committee 
visited the Company’s IT security operations centre to better 
understand the Group’s preventative and reactive cyber security 
measures. Metrics to support cyber security assurance have since 
been developed and are periodically reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Further training is available for all Directors, as appropriate, 
including presentations by the executive team on particular aspects 
of the business. For example, all Non-executive Directors undertook 
the Group’s ethics training programme during the year.

We will continue to consider candidates for future Board appointments 
from the widest possible pool and will only engage executive search 
firms that have signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive 
Search Firms in relation to gender diversity on corporate boards. 
We acknowledge the challenges of increasing diversity within our 
industry, and during 2015 we have introduced a refreshed global 
diversity and inclusion policy and a revised anti-discrimination policy. 
These policies aim to ensure that all employees are treated with respect 
and are empowered to deliver without fear of bullying or harassment.
We recognise that succession planning includes nurturing our 
own talent pool and giving opportunities to those who are  
capable of growing into more senior roles. We give full and fair 
consideration to all employment applications from people with 
disabilities, and support disabled employees, helping them to make 
the best use of their skills and potential. We have continued to roll 
out High Performance Culture training across the globe to help 
employees increase their personal effectiveness.
We have established several Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to 
support our diversity and inclusion strategy. These include Women’s 
ERGs in Germany, US and the UK, a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and 
Transgender ERG and an African Caribbean ERG, both in the UK.
The committee held two focused sessions during the year 
to consider succession planning at a senior level including the 
re-organisation of the ELT announced in December 2015.
Board induction and development
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring that new 
Directors have a thorough and appropriate induction. Each of the 
newly appointed Non-executive Directors has participated in a 
structured induction programme and received a comprehensive 
data pack providing detailed information on the Group. 
Each induction has been based on the individual Director’s 
requirements and included meetings with relevant employees, 
committee members and external advisers to ensure that each 
new Director understands the Group’s governance structure. 
72 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Committee reports Nominations & Governance Committee There is a procedure for Directors to take independent professional 
advice at the Company’s expense and every Director has 
independent access to the Company Secretary. 
Governance
The committee has taken on responsibility for corporate governance. 
Early in the year , we adopted the Company’s Board governance document 
which sets out the roles and responsibilities of the Board members, the 
matters reserved to the Board and the terms of reference of the Board 
committees. This was revised for best practice in December 2015.
We also oversaw the development of the Company’s internal governance 
framework, which documents how the Group is run, and recommended 
its adoption by the Board. It sets out the mandatory policies, processes 
and procedures that must be observed by all employees, clarifies the way 
in which we take decisions, and sets out our system of internal controls, 
risk management and assurance. Greater clarification around these 
issues is important in strengthening our governance and ensuring that 
all employees know what is expected of them. 
We reviewed an updated schedule of delegated authorities and 
recommended it to the Board for adoption. The revised authority 
levels are better aligned with business needs, helping the Group to 
eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy whilst still providing sufficient 
control to manage the business responsibly at appropriate levels. 
The committee reviewed the process through which sensitive 
information is handled and recommended the formation of 
a sub-committee, comprising only Directors who have received 
security clearance, to ensure proper oversight and control of classified 
information. This sub-committee will meet whenever necessary.
During 2015, an executive-level Disclosure Committee was 
established to review all significant market announcements and 
to oversee the process for handling any price-sensitive information. 
At its first meeting in October 2015, the committee members agreed 
its terms of reference, and received a refresher training session on 
inside information from the Company’s external legal counsel. The 
committee met in November 2015 to consider the operating review 
update and interim management statement before their release to 
the market, and again in February 2016 to review at executive level 
this Annual Report (including as to whether it is fair, balanced and 
understandable) and our draft preliminary results announcement.
A key challenge has been to improve the quality and timeliness 
of information going to the Board and its committees. The Company 
has worked to develop better information systems, creating a more 
consistent and thoughtful approach to presenting technical materials. 
This has included the creation of templates and the introduction of a 
new board portal for easier and more timely access to key information. 
As recommended in the 2014 Board evaluation, we have encouraged 
more frequent conversations between senior management and 
the Directors, resulting in greater and more constructive challenge, 
although the latest Board evaluation indicated that we can do more 
in this area, see page 66.
We reviewed Board committee membership during the year, following 
Warren East’s appointment as Chief Executive, John Neill’s departure 
from the Board and the appointments of Irene Dorner, Alan Davies and 
Sir Kevin Smith. The committee took care to ensure that the skills and 
experience of the new Board members were closely aligned with the 
needs of the Board committees. Committee membership is set out 
on pages 58 to 61 and on page 65. The Nominations & Governance 
Committee is satisfied with the composition of the committees and 
confident that they are appropriately resourced to carry out their work.
The committee also reviewed and recommended to the Board that 
Jasmin Staiblin, who has served on the Board for three years, be 
reappointed for a further three-year term, subject to shareholder 
support at the AGM.
As part of its consideration of Board governance, the committee 
discussed the implications of ValueAct increasing its shareholding 
in the Company and encouraged engagement with ValueAct 
to better understand its views.
Conflicts of interest and independence
The Nominations & Governance Committee reviews the Non-executive 
Directors’ external interests every year to determine whether each 
Non-executive Director continues to be independent. In undertaking 
this evaluation, the committee considers among other things the 
criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
It also reviews any potential conflicts of interest as they arise and 
recommends to the Board whether these should be authorised and 
whether any conditions should be attached to any such authorisation. 
Additionally, an annual review of conflicts of interest is undertaken 
to ensure that any previously authorised conflicting situations are 
still being dealt with appropriately.
Having carried out a rigorous review, the committee advised the 
Board that it considered that each of the Non-executive Directors, 
with the exception of the Chairman for whom the test is not 
appropriate, continued to be independent and recommended 
to the Board that each of the Directors’ potential conflicts of interest 
be authorised, without attaching any conditions.
Looking forward
Good progress has been made on governance during the year. 
For 2016, the key focus for the committee will be the development 
of succession plans to ensure that the transformation of the 
business is adequately supported below Board level and 
underpinned by the internal governance framework.

Committee reports / Nominations & Governance Committee REMUNERATION  
COMMITTEE REPORT
Introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased 
to introduce our 2015 Directors’ 
Remuneration Report, for which we seek 
your support at our forthcoming AGM, 
in May 2016. This report is designed 
to demonstrate the link between the 
Group’s strategy, its performance, 
and the remuneration outcomes for 
our executives, in particular the 
Executive Directors. 2015 has been a 
challenging year for the Group and this is 
reflected in the performance outcomes 
for Executive Directors under the annual 
bonus and Performance Share Plan (PSP). 
At the beginning of 2016, we consulted 
with shareholders on proposed changes 
to the 2016 annual bonus and PSP . These 
changes are within the terms of the 
approved policy, but we nevertheless 
considered it important to receive input 
from shareholders to maintain an open 
dialogue on remuneration and inform our 
judgement. The changes were driven by 
our desire to ensure we properly motivate 
our Executive Directors to deliver the 
transformation of the business, whilst 
balancing the interests of shareholders 
and other stakeholders.
Following Warren East’s appointment 
as Chief Executive and the changes he is 
introducing to the business, we will be 
reviewing our Group-wide remuneration 
policies in the second half of 2016.
Principal responsibilities
The key areas of responsibility of the 
committee are:
  to set and monitor the strategy and policy 
for the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, the Chairman and members 
of the ELT;
  to determine the design, conditions 
and coverage of annual and long-term 
incentive plans for senior executives and 
approve total and individual payments 
under the plans;
  to determine targets for any 
performance-related pay plans;
  to determine the issue and terms 
of all share-based plans available 
to all employees; and
  to oversee any major changes in 
remuneration.
Committee members and attendance
The committee membership and attendance 
throughout 2015 is shown on page 65. 
In addition to the committee members, the 
Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer 
and any of the Non-executive Directors may 
attend one or more meetings at the 
committee’s invitation, although none was 
present during any discussions of his or her 
own remuneration package. The committee 
is supported by the Company Secretary, 
the Senior Reward Consultant, the Group 
Human Resources Director, and the Global 
Performance, Reward & Pensions Director. 
The committee is advised by Deloitte LLP , 
an independent reward adviser.
Highlights

Performance under the 2012 and 2013 PSP . The 2012 PSP awards vested at 67% of the maximum award. The 2013 PSP awards 
will lapse in their entirety in March 2016 based on performance to 31 December 2015.
Leadership team 
changes
The terms of appointment for Warren 
East, who was appointed as Chief 
Executive on 3 July 2015. 
James Guyette retired from the Board 
on 8 May 2015 and John Rishton retired 
as Chief Executive on 2 July 2015. 
The committee agreed the terms for Warren East’s appointment. His base salary on 
appointment was £925,000 (equivalent to his predecessor) with a maximum annual 
bonus opportunity of 180% of salary, a maximum PSP opportunity of 180% of salary 
and a pension allowance of 25% of salary.
Neither James Guyette nor John Rishton participated in the 2015 annual bonus. No bonus 
was paid in respect of 2014 and therefore no entitlement to shares arose on retirement. 
The deferred portion of their 2013 APRA awards was released following retirement. 
PSP awards made in 2013 and 2014 remained subject to performance targets with any 
vesting time-apportioned for the period that they were employed by the Group. The 2013 
award has now lapsed in full based on Company performance.
2016 Annual 
Performance 
Related Award
Performance measures for the APRA 
to align better with the operational 
strategy for 2016. As Rolls-Royce enters a 
year of transformation it is important that 
the Group does not lose focus on the 
customer, and that employees are fully 
engaged in the transformation. 
The committee agreed that for 2016, the weightings of the bonus performance measures 
will be:
•  37 .5% Profit and 37 .5% Cash performance
•  12.5% Customer performance (measured through on-time delivery percentage)
•  12.5% People engagement (measured through our Employee Opinion Survey)
Any bonus payments in relation to non-financial measures will be subject to achieving 
a PBT threshold. Awards earned based on the above measures will continue to be subject 
to the personal performance assessment which allows an uplift of up to 20% or a 
reduction, potentially to zero.
The maximum opportunities will remain 180% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% 
of salary for other Executive Directors.
2016 PSP award Performance conditions for the 2016 
PSP award.
 
For 2016 our PSP will continue to be based on CPS and TSR measures with an EPS hurdle. 
The EPS hurdle will be measured over the period 2017-2018. This change reflects the 
current business circumstances and the intended level of stretch of the EPS hurdle which 
is used as an underpin rather than as a primary performance measure.
In recognition of the change, the maximum 2016 PSP award level will be reduced 
from 180% to 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and from 150% to 130% for other 
Executive Directors.
Governance

Terms of reference to ensure their 
adequacy and we assessed whether 
all the requirements of the terms of

The terms of reference for the committee were reviewed and minor amendments made.  
The committee was satisfied that it had covered all the requirements of the terms 
of reference during the year.
   Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 75
Directors’ Report 
Committee reports / Remuneration Committee We reviewed our annual bonus plan to ensure that it will support 
the transformation of the business. As a result, and following 
consultation with shareholders, we have introduced two new metrics 
into the APRA, relating to on-time delivery to customers and to 
employee engagement, that reflect the strategic priorities of the 
business over the next year. Underlying financial performance will 
still be required in order for the bonus to pay out. The introduction 
of the measures will support the work being carried out on business 
transformation and operational effectiveness. 
In recognition that 2016 is set to be a challenging year, and to ensure 
that our incentives are motivating for the management team during 
the transformation of the business, the committee reviewed the PSP . 
Following consultations with shareholders, we agreed that, for 
awards made in 2016 only, the EPS condition which underpins the 
award would measure growth over two years (2017-2018) against 
a baseline set in 2016. In recognition of this, the 2016 awards will be 
scaled back so that the maximum PSP award for the Chief Executive 
will be reduced from 180% to 150% of salary, and from 150% to 130% 
of salary for other Executive Directors. 
2015 outturn
Group underlying profit and cash flow were below the base level 
performance targets and therefore no bonus will be paid for 2015.
Over the three-year performance period for the 2013 PSP grant, 
earnings per share growth was -13.7% which was below the growth 
measured by the OECD index of consumer prices of 3.8%. Cash flow 
per share was 45p against a threshold of 53p. As EPS growth and CPS 
were below the performance targets the awards have not vested 
and have lapsed. 
2016 salary review
The committee has reviewed the salary levels of the Executive 
Directors in accordance with the remuneration policy and 
concluded that no increases to Executive Directors’ base salaries 
will be made in 2016. 
2016 Annual General Meeting (AGM)
The main part of this report sets out the way in which our 
remuneration policy was implemented during the year ended 
31 December 2015 and shows how we intend to apply it in 2016. 
This will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM. 
Having served for nine years, I will be stepping down from the 
Board after the AGM in May 2016 and Ruth Cairnie will become 
chairman of the Remuneration Committee at that point. We look 
forward to your continuing support.
Dame Helen Alexander
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
Remuneration policy
This year we have sought to improve the design and content of this 
report to include a summary of our remuneration policy, which 
remains unchanged. It is shown on page 90 and the full policy 
is available on the Group’s website at rolls-royce.com. 
The remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate 
executives of the highest quality, incentivising them to deliver 
exceptional business performance aligned with the interests 
of shareholders, and to deliver the Group’s strategy and objectives. 
The committee has taken care to ensure any change or decision 
made around remuneration potential for Executive Directors remains 
consistent and in line with the policy as approved by shareholders.
We value shareholder comments on our remuneration policy and 
its implementation. We strive to ensure that the policy is aligned 
to our strategy to enable the Group to attract and keep the experts 
and expertise it needs to deliver business success. To this end, the 
committee will begin a review of the policy in 2016 and propose 
any changes necessary to ensure that it continues to support 
our strategy. We will consult with shareholders on any proposed 
changes before bringing a revised policy to the 2017 AGM 
for approval.
Committee composition
I was delighted to welcome Sir Kevin Smith as a new member 
to the committee when he joined the Company as a Non-executive 
Director in November 2015. With his operational experience, 
Sir Kevin is well placed to offer challenge and support in ensuring 
that our remuneration is aligned to our strategy and incentivises 
exceptional performance. 
The committee composition is shown on page 65.
Activities
No substantial changes have been made to Directors’ remuneration 
in 2015 and all payments made have been in line with the approved 
remuneration policy. 
We reviewed the executive reward framework as a precursor to 
the review of the remuneration policy and considered the high-level 
assumptions that would be used for the review.
We set the package terms for the appointment of Warren East 
as Chief Executive and delegated authority to the Chairman 
to finalise the terms of his contract within the agreed parameters. 
Details of his terms of appointment are shown on page 75.
We also considered and agreed the overall remuneration proposals 
for the new members of the ELT who were appointed during the year.
John Rishton and James Guyette both retired during the year, and the 
committee considered the terms of their departures. The committee 
agreed that neither should participate in the 2015 APRA, and that the 
deferred shares under the 2013 APRA be released to them after 
retirement. Their existing PSP awards remained, subject to performance 
conditions and time apportionment for the period that they were 
employed by the Group, in accordance with the rules of the PSP .

A. Salary and fees
BASE SALARY 
The Executive Directors’ salaries are normally reviewed, but not necessarily increased, with effect from 1 March each year.
The committee reviewed the salary levels of Executive Directors during the year and the result of the review is shown below. 
David Smith’s increase reflected that his salary on appointment was positioned to allow scope for progression in the role and the increase 
made in the year reflects that progression. The increase in March 2015 for Colin Smith reflected the importance of the role to the business 
along with the current modest positioning compared to the external market range.  No salary increases will be made for any Executive 
Directors in 2016.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
The Chairman’s fee is reviewed by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee and the review of the 
Non-executive Directors’ fees is reserved to the Executive Directors, who take recommendations from the Chairman. No individual may 
be involved in setting his or her own fee. The Non-executive Directors’ fees were last increased with effect from 1 May 2014.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group’s share schemes, incentive arrangements 
or pension schemes. We have in place a facility to enable Non-executive Directors to use some or all of their fees, after the appropriate 
statutory deductions, to make market purchases of shares in the Company on a monthly basis. Dame Helen Alexander, Ruth Cairnie, 
Sir Frank Chapman, Ian Davis, Lee Hsien Yang and John McAdam participate in this facility.

Benefits are provided to ensure that remuneration packages remain sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain directors and to enable 
them to devote themselves fully to their roles. The benefits for the Non-executive Directors relate predominantly to travel and subsistence 
associated with attending Board meetings, although for Directors who are based outside the UK, the Company may pay towards tax advice 
and filing. Additionally, the Chairman has occasional use of a chauffeur service to enable him to undertake his duties. The taxable value 
of all benefits paid to Executive Directors in the year is shown below.

OUR APPROACH TO BENEFITS IN 2016
There will be no change to our approach to benefits in 2016. 
C. Annual bonus 
Annual bonuses may be awarded under the Annual Performance Related Award plan (APRA).
Executive Directors receive any annual bonus awarded in March following the performance period. The bonus is paid partially in cash 
and partially in deferred shares. The deferred shares are held in trust for two years before being released, subject to the recipient being 
still employed by the Group. Ordinary shares held as deferred shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares during the deferral period. 
Malus and clawback provisions apply from the date of deferral until three years after the release of shares where there is: a material 
misstatement of the audited results; failure of risk management; serious reputational damage to the Company as a result of misconduct; 
serious breach of the Company’s global code of conduct; or gross misconduct. 
APRA 2015 
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the 2015 outturn against the performance measures, which are shown overleaf, and determined 
that bonuses would not be payable this year in respect of performance in 2015.
The APRA bonus is determined by Group financial performance and personal performance. The Group financial performance is based on 
the addition of the cash and profit outturns, with a specified minimum level to be achieved on both, after deduction of the cost of bonus 
from profit. For 2015, the Group financial measures were cash flow performance and group underlying profit. Levels for both of these 
measures and their outcome are shown overleaf.

exchange translation effects where material. To reflect the disposal of the Energy business, the December 2014 forecast cash and profit were added back to the 11 month 
actual results for bonus purposes.
For 2015 the base level of profit was set to be equivalent to target profit. This was to take into account the cost of the all-employee bonus 
plan which was aligned to the base and target profit levels. 
OUR APPROACH TO APRA IN 2016
Following consultation with shareholders at the start of 2016, the committee has determined that the bonus in respect of 2016 will be 
operated on similar terms to 2015, but with the introduction of two new measures relating to customer and employee engagement. 
Any bonus in relation to the non-financial targets will be subject to achieving the underlying profit threshold. The maximum bonus 
opportunities for Executive Directors will remain at 180% for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for other Executive Directors.

Base, target and maximum performance levels are set for all business measures and result in 30%, 60% and 100% outturns respectively.   
The individual performance multiplier can increase or decrease the business outturn in a range of 0-120%.
D. Long-term incentives – Performance Share Plan 
The PSP is designed to attract, reward and incentivise selected senior executives who can influence the long-term performance of the Group 
and execute the business strategy. Under the PSP , awards of shares are made annually at the start of a three-year performance period. Vesting is 
subject to continued employment and achievement of Group performance conditions. The number of shares vesting will be determined by the 
growth in aggregate cash flow per share (CPS) over the performance period. CPS is calculated as reported cash flow before the cost of business 
acquisitions or proceeds of disposals, foreign exchange translation effects, special payments into pension schemes and payments to 
shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. CPS is cumulative over a three-year period.
A further performance measure is growth in TSR relative to the FTSE 100 or other appropriate index. Where the Company’s TSR is ranked 
above median in the comparator group, the shares vesting will be increased by 25%. Where the ranking is at or within upper quartile, 
the vesting will be increased by 50%. Between these two points, the increase will be on a straight-line basis.
The above measures are underpinned by growth in earnings per share (EPS). Growth in EPS must exceed the growth in an appropriate 
consumer price index over the performance period for any shares to vest.
PSP awards are conditional share awards and are usually made in March with the release date being in March of the year following the 
completion of the three-year performance period, subject to the performance criteria being met. Malus and clawback provisions apply 
where: there has been a material misstatement of audited results; serious financial irregularity which invalidates the targets set; 
reputational damage; material failure of risk management; a serious breach of the Company’s global code of conduct; or individual 
gross misconduct. Clawback will apply for three years after the vesting of an award.

PSP AWARDS MADE IN MARCH AND SEPTEMBER 2015
In 2015, Executive Directors received PSP awards in line with the remuneration policy as follows:
Date  
of award
Number 
of shares 
awarded
% of  
salary
Performance 
period 
end date
Warren East 01/09/2015 126,643 100 31/12/2017

David Smith 02/03/2015 57,204 100 31/12/2017
All awards are made as performance shares based on a percentage of salary and the value is divided by the average share price over 
a three-day period before the date of grant, being 944p for the award on 2 March 2015 and 730p for the award on 1 September 2015. 
The face value is the maximum number of shares that would vest (150% of the award) multiplied by the share price at the date of grant. 
If the EPS and base CPS targets are not achieved, no shares vest.
PSP AWARDS VESTING IN MARCH 2016
The following sets out details in respect of the March 2013 PSP award, for which the final year of performance was the 2015 financial year. 
Subject to performance conditions, these shares would be due to vest in March 2016, three years after the award was made.
Targets for 2013 – 2015 period Performance against targets

(100% of award)
Aggregate CPS over three-year period of less than 56p – zero vesting. 
Aggregate CPS over three-year period of 94p – 100% vesting.
Aggregate CPS performance over three years of 45p.
Outcome None of the 2013 shares will vest in March 2016.
OUR APPROACH TO PSP IN 2016 
Following consultation with shareholders in early 2016, the committee has confirmed that CPS and TSR measures will continue to determine 
the vesting level of PSP awards for 2016 as described on page 80. The EPS hurdle will also apply, although we have adjusted the calculation 
of the EPS hurdle to reflect the very significant changes in our business environment and our financial forecasts, so that the measurement 
will be based on two years’ performance from 2016. Without such adjustments, the awards would have been inappropriate as they would be 
unlikely to vest. To balance this, we have reduced the PSP award levels from a maximum of 180% to 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
from a maximum of 150% to 130% of salary for other Executive Directors. These targets have been chosen to ensure that the participants 
maintain focus on people and customers during the transformation of our business. The performance targets in respect of the 2016 to 2018 
performance period under the aggregate CPS measure will be as follows:
PSP AWARDS TO BE MADE IN MARCH 2016
Aggregate CPS over the three-year period Maximum award released %
Less than 10p 0
10p 30
50p 100
The stretch of these targets reflects that, during this period, we will be investing in ramping up Trent production, IT, new product technology 
and aftermarket capability, while at the same time implementing cost reductions and inventory and working capital improvements. We 
believe that the combination of the EPS hurdle, CPS and TSR targets are challenging and that the performance necessary to achieve awards 
towards the upper end of the range is stretching. They should not, therefore, be interpreted as providing guidance on the Group’s 
future performance.

E. Other items 
As reported last year, loss of office payments were made to Mark Morris who left the Group on 4 November 2014. The contractual payments 
were made in accordance with his service agreement. The total amount paid to him in 2015 in respect of the termination of his employment 
was £597 ,000.
Dr Mike Howse retired from the Board on 30 June 2005. Following his retirement, he has continued to be retained by the Company 
for his expertise in engineering and was paid £21,420 in 2015 (2014: £27,720).
F . Pension entitlements (audited)
The Group’s UK pension schemes are funded, registered schemes and were approved under the regime applying until 6 April 2006. 
They include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. In the defined benefit schemes, normal retirement age is 62.
Warren East and David Smith receive a cash allowance in lieu of a defined contribution pension accrual. Colin Smith, who opted out 
of future pension accrual with effect from 1 April 2006 and opted out of salary linkage with effect from 30 November 2015, receives 
a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
John Rishton, who left the Group and started to receive his pension on 2 July 2015, was a member of one of the Group’s UK defined 
contribution pension schemes and received employer contributions restricted to the annual allowance limits with any excess paid as a cash 
allowance. The cash allowance was calculated as equivalent to the cost of the pension contributions allowing for National Insurance costs.
James Guyette, who retired and started to receive his pension on 8 May 2015, participated in pension plans sponsored by Rolls-Royce North 
America Inc (RRNA). He was a member of two defined benefit plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified. He accrued a retirement 
lump sum in both of these plans. In addition, he was a member of two 401(k) Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, 
to which both he and RRNA contributed. He was also a member of an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US, to which 
RRNA made notional contributions. Under the defined benefit plans, the earliest age at which benefits could be taken without consent and 
without actuarial reduction was 65. 
Details of the defined benefits of the Executive Directors as at 31 December 2015 in the Group’s UK and US pensions schemes are given below.

Directors’ Report / Committee reports Directors’ Remuneration Report OUR APPROACH TO PENSIONS IN 2016
We will continue to operate both defined benefit and defined contributions pension plans on the basis outlined above.
We will continue to allow Directors to receive a cash allowance in lieu of contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme. 
Where a Director has opted out of future accrual under the defined benefit pension scheme, we will continue to pay a cash allowance 
in lieu of that accrual.

 On 31 March 2011, Sir John Rose retired and John Rishton was appointed. John Rishton retired on 2 July 2015 and Warren East was appointed on 3 July 2015. 
2
 John Rishton received a special grant of shares on joining the Company on 1 March 2011 to mirror the shares he forfeited on resigning from his previous employer. 
The share price had increased from 483.50p at the time this grant was made to 870p at the end of 2014. These are the main reasons why John Rishton’s remuneration 
in 2012 and 2013 exceeded that of his predecessor.

  The remuneration for Sir John Rose does not include any pension accrual or contribution as he received his pension from 1 February 2008.

C. DIRECTORS’ INTERESTS IN SHARES (AUDITED)
We believe it is important that the interests of the Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The deferred 
APRA award and the PSP provide considerable alignment. However, participants in the PSP are also required to retain at least one half of 
the number of after-tax shares released from the PSP until the value of their shareholding reaches the percentage of salary shown in the 
table below. When this level is reached it must be maintained until retirement or departure from the Group. Each Executive Director’s total 
shareholding, for the purposes of comparing it with the minimum shareholding requirement, includes shares held: by connected persons; 
in the all-employee Share Incentive Plan; and PSP shares that have vested, but does not include unvested PSP awards. The shareholding 
requirement is 250% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the other Executive Directors. APRA deferred shares do not 
count towards their minimum shareholding requirement. 
Each Executive Director has built towards compliance with the minimum shareholding requirement as detailed in the table below.

POLICY SUMMARY
Fixed remuneration Purpose
Base salaries The Company provides competitive salaries, suitable to attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to develop and execute 
the business strategy. 
Salaries are set using careful judgement taking into account a range of factors including experience, role and responsibilities, 
performance and salaries elsewhere in the Group. Decisions on salary are informed but not led by reference to companies 
of a similar size, complexity and international reach. 
Salaries are reviewed, although not necessarily increased, annually. Any salary increases will not normally exceed average increases 
for employees in other appropriate parts of the Group. 
The committee may exercise discretion to make larger increases in circumstances where it is necessary to address particular issues 
or risks, although in exercising such discretion the resulting salary will not exceed the competitive market range. Executive Directors 
may be appointed at salaries below the target level to enable pay progression commensurate with growth in the new role.
Benefits Benefits include car or car allowance and related costs, financial planning assistance and certain insurances and other appropriate 
benefits at the discretion of the committee. 
Relocation support, or support for accommodation and travel, may be offered to executives where necessary. 
Benefits excluding any accommodation, relocation and associated tax costs will not exceed £100,000 per annum.
Pension The maximum employer contribution to defined contribution pension arrangements is 38% of base salary. Pension contributions 
are based on base salary only.
A cash allowance may be paid in lieu of pension contributions, reduced to allow for the additional NI incurred.
A number of legacy plans are also in operation, including defined benefits plans which are closed to new members under which a 
maximum of two thirds of final salary may be accrued. A cash allowance may be paid in lieu of pension contributions.
At risk remuneration Purpose
Annual bonus The annual bonus is designed to incentivise execution of the business strategy, delivery of financial targets and the achievement 
of personal objectives. 
The bonus payout level is determined primarily by Group financial performance but the committee may introduce non-financial 
metrics and/or adjust the payout level to reflect other factors as appropriate. The final bonus awarded to each Director is also linked 
to personal performance.
No bonus is payable unless the base financial targets are achieved and this also applies if non-financial measures are introduced. 
The committee also has discretion to increase the bonus to 200% for the Chief Executive and 175% for other Executive Directors 
respectively subject to this not being above the competitive market range. 
Between 30% and 50% of the bonus is compulsorily deferred into shares for a period of two years and released subject to continued 
employment.
Performance 
Share Plan
The PSP is designed to reward the development and execution of the business strategy over the longer term, providing alignment 
with shareholder interests through the performance conditions and a retention element through the plan timescale. 
Executive Directors are granted awards over shares annually at the start of a three-year performance period. The proportion 
of award that vests is determined at the end of the period according to a set of Company performance measures.
The three corporate performance measures are CPS (the prime measure), TSR (relative to the FTSE 100 or other appropriate index) 
and EPS.
Maximum face values of annual awards are 180% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% for the other Executive Directors.
All employee 
share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in the ShareSave and Share Incentive plans on the same terms as other employees.

Directors’ Report / Committee reports Remuneration policy summary AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Introduction
I am pleased to present the 2015 report 
of the Audit Committee which describes 
how the committee has carried out its 
responsibilities during the year. I would like 
to thank the members of the committee, 
the executive management team and

the Board in May and Warren East stepped 
down before taking on the role of Chief 
Executive in July 2015. Irene Dorner joined 
the committee on 27 July 2015. Irene’s 
background in banking gives her a strong 
understanding of complex financial issues 
and risk management processes. Alan 
Davies joined the committee on 
1 November 2015. Alan is a fellow of the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in 
Australia and through his career at Rio Tinto 
has amassed considerable financial 
experience, including serving as CFO of its 
Iron Ore group.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  
CONTINUED
92 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Committee reports Audit Committee Operation of the committee
The committee’s responsibilities are outlined in its terms of reference 
which can be found in the Board governance document on the Group’s 
website. We review these annually and refer them to the Board for 
approval. During 2015, we made revisions to clarify our interaction 
with other committees in meeting the requirements of the Code.
Following the changes agreed in 2014, which gave us additional 
responsibilities for the oversight of risk management, the 
committee has worked closely with the Director of Risk to enhance 
the Group’s risk management system. 
As described on page 66, the performance of the committee was 
independently assessed in 2014, with a follow-up in 2015. 
Sector audit committees
In support of our work, each of the Group’s businesses has its own 
sector audit committee, each of which comprises senior finance 
personnel and is attended by KPMG. These committees:
• allow the review of accounting policies and their consistent 
application, risk management, internal systems and issues arising 
at a more detailed level;
• give us further assurance as to the extent of management control 
and accountability;
• promote the governance culture within the Group; and
• inform areas for further consideration at our meetings.
In 2015, additional committees were established to cover central 
functions including group finance, treasury, tax, transaction 
processing shared-service centres, property, human resources, 
engineering and technology, information technology, and our 
regional offices. These additional committees provide assurance 
that all key areas are covered. In particular, they consider issues 
arising from the interactions between the businesses and central 
functions. All the committees meet twice a year to consider the 
accounting policies, judgements and estimates and the internal 
control environment. They are chaired by the Director of Internal 
Audit, who then reports to us. 
In 2015, the sector audit committees have focused on internal control 
and risk management processes in support of the new requirements 
of the Code. We expect this to continue in 2016, as we seek to enhance 
these processes, making them as effective and efficient as possible.
Business and function presentations
We have a regular schedule of presentations from each of the 
Group’s businesses and its key functions. During 2015, we received 
presentations from the following:
• Civil Aerospace business – key business risks (including 
major product failure, on-time and profitable delivery of new 
programmes, business continuity risks including supply chain 
disruption and market shock due to external events or factors 
reducing air travel); accounting policies; key accounting 
judgements, estimates and controls; credit risks associated 
with customers; and TotalCare and CorporateCare accounting.
• Nuclear business – key business risks (including the future of the UK 
submarine programme, government relations, new programmes, 
and product safety); growth in civil nuclear markets; accounting 
policies and key accounting estimates (which principally relate to 
accounting for long-term contracts); and controls.
• Power Systems – key business risks (including competitor actions, 
the low oil price, and warranties); new programme developments; 
accounting policies; key accounting estimates (largely relating to 
warranty provisions) and controls.
• Director of Tax – approach to managing the Group’s tax affairs; 
key tax risks and how they are managed (with specific consideration 
of customs duties); effective tax rate; UK tax position; and key 
tax-related accounting policies and judgements.
Financial reporting
We place considerable emphasis on making sure that the accounting 
policies are appropriate and are consistently applied so that the 
financial statements faithfully represent the results and financial 
position of the Group and its underlying contractual arrangements. 
Given the long-term nature of the Group’s businesses, most of the 
accounting policies subject to significant judgement do not change 
significantly year-on-year. However, the facts and circumstances on 
which those judgements are based do vary over time, with a 
consequential impact on the application of the policies. The key 
areas of focus in 2015 are set out in the table overleaf. In part, these 
reflect the current weak trading conditions in Marine. Overall, we 
are satisfied that the judgements and estimates made are balanced.
During the year, we discussed the requirements of IFRS 15 Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers, which will be applicable for 2018. 
This new standard will have a significant impact on our accounting 
policies for revenue recognition in our Civil Aerospace business. 
The Group is consulting with other companies in the aerospace 
and defence sector, and we will take account of other 
interpretations in our implementation of the new requirements.  
This is discussed further in the accounting policies on page 121. 
Since the year end, we have reviewed the form and content of the 
Group’s 2015 Annual Report together with the processes used 
to prepare and verify it. We have reported to the Board that, taken 
as a whole, we consider the Annual Report to be fair, balanced and 
understandable. We further believe the Annual Report provides 
the necessary information for shareholders to adequately assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
The Group is also implementing a new management information 
system covering both financial and non-financial information. 
The committee strongly supports this initiative and is reviewing 
the progress of this project to ensure that it provides improvements 
in the information used to manage the business.

Committee reports / Audit Committee Directors’ Report / Corporate governance Directors’ Report 
Key issues Matters considered Outcome
Reversal of impairment on contractual 
aftermarket rights
The background to the impairment charges originally made 
on certain Trent 1000 contractual aftermarket rights and 
the reasons and supporting evidence as to why it is considered 
that the circumstances have changed, requiring the reversal 
of these charges. 
We are satisfied that this is an appropriate 
judgement. We paid particular attention to the 
requirements of accounting standards and to the 
engineering assessment of the improved outlook 
for the cost of maintaining these engines.
Indications of impairment of the 
carrying values of intangible assets 
in Civil Aerospace
The assessments of the value-in-use of the principal 
intangible assets, including the key assumptions and 
estimates on which they are based. 
We are satisfied that there were no indications 
of impairment.
The estimates used in accounting for 
long-term contractual arrangements 
in Civil Aerospace are appropriate
The basis on which the estimates are prepared and,  
in particular, how the inherent uncertainties are reflected  
in these estimates. 
In 2015, as we had agreed in 2012, the methodologies 
to reflect risk, current experience and expected long-term 
performance were reviewed. 
We are satisfied that the process produces 
balanced estimates, with appropriate 
consideration of the uncertainties.
Refinements to the methodologies as a result 
of the review, resulted in a one-off profit benefit 
to the income statement of £189m.
The sale of engines to joint ventures The basis for assessing the selling price. We are satisfied that the price represents the 
fair value of the engines.
Impairment of goodwill in Marine The forecasts for each of the relevant cash generating units, 
including the key assumptions on which they are based. 
We are satisfied with the analysis and that 
impairments should be recognised where these 
did not support the carrying value of the goodwill. 
Whether there is any impairment 
to the carrying value of the goodwill 
in Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG
The business plan, and the underlying assumptions 
on which it is based. 
We are satisfied that, although the headroom has 
reduced as a result of the current trading 
environment, there is no indication of impairment.
Warranty and contractual provisions 
in Marine
The basis for specific warranty and contractual provisions, 
including those established in 2014 and 2015 for product 
quality issues. 
We are satisfied that the estimates reflect 
a balanced assessment of the likely outcome.
The disclosures of contingent liabilities, 
in particular those in respect of the 
possible outcome of the SFO enquiries, 
are adequate
Legal advice received in respect of the SFO enquiries. We are satisfied that the disclosures appropriately 
reflect the current position.
Risk and control environment
Assessment of principal risks
Risk management is fundamental and forms an integral part of how 
we work. All risks are managed through a risk management system 
(described on page 54) in accordance with policies and guidance 
established by the Director of Risk and his team and approved by the 
Board. The new requirements of the Code have provided a catalyst to 
review and enhance these, to improve Board oversight and to enable 
continuous monitoring within the businesses. On behalf of the 
Board, we monitored this system and the enhancements.
In addition, as described in last year’s Annual Report, the Board 
allocated responsibility for reviewing certain principal risks to an 
appropriate committee. 
This process and the principal risks arising then formed the basis 
for our assessment of the going concern and viability statements 
which are discussed later in this report. As described on page 54, 
the processes are designed to identify and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve our business objectives.
We satisfied ourselves that the processes for identifying 
and managing the principal risks are appropriate and that all risks 
and mitigating actions had been subject, during the year, to a 
detailed review by the Board or an appropriate committee. Based 
on this and on our other activities including consideration of the 
work of internal and external audit and presentations from senior 
management of each business which include risk management, 
we reported to the Board that a robust assessment of the principal 
risks facing the Company had been undertaken.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  
CONTINUED
94 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Committee reports Audit Committee We considered that the existing process, together with the 
enhancements implemented to date, are sufficient to meet the 
requirements of the Code and the FCA’s Disclosure Rules and 
Transparency Rules and we concluded that the operation and 
monitoring of controls, including those relating to the financial 
reporting process, were effective during the year. Work will 
continue during 2016 to complete the definition and 
documentation of the controls in the enhanced model.
Judgement is required in evaluating the risks facing the Group in 
achieving its objectives, in determining the risks that are considered 
acceptable, in determining the likelihood of those risks 
materialising, in identifying the Group’s ability to reduce the 
incidence and impact on the business of risks that do materialise, 
and in ensuring the costs of operating particular controls are 
proportionate to the benefit provided.
The enhanced control model has been reviewed by the sector audit 
committees and a summary by this committee. Going forward, this 
will be included in the presentations we receive from the Group’s 
businesses and key functions, giving us the opportunity to discuss 
and challenge the assessments and judgements underlying the 
internal control systems. 
The Group is also using this standardisation of the internal control 
framework as an opportunity to improve the consistency of 
reporting, in particular from the Group’s smaller operations.
We paid particular attention to internal controls over financial 
reporting and, mindful of the current business challenges the 
Group is facing, have instigated, and will monitor progress in 
achieving, a wide-ranging plan to improve controls in this area.
The going concern and viability statements
We reviewed the processes and assumptions underlying the 
statements set out on page 57. In particular, we focused on the new 
viability statement and considered:
• the consistency of the analysis of risk impact with that reviewed 
by the Board as part of its strategy review;
• the assessment of the impact of individual risks, both in amount 
and timing;
• the analysis of multiple risk impacts; and
• the current financing in place and the availability of future 
financing. 
As a result, we were satisfied that the viability statement had been 
prepared on an appropriate basis.
We also considered in detail the principal risks that have been 
allocated to us by the Board. 
Business continuity – we reviewed management’s contingency 
plans in the event of a disruptive event, most particularly within 
the aero gas turbine supply chain, both external and internal. 
These take account of the likelihood of such an incident, its impact 
on the business and its likely duration, and the cost and availability 
of mitigating actions. The Group has an incident management 
framework in place, including a crisis management team to deal 
with any significant event.
IT vulnerability – recent events make it clear that this is an 
increasing issue for all companies, and particularly for Rolls-Royce 
given the nature of the data held. During the year, we visited the 
Group’s security centre where we met with the senior IT security 
team. During this visit, the Group’s systems for preventing breaches 
of the IT system and procedures for monitoring and combatting 
those arising were demonstrated. We discussed with the team the 
evolving nature of cyber attacks and how its procedures are 
evolving in parallel. During the year, a dashboard was developed 
to monitor attacks and how they are dealt with. 
Market and financial shock – as part of the decision to issue the 
US$1.5bn bond in October 2015, the Board considered the exposure 
of the Group to financial market risks including: foreign currency 
exchange rates; oil price; liquidity and credit risks; and reduction 
in air travel or other disruption to customer operations. The Board 
also reviewed the Group’s management of these risks. As this area 
was subject to detailed review by the Board, we did not consider it 
necessary to repeat this.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility to the shareholders for the 
Group’s system of internal control over its business and risk 
management processes and the risks identified through the risk 
management process. The committee has responsibility for 
reviewing the system’s operation and effectiveness. 
The Group has a long-standing process for identifying risks and 
planning mitigating actions and for assessing the effectiveness of 
internal control. In assessing the Code requirements, enhancements 
to the existing processes were identified. We approved an enhanced 
model for representing the system, comprising:
• entity-level controls covering leadership and direction from the 
top; and 
• specific control activities, covering detailed process controls, 
and internal and external assurance activities.
This model was then populated and the operation and effectiveness 
of the controls rated. This commenced in 2015 and prioritised:
• entity-level controls;
• controls over principal risks as described on pages 55 and 56;
• controls over key risks and critical processes for each of the 
Group’s business; and
• core financial controls.

Directors’ Report 
Committee reports / Audit Committee AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT  
CONTINUED
Directors’ Report / Corporate governance Directors’ Report 
Internal audit
We receive a quarterly dashboard from the Director of Internal 
Audit identifying key trends and findings of internal audit reports, 
and the resolution of actions agreed. Twice a year, we review 
detailed updates of significant findings. In particular, we review the 
nature and number of issues raised by internal audit and the time 
to complete the related actions, which during 2015 we considered 
to be reasonable.
Increasing focus has been put on identifying the root causes of 
unsatisfactory internal audit reports, both to consider whether 
there are any systemic areas of concern in the Group’s control 
environment and to inform the development of future internal 
audit planning. 
The committee considered and reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s internal audit function, including internal audit resources, 
plans and performance as well as the function’s interaction with 
management. The outcome of the 2014 review of the audit function 
provided a number of improvements and changes which have been 
implemented during 2015. In particular, the recruitment process 
has been improved to ensure that the function maintains adequate 
resource to meet its objectives. 
I meet the Director of Internal Audit privately before each meeting 
and on an ad-hoc basis throughout the year, and the committee as 
a whole has a private meeting with him at least once a year. These 
discussions cover the activities, findings, resolution of control 
weaknesses, progress against the agreed plan and the resourcing 
of the department.
We were satisfied that the scope, extent and effectiveness of 
internal audit work are appropriate for the Group and that there 
is a sound plan for ensuring that this continues to be the case 
as our business progresses and risks change.
External auditor
2015 audit
During the year , KPMG presented the audit strategy, which identified 
their assessment of the key audit risks and the proposed scope of audit 
work. We agreed the approach and scope of audit work to be undertaken. 
Key risks and the audit approach to these risks are discussed in the 
Independent Auditor’s report (pages 167 to 17 4), which also highlights 
the other significant risks that KPMG drew to our attention. 
We also undertook an assessment of KPMG’s qualifications, expertise 
and resources, independence and the effectiveness of the external 
audit process. We reviewed the fees of the external auditor. Our 
conclusions were that the external audit was carried out effectively, 
efficiently and with the necessary objectivity and independence. 
As part of the reporting of the half and full-year results, in July 2015 
and February 2016, KPMG reported to the committee on their 
assessment of the Group’s judgements and estimates in respect 
of these risks and the adequacy of the reporting. KPMG also report 
on their assessment of the Group’s control environment.
We continue to be supportive of the extended auditor’s report and 
KPMG’s approach which goes beyond the minimum requirements, 
providing additional clarity on the key judgements and estimates.
I meet with the lead partner prior to each meeting and the whole 
committee has a private meeting with KPMG at least once a year. 
In 2015, upon their appointments to the committee, Lee Hsien Yan, 
Irene Dorner and Alan Davies had briefings with KPMG.
Reappointment of KPMG and audit tender process
The committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board 
with regard to the reappointment of the external auditor. In doing 
so, we take into account auditor independence and audit partner 
rotation. KPMG were appointed as auditors in 1990 and we have not 
tendered the audit since. No contractual obligations restrict our 
choice of external auditor. The lead audit partner is required 
to rotate every five years and other key audit partners are required 
to rotate every seven years. Jimmy Daboo took over as lead audit 
partner in 2013, and will be required to rotate after the 2018 AGM. 
The committee and the Board have recommended KPMG’s 
re-appointment at the 2016 AGM.
The new EU directive requires us to appoint a different auditor 
no later than 2020. During 2015, we have considered the plans for 
meeting these requirements. We believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders to allow an 
appropriate period for the new auditor to build up a detailed 
knowledge of the business. A tender of the audit will be undertaken 
during 2016. The new auditor will then be appointed at the 2018 
AGM and provide its first auditor’s report in the 2018 Annual Report.
96 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Directors’ Report / Committee reports Audit Committee The Committee considers that the Company has, throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2015, complied with the provisions 
of the The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market 
Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes 
and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.
Non-audit services provided by KPMG
In order to safeguard auditors’ independence and objectivity, we do 
not engage KPMG for any non-audit services except where it is work 
that they must, or are clearly best suited to, perform. Fees paid to 
KPMG for audit, audit-related and other services are set out in note 8 
to the Financial Statements and summarised below.
All proposed services must be pre-approved in accordance with the 
non-audit services policy which is reviewed and approved annually. 
Above defined levels, my pre-approval is required. The committee also 
reviews the non-audit fees charged by KPMG quarterly.
Non-audit related fees paid to KPMG during the year were 29% (2014: 
39%) of the audit fee. Our annual review of the external auditor takes 
into account the nature and level of all services provided.

Based on our review of the services provided by KPMG and 
discussion with the lead audit partner, we concluded that neither 
the nature nor the scale of these services gave any concerns 
regarding the objectivity or independence of KPMG.
As part of the EU audit reform, further restrictions will be placed on 
auditors undertaking non-audit services from 2017. In the UK, these 
will be implemented by the Financial Reporting Council, which is 
expected to publish the final requirements in the first half of 2016. 
We will continue to monitor developments in this area and make 
amendments as necessary to the policy. We have also put in place 
additional procedures to monitor engagements with potential 
future auditors to ensure that, following the tender process, 
we can discontinue or transition any engagements as required.
Looking forward
The introduction of the recent changes to the Code has increased the 
focus of the committee on business risk, which continues to be 
a high profile topic in boardrooms. During 2015, we have made 
significant progress in developing further the existing processes 
for risk management and internal controls. However, we believe that 
that this is a continuous activity of improvement to the underlying 
processes, making them as effective and efficient as possible and 
ensuring that they are fully embedded as part of ‘business-as-usual’ 
activities. In championing this in 2016 and beyond, we will ensure 
that the Board, its committees and senior management have a 
sound basis for understanding the principal risks in the Group, 
assurance that they are being managed effectively and that the 
internal controls are appropriate and are operating effectively.
We will continue to monitor the key accounting judgements and 
estimates, focusing on ensuring consistent application across 
the Group. In particular, we will review the accounting impact of the 
transition in the Civil Aerospace business from mainly linked to 
mainly unlinked TotalCare contracts.
During 2016, we will also continue to review the development of the 
plans to implement IFRS 15 in 2018. 
We will also continue to review the implementation of the improved 
management information system, ensuring that this will provide 
a robust basis for the management of the business and will support 
high quality analysis and will monitor progress on the internal 
financial control improvement programme.
As noted above, we plan to tender the audit in 2016 and this will be 
a significant activity for both the committee and management. 
We will ensure that the selection of the new auditor is based 
on a robust assessment, focusing on the qualities of the proposed 
audit team and their understanding of our business. As this process 
develops, our attention will also turn to ensuring that there 
is a seamless transition from KPMG to the new auditor.

Introduction
On 1 January 2015 the Group’s separate 
Safety and Ethics Committees combined 
to become one committee. 
The committee assists the Board in 
fulfilling its oversight responsibilities 
in respect of safety and ethics matters, 
which include: product safety; HS&E 
(occupational health, process safety, 
asset integrity, personal security and 
the environment); sustainability; 
and ethics (business ethics, anti-bribery 
and corruption and export controls 
compliance). It has been allocated 
responsibility on behalf of the Board 
for overseeing the Group’s principal risks 
of product failure and compliance 
(see pages 54 to 56).
In addition to its oversight role for the 
Board, the committee supports 
management in its aim to create, promote 
and maintain an ethical, compliant, 
safety-conscious, environmentally-aware 
and socially-responsible culture across 
the Group as a means of delivering its 
safety and ethics goals. 
Principal responsibilities
Under its wide remit, the committee’s 
responsibilities include:
  to maintain an understanding of and 
keep under review the Group’s 
frameworks for the effective governance 
of safety and ethics and the Group’s 
culture in these areas;
  to oversee and review annually the 
Group’s key safety and ethics policies, 
including: the Global Code of Conduct, 
anti-bribery and corruption and export 
controls, fraud, product safety, HS&E 
and sustainability policies, and ensuring 
appropriate independent scrutiny 
of policies and practices;
  to review the Group’s compliance 
with relevant legislation, regulation 
and make recommendations in the 
key policy areas;
  to oversee training in respect of safety 
and ethics, including ensuring adequate 
arrangements exist to enable employees 
and contractors to raise concerns, 
in confidence;
  to review reports on issues raised through 
the Ethics Line and review the results of any 
investigations into ethical or compliance 
breaches or allegations of misconduct;
2015 overview

Directors’ Report / Committee reports Safety & Ethics Committee Principal risks
The Board has allocated responsibility to the committee for 
reviewing the principal risks of product failure and compliance. 
These topics form a core part of discussions at our meetings, as 
described in more detail in the remainder of this committee report.
Product safety
The Group recognises that its products are mission critical to its 
customers, and the people its customers serve, all over the world. 
As Rolls-Royce products become increasingly technologically 
advanced, they are expected to always be reliable and safe whenever 
they are used, often in harsh operating environments. Our 
commitment to meet this expectation is essential to the Group’s 
business, its reputation and its sustainability. As a committee we 
draw on our collective industry and regulatory experience to oversee 
the Group’s work in achieving this.
Throughout the year, we were kept regularly updated on aviation 
product-related safety incidents in service and considered the 
potential impact on the Group and its products. We also oversaw 
the Group’s response to a marine equipment product issue. Our 
work in reviewing incidents in service involved: monitoring 
management’s progress in root cause identification; being briefed 
on the development and deployment of technical solutions 
required; testing the Group’s approach in engaging with affected 
operators; and overseeing plans for the timely mitigation and 
retirement of any safety risk including through the application of 
lessons learned back into product design. The committee was 
satisfied with the Group’s response in swiftly deploying its safety 
assessment process to mitigate, control and monitor any potential 
product safety risks as they emerged.
The committee considered the Group’s product portfolio in offshore 
marine applications. We discussed with management the potential 
safety risk and associated liabilities were the Group in future to be 
requested to provide dynamic positioning equipment or systems 
for drill rigs and work-over vessels. The Group does not presently 
provide any such equipment for these specific applications. However 
this resulted in management reviewing its processes for ensuring 
that novel products, and novel applications of existing products, 
cannot be introduced without being the subject of a rigorous safety 
assessment and a suitability and performance review.
Throughout the year, the committee received detailed briefings 
in relation to elements of the product safety assurance framework 
and safety management system outlined on the following page. 
This included a review of how the Group is managing product safety 
assurance while major updates to the engineering processes in the 
Group’s quality system are being implemented. 
We spent time during 2015 gaining a more detailed understanding 
of product safety management in the Marine and Power Systems 
businesses. The committee was assured that progress is being made 
in deploying many of the rigorous safety methodologies used in 
aerospace to the Marine business in order to align the Group’s 
global safety standards. Power Systems operates its own mature 
product safety assurance system to comparable standards. Further 
shared learning and closer alignment are planned for the future.
To maintain the highest standards of product safety requires that 
engineering tasks are carried out only by those with a suitable level 
of competence. During the year, the committee assessed the Group’s 
product safety learning and development framework as it applies 
to different categories of employees depending upon their roles. 
To experience training first-hand, the committee members 
undertook an employee product safety training module.

Directors’ Report 
Committee reports / Safety & Ethics Committee Product safety policy
The Group’s product safety policy sets out the internal standards 
that we expect to be met across the Group, through the following 
five governing principles:
1 .  L ea d e r s h ip 
commitment 
and 
accountability
Our leaders champion product safety and 
prioritise it so that safety-related tasks receive 
the right level of attention, time and resource. 
We make accountability for product safety 
clear and ensure people understand what they 
are accountable for.
2.  Level of 
product 
safety
We design our products to achieve a high level 
of safety consistent with their application, 
always ensuring that we meet or better the 
relevant Group, legal, regulatory and industry 
requirements. We assess what potentially 
could go wrong and put in place controls to 
meet the required safety levels, thereby 
reducing safety risks as far as is reasonably 
practicable.
3 .  M a in t a in in g 
and 
improving 
product 
safety
We are committed to the continuous 
improvement of product safety and actively 
engage in setting industry standards and good 
practice. We continually measure our 
performance and rigorously investigate and 
resolve safety-related issues, systematically 
embedding the learning from these back into 
our practices and processes. Everyone is 
encouraged to report any product safety 
concerns.
4 .  C onf or m i ng 
product
Robust quality is an essential building block of 
product safety and by following our processes 
we can ensure that our products and those of 
our suppliers conform to specification.
5 .  Sa fe t y 
awareness 
and 
competence
Everyone who works in the Group shares 
responsibility for product safety and we are 
mindful of the safety implications of our 
actions. T raining is provided to ensure a clear 
understanding of the product safety policy and 
processes. There is a collective and personal 
responsibility accepted by all.
The product safety policy is subject to annual 
review by both the Group product safety 
review board and the committee. No 
significant policy weakness or omission was 
identified during the period of review.
Safety management system 
In order to help the organisation to follow these five principles 
and meet the required standards through operational processes, 
the Group maintains a product safety management system (SMS). 
During 2015, it was agreed to develop the SMS manual further to 
clarify how accountability for product safety, in particular the 
conforming product element, flows through the organisation; 
and to define the role of Quality and Safety Assurance Boards 
in identifying and addressing causes of non-conformance. 
The Group’s engineering and safety processes must work together 
closely in order to ensure that we efficiently produce safe designs 
for our products. Safety assessments are undertaken in support 
of the design of all Rolls-Royce products and during in-service 
operation to support the response to arising safety issues. 
The test applied to all product safety risks is that they are both 
tolerable and as low as reasonably practicable. Tolerable risks are 
those that satisfy all relevant targets. The targets are set internally 
by the Group and externally by customers and regulators.
The safety assessment process that has been developed is based 
upon a standard industry approach as follows:

REVIEW AND  
MONITOR THE 
RISKS Health, safety and the environment (HS&E)
During the year, we receive a number of briefings and presentations 
as part of an annual agreed cycle of HS&E topics. This enables 
oversight, discussion and year -on-year monitoring of the Group’s 
progress on key aspects of its HS&E management and assurance.
At each meeting, the committee receives HS&E performance 
reports and a balanced scorecard showing performance trends 
against the objectives of protecting health, preventing injury and 
reducing environmental impact. Overall, in 2015, this showed 
improvement in all areas except personal safety. Areas for 
improvement were identified.
The committee also oversees the ‘learning from incidents’ process that 
examines root causes of significant and major incidents and defines 
measures to mitigate against the risk of similar incidents. In July 2015, 
we were saddened to learn that a contractor working in Italy had died 
from an electric shock at a customer site. A detailed investigation was 
conducted and a Group-wide HS&E bulletin was issued to share lessons 
learned and to stipulate actions needed to prevent any similar incident.
The Group also suffered two dust fires during the year at one of its 
facilities in Hucknall, UK. Whilst these were contained and no-one was 
injured, again the lessons learned were promptly shared and steps 
taken to mitigate against any re-occurrence at other Group sites. 
We conducted an annual review of HS&E governance and 
concluded that this remained satisfactory, noting that it had been 
strengthened during the year to include a rolling calendar of 
executive level reviews. The committee also examined the HS&E 
Group risk profile which had been adapted during the year, and 
received assurance on the steps taken to contain known issues and 
to mitigate against the effects of future emerging risks. In December 
2015, we endorsed the adoption of a revised Group HS&E policy. 
The Group’s HS&E experts gave progress updates to the committee 
during the year on the key HS&E improvement programmes: 
• the process safety management programme is driving 
improvements in the management of high hazard processes, 
including relating to chemicals;
• the electrical safety programme has successfully raised the level 
of electrical safety management and control across the Group;
• waste control standards and tools, innovation, multi-site 
solutions and the development of exemplar sites are being used 
to manage and further the Group’s waste action programme; and
• development of an improved HS&E management system 
continued throughout 2015 and is starting to be deployed.
The committee was satisfied that these programmes will continue 
to deliver improvements. 
We also learned about the Group’s management of the integrity 
of its infrastructure and assets, in order that HS&E risk can be 
profiled to reflect age or environmental conditions.
This year, as part of its occupational health strategy, the Group 
has increased the level of focus and resources being applied in 
promoting health risk management, resilience and wellbeing 
among the workforce. This has included the launch of toolkits, 
workshops, videos and blogs from the Chief Medical Officer.
The committee reviewed the overall HS&E learning and development 
programme and discussed how HS&E culture can be promoted and 
strengthened. The HS&E communications plan and initiatives were 
discussed, including the regular inclusion of HS&E ‘moments’ at team 
meetings (including the ELT), promotion of HS&E walks and talks, and 
the HS&E Week held Group-wide in October 2015. In September 2015, 
the committee undertook an HS&E walk with members of management 
at operational facilities in Derby, UK.
The committee received a presentation on the Group’s environmental 
strategy, centred around efficient products, advanced technology 
for future low emission products, and reducing the environmental 
impact of business operations.
The model for governance of environmental aspects of the Group’s 
business, product and operational strategies was also reviewed. 
This includes support provided to the management by an 
Environmental Advisory Board whose members and supporting 
project teams are respected authorities in their fields drawn from 
academia and external organisations.
Sustainability
The committee oversees and helps guide the Group’s approach to 
sustainability, as well as monitoring progress towards goals in this 
area. In 2015, we discussed how sustainability can be used as 
a driver of value creation. To support this, the Group has been 
focusing in the year on reducing what it uses, re-using waste 
material, and recycling end-of-life products. 
We were delighted that, in September 2015, Rolls-Royce achieved 
Industry Leader for the Aerospace and Defense sector in the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index. This marked a significant (17%) improvement 
since 2014 reflecting the Group’s progress across sustainability and 
corporate responsibility disciplines. All scores were well above the 
industry average for all sections. Of particular note to the committee 
was that the Group achieved industry best scores for product 
stewardship, corporate citizenship and philanthropy, as well as the 
environmental and social dimensions as a whole. You can read more 
about the Group’s approach to sustainability on pages 48 to 51.
Ethics and compliance
There is recognition that the Board and the ELT must continue to 
demonstrate leadership around ethical and behavioural standards. 
The Board is determined to ensure this is embedded into the culture 
of the business. The committee plays a vital role in providing 
dedicated focus and attention on behalf of the Board to this critical 
area, including reviewing the Group’s 2015 ethics and compliance 
employee communications plan.
Regulatory investigations
We previously reported that the SFO had begun a formal investigation. 
The Group is continuing to co-operate with the authorities in the UK, 
US and elsewhere. The committee received regular updates on the 
regulatory investigations. As the investigations are still ongoing we 
are unable to give any further details or a timescale for when they 
will conclude.
   Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 101
Directors’ Report 
Committee reports / Safety & Ethics Committee Disciplinary proceedings under the Global Code of Conduct 
(Global Code)
If an employee is found to have acted in breach of the Company’s Global 
Code, the Group takes appropriate action to address that breach. That 
action may include giving a disciplinary warning, imposing another 
penalty or, ultimately, terminating employment in the most serious 
of cases. In 2015, there were 33 employees whose employment ended 
for reasons relating to breaches of the Global Code.
Ethics and compliance improvement programme and 
Lord Gold’s review
Lord Gold was engaged in 2013 to provide independent assessment and 
guidance to assist the Company in improving its ethics and compliance 
culture. In December 2014, Lord Gold issued a second interim report and 
recommendations on the results from his detailed review. The Group has 
been implementing these recommendations in 2015 through its ethics 
and compliance improvement programme under the committee’s 
oversight, and has continued to make good progress. Lord Gold attended 
three meetings of the committee during the year. We discussed the 
results of his review and his observations, including insights from focus 
groups held with a mix of employees in different countries. 
The size, structure and skills of the risk team were kept under review 
during the year with regard to required resourcing to deliver and 
maintain the appropriate level of focus.
Anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) policies 
In 2014, the ABC compliance team completed a thorough and successful 
review and update of the Group’s policies on ABC, advisers, confidential 
information, gifts and hospitality and facilitation payments. In 2015, 
this work expanded to the review and updating of policies on offset, 
conflicts of interest and lobbying and political donations together with 
guidance on managing the ABC risks of sponsorship and donations. 
All of these refreshed policies were fully operational by the end of 2015 
and are being rolled out in the Power Systems business in 2016. 
Completion of this roll-out will mean that unified global ABC policies 
will be implemented across the entire Group. The committee, 
throughout the year, turned its focus to ensuring the effective 
monitoring of the suite of policies and their implementation. 
During the year, the risk team also launched a due diligence toolkit, 
which enables managers across the Group to understand and manage 
ABC risks relating to lower risk third parties such as maintenance 
repair and overhaul centres, logistics providers and suppliers. 
Following the introduction of the Group’s new adviser policy, 
the number of advisers engaged has reduced dramatically for 
all businesses except Power Systems, which has a large network of 
distributors and is more reliant on the services of third parties to sell, 
distribute and support its products. However, the Group is applying its 
new adviser policies to all Power Systems’ third parties and this review 
is expected to be completed during 2016. In addition, every new 
proposal to engage an adviser must go through rigorous review by the 
Group’s advisers and offset panel, presently comprised of the Director 
of Risk, Lord Gold, and a partner from an external law firm.
Ethics Line and local ethics advisers
As part of the committee’s responsibility, the Group’s confidential 
reporting line, the Ethics Line, was discussed and reviewed. The Group 
continues to improve awareness of the ‘speak-up’ channels available 
to employees through training and ongoing engagement. Ethical 
questions and concerns that are raised by employees and other 
stakeholders are recorded as contacts in the Ethics Line system. 
Whilst the total number of Ethics Line contacts decreased in 2015 to 
729 (2014: 850 contacts) this was largely driven by a reduction in the 
number of questions asked, with the number of ethical concerns raised 
remaining at a similar level to last year at 439 (2014: 434 concerns). 
The Ethics Line oversight group, which was originally formed in 2014, 
continued to review cases, analyse the contact trends and provide 
updates to the committee highlighting any high-risk cases. We share 
any concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting with the Audit Committee. 
During 2015, the committee supported and welcomed the 
introduction of a global network of local ethics advisers appointed 
from the existing workforce who are trained in how to respond to 
ethical issues raised. The presence of these 76 local points of contact is 
designed to promote ‘speaking-up’ and tackling of ethical issues locally 
where appropriate to provide staff with an alternative to using other 
‘speak-up’ channels including the Ethics Line.
Export control
During the year, the committee received briefings and a presentation 
on the export control compliance landscape, the key risks, and the 
Group’s export control enhancement programme to address those 
risks. This included discussion of the Group’s processes and systems 
for classification of parts, and the deployment of extra export control 
professionals into the business.
Training
The committee reviewed the proposal for an integrated ethics training 
and communications campaign to engage the Group’s employees 
further, and to create the right environment for our employees to 
‘speak-up and ask’ and ‘think and act’. This built on the manager-led 
ethics toolkit discussions undertaken in 2014 whilst bringing a fresh 
approach for 2015, built around a series of filmed scenarios to prompt 
manager-led group discussions. Annual ethics training is mandatory 
for all employees across the Group, and the Board and the ELT 
undertook this ethics training in the year. Each member of the ELT also 
had a personal objective to lead an ethics session with their teams 
during 2015. A series of monthly dilemma-based stories drawn from 
real cases were also published on the Group’s intranet during 2015, 
inviting employees to vote on what action they would take.
In 2015, a further mandated ABC training programme for employees 
was rolled out, as well as annual online export control training.
Conclusion
The committee is pleased with the progress made by the Group 
during the year promoting the safety and ethics agenda, and in 
particular in developing and undertaking detailed improvement 
plans. These plans are making a difference across the Group. The 
focus of the committee in 2016 is expected to turn to the challenge 
of ensuring that the improvement programmes transition into 
a sustainable ‘steady-state’ position that will provide a strong 
platform for achievement of the Group’s safety, ethics, and wider 
objectives and targets over the years to come.

Introduction
I am pleased to present the inaugural 
report of the Science & Technology 
Committee, which the Board agreed to 
establish with effect from 1 January 2015.
The Group invests more than £1bn each 
year in R&D to enable us to conceive, 
design and deliver world-class technology 
that meets our customers’ current and 
future requirements. The Board considers 
that this key area of the business will 
benefit from the dedicated focus and 
support of the committee especially in 
helping with the formulation of strategic 
direction. It is the aim of the committee to 
provide high level oversight and assurance 
of the Group’s scientific and technological 
strategy, processes and investments. 
Upon its creation, Warren East (then a 
Non-executive Director) assumed the 
chairmanship of the committee. In May 2015, 
he chaired the first of the two meetings 
of the committee held during the year 
(a planning session also having taken place 
in March 2015). Warren stepped down from 
the committee when he became Chief 
Executive in July 2015, and as an interim 
arrangement Ruth Cairnie chaired the 
second meeting of the committee in 
December 2015. I was appointed as the new 
chairman of the committee in February 
2016. The membership of the committee 
presently comprises four independent 
Non-executive Directors. 
Principal responsibilities
The remit of the committee is to:
  to review the strategic direction of the  
Company’s research, technology and 
development activities; 
  to provide assurance that significant 
trends in science, technology, software 
and data are identified and incorporated 
into management plans; 
  to assist the Board in its oversight of 
major R&D investment and provide 
assurance on the competitiveness and 
adequacy of any R&D;
  to oversee the effectiveness of key 
engineering and technological processes 
and operations, including delivery of 
major product development and 
technology programmes, intellectual 
property management and interactions 
with institutions;
  to provide assurance on the 
identification and management of key 
technological risks;
  to oversee processes for ensuring 
effective resourcing and development 
of required technological capability 
and skills;
  to conduct visits to R&D facilities;
  to ensure dialogue with the Group’s 
engineering and technology leaders 
and employees; and
  to review industry and scientific 
benchmark data and best practices. 
The Director – Engineering & Technology, 
and other senior engineering and 
technology executives, attend the 
committee meetings.

Directors’ Report 
Committee reports / Science & Technology Committee Overview and deep dive reviews
The first meeting of the committee served as an orientation session 
at which the members received detailed briefings and presentations 
from senior engineering and technology executives. This included 
a review of the Group’s technology acquisition process, and a detailed 
walkthrough of each of the Group’s identified key technologies 
in its businesses. 
The committee learned about how the Group benchmarks 
its activities in R&D and research & technology providing measures 
to establish whether the Group is doing enough to capture its 
intellectual property.
In December 2015, a briefing was provided on technologies which could 
be potential disruptors (both as potential risks and opportunities).
A detailed discussion was held with the Group’s Chief Scientific 
Officer and Chief Information Officer on steps taken in identifying 
and mitigating the risks and opportunities in emerging digital 
capabilities, and the Group’s future plans for digital business. 
This included consideration of how digitisation could be applied 
to particular technologies reviewed in detail by the committee.
The committee reviewed the processes and outcomes of current 
technology selection and related funding, including a discussion 
of items that did not get funded and the reasons why.
The committee is continuing to review the Group’s current and 
emerging technologies, as well as the measures that the Group deploys 
continually to assess the competitive and technological landscape. 
Maintaining technological advantage through leading-edge R&D, 
engineering and manufacturing techniques in the development of our 
products whilst ensuring they remain reliable, safe and compliant with 
regulatory standards is core to what the Group does. The committee 
will continue to support and guide management in its strategic 
decision-making on technology investments, and in assessing scientific 
and technology risks and opportunities for our business.

Chairman of the Science & Technology Committee 
University Technology Centres (UTCs)
We have established a global network of UTCs, with the first 
formal collaborations being signed in 1990. At first, UTCs 
were established mostly in the UK and more recently they have 
been founded in the US, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Germany and 
Korea. Additionally, Rolls-Royce has significant relationships 
with many other research centres around the world, including 
Japan, Singapore, China, Germany and the US. 
Each UTC addresses a key technology; collectively they tackle 
a wide range of engineering disciplines from combustion 
and aerodynamics to noise and manufacturing technology. 
This consistent strategy of developing long-term relationships 
with selected universities has provided close contact with 
world-class academic institutions, and given access to a 
wealth of talent and creativity to help protect our capability 
into the future.
The aim is to satisfy the needs of the business and its 
customers whilst providing technical input that enhances 
the research reputation of the university. UTCs are long-term, 
funded collaborations that ensure continuity of work, offering 
high-quality technology for the Group and real-world 
challenges for academic partners. Each is led by a world-class 
academic and supported by a strong team of research fellows, 
associates, students, technicians, staff and facilities.
While the main focus of the UTC is long-term research, 
an additional advantage of the relationship is to provide 
the Group with access to highly capable people to support 
short-term needs. This can be beneficial to both parties, 
providing practical experience for the research team and 
valuable solutions for the Group.

Directors’ Report / Committee reports Science & Technology Committee RESPONSIBILITY  
STATEMENTS
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT 
OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors, as listed on pages 58 to 61, are responsible  
for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent  
company financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements  
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU and applicable law 
and have elected to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and 
applicable law.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and 
of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent;
• for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU;
• for the parent company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
company financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the 
parent company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent and 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the financial position of the parent company and enable them 
to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ 
Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement 
that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the Group’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENTS UNDER THE DISCLOSURE RULES 
AND TRANSPARENCY RULES 
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
report confirms that to the best of his or her knowledge:
i)  each of the Group and parent company financial statements, 
prepared in accordance with IFRS and UK Accounting Standards 
respectively, gives a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; 
ii)   the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 57 and Directors’ Report 
on pages 58 to 104 and pages 178 to 181 include a fair review 
of the development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Company and the undertakings included in 
the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description 
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face; and
iii)   the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.

respectively) were held for the purpose of share-based payment plans and included in retained earnings. During the year, 10,892,026 ordinary shares with a net book value of £98m 
(2014 7,770,113 shares with a net book value of £64m) vested in share-based payment plans. During the year the Company acquired 224,993 (2014 169,404) of its ordinary shares via 
reinvestment of dividends received on its own shares and purchased 2,000,000 (2014 nil) of its ordinary shares through purchases on the London Stock Exchange. During the year, 
the Company issued no new ordinary shares (2014 10,200,000) to the Group’s share trust for its employees share-based payment plans with a net book value of nil (2014 £100m).

  Following the completion of the sale of the Energy business to Siemens on 1 December 2014 and further to the announcement on 19 June 2014 of a £1bn share buyback, the Company 
put in place a programme to enable the purchase of its ordinary shares. The aim of the buyback was to reduce the issued share capital of the Company, helping enhance returns 
for shareholders. In the period to 31 December 2014, 8,215,000 shares were purchased at an average price of 840p. These shares were cancelled. In the year to 31 December 2015, 
46,016,303 shares were purchased at an average price of 937p. 44,016,303 of these shares were cancelled and 2,000,000 were retained for use in share-based payment programmes. 
On 6 July 2015, the Company announced that the share buyback programme had been curtailed at the to-date total of £500m.

  Share-based payments – direct to equity is the net of the credit to equity in respect of the share-based payment charge to the income statement and the actual cost of shares vesting,

1 Accounting policies
THE COMPANY
Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (the ‘Company’) is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements  
of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2015 consist of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Company  
and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) and include the Group’s interest in jointly controlled and associated entities. 
BASIS OF PREPARATION AND STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
In accordance with European Union (EU) regulations, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), as adopted for use in the EU effective 
at 31 December 2015 (Adopted IFRS). 
The Company has elected to prepare its individual company financial statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. This year is 
the first year that the financial statements have been prepared under FRS 101. They are set out on pages 157 to 159 and the accounting 
policies in respect of Company financial statements are set out on page 158.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except where Adopted IFRS requires the 
revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis – most significantly 
post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits – and on a going concern basis  
as described on page 57.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The Group generates a significant portion of its revenues and profit on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed original 
equipment (OE) fleet. As a consequence, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the 
anticipated aftermarket arrangements. Accounting policies reflect this aspect of the business model, in particular the policies for  
the recognition of contractual aftermarket rights and the linkage of OE and aftermarket arrangements.
When a civil large engine is sold, the economic benefits received usually far exceed the cash receivable under the contract, due to the 
rights to valuable aftermarket spare parts business. However, because the value of this right cannot be estimated with enough precision, 
accounting standards require that the revenue recognised in the accounts on sale of the engine is restricted to a total amount that results 
in a break even position. The amount of the revenue recognised in excess of cash receivable is recognised as an intangible asset, which is 
called a ‘contractual aftermarket right’ (previously referred to as a ‘recoverable engine cost’; this change has been made to reflect better 
the nature of the asset).
There is only one circumstance where accounting standards require the recognition of more of the value of the aftermarket rights 
when an engine is sold. This occurs where a long-term aftermarket contract (generally a TotalCare agreement – TCA) and an engine 
sale contract have been negotiated together. In this circumstance, the part of the aftermarket rights covered by the TCA can be valued 
much more precisely and is recognised at the time of the engine sale through accounting for the engine sale and TCA as a single contract. 
Nevertheless, the accounting profit recognised is still less than the economic benefits on the sale as there will be other valuable 
aftermarket rights (for instance for the period beyond the TCA term or for the sale of parts which are outside the scope of the TCA) 
which cannot be recognised.
The Group enters into arrangements with long-term suppliers to share the risks and rewards of major programmes – risk and revenue 
sharing arrangements (RRSAs). The accounting policy for these arrangements has been chosen, consistent with Adopted IFRS, to reflect 
their commercial effect.
The key judgements in determining these accounting policies are described below. 
Contractual aftermarket rights (CARs)
On delivery of Civil Aerospace engines, the Group has contractual rights to supply aftermarket parts to the customers and its intellectual 
rights, warranty arrangements and, where relevant, statutory airworthiness or other regulatory requirements provide reasonable control 
over this supply. The Directors consider that these rights meet the definition of an intangible asset in IAS 38 Intangible Assets. However,  
the Directors do not consider that it is possible to determine a reliable fair value for this intangible asset. Accordingly, an intangible asset 
(CAR) is only recognised on the occasions where the contractual price of the engine is below the cost of manufacture and then only to the 
extent of this deficit, as this amount is reliably measureable. An equal amount of revenue is recognised at the same point. Where a 
long-term aftermarket contract is linked to the OE contract (see below), the contractual price of the engine (including amounts allocated 
from the aftermarket contract) is above its cost of manufacture; consequently no CAR is recognised.

Measure of performance on long-term aftermarket contracts
A large proportion of the Group’s activities relate to long-term aftermarket contracts, in particular TotalCare and similar arrangements  
in the Aerospace Division. Under these contracts, the Group’s primary obligation is to maintain customers’ equipment in an operational 
condition and achieves this by undertaking various activities, such as engine monitoring, line maintenance and repair and overhaul, over 
the period of the contract. In general, the Directors consider that the stage of performance of the contract should be by reference to the 
obligation to maintain an operational fleet and that this is best measured by the operation of the fleet. Accordingly, stage of performance 
is measured by reference to flying hours of each fleet under contract. 
Linkage of original and long-term aftermarket contracts 
Where the key terms of a long-term aftermarket contract are substantively agreed (eg. in a term sheet) at the same time as an OE contract 
with the operator, the Directors consider these to be linked for accounting purposes and they are treated as a single contract, as this best 
reflects the overall commercial effect. Where the OE contract is not with the operator, eg. where it is with an OE manufacturer or a lessor, 
the contracts are not linked as they were not negotiated on a unified basis.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements
RRSAs with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of our Civil Aerospace business. Under these contractual arrangements the  
key commercial objectives are that: (i) during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine  
by performing its own development work, providing development parts and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) during the 
production phase it supplies components in return for a share of the programme revenues as a ‘life of type’ supplier (ie. as long as the 
engine remains in service). The share of development costs borne by the workshare partner and of the revenues it receives reflect the 
partner’s proportionate cost of providing its production parts compared to the overall manufacturing cost of the engine. The share is 
based on a jointly agreed forecast at the commencement of the arrangement.
These arrangements are complex and have features that could be indicative of: a collaboration agreement, including sharing of risk and 
cost in a development programme; a long-term supply agreement; sharing of intellectual property; or a combination of these. In summary, 
and as described below, the Directors’ view is that the development and production phases of the contract should be considered separately 
in accounting for the RRSA, which results in the entry fee being matched against the non-recurring costs incurred by the Group.
Having considered the features above, the Directors considered that there is no directly applicable IFRS to determine an accounting policy 
for the recognition of entry fees of this nature in the income statement. Consequently, in developing an accounting treatment for such 
entry fees that best reflects the commercial objectives of the contractual arrangement, the Directors have analysed these features in the 
context of relevant accounting pronouncements (including those of other standard setters where these do not conflict with IFRS) and have 
weighed the importance of each feature in faithfully representing the overall commercial effect. The most important considerations that 
need to be balanced are: the transfer of development risk; the workshare partner receiving little standalone value from the payment of the 
entry fee; and the overall effect being collaboration between the parties which falls short of being a joint venture as the Group controls the 
programme. Also important in the analysis is the fact that, whilst the Group and the workshare partner share risks and rewards through 
the life of the contract, these risks and rewards are very different during the development and production phases.
In this context, the entry fee might be considered to represent: an amount paid as an equalisation of development costs; a payment to 
secure a long-term supply arrangement; a purchase of intellectual property; or some combination thereof. The accounting under these 
different scenarios could include: recognition of the entry fee to match the associated costs in the income statement; being spread over 
the life of the programme as a reduction in the cost of supply during production; or being spread over the time period of the access to the 
intellectual property by the workshare partner.
The Directors consider that the most important features of the arrangement are the risk sharing and that the entry fee represents a 
contribution to the development costs that the Group incurs in excess of its proportionate programme share. The key judgements taken in 
reaching this view are: the entry fee is determined by the parties on that basis and the contract specifies that, in the event that a derivative 
engine is to be developed, additional entry fees will also be calculated on this basis; the workshare partners describe the entry fee in this 
way; although the workshare partner receives little stand-alone value from paying the entry fee, the entry fee together with its own 
development activities represent its aggregate investment in the collaboration; the amount of the entry fee does not include any amount 
in excess of that necessary to equalise forecast development costs; the Group is not ‘on risk’ for the full development costs it incurs but for 
that amount less the entry fees received; and, as far as can be determined, this appears to be common industry accounting for 
arrangements of this type, under both Adopted IFRS and US accounting standards (which the Directors do not believe conflicts with IFRS  
in this regard).
The resulting accounting policy (described on page 117) represents the commercial effect of the contractual arrangements in that the 
Group recognises only those development costs to which it is exposed (and thus reflects the significant transfer of development risk to the 
workshare partner) and the costs of supply of parts during the production phase is measured at the workshare partner’s share of 
programme revenues (which we consider to be a commercial fair value). The Directors do not consider that accounting which would result 
in entry fees only being recognised in the production phase would appropriately reflect the sharing of development risk. Accordingly, the 
Directors believe that the policy adopted best reflects the commercial objectives of the arrangements, the nature of the relationship with 
the workshare partner and is in accordance with Adopted IFRS.

As described in the 2013 Annual Report, an alternative view is that the RRSA contract cannot be divided into separate development and 
production phases, as the fees and development components received by the Group during the development phase are exchanged for  
the obligation to pay the supplier a predetermined share of any sales receipts during the production phase. On this basis the entry fees 
received would be deferred in their entirety and recognised over the period of production. The size of the difference between the two 
approaches is monitored and is not currently expected to become material in the foreseeable future. The impact of the different 
approaches on profit before tax and net assets, which is not considered to be material, is as follows:

 If the alternative policy were adopted, the difference would be included in profit before financing, which would change from £1,501m as reported to £1,473m (2014: £1,398m to £1,368m)
Internally generated development costs
IAS 38 requires that internally generated development costs should only be recognised if strict criteria are met, in particular relating to 
technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. The Directors consider that, due to the complex nature of new equipment 
programmes, these criteria are not met until relatively late in the programme – Civil Aerospace programmes represent around half of 
development costs recognised; for these, the criteria are generally satisfied around the time of the initial engine certification.
Customer financing contingent liabilities
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of financing support provided to customers. In order to assess whether a provision should 
be recognised, judgement as to the likelihood of these crystallising is required. This judgement is based on an assessment on the knowledge 
of the customers’ fleet plans, the underlying value of the security provided and, where appropriate, the customers’ creditworthiness.
KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In applying the accounting policies, estimates are made in many areas; the actual outcome may differ from that calculated. The key sources of 
estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets 
and liabilities within the next financial year are set out below. The estimation of the relevant assets and liabilities involves the combination 
of a number of assumptions. Sensitivities are disclosed in the relevant notes where this is appropriate and practicable.
Forecasts and discount rates
The carrying values of a number of items on the balance sheet are dependent on the estimates of future cash flows arising from the 
Group’s operations, in particular:
• The assessment of whether the goodwill and other intangible assets (carrying value at 31 December 2015: £1,502m, 31 December 
2014: £1,658m) arising on the consolidation of RRPS is impaired is dependent of the present value of the future cash flows expected to be 
generated by the business. 
• The assessment as to whether there are any indications of impairment of development, participation, certification, customer relationships 
and contractual aftermarket rights recognised as intangible assets (carrying values at 31 December 2015: £2,533m, 31 December 2014: 
£2,533m) is dependent on estimates of cash flows generated by the relevant assets and the discount rate used to calculate a present value. 
These estimates include the performance of long-term contractual arrangements as described below, as well as estimates for future market 
share, pricing and unit cost for uncontracted business. The risk of impairment is generally higher for newer programmes and for customer 
specific intangible assets (CARs) for launch customers and typically reduces as programmes become more established.
Assessment of long-term contractual arrangements
The Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods – the most 
significant of these are long-term service arrangements in the Civil Aerospace business. The estimated revenues and costs are inherently 
imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: engine flying hours, time on wing and other operating parameters; the pattern 
of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred; and life cycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts. The estimates 
take account of the inherent uncertainties and the risk of non-recovery of any resulting contract balances. During 2015, the methodologies 
for making these estimates were reviewed and refined.
Post-retirement benefits
The Group’s defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19. The accounting 
valuation, which is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of £77m before deferred 
taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: net surplus £555m). The size of the net surplus/
deficit is sensitive to the market value of the assets held by the schemes and to actuarial assumptions, which include price inflation, 
pension and salary increases, the discount rate used in assessing actuarial liabilities, mortality and other demographic assumptions and 
the levels of contributions. Further details are included in note 19.

Provisions
As described in the accounting policy on page 120, the Group measures provisions (carrying value at 31 December 2015: £640m, 
31 December 2014: £807m) at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. 
These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.
Taxation
The tax payable on profits is determined based on tax laws and regulations that apply in each of the numerous jurisdictions in which the 
Group operates. Where the precise impact of these laws and regulations is unclear, or uncertain, then reasonable estimates may be used 
to determine the tax charge included in the financial statements.  
The main area of uncertainty is in relation to cross border transactions, entered into in the normal course of business, as the amount of 
income or profit taxable in each country involved can be subjective and therefore open to interpretation by the relevant tax authorities. 
This can result in disputes and possibly litigation.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make judgements and estimates of exposures in relation to tax audit issues and 
other areas of uncertainty. Contingent liabilities, including in respect of any tax disputes or litigation, are covered in note 23 (contingent 
liabilities). All provisions are in current liabilities. Any liability relating to interest or penalties on tax liabilities is included in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductable 
temporary difference can be utilised, based on management’s assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits.
Further details on the Group’s tax position can be found on page 176.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods 
presented in these consolidated financial statements and by all Group entities.
Basis of consolidation
The Group consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings together 
with the Group’s share of the results of joint arrangements and associates made up to 31 December. In line with common practice in 
Germany, a small number of immaterial subsidiaries of Rolls-Royce Power Systems are not consolidated and are carried at cost in other 
investments. If such subsidiaries become material, they are consolidated. The difference between the net assets recognised and the 
investment cost eliminated is recognised in other operating income.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has power over an entity, exposure to variable 
returns from its involvement with an entity and the ability to use its power over an entity so as to affect the Company’s returns. 
A joint arrangement is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more 
other venturers under a contractual arrangement. Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations. An associate is an 
entity, being neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a 
significant influence. The results of joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Joint operations 
are accounted for using proportionate accounting.
Any subsidiary undertakings, joint arrangements or associates sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date 
of change of control. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.
Where a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest has been agreed, the Group recognises a liability for the estimated 
exercise value of that option. Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised in the income statement.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the 
profit or loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity.
Revenue recognition
Revenues comprise sales to outside customers after discounts, excluding value added taxes.
Sales of products (both original equipment and spare parts) are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods 
are transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment can be assured – this is generally on delivery. On occasion, 
the Group may participate in the financing of OE, most commonly by the provision of guarantees as described in note 18. In such circumstances, 
the contingent obligations arising under these arrangements are taken into account in assessing when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred to the customer. As described on page 113, a sale of OE at a contractual price below its cost of manufacture 
is considered to give rise to revenue to the extent that an intangible asset (contractual aftermarket right) is recognised at the same time. 
116 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued 
Sales of services are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date. As described on page 114,  
the assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: flying hours or 
equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements where the service is provided on a continuous basis; costs incurred to the extent these 
relate to services performed up to the reporting date; or achievement of contractual milestones where relevant. 
As described on page 114, sales of products and services are treated as though they are a single contract where these components have 
been negotiated as a single commercial package and are so closely interrelated that they do not operate independently of each other and 
are considered to form a single transaction with an overall profit margin. The total revenue is allocated between the two components such 
that the total agreed discount to list prices is allocated to revenue for each of the two components pro rata, based on list prices. The 
revenue is then recognised for each component on this basis as the products are delivered and services provided, as described above. 
Where the contractual price of the OE component is below the revenue allocated from the combined arrangement, this will give rise 
to an asset included in ‘amounts recoverable on contracts’. This asset reduces as services are provided, increases as costs are incurred, 
and reduces to zero by the end of the contract. Where the balance is a liability, it is recognised in ‘accruals and deferred income’.
Provided that the outcome of construction contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty, the revenues and costs on such contracts are 
recognised based on stage of completion and the overall contract profitability. Full provision is made for any estimated losses to completion 
of contracts, having regard to the overall substance of the arrangements.
Progress payments received, when greater than recorded revenue, are deducted from the value of work in progress except to the extent 
that payments on account exceed the value of work in progress on any contract where the excess is included in accruals and deferred 
income within trade and other payables. The amount by which recorded revenue of long-term contracts is in excess of payments on 
account is classified as amounts recoverable on contracts and is separately disclosed within trade and other receivables.
TotalCare arrangements
As described above, these are accounted for on a stage of completion basis, with the stage of completion based on the proportion of flying 
hours completed compared to the total estimated under the contract. In making the assessment of future revenues, costs and the level of 
profit recognised the Group takes account of: (i) the forecast utilisation of the engines by the operator; (ii) the forecast costs to maintain the 
engines in accordance with the contractual requirements – the principal variables being the time between shop visits and the cost of each 
shop visit; and (iii) the recoverability of any contract asset arising. The Group benchmarks the forecast costs against previous programmes, 
recognising that the reliability of the forecasts will improve as operational experience of the engine increases. To the extent that actual 
costs differ from forecast costs or that forecast costs change, the cumulative impact is recognised in the period. An allowance is made 
against forecast contract revenues given the potential for reduced engine flying hours based on historical forecasting accuracy, the risk of 
aircraft being parked by the customer and the customer’s creditworthiness (previously assessed against contract assets arising, based on 
both the customer’s creditworthiness and an assessment of the importance of the particular engine fleet to the customer). Again, changes 
in this allowance are recognised in the period.
Risk and revenue sharing arrangements (RRSAs)
As described on page 114, the Group enters into arrangements with certain workshare partners under which these suppliers: (i) contribute 
to the forecast costs of developing an engine by performing their own development work, providing development parts and paying a 
non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) supply components for the production phase for which they receive consideration, which is an 
agreed proportion of the total programme revenues. Both the suppliers’ contributions to the forecast non-recurring development costs 
and their consideration are determined by reference to their proportionate forecast scopes of supply relative to that of the engine overall. 
Once the forecast costs and the scopes of supply have been agreed at the inception of the contract, each party is then accountable for its 
own incurred costs. No accounting entries are recorded when the suppliers undertake development work or when development 
components are supplied. Cash sums received are recognised in the income statement, as a reduction in research and development costs 
incurred, to match the expensing of the Group’s related costs – where the cash sums are received in advance of the related costs being 
expensed or where the related costs are capitalised as intangible assets, the recognition of the cash received is deferred (in accruals and 
deferred income) to match the recognition of the related expense or the amortisation of the related intangible asset respectively. The 
payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme revenues for their production components are charged to cost of sales as 
programme revenues arise.
The Group has arrangements with partners who do not undertake development work or supply parts. Such arrangements are considered  
to be financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.
Government investment
Where a government or similar body has previously invested in a development programme, the Group treats payments to that body  
as royalty payments, which are matched to related sales.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match them with the related expenses that they are intended to 
compensate. Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are included in the balance sheet as deferred income. 
Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.

Interest
Interest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Where borrowing costs are 
attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.
Taxation
The tax charge/credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax:
• Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and 
any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
• Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts 
of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted 
or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement or other comprehensive income (OCI) as appropriate, except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of 
goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the 
assets can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting Group undertaking are translated into 
the functional currency at the exchange rates ruling on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate ruling at the year end. Exchange differences arising on foreign 
exchange transactions and the retranslation of assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate ruling at the year end are taken 
into account in determining profit before taxation.
The trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. The assets and liabilities of 
overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the 
year end. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments, and from the translation of the profits or losses 
at average rates, are recognised in OCI. The cumulative amount of exchange adjustments was, on transition to IFRS in 2004, deemed to be nil. 
Financial instruments
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires the classification of financial instruments into separate categories 
for which the accounting requirement is different. The Group has classified its financial instruments as follows:
• short-term investments are generally classified as available for sale;
• short-term deposits (principally comprising funds held with banks and other financial institutions), trade receivables and short-term 
investments not designated as available for sale are classified as loans and receivables;
• borrowings, trade payables, financial RRSAs, put options on NCI, and C Shares are classified as other liabilities; and
• derivatives, comprising foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps are classified as fair value through profit 
or loss.
Financial instruments are recognised at the contract date and initially measured at fair value. Their subsequent measurement depends 
on their classification:
• Available for sale assets are held at fair value. Changes in fair value arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the income 
statement. All other changes in fair value are taken to equity. On disposal, the accumulated changes in value recorded in equity are 
included in the gain or loss recorded in the income statement.
• Loans and receivables and other liabilities are held at amortised cost and not revalued (except for changes in exchange rates and 
forecast contractual cash flows, which are included in the income statement) unless they are included in a fair value hedge accounting 
relationship. Where such a hedging relationship exists, the instruments are revalued in respect of the risk being hedged, with the change 
in value included in the income statement.
• Fair value through profit or loss items are held at fair value. Changes in fair value are included in the income statement unless the 
instrument is included in a cash flow hedge. If the instruments are included in an effective cash flow hedging relationship, changes 
in value are taken to equity. When the hedged forecast transaction occurs, amounts previously recorded in equity are recognised 
in the income statement.
Financial instruments are derecognised on expiry or when all contractual rights and obligations are transferred.

Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
Hedge accounting
The Group does not generally apply hedge accounting in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts or commodity swaps held  
to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively.
The Group applies hedge accounting in respect of transactions entered into to manage the fair value and cash flow exposures of its 
borrowings. Forward foreign exchange contracts are held to manage the fair value exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign 
currencies and are designated as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures and are designated 
as fair value or cash flow hedges of fixed and floating rate borrowings respectively.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and changes in fair value of the related hedged item are 
recognised directly in the income statement.
Changes in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges and are effective are recognised directly in equity.  
Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is included in the income statement. The amounts deferred in equity are recognised  
in the income statement to match the recognition of the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, for cash flow hedges and if the forecast transaction remains probable, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected  
to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
The portion of a gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective 
hedge is recognised directly in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses 
accumulated in the translation reserve will be recycled to profit when the foreign operation is sold.
Business combinations and goodwill
On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities unless the fair value 
cannot be measured reliably, in which case the value is subsumed into goodwill. Where fair values of acquired contingent liabilities cannot be 
measured reliably, the assumed contingent liability is not recognised but is disclosed in the same manner as other contingent liabilities. 
Goodwill recognised represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value to the Group of the net of 
the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not 
retrospectively adjusted to comply with Adopted IFRS and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous 
accounting policies. Goodwill in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the 
acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Certification costs and participation fees
Costs incurred in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new civil aero-engine/aircraft combinations including 
payments made to airframe manufacturers for this and participation fees are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they 
can be recovered out of future sales and are charged to the income statement over the programme life, up to a maximum of 15 years  
from the entry into service of the product.
Research and development
In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets, expenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either  
to a research phase or to a development phase.
All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure is capitalised as an internally generated 
intangible asset only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits.  
As described on page 115, the Group considers that it is not possible to distinguish reliably between research and development activities 
until relatively late in the programme.
Expenditure capitalised is amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years from the entry into service of the product.
Contractual aftermarket rights
As described under key judgements on page 113, the Group may sell OE to customers at a price below its cost, on the basis that it also 
receives valuable aftermarket rights. Such a sale is considered to give rise to an intangible asset which is recognised, in accordance with  
IAS 38, at the same time as the revenue at an amount equal to the cash deficit and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the period  
that highly probable aftermarket sales are expected to be earned.
Customer relationships
The fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired company’s established 
relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Amortisation occurs on a straight-line  
basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.

Software
The cost of acquiring software that is not specific to an item of property, plant and equipment is classified as an intangible asset and 
amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of five years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment 
over their estimated useful lives. No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction. Estimated useful lives are as follows:
i) land and buildings, as advised by the Group’s professional advisers:
 a) freehold buildings – five to 45 years (average 25 years);
 b) leasehold buildings – lower of adviser’s estimates or period of lease;
 c) no depreciation is provided on freehold land;
ii) plant and equipment – five to 25 years (average 13 years);
iii) aircraft and engines – five to 20 years (average 13 years).
Operating leases
Payments made and rentals received under operating lease arrangements are charged/credited to the income statement on a straight-
line basis.
Impairment of non-current assets
Impairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Where the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Goodwill 
and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment 
and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually. If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment  
test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced  
to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised as an expense. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair 
value less costs to sell, if this is readily available. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate  
that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset.
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Cost comprises direct 
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with  
a maturity of three months or less on inception. The Group considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its  
cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Post-retirement benefits
Pensions and similar benefits (principally healthcare) are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value, using a discount rate derived from high-quality corporate 
bonds denominated in the currency of the plan, whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value. Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets 
only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future. A liability is recognised to the extent that the minimum 
funding requirements in respect of past service will give rise to an unrecognisable surplus. 
The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement:
• current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees;
• past service costs are recognised immediately; and
• financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses and movements in unrecognised surpluses and minimum funding liabilities are recognised immediately in OCI.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies continued
Share-based payments
The Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees. These are principally equity-settled arrangements and  
are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed  
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares  
or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result of the total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition  
in the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
Cash-settled share options (grants in the International ShareSave plan) are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group 
recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that will 
actually vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement 
for the year.
The cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans 
is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet. See note 21 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.
Sales financing support
In connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers. These arrangements 
fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 39 and IFRS 4 
Insurance Contracts, credit-based guarantees are treated as insurance contracts. The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be 
non-financial liabilities and accordingly these are also treated as insurance contracts. As described on page 115, the Directors consider the 
likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.
The Group’s contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers  
and a broad product portfolio, and are reported on a discounted basis.
Revisions to Adopted IFRS in 2015
There were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on the 2015 financial statements. 
Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2015
Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU. 
Once endorsed, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not 
anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (effective for the year ending 31 December 2018, not yet endorsed by the EU) provides  
a single, principles-based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services 
to customers. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in IAS 11 Construction 
Contracts and IAS 18 Revenue. Given the nature of the Group’s long-term contracts, it is likely that the adoption of IFRS 15 will require 
significant judgement.
Based on the provisional assessment, IFRS 15 will have a significant impact on the timing of recognition of revenue on individual long-term 
contracts, most particularly in the Civil Aerospace business, although this impact is likely to be significantly reduced at a Group level when all 
long-term contracts (with different start and end dates) are combined. The key areas of judgement are: (i) whether contractual aftermarket 
rights can continue to be recognised; (ii) whether OE and TotalCare contracts can be linked for accounting purposes; and (iii) how performance 
should be measured on TotalCare contracts. The Group will continue to assess the impact during 2016 and also consider the interpretations 
of other aerospace and defence companies .
IFRS 16 Leases (effective for the year ending 31 December 2019, not yet endorsed by the EU) will require all leases to be recognised on the 
balance sheet. Currently, IAS 17 Leases only requires leases categorised as finance leases to be recognised on the balance sheet, with leases 
categorised as operating leases not recognised. In broad terms, the impact will be to recognise a lease liability and corresponding asset 
for the operating lease commitments set out in note 22.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have 
a significant impact on the financial statements.

2 Segmental analysis
The analysis by Division (business segment) is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those segments 
whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8), as follows:
AEROSPACE DIVISION:
Civil  – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence  – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
LAND & SEA DIVISION:
Power Systems – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of reciprocating engines and power systems.
Marine  – development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Nuclear –  development, manufacture, marketing and sales of nuclear systems for civil power generation and naval  
propulsion systems. 
The Energy business was sold on 1 December 2014 and is excluded from the 2014 comparative figures. The residual businesses previously 
included in the Energy sector and costs associated with the wind-down are shown as ‘Other’.
The operating results reviewed by the Board are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board considers reflects better the economic 
substance of the Group’s trading during the year. Additional disclosure of the two segments is also provided. The principles adopted to 
determine underlying results are:
Underlying revenues – Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, 
these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
Underlying profit before financing – Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group 
undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts. In addition, adjustments have 
been made to exclude one-off past service credits on post-retirement schemes, exceptional restructuring costs, the effect of acquisition 
accounting and the impairment of goodwill.
Underlying profit before taxation – In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing:
• includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast 
to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts; and
• excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, 
changes in value of financial RRSA contracts arising from changes in forecast payments, changes in the value of put options on NCI 
and the net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.
Taxation – the tax effect of the adjustments above are excluded from the underlying tax charge. In addition changes in the amount 
of recoverable advance corporation tax recognised and the impact of changes in tax rates are also excluded.
This analysis also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.

  The basis for the allocation of Civil Aerospace revenues on linked TotalCare contracts between OE and aftermarket has been reviewed and amendments made to reflect better the 
commercial substance of the combined contracts. Historically, the allocation has resulted in OE revenue and aftermarket revenue reflecting the contractual terms rather than the 
commercial substance of the contracts. The 2014 figures have been restated on the same basis; the impact was an increase in OE revenue of £198m and an equal decrease in 
aftermarket revenue.

DEFERRED TAXATION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
The Summer Budget 2015 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 19% from 1 April 2017 and 18% from 1 April 2020; 
these reductions were substantively enacted on 26 October 2015. As the reductions were substantively enacted prior to the year end, 
the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate. The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in 
the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity. Accordingly, in 2015, 
£18m has been credited to the income statement and £3m has been charged directly to equity.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability 
has not been recognised, aggregate to £347m (2014: £512m). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding 
tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that 
consent will not be given in the foreseeable future. 
6 Earnings per ordinary share
Basic earnings per ordinary share (EPS) are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares held under trust, which have been treated as if they had 
been cancelled.
Diluted EPS are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the bonus element 
of share options.

Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2015 on the following basis:
• The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the 
most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on 
market conditions. Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Group’s products (product lives are often measured in 
decades), these forecasts generally cover the next ten years. Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a 
range of growth rates 2.0-2.75%) that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
• The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, 
the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs. Impairment tests are 
performed using prevailing exchange rates.
• The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at rates based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for 
specific risk where appropriate. The discount rate used, before taking account of specific risks, is 13% (2014: 13%).
As a result of the continuing poor market conditions in the Marine offshore business caused by the low crude oil price and the 
consequential reduced order intake in the period, the Group has recognised an impairment loss of £69m (included in the total impairment 
charge of £75m) to the carrying value of goodwill of cash generating units in this market. This is included in cost of sales in the income 
statement, but excluded from the underlying results. The impairment loss primarily relates to the cash generating units Scandinavian 
Electric Holding AS (acquired in 2008) and ODIM ASA (acquired in 2010), which are both business operations included in Marine. The 
impairment loss is based on a value in use calculation using cash flows forecast over a ten-year period and a pre-tax discount rate of 13% 
which indicated a recoverable amount of £74m compared with a pre-impairment carrying value of £143m. 
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are:
• Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG – Volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation. These are based on current and 
known future programmes, estimates of capture of market share and long-term economic forecasts. The principal foreign exchange 
exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into euros. For the purposes of the impairment only, cash 
flows from recent management forecasts for a five-year period have been included. Cash flows beyond five years are assumed to grow at 
2% (2014 2%). Reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying 
value, which include a reduction in the level of cash generation of 9%, or an increase in the assumed discount rate of 2%.
• Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG – Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation. These are based 
on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts. The principal 
foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros. For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows 
beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% (2014: 2.5%). The Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible 
change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value. The overall level of business 
would need to reduce by more than 69% to cause an impairment of this balance.
• Vinters Limited – Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation. These are based on current and known 
future programmes, estimates of customers’ fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts. The principal foreign exchange 
exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner. For the purposes of the 
impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5% (2014: 2.5%). The Directors do not consider 
that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value. 
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 54% to cause an impairment of this balance.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and contractual aftermarket rights have been reviewed for impairment 
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been 
performed on the following basis:
• The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent 
forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market 
conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
• The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount 
rates, and foreign exchange rates.
• The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11% (2014: 11%), based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, 
reduced where relevant to take account of the lower risk associated with contracted aftermarket flows.
No impairment is required on this basis. However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that 
are outside the Group’s control (discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays), could result in impairment in future years.
During the year, following analysis of the first major overhauls of the Trent 1000 engines, the recoverable amount of certain contractual 
aftermarket rights have been reassessed. This analysis demonstrated that the aftermarket cash flows from the engines were better than 
originally assumed, arising from both operational and contractual performance improvements. As a result of this analysis, the value in use 
(based on a pre-tax discount rate of 9%) has increased to around £140m, exceeding the unimpaired carrying value of £72m. Accordingly, 
cumulative impairments prior to 2015 of £50m have been reversed. This reversal is included in the Civil Aerospace business cost of sales. 134 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

on 24 March 2014. From this date, the Group had an effective economic interest in RRPSH of 100% and NCI of £584m was transferred to 
retained earnings. The Group acquired the shares on 26 August 2014, giving it a 100% interest in RRPSH.

would net off. If this occurred with every counterparty, total financial assets would be nil and liabilities £1,731m.

Financial RRSAs (110) (110) (145) (152)
The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, 
willing parties in an arms-length transaction. Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the 
balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value.
B  Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not 
exceeding six months.
C  Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash ﬂows using prevailing interest rate curves. Amounts 
denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, 
derived from observable market prices (Level 2 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement).
D Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
E  The fair value of RRSAs is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows. The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest 
forecasts (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13).
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines a three level valuation hierarchy:
Level 1 – quoted prices for similar instruments
Level 2 – directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs
Level 3 – inputs not based on observable market data    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 141

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses various ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. Where the effectiveness 
of a hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash 
flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item. The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure 
to movements in the price of commodities (jet fuel and base metals). To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated 
in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges. The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward 
rate agreements to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.
Movements in the fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities were as follows:

EXERCISE PRICE OF PUT OPTION ON NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND FINANCIAL RISK AND REVENUE SHARING ARRANGEMENTS
The Group has ﬁnancial liabilities arising from ﬁnancial RRSAs. These ﬁnancial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the 
amortised cost method. This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash ﬂows of the arrangements using the internal rate 
of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate. 
The Group had agreed a put option with Daimler AG, such that Daimler could sell its interest in Rolls-Royce Power Systems Holding GmbH 
to the Group. Daimler AG exercised this option on 24 March 2014 and the Group acquired Daimler’s 50% share of RRPSH on 26 August 2014. 
Prior to this, the fair value of the exercise value of this option was included as a financial liability.  142 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

The principal ﬁnancial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk; liquidity risk; credit risk; interest rate 
risk; and commodity price risk. The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk – The Group has signiﬁcant cash ﬂows (most signiﬁcantly US dollars, followed by the euro) 
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity. To manage its exposures to changes in values 
of future foreign currency cash ﬂows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the 
Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not 
designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative ﬁnancial instruments denominated in foreign currencies. To manage the 
risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value 
hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments. The Group aims to match its translational 
exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities. Where appropriate, foreign currency ﬁnancial liabilities may be designated 
as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk – The Group’s policy is to hold ﬁnancial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufﬁcient to 
ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen 
obligations and opportunities. The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, 
enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk. 
Credit risk – The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its ﬁnancial 
instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Group’s risk management activities. The 
Group has credit policies covering both trading and ﬁnancial exposures. Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a 
central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Group’s 
exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with ‘BBB+’ or higher rated financial institutions 
based on pre-established limits per financial institution. At the balance sheet date, there were no signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk to 
individual customers or counterparties. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying 
value of each ﬁnancial asset, including derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
Interest rate risk – The Group’s interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its ﬁxed rate borrowings (fair value risk), ﬂoating rate borrowings 
and cash and cash equivalents (cash ﬂow risk). Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate proﬁle within the 
Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position. 
These are designated as either fair value or cash ﬂow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk – The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations. To minimise its cash 
ﬂow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. For accounting purposes, these 
derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Other price risk – The Group’s cash equivalent balances represent investments in money-market instruments, with a term of up to three 
months. The Group does not consider that these are subject to signiﬁcant price risk.    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 143

Some of the Group’s borrowings are subject to the Group meeting certain obligations, including customary ﬁnancial covenants. If the 
Group fails to meet its obligations these arrangements give rights to the lenders, upon agreement, to accelerate repayment of the 
facilities. There are no rating triggers contained in any of the Group’s facilities that could require the Group to accelerate or repay any 
facility for a given movement in the Group’s credit rating. 
In addition, the Group has £1,780m (2014: £1,277m) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities available for at least the next two years.

At 31 December 2015 the Group had no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates on that date. The main interest rate sensitivity for the Group 
arises as a result of the gross up of net cash and this is mitigated as described under the interest rate risk management policies on page 142. 
C SHARES AND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. C Shares in 
respect of a year are issued in the following year. Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash. Any C Shares 
retained attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting 
rights. The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less 
than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
Movements in issued and fully paid C Shares during the year were as follows:

Provisions for warranties and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and generally cover a period of up to three years.
Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years. 
In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide ﬁnancing support for its customers – generally in respect 
of civil aircraft. The Group’s commitments relating to these ﬁnancing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number of customers 
and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing. These include commitments of US$3.1bn to provide 
borrowing facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft (of which approximately US$322m could be called during 2016). These facilities may 
only be used if the customer is unable to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate. Consequently the Directors 
do not consider that there is a significant exposure arising from the provision of these facilities.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and/or financing. These guarantees, the risks arising and the 
process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the heading ‘Customer financing’ in the Financial review on page 46. It is 
estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows:

Commitments on delivered aircraft in excess of the amounts provided are shown in the table below. These are reported on a discounted 
basis at the Group’s borrowing rate to reﬂect better the time span over which these exposures could arise. These amounts do not represent 
values that are expected to crystallise. The commitments are denominated in US dollars. As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow 
hedge accounting for future foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting 
date spot rate. The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser.

 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20% illustrates the sensitivity to changes in this assumption.
The Group’s captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group. Significant 
delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost 
and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information 
currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary. Provisions for outstanding claims 
are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 149

19 Post-retirement benefits
The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:
• UK defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets held in separate trustee administered funds. Employees are entitled to 
retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service; and
• Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice. 
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group’s employment practices include the provision of 
healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These schemes are unfunded.
The valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, where relevant, updated by the scheme 
actuaries to 31 December 2015.
The defined benefit schemes expose the Group to actuarial risks such as longevity, interest rate, inflation and investment risks. In the UK, 
and in the principal US pension schemes, the Group has adopted investment policies to mitigate some of these risks. This involves 
investing a significant proportion of the schemes’ assets in Liability Driven Investment portfolios, which hold investments designed to 
offset interest rate and inflation rate risks. In addition, in the UK, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund has invested in a longevity swap, which is 
designed to offset longevity risks in respect of existing pensioners.
In the UK, surpluses are recognised on schemes where, on ultimate wind-up when there are longer any remaining members, any surplus 
will be returned to the Group.

The Group operates a PaySave scheme in the UK. This is a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee 
contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay. As a result, there is a 
decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of £32m (2014: £35m) in the year.

DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES
Assumptions
Significant actuarial assumptions for UK schemes (weighted average, weighted by the size of the obligation) used at the balance sheet date 
were as follows: 
2015 2014
Discount rate 3.6% 3.6%
Inflation assumption (RPI)
 1
3.2% 3.2%
Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 4.2%
Male life expectancy from age 65: current pensioner 22.8 years 22.5 years 
 future pensioner currently aged 45 24.8 years 24.1 years 
1
 This is the assumption for the Retail Price Index. The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be 1.1% lower
Discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds. The rate is determined by using the profile 
of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
The inflation assumption is determined by the market implied assumption based on the yields on long-term indexed linked government 
securities and increases in salaries are based on actual experience, allowing for promotion, of the real increase above inflation.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAP actuarial tables, with future improvements in 
line with the CMI 2015 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.5%. Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the 
relevant scheme’s actual experience.     Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 151

19 Post-retirement benefits continued
Other assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the 
assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation. The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the relevant 
scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped. 
Assumptions for overseas schemes are less significant and are based on advice from local actuaries. The principal assumptions are:
2015 2014
Discount rate 3.6% 3.3%
Inflation assumption 2.2% 2.2%
Long-term healthcare cost trend rate 5.0% 5.0%
Male life expectancy from age 65: current pensioner 21.1 years 21.1 years

  Under the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty. If pensioners live longer than expected the 
counterparty will make payments to the Fund to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners. If the reverse applies the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme 
will be required to make payments to the counterparty. The longevity swap is valued at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 (Level 3).
The scheme assets do not include any of the Group’s own ﬁnancial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. 
The longevity swap is valued by the scheme actuaries based on the difference between the agreed longevity assumptions at inception and 
actual longevity experience. All other fair values are provided by the fund managers. Where available, the fair values are quoted prices (eg. listed 
equity, sovereign debt and corporate bonds). Unlisted investments (private equity) are included at values provided by the fund manager in 
accordance with relevant guidance. Other significant assets are valued based on observable inputs such as yield curves.

  Where a surplus has arisen on a scheme, in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus is recognised as an asset only if it represents an unconditional economic benefit available 
to the Group in the future. Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet. During 2014, the rules of one scheme were amended, which removed the 
restriction on recognising the surplus.
2
  A minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements require future contributions in respect of past service that will result in a future unrecognisable surplus.
FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS
The Group expects to contribute approximately £260m to its defined benefit schemes in 2016.
In the UK, the funding is set on the basis of a triennial funding valuation by the actuaries for which the assumptions may differ from those 
above. In particular, the discount rate used to value the obligations takes account of the investment strategy, rather than being based on 
market yields of AA corporate bonds. As a result of these valuations, the Group and the scheme trustees agree a Schedule of Contributions 
(SoC), which sets out the required contributions from the employer and employees for current service. Where the scheme is in deficit, the 
SoC also includes required contributions from the employer to eliminate the deficit. The most recent agreed triennial valuations for the 
principal schemes are:

Sensitivities
The calculations of the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the assumptions set out above. The following table summarises how the 
estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2015, while holding 
all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is 
unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.
For the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation on an 
economic basis and in the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund in the UK, the longevity of pensioners. Where appropriate, the table also includes the 
corresponding movement in the value of the plan assets.

  The difference between the sensitivities on obligations and plan assets arises largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting and economic 
purposes. On an economic basis the correlation is approximately 97% for discount rates and 89% for inflation.

As share options are exercised throughout the year, the weighted average share price during the year of 820p (2014: 1013p) is 
representative of the weighted average share price at the date of exercise. The closing price at 31 December 2015 was 575p (2014: 870p).
FAIR VALUES OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS
The weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date 
of grant, are as follows:
2015 2014
PSP – 25% TSR uplift 1,015p 1,105p 
PSP – 50% TSR uplift 1,036p 1,227p 
ShareSave – 3 year grant 192p n/a 
ShareSave – 5 year grant 219p n/a 
APRA n/a 984p 
PSP
The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends 
(or equivalent) during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation 
of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price 
performance and TSR vesting. This adjustment increases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave
The fair value of the options granted under the ShareSave plan is calculated using a binomial pricing model that assumes that participants 
will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it 
assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term. This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between 
the start and end of the exercise window.
APRA
The fair value of shares awarded under APRA is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends (or equivalent).

23 Contingent liabilities
Contingent liabilities in respect of customer financing commitments are described in note 18.
On 6 December 2012, the Company announced that it had passed information to the Serious Fraud Office (SFO), following a request from 
the SFO for information about allegations of malpractice in overseas markets. On 23 December 2013, the Company announced that it had 
been informed by the SFO that it had commenced a formal investigation. Since the initial announcement, the Company has continued its 
investigations and is engaging with the SFO and other authorities in the UK, the USA and elsewhere in relation to the matters of concern.
The consequence of these disclosures will be decided by the regulatory authorities. It is too early to predict the outcomes, but these could include 
the prosecution of individuals and of the Group. Accordingly, the potential for fines, penalties or other consequences cannot currently be 
assessed. As the investigation is ongoing, it is not yet possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, 
performance and reliability. The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export ﬁnance, 
performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions 
and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the 
insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from 
employees who worked for certain of the Group’s UK-based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the 
Group. While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these 
arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in signiﬁcant loss to the Group. 
The Group’s share of equity accounted entities’ contingent liabilities is £11m (2014: £11m). 156 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework 
(‘FRS 101’) on the historical cost basis.
These are the Company’s first financial statements prepared in accordance with FRS 101.
In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted IFRS’), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the 
Companies Act 2006.
In the transition to FRS 101, the Company has applied IFRS 1, whilst ensuring that its assets and liabilities are measured in compliance 
with FRS 101. 
In these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
• a cash flow statement and related notes; and
• the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Transactions and has, therefore, not disclosed transactions between the Company and its wholly 
owned subsidiaries.
FRS 101 has had no impact on the figures presented in these financial statements. 
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been included in these 
financial statements. As permitted by the audit fee disclosure regulations, disclosure of non-audit fees information is not included in 
respect of the Company.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are reported at cost less any amounts written off.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
As described in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 77 to 89, the Company grants awards of its own shares to employees of its 
subsidiary undertakings (see note 21 of the consolidated financial statements). The costs of share-based payments in respect of these 
awards are accounted for, by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary undertakings. The costs are determined in 
accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. Any payments made by the subsidiary undertakings in respect of these arrangements are 
treated as a return of this investment.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
In accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the Company’s C Shares are classified as financial liabilities and held 
at amortised cost from the date of issue until redeemed.

The rights attaching to each class of share are set out on page 178.
In accordance with IAS 32, the Company’s non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) are classified as financial liabilities. 
Accordingly, movements in C Shares are included in note 3.
5 Contingent liabilities
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the 
Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.
At 31 December 2015, these guarantees amounted to £1,937m (2014: £959m).

OPINIONS AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING FROM OUR AUDIT
1 OUR OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
IS UNMODIFIED
We have audited the financial statements of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 107 to 166.
In our opinion:
•  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 
2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;
•  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union (Adopted IFRS);
•  the parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
•  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
2 OUR ASSESSMENT OF RISKS OF MA TERIAL MISST A TEMENT
When planning our audit, we made an assessment of the relative 
significance of the key risks of material misstatement to the 
Group financial statements initially without taking account of the 
effectiveness of controls implemented by the Group. This initial 
assessment is shown below in the output from our Dynamic Audit 
planning tool. As there has been no significant change in the Group’s 
operations or in our assessment of materiality these key risks are the 
same as in the prior year, though there have been some changes in 
the significance to our audit of some of the risks.
Of the 18 key risks identified, we describe below (i) the eight risks 
of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit 
(those in dark blue on the risk map – the descriptions of risks include 
an explanation for the changes in significance of these risks from last 
year), (ii) our key audit procedures to address those risks and (iii) our 
findings from those procedures in order that the Company’s members 
as a body may better understand the process by which we arrived 
at our audit opinion. Our findings are the result of procedures 
undertaken in the context of and solely for the purpose of our 
statutory audit opinion on the financial statements as a whole and 
consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not express 
discrete opinions on separate elements of the financial statements.
 A  The pressure on and incentives for management to meet 
revised revenue and profit guidance
Refer to pages 22 to 41 (Business review) and pages 93 to 94 (Audit 
Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk – The Group has published a number of revisions to its revenue 
and profit guidance during the last two years with a generally 
decreasing trend in profit and revenue and there have been significant 
associated decreases in the Group’s share price. Clear instructions were 
given to the Executive Leadership Team and the senior finance 
executives on more than one occasion not to take any account of the 
pressure to meet forecasts in preparing the financial results and to 
manage and be alert to how this pressure might affect personnel 
across the wider Group. Nevertheless, the continuing heightened

Likelihood of material misstatement 168 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Other information / Independent Auditor’s report
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
pressure on and incentives for management to meet the latest 
guidance increases the inherent risk of manipulation of the Group 
financial statements. The financial results are sensitive to significant 
estimates and judgements, particularly in respect of revenues and 
costs associated with long-term contracts, and there is a broad range 
of acceptable outcomes of these that could lead to different levels 
of profit and revenue being reported in the financial statements. 
Relatively small changes in the basis of those judgements and 
estimates could result in the Group meeting, exceeding or falling 
short of guidance. 
The significance of the risk has increased marginally due to revisions 
to guidance issued during the year, continuing deterioration in the 
short-term business outlook and the incidence of individually 
significant items affecting profit.
Our response – We have: (i) extended our enquiries designed to assess 
whether judgements and estimates exhibited unconscious bias or 
whether management had taken systematic actions to manipulate 
the reported results; (ii) compared the results to forecasts and 
challenged variances at a much lower level than we would otherwise 
have done based on our understanding of factors affecting business 
performance with corroboration using external data where possible; 
and (iii) applied an increased level of scepticism throughout the audit 
by increasing the involvement of the senior audit team personnel, 
with particular focus on audit procedures designed to assess whether 
revenues and costs have been recognised in the correct accounting 
period, whether central adjustments were appropriate and whether 
the segmental analysis has been properly prepared.
In particular:
•  when considering the risk relating to The measurement of revenue 
and profit in the Civil Aerospace business ( C refer to page 169), 
we challenged the basis for changes in the estimated revenues 
and costs in long-term contracts, with a heightened awareness 
of the possibility of unconscious or systematic bias, particularly 
regarding the refinement in the basis of measurement of the risk 
contingency for forecasts of future revenue to be earned under 
long-term contracts which resulted in recognition of profit 
of £189m;
•  when considering the risk relating to Recoverability of intangible 
assets in the Civil Aerospace business ( D refer to page 170), 
we challenged with a heightened awareness of the possibility 
of unconscious or systematic bias the basis for changes in the 
estimated maintenance costs which led to the reversal of the 
impairment on certain Trent 1000 launch engine Contractual 
aftermarket rights (“CARs”) assets and a related provision which 
resulted in recognition of profit of £65m and avoidance 
of impairments of £22m that otherwise would have been recorded; 
•  when considering the risk relating to The basis of accounting for 
revenue and profit in the Civil Aerospace business ( B refer below), 
we challenged the basis on which management had accounted 
for a sale of engines and a long-term service agreement as a 
single arrangement which resulted in recognition of profit of 
£44m despite there being a significant period of time between 
concluding these agreements; and
•  when considering the risk relating to The presentation of 
underlying profit ( G refer to page 171) and the risk relating 
to Disclosure of the effect on the trend in profit of items which are 
uneven in frequency or amount ( H refer to page 172), we sought 
to identify items that affected profit (and/or the trend in profit) 
unevenly in frequency or amount (especially those where 
management had a greater degree of discretion over the timing 
or scale of transactions entered into) at a much lower level than 
we would otherwise have done and to assess the balance and 
transparency of disclosure of these items.
Our findings – Our testing did not identify any indication of 
manipulation of results (2014 audit finding: one instance which 
was corrected by management). We found the degree of caution/
optimism adopted in estimates to be slightly less cautious than 
in the previous year, but balanced overall. We found that there was 
ample unbiased disclosure of items affecting the trend in profit.
 B  The basis of accounting for revenue and profit in the 
Civil Aerospace business
Refer to page 113 and 114 (Key areas of judgement – Introduction, 
Contractual aftermarket rights, Linkage of original and long-term 
aftermarket contracts), pages 116 and 117 (Significant accounting 
policies – Revenue recognition) and pages 93 and 94 
(Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk – The amount of revenue and profit recognised in a year on 
the sale of engines and aftermarket services is dependent, inter alia, 
on the appropriate assessment of whether or not each long-term 
aftermarket contract for services is linked to or separate from the 
contract for sale of the related engines as this drives the accounting 
basis to be applied. As the commercial arrangements can be 
complex, significant judgement is applied in selecting the 
accounting basis in each case. The most significant risk is that 
the Group might inappropriately account for sales of engines and 
long-term service agreements as a single arrangement as this 
would usually lead to revenue and profit being recognised too early 
because the margin in the long-term service agreement is usually 
higher than the margin in the engine sale agreement.
The significance of the risk has increased marginally during the year 
due to the identification of one instance where the Group had to 
apply significant judgement in concluding that it was appropriate 
to account for the sale of engines and the long-term service 
agreement as a single arrangement.
Our response – We re-evaluated the appropriateness of the 
accounting bases the Group applies in the Civil Aerospace business 
by reference to accounting standards and re-examining historical 
long-term aftermarket contracts. We considered whether the 
disclosure included in the financial statements enables shareholders 
to understand how the accounting policies represent the commercial 
substance of the Group’s contracts with its customers. We made 
our own independent assessment, with reference to the relevant 
accounting standards, of the accounting basis that should be applied 
to each long-term aftermarket contract entered into during the year 
and compared this to the accounting basis applied by the Group.
Our findings – We found that the Group has developed a framework 
for selecting the accounting bases which is consistent with a 
balanced interpretation of accounting standards (2014 audit 
finding: balanced) and has applied this consistently. We found that 
the disclosure was ample.     Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 169
Other information
Independent Auditor’s report
For the agreements entered into during this year, it was generally 
clear which accounting basis should apply. We identified one 
instance where the Group had to apply significant judgement in 
concluding that it was appropriate to account for the sale of engines 
and the long-term service agreement as a single arrangement, 
resulting in the recognition of incremental profit of £44m. In this 
case there was a longer than usual period between conclusion of the 
engine sale contract and conclusion of the long-term service 
agreement. We found sufficient evidence that the key commercial 
terms included in the long-term service agreement had been 
established at the time the engine sale contract had been concluded 
and that the intention of both parties had always been to enter 
into a long-term service agreement on those terms. Consequently, 
we found the judgements made in the application of the Group’s 
accounting bases to these particular contracts to be balanced.
 C  The measurement of revenue and profit in the 
Civil Aerospace business
Refer to page 114 (Key areas of judgement – Measurement of 
performance on long-term aftermarket contracts), pages 116 and 117 
(Significant accounting policies – Revenue recognition and TotalCare 
arrangements) and pages 93 and 94 (Audit Committee report – 
Financial reporting)
The risk – The amount of revenue and profit recognised in a year 
on the sale of engines and aftermarket services is dependent, inter 
alia, on the assessment of the percentage of completion of long-term 
aftermarket contracts and the forecast cost profile of each 
arrangement. As long-term aftermarket contracts can extend over 
significant periods and the profitability of these arrangements 
typically assumes significant life-cycle cost improvement over the 
term of the contracts, the estimated outturn requires significant 
judgement to be applied in estimating future engine flying hours, 
time on wing and other operating parameters, the pattern of future 
maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred. The nature of these 
estimates means that their continual refinement can have an impact 
on the profits of the Civil Aerospace business that can be significant in 
an individual financial year. The assessment of the estimated outturn 
for each arrangement involves detailed calculations using large and 
complex databases with a significant level of manual intervention.
In 2012, the Group made changes to the way it takes account of risk 
in making these estimates and agreed with the Audit Committee that 
it would carry out a comprehensive review of how well the revised 
basis reflected actual experience after three years. In 2015, the Group 
has refined the basis of taking account of risk in its estimates of future 
revenue resulting in an increase in estimated future revenue of 
approximately 2% which had a one-off profit benefit of £189m.
This refinement in basis together with changes in customer flying 
patterns on some of the older engine programmes resulted in the 
significance of the risk increasing marginally in the year.
Our response – We tested the controls designed and applied by the 
Group to provide assurance that the estimates used in assessing 
revenue and cost profiles are appropriate and that the resulting 
estimated cumulative profit on these contracts is accurately 
reflected in the financial statements; these controls operated over 
both the inputs and the outputs of the calculations. We challenged 
the appropriateness of these estimates for each programme and 
assessed whether or not the estimates showed any evidence of 
systematic or unconscious management bias in the context of the 
heightened pressure on and incentives for management to meet 
the latest guidance discussed above. Our challenge was based on 
our assessment of the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates 
in previous periods, identification and analysis of changes in 
assumptions from prior periods and an assessment of the 
consistency of assumptions within programmes. 
In particular with regard to the refined approach to revenue 
forecasting risk, we assessed the extent to which the new basis 
better incorporates business risks affecting the Group’s customers 
based on recently emerging trends being experienced by the Group 
and our own experience. 
In terms of future cost estimates, we undertook detailed assessments 
of the achievability of the Group’s plans to reduce life-cycle costs 
and an analysis of the impact of these plans on forecast cost profiles 
taking account of contingencies and analysis of the impact of known 
technical issues on cost forecasts. Our analysis considered each 
significant airframe that is powered by the Group’s engines and 
was based on our own experience supplemented by discussions with 
an aircraft valuation specialist engaged by the Group. We assessed 
whether the valuation specialist was objective and suitably qualified. 
We also checked the mathematical accuracy of the revenue and profit 
for each arrangement and considered the implications of identified 
errors and changes in estimates.
Our findings – Control weaknesses identified in earlier periods 
have been partially remediated. The scope and depth of our detailed 
testing and analysis was expanded to take account of the remaining 
weaknesses. We found no evidence that the refinement to the basis 
for incorporating revenue risk was motivated by the positive impact 
it has had on profit in the current year. Overall, our assessment is that 
the refined basis for incorporating revenue risk is an improvement 
and the assumptions and resulting estimates (including appropriate 
contingencies) resulted in balanced (2014 audit finding: mildly 
cautious) profit recognition. We found the disclosure of the impact 
of the refined basis for incorporating revenue risk to be ample. 170 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
 D  Recoverability of intangible assets (certification costs and 
participation fees, development expenditure and contractual 
aftermarket rights) in the Civil Aerospace business
Refer to page 115 (Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Forecasts and 
discount rates), pages 119 and 120 (Significant accounting policies – 
Certification costs and participation fees, Research and development, 
Contractual aftermarket rights and Impairment of non-current assets), 
pages 132 and 133 (Note 9 to the financial statements – Intangible 
assets) and pages 93 and 94 (Audit Committee report – Financial 
reporting)
The risk – The recovery of these assets depends on a combination 
of achieving sufficiently profitable business in the future as well 
as the ability of customers to pay amounts due under contracts 
often over a long period of time. Assets relating to a particular engine 
programme are more prone to the risk of impairment in the early 
years of a programme as the engine’s market position is established. 
In addition, the pricing of business with launch customers makes 
assets relating to these engines more prone to the risk of impairment.
In 2015, the Group reduced its estimate of the future maintenance 
costs on certain Trent 1000 launch engines which in previous 
periods had been at a level requiring the impairment of the related 
CARs assets and the recording of a related provision. This resulted in 
the reversal of previously recognised impairments and the related 
provision with a profit of £65m being recognised (2014: impairment 
charge of £19m) and the capitalisation of £22m that would otherwise 
have been impaired.
The significance of the risk has decreased somewhat during the year 
due to better information on the performance of the T rent 1000 engine 
following the first shop visits and confirmation of the Emirates order 
for T rent 900 engines (the T rent 900 programme assets had been 
identified as being at higher risk of impairment in the prior year). 
Our response – We tested the controls designed and applied by the 
Group to provide assurance that the assumptions used in preparing 
the impairment calculations are regularly updated, that changes are 
monitored, scrutinised and approved by appropriate personnel and 
that the final assumptions used in impairment testing have been 
appropriately approved. We challenged the appropriateness of the 
key assumptions in the impairment test (including market size, 
market share, pricing, engine and aftermarket unit costs, individual 
programme assumptions, price and cost escalation, discount rate 
and exchange rates). Our challenge was based on our assessment 
of the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates in previous 
periods, our understanding of the commercial prospects of key 
engine programmes, identification and analysis of changes in 
assumptions from prior periods and an assessment of the 
consistency of assumptions across programmes and customers 
and comparison of assumptions with publicly available data where 
this was available. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the 
impairment calculations. We considered whether the disclosures 
in note 9 to the financial statements describe the inherent degree of 
subjectivity in the estimates and the potential impact on future 
periods of revisions to these estimates.
In particular, with regard to the reversal of impairments on 
certain Trent 1000 launch engine CARs and a related provision, 
we challenged the key assumptions underlying the forecast future 
cash flows to be derived from the engines including: the period 
and mode of operation of the engines, the time and materials 
maintenance revenue (which the Group has guaranteed will not 
exceed a specified maximum amount) and the cost of required 
maintenance activity. Our assessment was that the amount of 
profit to be recognised depended critically on the Group 
engineering department’s judgement as to the impact on estimated 
future maintenance costs of the wear and tear on the engines based 
on their first few years of operation (evidenced by the first strip 
down and detailed off-wing investigations of engines in the second 
half of 2015). Given the specialist knowledge necessary to make 
these judgements appropriately, we assessed the capabilities and 
objectivity of the employees making the judgement and the members 
of management reviewing and approving the judgements. Finally 
to supplement this and to ensure that the matter had received 
appropriate attention from the Board, we sought and received 
written representations from the Directors that, based on their 
enquiries, they consider that the engineering judgement is 
appropriate and that, based on that consideration, the recognition 
of the profit of £65m is appropriate.
Our findings – Our testing did not identify weaknesses in the 
design and operation of controls that would have required us 
to expand the nature or scope of our planned detailed test work. 
We found that the assumptions and resulting estimates were 
balanced (2014 audit finding: balanced) and that the disclosures 
were proportionate (2014 audit finding: proportionate). We found 
no errors in calculations (2014 audit finding: none).
With regard to the reversal of impairments on certain Trent 1000 
launch engine CARs and a related provision, we found no evidence 
that this was motivated by the positive impact it has had on profit 
in the current year. We found that the change in estimate from the 
prior periods was based on improved information becoming 
available in 2015 as the engine programme moved out of its earliest 
stages which has reduced estimation uncertainty, that there was 
no indication of bias and that the estimate of forecast future cash 
flows to be derived from the engines was balanced and supported 
the accounting treatments adopted by the Group. We found the 
disclosure of the impact to be ample.
 E Liabilities arising from sales financing arrangements
Refer to page 115 (Key areas of judgement – Customer financing 
contingent liabilities), page 121 (Significant accounting policies – 
Sales financing support), page 148 (Note 18 to the financial 
statements – Provisions for liabilities and charges) and pages 93 
and 94 (Audit Committee report – Financial reporting)
The risk – The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of financing 
and asset value support provided to customers. This support 
typically takes the form of a guarantee with respect to the value 
of an aircraft at a future date, a commitment to buy used aircraft 
or a guarantee of a customer’s future payments under an aircraft 
financing arrangement. The Group also provides standby finance 
lines to certain customers that can be accessed if they fail 
to arrange alternative financing at the time they take delivery 
of engines. Judgement is required to assess the likelihood of these 
liabilities crystallising, in order to assess whether a provision 
should be recognised and, if so, the amount of that provision. 
The total potential liability is significant and can be affected 
by the assessment of the residual value of the aircraft and the 
creditworthiness of the customers.
The significance of the risk has not changed during the year.    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 171
Other information
Independent Auditor’s report
Our response – We analysed the terms of guarantees on aircraft 
delivered during the year in detail and obtained aircraft values from 
and held discussions with aircraft valuation specialists engaged 
by the Group. We assessed whether the valuer was objective and 
suitably qualified, had been appropriately instructed and had been 
provided with complete, accurate data on which to base its 
evaluation. For all contracts on delivered aircraft, we assessed 
the commercial factors relevant to the likelihood of the guarantees 
being called, including the credit ratings and recent financial 
performance of the relevant customers and their fleet plans, and 
critically assessed the Group’s estimate of the required provisions 
for those liabilities. We considered movements in aircraft values 
and potential changes in the assessed probability of a liability 
crystallising since the previous year end and considered whether 
the evidence supported the Group’s assessment as to whether or 
not a liability needs to be recognised and the amount of the liability 
recognised or contingent liability disclosed. We considered whether 
the related disclosure in note 18 to the financial statements 
appropriately explains the potential liability in excess of the amount 
provided for in the financial statements for delivered aircraft and 
highlights the significant but unquantifiable contingent liability 
in respect of aircraft which will be delivered in the future.
Our findings – We found that the level of exposure from asset value 
support had reduced during the year and that the assumptions and 
estimates were balanced (2014 audit finding: balanced) and that the 
disclosures were proportionate (2014 audit finding: proportionate).
 F   Bribery and corruption
Refer to page 155 (Note 23 to the financial statements – 
Contingent liabilities) and pages 93 and 94 (Audit Committee report 
– Financial reporting)
The risk – A large part of the Group’s business is characterised 
by competition for individually significant contracts with 
customers, which are often directly or indirectly associated with 
governments, and the award of individually significant contracts 
to suppliers. The procurement processes associated with these 
activities are highly susceptible to the risk of corruption. In addition 
the Group operates in a number of territories where the use 
of commercial intermediaries is either required by the government 
or is normal practice. In December 2013, the Group announced that 
it had been informed by the Serious Fraud Office in the UK that it 
had commenced a formal investigation into bribery and corruption 
in overseas markets. The Group is cooperating with the Serious 
Fraud Office and other agencies, including the US Department 
of Justice. Breaches of laws and regulations in this area can lead to 
fines, penalties, criminal prosecution, commercial litigation and 
restrictions on future business.
The significance of the risk has not changed during the year.
Our response – We evaluated and tested the Group’s policies, 
procedures and controls over the selection and renewal of 
intermediaries, contracting arrangements, ongoing management, 
payments and responses to suspected breaches of policy. We sought 
to identify and tested payments made to intermediaries during the 
year, made enquiries of appropriate personnel and evaluated the tone 
set by the Board and the Executive Leadership Team and the Group’s 
approach to managing this risk. Having enquired of management, 
the Audit Committee and the Board as to whether the Group is in 
compliance with laws and regulations relating to bribery and 
corruption, we made written enquiries of and met with the Group’s 
legal advisers to cross check the results of those enquiries with third 
parties and maintained a high level of vigilance to possible indications 
of significant non-compliance with laws and regulations relating to 
bribery and corruption whilst carrying out our other audit procedures. 
We discussed the areas of potential or suspected breaches of law, 
including the ongoing investigations, with the Audit Committee and 
the Board as well as the Group’s legal advisers and assessed related 
documentation. We assessed whether the disclosure in note 23 to the 
financial statements of the Group’s exposure to the financial effects 
of potential or suspected breaches of law or regulation complies with 
accounting standards and in particular whether it is the case that the 
investigations remain at too early a stage to assess the consequences 
(if any), including in particular the size of any possible fines.
Our findings – We found that disclosure to be proportionate 
(2014 audit finding: proportionate).
Presentation and explanation of results
Refer to pages 22 to 41 (Business review), pages 42 to 47 
(Financial review), pages 122 to 126 (Note 2 to the financial statements 
– Segmental analysis) and pages 93 and 94 (Audit Committee report 
– Financial reporting)
 G  The presentation of ‘underlying profit’
The risk – In addition to its Adopted IFRS financial statements, the 
Group presents an alternative income statement on an ‘underlying’ 
basis. The directors believe the ‘underlying’ income statement 
reflects better the Group’s trading performance during the year. 
The basis of adjusting between the Adopted IFRS and ‘underlying’ 
income statements and a full reconciliation between them is set 
out in note 2 to the financial statements on pages 124 and 125. 
A significant recurring adjustment between the Adopted IFRS 
income statement and the ‘underlying’ income statement relates 
to the foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign currency 
transactions. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts 
to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions 
denominated in foreign currencies but does not generally apply 
hedge accounting in its Adopted IFRS income statement. The 
‘underlying’ income statement translates these amounts at the 
achieved foreign exchange rate on forward foreign exchange 
contracts settled in the period, retranslates assets and liabilities 
at exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement 
of such contracts and excludes unrealised gains and losses on such 
contracts which are included in the Adopted IFRS income statement. 
The Group has discretion over which forward foreign exchange 
contracts are settled in each financial year, which could impact the 
achieved rate both for the period and in the future. 
In addition, adjustments are made to exclude one-off past-service 
costs on post-retirement schemes, restructuring activities that 
significantly change the shape of the Group’s operations and the effect 
of acquisition accounting (including any subsequent impairments 
of goodwill or other intangible assets) and a number of other items. 
Alternative performance measures can provide shareholders with 
appropriate additional information if properly used and presented. 
In such cases, measures such as these can assist shareholders 
in gaining a more detailed and hence better understanding 
of a company’s financial performance and strategy. However, 
when improperly used and presented, these kinds of measures  172 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015
Other information / Independent Auditor’s report
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT CONTINUED
might prevent the Annual Report being fair, balanced and 
understandable by hiding the real financial position and results 
or by making the profitability of the reporting entity seem 
more attractive.
The significance of the risk has not changed during the year.
Our response – We assessed the appropriateness of the basis for the 
adjustments between the Adopted IFRS income statement and the 
‘underlying’ income statement and the consistency of application of 
this basis and we recalculated the adjustments with a particular focus 
on the impact of the foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign 
currency amounts in the ‘underlying’ income statement. We assessed 
whether or not the selection of forward foreign exchange contracts 
settled in the year showed any evidence of management bias. 
We also assessed: (i) the extent to which the prominence given to the 
‘underlying’ financial information and related commentary in the 
Annual Report compared to the Adopted IFRS financial information 
and related commentary could be misleading; (ii) whether the Adopted 
IFRS and ‘underlying’ financial information are reconciled with 
sufficient prominence given to that reconciliation; (iii) whether the 
basis of the ‘underlying’ financial information is clearly and accurately 
described and consistently applied; and (iv) whether the ‘underlying’ 
financial information is not otherwise misleading in the form and 
context in which it appears in the Annual Report.
Our findings – We found no concerns regarding the basis of the 
‘underlying’ financial information or its calculation and no indication 
of management bias in the settlement of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. We consider that there is proportionate disclosure of the 
nature and amounts of the adjustments to allow shareholders 
to understand the implications of the two bases on the financial 
measures being presented (2014 audit finding: proportionate). 
We found the overall presentation of the ‘underlying’ financial 
information to be balanced (2014 audit finding: balanced).
 H   Disclosure of the effect on the trend in profit of items which 
are uneven in frequency or amount
The risk – The Group’s profits are significantly impacted by items 
such as cumulative adjustments to profit recognised on long-term 
contracts, impairments (and reversals of impairments) of goodwill, 
CARs and other intangible assets, sale and leasebacks of spare 
engines to joint ventures, research and development charges, 
reorganisation costs and foreign exchange translation which 
can be uneven in frequency and/or amount. If significant either 
to the profit for the year or to the trend in profit, appropriate 
disclosure of the effect of these items is necessary in the Annual 
Report and financial statements to provide the information 
necessary to enable shareholders to assess the Group’s performance.
The significance of the risk has not changed during the year.
Our response – We undertook detailed analysis of business 
performance at Group and sector level that sought to identify items 
that affect profit (and the trend in profit) which are uneven in 
frequency or amount at a much lower level than we would otherwise 
have done and to assess the transparency of disclosure of these items. 
We focused on the enhanced financial disclosures included in note 2 
to the financial statements and the Business and Financial reviews.
Our findings – We identified a number of significant items that 
had affected profit for the year or the prior year that required 
appropriate disclosure in the Annual Report to enable shareholders 
to assess the Group’s performance. The key items are:
1)   the £1,315m unrealised fair value losses (2014: £1,156m) 
on derivative contracts; 
2)  the £189m profit (2014: nil) arising from refinement in the 
basis of measurement of the risk contingency for forecasts 
of future revenue to be earned under long-term contracts; 
3)  the £140m profit (2014: £60m profit) arising from the impact 
of improvements in lifecycle costs on long-term contracts; 
4)  the £107m loss (2014: £90m profit) arising from other estimate 
changes on long-term contracts; 
5)  the £65m profit (2014: £19m charge) (and capitalisation of 
£22m that otherwise would have been impaired) arising from 
the reversal of the impairment on certain Trent 1000 launch 
engine CARs and the related provision; 
6 )  t h e £ 8 1 8 m (2014: £793m) of research and development charges; 
7)  the £88m, net of a release of prior year provisions of £30m, 
(2014: £188m) of restructuring charges; 
8 )  t h e £ 7 1 m (2014: £54m) profit arising from sales of spare 
engines to joint ventures; 
9 )  t h e £ 7 5 m (2014: £1m) impairments of goodwill; 
10)  the £142m profit for the year from discontinued operations 
in 2014; and 
11)  the £64m tax charge arising from derecognition of advance 
corporation tax in 2014.
We found that the Group had improved the disclosure of its results 
and the transparency of its commentary on profit trends and that 
ample disclosure of these items had been provided in the Annual 
Report and financial statements taken as a whole (2014 audit 
finding: proportionate).
In reaching our audit opinion on the financial statements we took 
into account the findings that we describe above and those for other, 
lower risk areas including those included in the output from our 
Dynamic Audit planning tool set out above. Overall the findings from 
across the whole audit are that the financial statements have been 
prepared on the basis of appropriate accounting policies, reflect 
balanced estimates compared to the mildly cautious estimates made 
last year resulting in slightly favourable current year profit 
recognition, and provide proportionate disclosure. Having assessed 
these findings and evaluated uncorrected misstatements in the 
context of materiality and considered the qualitative aspects of the 
financial statements as a whole, we have not modified our opinion 
on the financial statements.    Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 173

3 OUR APPLICATION OF MATERIALITY AND AN OVERVIEW 
OF THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT
Our measure of materiality for the Group financial statements as 
a whole has reduced in line with the reduction in the Group’s profit. 
This was set at £66m (2014: £70m) and was, as last year, determined 
with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation, 
normalised to exclude the volatility in reported profit due to gains 
and losses on revaluation of foreign currency and other derivative 
financial instruments which could otherwise result in an 
inappropriate materiality level being determined. This materiality 
measure represents 4.5% (2014: 4.6%) of this benchmark and 41.3% 
(2014: 34.3%) of total reported profit before tax. We carry out audit 
procedures to assess the accuracy of the gains and losses on these 
derivative financial instruments (which this year amounted to a 
£1.3bn (2014: £1.1bn) loss) as part of our audit of the Group’s 
treasury operations.
We report to the Audit Committee: (i) all material corrected identified 
misstatements; (ii) uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding 
£3m (2014: £4m) for income statement items; and (iii) other identified 
misstatements that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We subjected 31 (2014: 33) of the Group’s reporting components 
to audits for group reporting purposes and 11 (2014: 14) to specified 
risk-focused audit procedures. The latter were not individually 
financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting 
purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be 
addressed. This work also provided further audit coverage. For the 
remaining components, the Group audit team performed analysis 
at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement within these 
components. The reduction in reporting components subject to audit 
primarily resulted from the disposal of the Energy business in late 2014.
The Group operates shared service centres for the bulk processing 
of financial transactions in Derby (UK) and Indianapolis (US), the 
outputs of which are included in the financial information of the 
reporting components they service and therefore they are not 
separate reporting components. Each of the service centres is 
subject to specified risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly 
the testing of transaction processing and review controls. 
Additional audit procedures are performed at certain reporting 
components to address the audit risks not covered by the work 
performed over the shared service centres.

The Group audit team instructed component auditors, and the 
auditors of the shared service centres, as to the significant areas 
to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above, and the 
information to be reported back. The Group audit team approved 
the component materialities, which ranged from £0.2m to £52m 
(2014: £0.3m to £60m), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile 
of the Group across the components. The work on 21 of the 42 
(2014: 29 of 47) components was performed by component auditors 
and the rest by the Group audit team. The Group audit team visited 
31 (2014: 25) component locations in the UK, the US, Germany, China 
and Scandinavia, the purpose of which included an assessment of the 
audit risk and strategy. Telephone conference meetings were also 
held with these component auditors and with those of the higher risk 
components that were not physically visited. At these visits and 
meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group 
audit team was then performed by the component auditor. 174 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

4 OUR OPINION ON OTHER MATTERS PRESCRIBED 
BY THE COMPANIES ACT 2006 IS UNMODIFIED
In our opinion:
•  the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•  the information given in the strategic report and directors’ report 
for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of 
the audit of the financial statements and from reading the strategic 
report and the directors’ report:
•  we have not identified material misstatements in those reports; and 
•  in our opinion, those reports have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.
5 WE HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT ON THE DISCLOSURES 
OF PRINCIPAL RISKS 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
•  the directors’ viability statement on page 57 , concerning the 
principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the Directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing

SUSTAINABILITY ASSURANCE
Bureau Veritas Independent Assurance Statement
INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE STATEMENT
Bureau Veritas Certification UK Ltd (Bureau Veritas) has been engaged 
by Rolls-Royce Holdings plc to provide limited external assurance 
of selected sustainability performance indicators for the year ended 
31 December 2015, for inclusion in its Annual Report and Accounts 
2015. The aim of this activity is to provide assurance over the accuracy 
and reliability of the reported information.
SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY 
The reporting boundary for Rolls-Royce Holdings plc sustainability 
performance indicators covers all of its global business operations. 
The reporting period is from the 1 January 2015 to the 31 December 
2015. The scope of the assurance work includes quantitative 
performance data only. 
The following sustainability performance indicators were verified:
•  E n er g y u s e ;
•  Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;
•  Safety – total reportable injuries (TRI).
We did not verify any other information that may be presented 
in Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015.
A limited level of assurance was undertaken taking into account 
the requirements of the International Standard on Assurance 
Engagements 3000 – Assurance Engagements other than Audits 
or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000) and, 
concerning GHG emissions, the requirements of the International 
Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 – Assurance 
Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410), 
incorporated to Bureau Veritas internal protocol for the assurance 
of sustainability reports. The assurance process included interviews 
with content owners, documentary reviews, checking of the 
calculation of datasets and the application of appropriate conversion 
factors, and the sampling of data for a number of Rolls-Royce 
Holdings plc’s operations.
The integrity and accuracy of site data was tested by sampling 
data back to source in cases but mostly through the checking 
of aggregated data managed centrally.
LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS
This statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, 
omissions or misstatements. 
The following exclusion applies: 
•  Emissions of HFCs were not accounted for in the determination of 
the organisation’s overall GHG emissions, therefore, the verification 
of those emissions was excluded from this assurance exercise.
OPINION
Based on the assurance work we carried out and the evidence we 
were presented with, as per the scope of work above, nothing came 
to our attention to suggest that factual information, performance 
metrics and data contained within the Annual Report 2015, as far as 
the verified sustainability performance indicators are concerned, 
are not: 
•  demonstrative of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc’s understanding of the 
material issues that are important to its key stakeholder groups; 
•  a fair summary of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc’s sustainability-related 
activities and performance; and
•  free from significant error or omission.

The Group’s approach to managing its tax affairs 
The Board is involved in setting the Group’s tax policies which 
govern the way its tax affairs are managed. In summary, this means:
i)  the Group manages its tax costs through maximising the tax 
efficiency of business transactions. This includes taking 
advantage of available tax incentives and exemptions;
ii)  this must be done in a way which is aligned with the Group’s 
commercial objectives and meets its legal obligations and 
ethical standards;
iii)  the Group also has regard for the intention of the legislation 
concerned rather than just the wording itself;
iv)  the Group is committed to building constructive working 
relationships with tax authorities based on a policy of full 
disclosure in order to remove uncertainty in its business 
transactions and to allow the authorities to review possible risks;
v)  where appropriate and possible, the Group enters into 
consultation with tax authorities to help shape proposed 
legislation and future tax policy; and
vi)  the Group seeks to price transactions between Rolls-Royce group 
companies as if they were between unrelated parties, in compliance 
with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws of the 
relevant jurisdictions.
The Group’s global corporate income tax contribution
Around 95% of the Group’s underlying profit before tax (excluding 
joint ventures and associates) is generated in the UK, the US, 
Germany, Norway, Finland and Singapore. The remaining profits are 
generated across more than 40 other countries. This reflects the 
fact that the majority of the Group’s business is undertaken, and 
employees are based, in the above countries. 
In common with most multinational groups the total of all profits 
in respect of which corporate income tax is paid is not the same as 
the consolidated profit before tax reported on page 107. The main 
reasons for this are:
i)  the consolidated income statement is prepared under adopted 
IFRS whereas tax is paid on the profits of each Group company, 
which are determined by local accounting rules; 
ii)  accounting rules require certain income and costs relating 
to our commercial activities to be eliminated from, or added to, 
the aggregate of all the profits of the Group companies when 
preparing the consolidated income statement (‘consolidation 
adjustments’); and
iii)  specific tax rules including exemptions or incentives 
as determined by the tax laws in each country. 
The Group’s total corporation tax payments in 2015 were £160m. 
The level of tax paid in each country is impacted by the above. 
In most cases, (i) and (ii) are only a matter of timing and therefore 
tax will be paid in an earlier or later year. As a result they only have 
a negligible impact on the Group’s underlying tax rate, which 
excluding joint ventures and associates would be 26.6% 
(the underlying tax rate including joint ventures and associates can 
be found on page 45). This is due to deferred tax accounting, details 
of which can be found in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements. The impact of (iii) will often be permanent depending 
on the relevant tax law.
Further information on the tax position of the Group can be found 
as follows:
• Audit Committee report (page 93) – The Director of T ax gave a 
presentation to the Audit Committee during the year which covered 
various matters including tax risks and how they are managed; 
• Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 116 and 
118) – Details of key areas of uncertainty and accounting policies 
for tax;
• Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 128 to 130) 
– Details of the tax balances in the Consolidated Financial 
Statements together with a tax reconciliation on continuing 
operations. This explains the main drivers of the tax rate.
At this stage we expect these items to continue to influence the 
underlying tax rate. The reported tax rate is more difficult to forecast 
due to the volatility of significant items in reported profits, in particular 
the net unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts.
Investments and capital expenditure
The Group subjects all major investments and capital expenditure 
to a rigorous examination of risks and future cash flows to ensure 
that they create shareholder value. All major investments, including 
the launch of major programmes, require Board approval.
The Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages of their 
life cycles. Discounted cash flow analysis of the remaining life 
of projects is performed on a regular basis.
Sales of engines in production are assessed against criteria in 
the original development programme to ensure that overall value 
is enhanced. Other information

Financial risk management
The Board has established a structured approach to financial risk 
management. The Financial risk committee (Frc) is accountable for 
managing, reporting and mitigating the Group’s financial risks and 
exposures. These risks include the Group’s principal counterparty, 
currency, interest rate, commodity price, liquidity and credit rating 
risks outlined in more depth in note 17. The Frc is chaired by the 
Chief Financial Officer. The Group has a comprehensive financial 
risk policy that advocates the use of financial instruments to 
manage and hedge business operations risks that arise from 
movements in financial, commodities, credit or money markets. 
The Group’s policy is not to engage in speculative financial 
transactions. The Frc sits quarterly to review and assess the key 
risks and agree any mitigating actions required.
Capital structure

Total equity 5,016 6,387
Cash flow hedges 100 81
Group capital 5,116 6,468
Net funds (111) 666
Operations are funded through various shareholders’ funds, bank 
borrowings, bonds and notes. The capital structure of the Group 
reflects the judgement of the Board as to the appropriate balance 
of funding required.
Funding is secured by the Group’s continued access to the global 
debt markets. Borrowings are funded in various currencies using 
derivatives where appropriate to achieve a required currency and 
interest rate profile. The Board’s objective is to retain sufficient 
financial investments and undrawn facilities to ensure that the 
Group can both meet its medium-term operational commitments 
and cope with unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments which, together 
with the undrawn committed facilities, enable it to manage its 
liquidity risk.
On 6 October 2015 the Group issued US$500m 2.375% Notes due 
2020 and US$1,000m 3.625% Notes due 2025.
During the year the Group renegotiated the £1,000m committed 
bank borrowing facility, increasing the amount to £1,500m and 
extending the maturity to 2020. This facility was undrawn at the 
period end. A €300m committed borrowing facility was cancelled 
during the period.
At the year end, the Group retained aggregate liquidity of £5.0bn, 
including cash and cash equivalents of £3.2bn and undrawn borrowing 
facilities of £1.8bn. £419m of the facilities mature in 2016.
The maturity profile of the borrowing facilities is regularly reviewed 
to ensure that refinancing levels are manageable in the context of 
the business and market conditions. There are no rating triggers 
in any borrowing facility that would require the facility to be 
accelerated or repaid due to an adverse movement in the Group’s 
credit rating.
The Group conducts some of its business through a number of joint 
ventures. A major proportion of the debt of these joint ventures is 
secured on the assets of the respective companies and is 
non-recourse to the Group. This debt is further outlined in note 11.
Credit rating
Rating Outlook Grade
Moody’s Investors Service A3 Stable Investment
Standard & Poor’s A Negative Investment
The Group subscribes to both Moody’s Investors Service and 
Standard & Poor’s for independent long-term credit ratings. At the 
date of this report, the Group maintained investment grade ratings 
from both agencies.
As a capital-intensive business making long-term commitments 
to our customers, the Group attaches significant importance 
to maintaining or improving the current investment grade 
credit ratings.
Accounting
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
as adopted by the EU.
No new accounting standards had a material impact in 2015. 
The impact of changes to IFRS which have not been adopted in 2015 
is included within the accounting policies in note 1.
Share price
During the year, the share price decreased by 34% from 870p to 575p, 
compared to a 12% decrease in the FTSE aerospace and defence sector 
and 5% decrease in the FTSE 100. The Company’s share price ranged 
from 1054p in April 2015 to 514p in November 2015. 178 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION
Share capital 
On 31 December 2015, 1,838,677,392 ordinary shares of 20p each, 
28,959,754,116 C Shares of 0.1p each and one Special Share of £1 
were in issue. The ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange.
Payment to shareholders
The Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares 
(C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
Shareholders can choose to:
•  redeem all C Shares for cash;
•  redeem all C Shares for cash and reinvest the proceeds in the 
C Share Reinvestment Plan (CRIP); or
•  keep the C Shares.
The CRIP is operated by Computershare Investor Services PLC 
(the Registrar). The Registrar will purchase ordinary shares in the 
market for shareholders electing to reinvest their C Share proceeds. 
Shareholders wishing to participate in the CRIP or redeem their 
C Shares must ensure that their instructions are lodged with the 
Registrar no later than 5pm BST on 1 June 2016 (CREST holders must 
submit their election in CREST before 3pm BST on 1 June 2016). 
Redemption will take place on 4 July 2016.
At the AGM, the Directors will recommend an issue of 71 C Shares 
with a total nominal value of 7 .1p for each ordinary share. 
The C Shares will be issued on 1 July 2016 to shareholders on the 
register on 29 April 2016 and the final day of trading with 
entitlement to C Shares is 27 April 2016. Together with the interim 
issue on 4 January 2016 of 92.7 C Shares for each ordinary share with 
a total nominal value of 9.27p, this is the equivalent of a total annual 
payment to ordinary shareholders of 16.37p for each ordinary share.
Further information for shareholders is on pages 182 and 183.
Share class rights
The full share class rights are set out in the Company’s Articles 
of Association (Articles), which are available on the Group’s website 
at rolls-royce.com, and are summarised below.
Ordinary shares
Each member has one vote for each ordinary share held. Holders 
of ordinary shares are entitled to: receive the Company’s Annual 
Report; attend and speak at general meetings of the Company;  
appoint one or more proxies or, if they are corporations, corporate 
representatives; and exercise voting rights. Holders of ordinary 
shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares or a dividend and on 
liquidation may share in the assets of the Company. 
C Shares
C Shares have limited voting rights and attract a dividend of 75% 
of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-
yearly basis. The Company has the option to redeem the C Shares 
compulsorily, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares 
in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of all C Shares 
issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of 
the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of C Shares shall 
be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary 
shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited 
as paid-up on the C Shares held by them, together with a sum equal 
to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have been 
accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.
The holders of C Shares are only entitled to attend, speak and vote 
at a general meeting if a resolution to wind up the Company is to  
be considered, in which case they may vote only on such resolution.
Special Share
Certain rights attach to the special rights non-voting share 
(Special Share) issued to HM Government (Special Shareholder). 
These rights are set out in the Articles. Subject to the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006, the Treasury Solicitor may redeem the 
Special Share at par at any time. The Special Share confers no rights 
to dividends but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at 
its nominal value in priority to any other shares.
Certain Articles (in particular those relating to the foreign 
shareholding limit, disposals and the nationality of the Company’s 
Directors) that relate to the rights attached to the Special Share may 
only be altered with the consent of the Special Shareholder. The 
Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general meeting 
or any other meeting of any class of shareholders.
Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations 
on holdings
There are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding 
of the ordinary shares or C Shares other than under the Articles 
(as described here), under restrictions imposed by law or regulation 
(for example, insider trading laws) or pursuant to the Company’s 
share dealing code. The Articles provide that the Company should 
be and remain under UK control. As such, an individual foreign 
shareholding limit is set at 15% of the aggregate votes attaching 
to the share capital of all classes (taken as a whole) and capable 
of being cast on a poll and to all other shares that the directors 
determine are to be included in the calculation of such holding. 
The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred 
to the Special Shareholder or his successor or nominee. Other information
   Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015 179
Other information
Shareholder agreements and consent requirements
There are no known arrangements under which financial rights 
carried by any of the shares in the Company are held by a person other 
than the holder of the shares and no known agreements between the 
holders of shares with restrictions on the transfer of shares or exercise 
of voting rights. No disposal may be made to a non-Group member 
which, alone or when aggregated with the same or a connected 
transaction, constitutes a disposal of the whole or a material part 
of either the Nuclear business or the assets of the Group as a whole, 
without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
Authority to issue shares
At the AGM in 2015, authority was given to the Directors to allot 
new ordinary shares up to a nominal value of £124,333,948 
equivalent to one-third of the issued share capital of the Company.
In addition, a special resolution was passed to effect a 
disapplication of pre-emption rights for a maximum of 5% of the 
issued share capital of the Company. These authorities are valid 
until the AGM in 2016, and the directors propose to renew these 
authorities at that AGM. It is proposed to seek a further authority, 
at the AGM in 2016 to allot up to two thirds of the total issued share 
capital, but only in the case of a rights issue.
The Board believes that this additional authority will allow the 
Company to retain the maximum possible flexibility to respond 
to circumstances and opportunities as they arise; and to allot new 
C Shares up to a nominal value of £500 million as an alternative 
to a cash dividend. Such authority expires at the conclusion of the 
AGM in 2016. The directors propose to renew the authority to allot 
new C Shares at the AGM in 2016.
Authority to purchase own shares
At the AGM in 2015, the Company was authorised by shareholders to 
purchase up to 186,500,921 of its own ordinary shares representing 
10% of its issued ordinary share capital.
On 6 July 2015 the Company issued revised guidance for 2015 and 
announced that it would be cancelling its share buyback 
programme, having completed £500m of the planned £1bn 
programme during the first half of the year.
The authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires 
at the conclusion of the AGM in 2016 or 18 months from 8 May 2015 
whichever is the earlier. A resolution to renew it will be proposed at 
the 2016 meeting.
Voting rights
DEADLINES FOR EXERCISING VOTING RIGHTS
Electronic and paper proxy appointments, and voting instructions, 
must be received by the Company’s Registrar not less than 48 hours 
before a general meeting.
Voting rights for employee share plan shares
Shares are held in various employee benefit trusts for the purpose 
of satisfying awards made under the various employee share plans. 
For shares held in a nominee capacity or if plan/trust rules provide 
the participant with the right to vote in respect of specifically 
allocated shares, the trustee votes in line with the participants’ 
instructions. For shares that are not held absolutely on behalf of 
specific individuals, the general policy of the trustees, in accordance 
with investor protection guidelines, is to abstain from voting in 
respect of those shares.
Change of control 
CONTRACTS AND JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENTS
There are a number of contracts and joint venture agreements 
which would allow the counterparties to terminate or alter those 
arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. 
These arrangements are commercially confidential and their 
disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company. 
BORROWINGS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various 
banks. These facilities generally include provisions which may 
require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or the alteration 
or termination of the facility upon the occurrence of a change  
of control of the Company. At 31 December 2015 these facilities 
were less than 22% drawn (2014: 24%).
The Group has entered into a series of financial instruments  
to hedge its currency, interest rate and commodity exposures.  
These contracts provide for termination or alteration in the event 
that a change of control of the Company materially weakens the 
creditworthiness of the Group.
EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the effect  
on the employee share plans would be as follows:
•  PSP – awards would vest pro rata to service in the performance 
period, subject to Remuneration Committee judgement of  
Group performance;
•  APRA deferred shares – the shares would be released from  
trust immediately;
•  ShareSave – options would become exercisable immediately.  
The new company might offer an equivalent option in exchange 
for cancellation of the existing option; and
•  Share Incentive Plan (SIP) – consideration received as shares 
would be held within the SIP , if possible, otherwise the 
consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SIP . 180 Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual Report 2015

Companies Act 2006 to include disclosures in the Strategic Report:

• employee involvement 49
• the future development, performance and position of the Group 2 to 57
• the financial position of the Group 42 to 47
• R&D activities 18
• the principal risks and uncertainties 54 to 57
Political donations
The Group’s policy is not to make political donations and therefore 
did not donate any money to any political party during the year.
However, it is possible that certain activities undertaken by 
the Group may unintentionally fall within the broad scope 
of the provisions contained in the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). 
The resolution to be proposed at the AGM is to ensure that the 
Group does not commit any technical breach of the Act.
During the year, expenses incurred by Rolls-Royce North America 
Inc. in providing administrative support for the Rolls-Royce 
North America Political Action Committee (RRNAPAC) was 
US$45,021 (2014: US$52,690). PACs are a common feature of the 
US political system and are governed by the Federal Election 
Campaign Act.
The PAC is independent of the Group and independent of any 
political party. The PAC funds are contributed voluntarily by 
employees and the Company cannot affect how they are applied, 
although under US Law, the business expenses are paid by the 
Company. Such contributions do not require authorisation by 
shareholders under the Companies Act 2006 and therefore do not 
count towards the limits for political donations and expenditure 
for which shareholder approval will be sought at this year’s AGM 
to renew the authority given at the 2015 AGM. Other information

Your share certificate
Your share certificate is an important document. If you sell or 
transfer your shares you must make sure that you have a valid share 
certificate in the name of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. If you place an 
instruction to sell your shares and cannot provide a valid share 
certificate, the transaction cannot be completed and you may be 
liable for any costs incurred by the broker. Share certificates issued 
in the name of Rolls-Royce plc or Rolls-Royce Group plc are invalid 
and should be destroyed. If you are unable to find your share 
certificate please inform the Registrar immediately.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 
Managing your shareholding
Your shareholding is managed by Computershare Investor Services PLC 
(the Registrar). When making contact with the Registrar please 
quote your Shareholder Reference Number (SRN), an 11-digit number 
beginning with the letter ‘C’ that can be found on the right-hand 
side of your share certificate or in any other shareholder 
correspondence. It is very important that you keep your shareholding 
account details up to date by notifying the Registrar of any changes 
in your circumstances.
You can manage your shareholding at www.investorcentre.co.uk, 
speak to the Registrar on +44 (0)370 703 0162 (8.30am to 5.30pm 
Monday to Friday) or you can write to them at Computershare Investor 
Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol BS13 8AE.
Payments to shareholders
The Company makes payments to shareholders by issuing 
redeemable C Shares of 0.1p each. You can still receive cash 
or additional ordinary shares from the Company providing you 
complete a payment instruction form, which is available from the 
Registrar. Once you have submitted your payment instruction form, 
you will receive cash or additional ordinary shares each time the 
Company issues C Shares. If you choose to receive cash we strongly 
recommend that you include your bank details on the payment

WARNING TO SHAREHOLDERS – INVESTMENT SCAMS
We are aware that some of our shareholders have received unsolicited 
telephone calls or correspondence, offering to buy or sell their shares 
at very favourable terms. The callers can be very persuasive and 
extremely persistent and often have professional websites and 
telephone numbers to support their activities. These callers will 
sometimes imply a connection to Rolls-Royce and provide incorrect 
or misleading information. This type of call should be treated as an 
investment scam – the safest thing to do is hang up. 
You should always check that any firm contacting you about potential 
investment opportunities is properly authorised by the FCA. If you deal 
with an unauthorised firm you won’t be eligible for compensation 
under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. You can find out 
more about protecting yourself from investment scams by visiting the 
FCA’s website fca.org.uk/consumers, or by calling the FCA’s consumer 
helpline on 0800 111 6768 (overseas callers dial +44 20 7066 1000). 
If you have already paid money to share fraudsters contact Action 
Fraud immediately on 0300 123 2040, whose website is at 
actionfraud.police.uk
Remember: if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.

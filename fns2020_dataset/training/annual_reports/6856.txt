INVESTMENT CASE
 – A proven growth strategy 
 – A high quality, well positioned estate
 – Increasing exposure to the eating out market
 – A resilient brand portfolio
 – A strong balance sheet and attractive, 
growing dividends
Our overall vision is to build the best 
pubs and beer business in the UK.
Within this, our objectives are to deliver 
outstanding value, exceptional service and 
unbeatable quality across our businesses, 
supported by investment in innovation 
and in our people.
We have:
HIGH QUALITY, WELL POSITIONED ESTATE
We run around 1,900 managed and tenanted pubs. 
59% of our estate is situated in the south-east, 
which has proved beneficial throughout the 
economic recovery. 
We own the freehold title on c.94% of our estate. This gives 
us freedom to renovate our pubs and removes the ongoing 
requirement to use a proportion of the cash that we generate 
to pay rent. We believe that these benefits, among others, 
outweigh the initial capital outlay associated with 
purchasing the freehold title of a pub.
Our strategy of expanding our Retail business, 
reducing the size of our tenanted estate and 
delivering market outperformance in our 
Brewing & Brands business has produced 
adjusted EPS growth of 42% between 
2010 and 2014, representing a compound 
annual growth rate of 9.1%.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Results
We have delivered a strong financial result 
for the year, achieving record sales and profit. 
In a 53 week year, our revenue was up 8.9% 
to £1,301.6m and our operating profit before 
exceptional items was up 7.0% to £265.6m. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items was 
up 9.4% to £173.1m, while adjusted earnings 
per share were up 10.4% to 61.4p. 
Dividend
As a result of another year of strong growth, 
the board has recommended a final dividend 
of 20.8p per share, up 6.9% on last year. 
This takes the total dividend for the year to 
28.4p per share, up 6.8%. The final dividend 
is expected to be paid on 15 September 2014 
to those shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 15 August 2014.
Acquisitions
We continued to expand, and improve the 
overall quality of, our Retail business. We 
added 48 sites to our Retail estate through 
a combination of acquisitions and transfers 
from Pub Partners. The total cost of acquiring 
sites during the year was £24.3m. At the 
year end, we had a Retail estate of 1,032 sites, 
up from 888 sites when we started our 
Retail expansion strategy in 2009.
Disposals
We made further, significant progress on 
our non-core disposal plan in the year, selling, 
or transferring to Retail, 148 sites, taking 
the Pub Partners estate down to 1,165 sites, 
below what had been our strategic target of 
1,200 sites. The total proceeds raised from 
disposals in the year were £38.4m, in line 
with book value. Since the year end, we 
have sold 275 non-core Pub Partners’ pubs 
to Hawthorn Leisure, backed by May Capital, 
for £75.6m. 
Board
In March, Matthew Fearn, our group 
finance director, began a period of extended 
absence due to serious illness. He has been 
undergoing treatment and we are hopeful 
that he can make a full recovery. While 
Matthew is away, we have appointed David 
Brown, our corporate finance director, to 
fulfil the role of interim group finance director. 
In this role, David is attending all our board 
meetings, but is not a main board director.
At the end of July, we will be saying goodbye 
from our board to John Brady. He will have 
served for nine years, during which time he 
has been a member of all three of the board 
committees. I would like to thank John for 
the contribution he has made through his 
independent views and valuable insight 
and we wish him well in the future.
People
We now have 23,000 people working for 
Greene King and every one of them has 
contributed to our success this year. The 
dedication that they show on a daily basis, 
particularly when interacting directly 
with our customers, is a key driver of our 
long-term record of growth. 
I would like to express my thanks to all of 
them for the work they have done during 
the year in helping us to deliver these strong 
results. Going forward, they will remain 
crucial to further success as we remain 
focused on delivering sustainable value 
creation for our shareholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
ANOTHER  
SUCCESSFUL YEAR
Performance summary
It has been another successful year for 
Greene King with record sales and profits. 
In a 53 week year, we achieved profit growth 
of 11.9% in our key Retail business, further 
profit per pub growth in Pub Partners and 
a return to growth, on the back of market 
outperformance, at Brewing & Brands. We 
also made good strategic progress across the 
business, culminating in the announcement, 
at the end of the year, of the disposal of 275 
non-core sites from Pub Partners. 
Strong group revenue growth of 6.9%* was 
driven by a combination of Retail like-for-like 
(LFL) sales growth of 4.1%, supplemented 
by the positive impact of acquisitions and 
transfers during the year, and a contribution 
from the strong volume growth in Brewing 
& Brands. Staying close to our customers 
and meeting their needs through industry-
leading value, service and quality are key to 
our continued LFL sales growth and in the 
year this approach drove LFL sales growth 
across all three of our markets – eating out, 
drinking out and staying out. Most months 
of the year also delivered strong LFL sales 
growth, although customers spent less in 
September after their summer spending, while 
February was held back by record rainfall. 
Our revenue growth converted into operating 
profit growth of 5.0% at a slightly lower margin 
due to the impact of the changing channel mix 
as Retail grows its share of revenue, now at 
74%, up from 72% last year, while Pub Partners 
becomes a smaller part of the business. 
Encouragingly, despite the continued pressure 
on margins from input costs, we managed 
to expand the Retail margin by ten basis 
points (bps). 
Our strong operational performance led to 
profit before tax and exceptionals (PBTE) 
growth of 7.4%, adjusted earnings per share 
growth of 8.3%, free cash flow generation, 
after capital expenditure and dividends, 
of £67.9m and a 30bps increase in our 
return on capital employed (ROCE) to 
9.2%, comfortably above our cost of capital. 
These strong financial metrics gave the 
board the confidence to announce a dividend 
per share increase of 6.8%, maintaining our 
long-term track record of dividend growth. 
Looking forward, while the impact of 
selling a significant number of non-core 
pubs will slow growth in the new financial 
year, a combination of an improving external 
environment, maintained sales momentum in 
Retail and the continuation of our successful 
Retail expansion programme should deliver 
strong and sustainable earnings and dividend 
growth for our shareholders.
*  Unless otherwise stated, all numbers in this 
review are based on a 52 week year.
Strategic progress
We have now completed four years of our 
current five-year strategic plan to improve 
growth and returns to our shareholders. 
During the year we made further 
significant progress:
1.  Expanding Retail to 1,100 sites and 
improving estate quality. We acquired 
or transferred in 48 sites to take the 
estate to 1,032 pubs, restaurants and 
hotels. The average weekly take (AWT) 
of the acquired or transferred sites was 
£30k, 68% above the existing estate 
average. Of these additional sites, 21 were 
“
We achieved record sales and profits during 
the year and also made good strategic 
progress across the business.”

Hungry Horse sites, six were Old English 
Inns (OEI) and five were Metropolitan 
sites. We remain on track to reach 1,100 
sites by the end of the five-year plan. 
2.  Reducing the Pub Partners estate, 
improving estate quality and 
maintaining our offer influence. 
Against an initial target of 1,200 sites, 
we reached an estate of 1,165 by the year 
end following the disposal of 133 non-core 
sites and the transfer of 15 sites to Retail. 
This helped to drive average EBITDA* 
per pub up 5.3%. Just after the year end, 
we completed the sale of a further 275 
non-core sites.
3.  Maintaining industry-leading brand 
investment to strengthen our leadership 
position. We again invested in our 
core ale brands to drive own-brewed 
volume (OBV) growth and UK ale market 
outperformance in Brewing & Brands. 
We increased our volume share of the UK 
ale market by 70bps to 11.3%**. We also 
invested £750k in the St Edmund Brewhouse 
to supplement our core brands with a 
range of innovative ale brands to further 
meet the growing consumer demand for 
choice, provenance and quality.

Strategy update
As we near the end of our current five-year 
plan and given the pace of change in consumer 
behaviour, we are evolving a new five-year 
plan to take us to 2020, building on the 
progress we have made so far. 
We have taken steps already to get even 
closer to our customers and to understand 
their behaviour. For example, we increased 
investment in our digital platform and we 
launched the Greene King Leisure Spend 
Tracker during the year, reporting monthly 
GB household spending on eating out, 
drinking out and other leisure activities. 
Customer behaviour is increasingly 
dynamic, presenting constant challenges to 
the industry. Consumers are going out less 
but when they do they are demanding more 
choice and more control over what they eat 
and drink. Increasingly, they also like to 
treat themselves to more premium products. 
We responded to these trends by broadening 
our offering in key drinks categories such 
as premium lager, craft ale, wine and cider, 
and by offering increased customisation 
on our menus. 
Customers are also demanding higher 
quality, more healthy options and better 
consistency in what they eat and drink. We 
carried out two benchmarking exercises on 
key menu items to ensure we stay ahead of 
our competitors. As a result, we redesigned 
our burger offer, upgraded the quality of our 
steaks and added a number of healthier dishes 
to our menus. Importantly, we continue to 
win awards for the quality of our fish and 
chips, still our customers’ favourite dish. 
People are still looking for value and we 
saw an increase in the share of our sales from 
promotional activity, especially in food. In 
Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill, we increased 
communication of our offers through electronic 
direct mailing to our extensive customer 
database, while across Retail we broadened 
the number of sites with known value item 
pricing on lager.
In addition to addressing current trends, 
we have been working closely with the 
Trajectory Partnership, a leading consumer 
insight and futures consultancy, to analyse 
and identify forthcoming consumer trends 
in order to get a clearer understanding of 
how eating out and drinking out might 
change between now and 2025. 
The main trends we have identified include: 
1. ‘ Vertical families’ – indicates the 
rising importance of inter-generational 
leisure occasions. 
2. ‘ Digitalisation of leisure’ – the increase in 
use of and access to technology in leisure.
3. ‘ Value hunters’ – demonstrates that cost 
of living is likely to remain a central 
consumer issue.
4. ‘ Deregulation of life’ – where different 
activities are less associated with specific 
times of day. 
The implications of these trends for our 
business are significant and include the 
need to:
 – develop sites and offers that cater for 
different generations at the same occasions;
 – continue investing in our digital platform 
and our colleague training programmes 
to meet the challenges of a more demanding 
consumer, providing instant feedback 
to other customers;
 – maintain focus on delivering great value 
for our customers, even as the economy 
improves; and
 – make our sites more convenient for our 
customers by increasing the occasions they 
use our pubs by expanding our daytime 
offer and becoming less reliant on ‘traditional’ 
pub eating and drinking occasions.
Using the analysis of current and future 
consumer trends, we will evolve the current 
strategy to accelerate our Retail expansion 
and to move beyond conventional pub offers. 
Specifically, our future strategy will focus 
on six key elements:
1.  Open a minimum of 30 new Retail sites 
per annum.
2.  Reposition and simplify the existing Retail 
estate to optimise growth and returns.
3.  Further improve value, service 
and quality to our customers.
4.  Investigate options to diversify the Retail 
offer, including potential acquisitions.
5. Reduce Pub Partners to 750 sites.
6.  Maintain investment in Brewing & Brands 
to drive market outperformance.
Current trading and outlook 
After eight weeks of the new financial 
year, LFL sales in Retail were up 1.1%. 
This performance mirrors the trends seen 
in recent industry reports, including the 
latest Greene King Leisure Spend Tracker, 
which showed a softening in GB eating and 
drinking out from April to May. We have 
also seen regional differences in trading 
with LFL sales at Metropolitan, our 
premium London pubs, up 7.4%, and LFL 
sales overall in the south up, while LFL 
sales in the north are down.
We have seen strong starts to the year in 
our other businesses. LFL net income in our 
core Pub Partners estate was up 3.5%, with 
Brewing & Brands OBV, helped by strong 
Take Home sales due to the World Cup, 
up 6.2%.
Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we 
anticipate an improvement in LFL Retail 
sales and continued momentum in both Pub 
Partners and Brewing & Brands. We also 
expect to add 50 to 60 new Retail sites in 
the year. As a result, we are confident of 
achieving another year of strong progress.

KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS
RETAIL
Our retail business is split into two 
divisions. We have 512 Destination 
Pubs and Restaurants sites, spread 
across a number of brands, including 
Hungry Horse and Loch Fyne Seafood 
and Grill, as well as the Metropolitan 
Pub Company, which primarily operates 
our premium London pubs. We also 
have 520 Local Pubs comprising mainly 
branded and unbranded pubs in local 
communities, with operating concepts 
such as Flame Grill and Meet & Eat.
 – Our retail sales are determined by 
the number of customers we attract 
and the amount that they spend with us. 
Therefore, the success of Retail is driven 
by our customers’ desire to eat and drink 
outside of their homes.
 – Our principal revenue streams are food 
and drink available for consumption on 
our premises. We gain further revenue 
from our range of hotels, which offer 
overnight accommodation. A number 
of our sites also have gaming machines.
 – We aim to attract customers to our pub, 
restaurant and hotel sites through the 
consistent provision of outstanding value, 
exceptional service and unbeatable quality. 
Our people are crucial in driving footfall 
to our sites, which is further supported 
by ongoing investment in expanding and 
maintaining our estate, investment in 
digital and overall innovation to ensure 
that we remain relevant to the customer 
in an environment of increasing 
consumer choice and expectation.
PUB PARTNERS
Our Pub Partners business offers 
entrepreneurs the opportunity to run 
our pubs in England and Scotland.
 – We offer a range of agreements for 
tenanted pubs, leased pubs and 
franchised pubs.
 – Revenue in our Pub Partners business is 
principally achieved through the supply 
of beer and other drinks to our licensees 
and the rent that they pay us to have 
access to the pub and our support. 
We also derive a small portion of 
revenue from gaming machines.
 – The UK leased and tenanted pub industry 
has come under heavy scrutiny from 
industry associations and Government 
bodies in recent years resulting in the 
recent confirmation by The Department 
for Business, Innovation & Skills that they 
plan to set up a statutory code governing 
the relationship between pub companies 
and their tenants.
 – We have continuously adapted our 
business model to improve licensee and 
pub sustainability through increasing our 
support to them and do not believe the 
introduction of a statutory code will make 
a material difference to this business.
 – Core to our Pub Partners business is our 
ability to recruit and retain quality 
licensees, which we do through a focus 
on operating the right pubs, with the 
right people, on the right agreement 
with the right offer.
BREWING & BRANDS
Our Brewing & Brands division 
operates two breweries, one in Bury 
St Edmunds and the other in Dunbar, 
where we brew industry-leading 
brands such as Old Speckled Hen, 
Greene King IPA and Belhaven Best.
 – We generate revenue in this division from 
the sale and distribution of ales produced 
by us in our own breweries, and from 
the sale and distribution of drinks 
(both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) 
produced by third parties.
 – As well as to our internal customers in 
the other divisions, we also sell our ales 
to other pub companies and to individual 
free trade customers. A further important 
revenue stream for Greene King is the sale 
of our own-brewed ales to supermarkets 
and other retail outlets. An increasingly 
important channel for Greene King is the 
export market, where we sell to a wide 
range of countries both within Europe 
and further afield.
 – Although the total UK ale market is in 
decline, there are still channels of growth 
within the sector and we have successfully 
adapted our business model in Brewing 
& Brands to pursue these channels.
 – Our focus in Brewing & Brands is the 
operation of a highly efficient brewing 
model that facilitates industry-leading 
investment and delivers consistently 
high service and quality levels. This 
focus has driven the continuing market 
outperformance of many of our ales. Strategic report
GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 16
OUR MARKETS
In each market, we aim to grow our market share utilising 
our industry-leading brands, our high quality asset base 
and our talented teams.
MARKET OVERVIEW
We compete primarily in the UK 
drinking out, eating out and staying 
out markets. In each market, we aim 
to grow our market share utilising 
our industry-leading brands, our high 
quality asset base and our talented 
teams. Over the last 12 months we 
have met those aims within Greene 
King Retail, our largest and fastest 
growing business. Beer volumes per 
pub in Pub Partners, our tenanted, 
leased and franchised division, have 
also outperformed the UK on-trade 
beer market, while own-brewed 
volumes of our core ale brands 
have outperformed the total UK 
ale market.
Environmental analysis
Political
One of the biggest issues facing the industry 
at the moment is the uncertainty of the current 
political landscape, whether it be the Scottish 
independence referendum in 2014 or the UK 
general election in May 2015. As we invest a 
significant proportion of our cash in our pubs, 
restaurants and hotels, and in our people, we 
prefer more certainty of policy direction and 
decision making. We are looking closely at 
different potential outcomes from these two 
events and will consider them as part of our 
ongoing strategic review. 
Once again, the UK government has been 
inconsistent in its approach to the UK beer 
and pubs industry over the last 12 months. 
There was another welcome cut of 1p per pint 
in beer duty and the removal of the alcohol 
duty escalator for wines, spirits and cider. We 
support the principle of reforming Progressive 
Beer Duty, whereby small brewers currently 
receive a significant subsidy for brewing beer, 
creating a distorted market for beer in the UK. 
We also believe that a V AT cut for food sold 
in pubs and restaurants would help to boost 
investment and jobs in the industry, although 
we recognise this is unlikely in the short 
to medium term.

As regards the tenanted and leased pub industry , 
we believe that self-regulation of the relationship 
between pub companies and licensees is the 
best approach. We have, after all, successfully 
operated tied agreements with licensees for 
over 200 years. The government has, however, 
proposed a bill to introduce a statutory code to 
govern this relationship, notwithstanding the 
unintended consequences this code might 
generate. If a law is brought in to artificially 
rebalance the share of income from a pub asset 
between landlord and tenant, then it is likely 
that less investment will be made in that asset 
by the landlord, less support given to the tenant 
and more costs added for the tenant to bear. 
We maintain our support for an alcohol 
minimum unit price (MUP). We believe MUP , 
alongside other measures such as improved 
alcohol education, can be a highly effective 
measure in reducing irresponsible retailing 
and consuming of alcohol, thereby helping 
to reduce the costs to society of rising 
alcohol-related illness and crime.  Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 17
Economic
The macro-economic picture improved 
over the course of the year with GDP 
growth accelerating, unemployment falling 
and inflation reducing. This has led to an 
improvement in consumer confidence. 
However, we did not see that improvement 
convert to significant increases in volume 
and cover sales or spend per head within 
Retail during the year. In the second half of 
the year, we did though see a slight softening 
in monthly ‘payday spikes’ as customers felt 
under less financial pressure towards the end 
of each month. London and the south-east 
remain more buoyant than the rest of the UK. 
We are more likely to see material changes to 
our trading patterns once the UK consumer 
experiences sustainable real income growth, 
which we are hopeful we will see during the 
next 12 months. Even when that occurs though, 
we will need to continue delivering exceptional 
value, service and quality to our customers to 
ensure we win our fair share of any incremental 
discretionary spend against the potential 
pent-up demand for ‘bigger-ticket’ items. 
Social
UK alcohol consumption continues to decline 
for a combination of reasons – some social, 
some health related and some economic. 
With the exception of premium ale, which saw 
5.7% volume growth* in the year to April 2014, 
beer consumption remains in steep decline, 
averaging a 2.7% decline in each of the last 
10 years*.
We continue to see consumers choosing to 
drink alcohol at home – with beer consumption 
in the on-trade declining by 2.1% in the year to 
April 2014*, and growing by 4.4% in the off-trade 
over the same time period*. Continuously 
improving home comforts are partly responsible, 
as is a further widening of the price differential 
between the on- and off-trades. It now costs 
over 2.5 times as much to buy a pint of beer 
in the on-trade as it does in the off-trade*.
Improved affordability and increasing time 
pressures are contributing to a growing spend 
on eating out in the UK. The average growth 
rate per annum for spend on eating out in pubs 
and restaurants is +1.3% between 2011 and 
2014**, helped by average growth per annum 
of 6.6% in branded managed pubs**, reflecting 
the consumer’s growing preference for great 
value casual dining occasions. The Greene 
King Leisure Spend Tracker has highlighted 
the extent to which eating out has become an 
integral part of family socialising and major 
calendar events.
The UK provincial staying out market is 
gaining momentum as the economic recovery 
builds and inbound tourism continues to 
grow – offsetting a small drop in domestic 
‘staycations’. RevPAR (revenue per available 
room) grew by 4.8% in the UK provinces in 
2013*** and is forecast to grow by a further 
3% in 2014***.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
Greene King Retail again performed well, 
delivering strong growth and further strategic 
progress. LFL sales growth of 4.1% compared 
to 2.4%* sector growth, meaning we achieved 
another year of strong outperformance. 
LFL sales growth was well balanced 
through volume growth of 1.9% and price, 
mix, and spend per head improvements of 
2.2%. Growth was achieved across all the 
main sales categories, with food LFL sales 
up 5.0%, drink LFL sales up 3.2% and room 
LFL sales growth up 6.8%. Food generated 
over 41% of total Retail sales. 
* Coffer Peach Business Tracker.
Total revenue was £963.0m, up 9.4%, 
driven by a particularly strong performance 
in Local Pubs, a 3.7% increase in the average 
number of sites trading and more favourable 
weather in the second half compared to last 
year. The AWT was up 5.5% to £18.0k as the 
overall quality of our estate continues to 
improve. Retail delivered operating profit of 
£187 .7m, up 9.8%, with the 10bps improvement 
in the operating margin in the first half 
sustained through the year, reflecting positive 
drink and food price/mix effects, supported 
by tight cost control, but tempered by ongoing 
inflationary pressures including in rent 
and rates.
There are a number of key factors driving 
the continued success of Greene King Retail. 
Fundamental to our operational approach is 
putting customers at the heart of our business, 
building and sustaining their confidence in 
our brands and rewarding their loyalty. We 
constantly evolve our offer to ensure we stay 
relevant in an environment of increasing 
customer choice and expectation.
1.  Exceeding customer value, 
service and quality expectations
 – Value. We strive to offer value across 
all brands and segments. We rolled 
out a ‘Golden Years’ offer in OEI and 
a ‘Two courses for £3.99’ offer for over 
60s in Meet & Eat. New weekly offers 
were introduced in Hungry Horse, such 
as ‘Little Hooves Tuesday’, where kids 
can eat for a pound with every adult 
meal purchased, and ‘Thank Horse it’s 
Thursday’, where customers can choose 
a free starter or dessert with any 
‘Big Plate Special’. 
 – Service. We aim to provide industry-leading 
service standards. Hungry Horse won a 
national award at the Annual Customer 
Experience Awards and continued to 
implement initiatives, such as the trial of 
an ordering application and the extension 
of a self-serve kiosk trial, to further enhance 
the customer experience. Overall, our net 
promoter score, as measured by guest 
satisfaction, has increased 1.8% to 58.9%. 
In our food supply chain, we increased first 
time product availability by 13bps to 99.7%, 
further improving the reliability of product 
supply to our sites, giving greater and 
more consistent choice for our customers.
 – Quality. As part of our strategy to 
continuously improve quality, we introduced 
a 28-day aged Black Angus steak in Flame 
Grill and 30 wines served in Retail won 
prestigious Sommelier Wine Awards. Of 
the 30, 23 were specifically selected for 
Greene King by our own Master of Wine.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
2.  Broadening customer appeal 
through growth categories 
Part of our strategy is to increase our share 
of the £48bn* UK eating out market by 
increasing our provision of all-day food and 
drink, encompassing the broadening of our 
customer appeal through categories such 
as food, wine and coffee.
* Allegra UK Restaurant Market 2014.
Menu innovation during the year included 
the widening of our range of sharing platters, 
the launch of a new mid-week sizzler menu 
in OEI and, in Hungry Horse, the addition 
of new dishes such as the ‘Jumpin’ Jack 
Jalapeño Burger’. 
Looking to maximise the hot drinks 
opportunity, we have introduced unlimited 
Big Bean coffee with breakfast in Hungry 
Horse and Joe’s Tea into our premium Local 
Pubs while, just after the year end, we launched 
own label coffee in Farmhouse Inns.
As a result of our initiatives, LFL food sales 
grew 5.0%, with total food sales, on a 53 
week basis, up 15%, total wine sales up 9% 
and total coffee sales up 7%.
3.  Understanding key customer 
trends such as convenience, 
customisation and health
We previously identified three key 
consumer trends in eating out. Innovating 
to meet these trends is a significant driver 
of our food growth:
 – Customisation. The new Flame Grill 
menu has 11 different meat and fish 
grilling options. The carvery offer at 
Farmhouse Inns, which accounts for 
over 30% of the brand’s food sales, is 
now available in three different plate 
sizes and with additional vegetable, 
potato and gravy choices.
 – Convenience. Our Cakeaway offer, 
launched in 2013 in Hungry Horse, continued 
to grow strongly with sales up 47% to £1.1m. 
We also launched a weekend breakfast 
offer in Hungry Horse aiming to appeal 
to a broader range of eating out occasions.
 – Health. We introduced a new ‘Skinnylicious’, 
under 600 calorie section of the menu in 
Meet & Eat, while a menu redesign in 
Flame Grill increased the number of 
healthier options available. A five-a-day 
salad now features on all Mainstream 
High Street menus.
4 .  Continuing in v es tment 
in our core estate
In total, we spent £76.7m on repairing, 
maintaining and improving the quality of 
our existing Retail estate, of which £29.4m 
was expansionary capital. In addition to a 
number of smaller schemes, development 
spend comprised a number of projects in 
excess of £70k in 126 sites, or 12% of the 
estate. These developments achieved 
an annualised EBITDA return of 30%. 
5.  Further aligning our estate to 
our customers through targeted 
acquisitions
In the year, we increased our trading estate 
by a net 45 sites, having acquired or transferred 
in 48 sites and disposed of three non-core 
sites. This took our estate to 1,032 pubs at 
the year end. Of those new sites, 14 were 
single site acquisitions, 19 were new-build 
openings and 15 were transfers from Pub 
Partners. The new-build openings included 
our first new-build site in Scotland and the 
200th Hungry Horse site. 
6.  Employing the best trained and 
motivated people in the sector
3,900 colleagues have been on an 
apprenticeship programme since February 
2011 with 2,200 qualifying and an ongoing 
retention rate of 75%. Our progress was 
recognised, becoming a Top 100 
Apprenticeship Employer and coming 
runner-up in the national competition at 
the National Apprenticeship awards. We 
also saw year on year improvement of 2%pts 
in our employee engagement score to 77% 
and launched a new internal HR system, 
called ‘GKi’, which gives every colleague 
online access to Greene King and allows us 
to speak directly to all 23,000 colleagues 
across the business. 
7 .  Increasing investment in our 
expanding digital platform
We again invested more resource in digital 
to better understand our customers and to 
communicate more effectively with them. 
Traffic on our websites grew 59%, helped 
by website redesigns in Hungry Horse and 
Loch Fyne, while visits via mobile devices 
were up 97% to 4.4m, representing 39% of 
total visits. Our online hotel sales and table 
reservations were up 40% and 61% respectively, 
while our Facebook followers rose more 
than threefold to 793,000. We sold over £1m 
of Greene King gift cards and we saw a 32% 
increase in loyalty card holders.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
It was another successful year for Pub 
Partners with good trading and further 
strategic progress. This culminated in an 
agreement to dispose of 275 non-core sites to 
Hawthorn Leisure for a total consideration 
of £75.6m. Excluding this agreement, net 
disposal proceeds in the year totalled £31.8m, 
representing an average historic EBITDA 
multiple of 10.3x and against a total book 
value of £33.6m.
On 8.5% fewer pubs, Pub Partners achieved 
revenue of £149.6m, down 4.5%. Average 
revenue per pub was up 4.4%, driven by per 
pub increases in beer volume and rental 
income. EBITDA was £74.9m, down 3.7%, 
although average EBITDA per pub was up 
5.2% and LFL net income in the core estate 
was up 2.2%. Operating profit was £65.3m, 
down 5.9%, with the operating margin down 
70bps to 43.6%. The difference in performance 
between EBITDA and operating profit was 
due to a higher proportion of capital repairs 
as opposed to revenue repairs, compared 
to the previous year. 
While challenges in the tenanted and 
leased industry remain, Pub Partners plays 
an important role in Greene King through 
generating significant cash for the group, 
adding material purchasing scale and providing 
attractive yields on smaller pubs. As it stands, 
the proposed statutory code for pub companies 
is not expected to have a material impact on 
Pub Partners’ profitability.
Pub Partners is focused on operating the 
right pubs, with the right people, on the 
right agreement, with the right offer. 
 – Right pubs. During the year, we disposed 
of 133 non-core sites, transferred 15 to Retail, 
and announced an agreement to sell a 
further 275 non-core tenanted sites to 
Hawthorn Leisure. We invested £20.9m 
in our core estate, up from £16.2m last 
year. Successful developments in the year 
included the Station in Bury St Edmunds, 
the Weathercock in Woburn Sands 
and the White Lion in Baldock.
 – Right people. We launched quarterly open 
days for prospective licensees, including 
a National Open Day in Bury St Edmunds. 
These proved popular, increasing our 
future licensee talent pool and helping 
to let difficult sites. We introduced social 
media training courses for licensees and 
courses for business development managers 
(BDM) and head office teams to promote 
marketing and communication. One of 
our BDMs was named BDM of the year at 
the 2013 Association of Licensed Multiple 
Retailers awards. 
 – Right agreements. We now have 259 
Touchstone or Touchstone Plus tenancies 
and 46 franchise or franchise-style 
agreements including 26 Local Hero sites. 
We plan to add another 20 franchise or 
franchise-style sites in the new financial 
year. 70% of our trading estate, or 818 
sites, operated under a form of free-of-tie 
agreement, highlighting the flexibility 
of our agreements and our increasingly 
competitive range and pricing.
 – Right offer. We continue to help our 
licensees improve their offer where 
appropriate. We used our scale to drive 
new Sky subscribers to the estate and 
generated £750k of licensee discounts, 
while we funded the rollout of Cask 
Marque across our Head Brewer’s Cask 
Club. We successfully introduced cider 
and beer festivals to the estate with 
over 500 sites taking part in our Easter 
beer festival. 
As a result of these initiatives, average 
licensee tenure reached five years at the 
year end with first year licensee retention 
in the core estate improving 2%pts to 85%. 
We also achieved our lowest ever number 
of temporary agreements, at 16, and lowest 
ever levels of licensee overdue debt.

OPERATIONAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Brewing & Brands’ strategy is to drive OBV 
through a focus on core brands, supplemented 
by the growing range of small-batch, innovative 
brands from the St Edmund Brewhouse, 
while operating an efficient cost base. This 
facilitates sector-leading investment in sales 
and marketing and generates significant 
cash for the group.
Following a better second half, core OBV 
was up 4.6%, outperforming a UK ale market 
down 1.6%*. As a result, we increased our 
ale market share by 70bps to 11.3%**. 
Revenue was £189.0m, up 4.5%, while 
operating profit reached £30.4m, down 0.7%. 
This performance was driven by Old Speckled 
Hen, the UK’s no.1 premium ale brand. Led 
by strong growth in Take Home, the brand 
family grew 12.9% by volume against a 
premium ale market up 5.7%*. Greene King 
IPA volume was slightly down on last year 
due to lower tenanted and leased volumes, 
although we gained further market share 
against a UK standard ale market down 4.9%*.
We continued to reposition the business 
towards the Take Home and Export markets. 
Core OBV growth in Take Home was 18.2% 
and we are now the UK’s no.1 ale brewer in 
the off-trade by value**. Our core Export 
volume grew 5.4%, led by growth in 
emerging markets. 
We again invested in our industry-leading 
ale portfolio, including the continuation of 
our Greene King IPA ‘crafted for the moment’ 
campaign and sponsorship of the Greene 
King IPA rugby union Championship 
in England.
New beers, including Belhaven Black and 
Old Golden Hen, performed well, with sales 
of Old Golden Hen almost doubling versus 
last year. Overall, new product development 
volume was up 61% and accounted for 10% 
of total volume.
Innovation is key to our continued 
outperformance and in November we 
opened the St Edmund Brewhouse to brew 
and pack a range of innovative craft beers 
off shorter runs with a broader range of raw 
materials. Four brands from the new brewhouse, 
St Edmunds, Strong Suffolk, Double Hop 
Monster and Yardbird, won Gold Awards 
at the 2014 Monde Selection awards, along 
with four of our existing ale portfolio.

Results 
Revenue grew to £1,301.6m, an increase 
of 6.9%*. The biggest driver of this growth 
continues to be our Retail estate, where 
revenue grew 9.4% and average revenue per 
site rose 5.5%. Our Retail estate now accounts 
for 74% of group revenue and will continue 
to grow its share as we make further progress 
with our Retail expansion strategy. Total 
revenue in Pub Partners was down 4.5% from 
8.5% fewer pubs, although average revenue 
per pub increased 4.4%. Brewing & Brands 
grew revenue by 4.5%. 
Operating profit before exceptionals was 
£265.6m, up 5.0%. Group operating margins 
fell by 40bps to 20.4%, reflecting the ongoing 
changes to business mix, continuing 
inflationary cost pressures, particularly in 
our Brewing & Brands business, and reducing 
Pub Partners rental income. Despite these 
inflationary pressures, our control over costs 
and cash remains strong with the Retail 
operating margin growing 10bps to 19.5%.
Net interest costs before exceptional items 
of £92.5m were only 0.8% higher than last 
year, due to strong cash flow management 
and a small reduction in the IFRS pension 
interest charge.
PBTE was £173.1m, an increase of 7.4%. 
Adjusted earnings per share of 61.4p were 
up 8.3%, benefiting from the reduction in 
the effective tax rate. Statutory profit before 
tax was £105.2m, down 5.2% on a 53 week 
basis, as a result of the impact of exceptional 
items, summarised below.
*  Unless otherwise stated, all numbers in this 
review are based on an adjusted 52 week year.
Tax
The effective rate of corporation tax (before 
exceptional items) was 23% compared to 24% 
in the previous year, resulting in a charge to 
operating profits (before exceptional items) 
of £39.8m. This is in line with the standard 
UK corporation tax rate and is expected to 
remain in line. 
The group’s business strategy generates 
revenue, profits and employment, all of 
which deliver substantial tax revenues for 
the UK government in the form of duties, 
VAT, income and corporation tax. In the 
year, total tax revenues paid and collected 
by the group were £400m (2013: £375m). 
The group’s tax policy, which has been 
approved by the board, aligns with this 
strategy and ensures that the group fulfils 
its UK tax responsibilities, while also 
structuring its operations in a tax-efficient 
manner. There are a number of uncertain 
tax positions in relation to transactions over 
the last ten years and an estimate of the 
expected total payment relating to these 
transactions is included within the tax 
creditor of £46.5m (2013: £41.1m).

FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Exceptional items 
We recorded a net exceptional charge of 
£37.2m, consisting of a £66.2m charge to 
operating profit before tax, a £1.7m charge 
to finance costs and an exceptional tax credit 
of £30.7m. Full details are set out in note 
three and the principal items are as follows: 
1.  On 1 May 2014, we announced the 
disposal of 275 non-core pubs from Pub 
Partners, leading to an impairment charge 
of £34.2m, £19.6m in respect of the carrying 
value of the assets and £14.6m relating to 
goodwill allocated to these sites. This 
disposal completed on 2 June 2014. The 
disposal proceeds from other non-core 
pubs and properties sold in the year were 
in line with net book value, and a charge 
of £6.4m relating to allocated goodwill 
has been recognised.
2.  An impairment charge of £22.0m was 
made against the carrying value of a small 
number of our pubs where specific market 
conditions impacted trading. 
3.  In a prior period, the group received a 
refund of £7.0m from HMRC in respect of 
VAT on gaming machines, the application 
of which was deemed to have contravened 
the EU’s principle of fiscal neutrality. HMRC 
appealed the decision and on 30 October 
2013, following hearings involving the 
Rank Group plc, the Court of Appeal found 
in favour of HMRC. While Rank has applied 
for leave to appeal this latest decision, HMRC 
has enforced the protective assessments 
issued at the time and repayment of the 
£7.0m refund and associated interest of 
£1.7m are shown in exceptional items.
4.  In addition to a tax credit of £10.5m in 
respect of the above items, the exceptional 
tax credit of £30.7m includes a deferred tax 
credit of £18.8m, arising from the reduction 
in the rate of corporation tax to 20%, effective 
from 1 April 2015, a deferred tax credit of 
£6.5m, in respect of the licensed estate, and 
a £5.1m charge in respect of prior periods.
Cash flow
Operating cash flows continue to be strong. 
We generated free cash flow (FCF) of £67.9m, 
up from £63.1m, and comfortably ahead of 
our scheduled debt repayments of £29.4m. 
EBITDA was £329.7m, up 5.5%, from 3.4% 
fewer pubs. 
We disposed of 136 sites as part of our strategy 
to improve the quality of our estate with the 
cash proceeds totalling £38.4m. We also made 
good progress with our strategic Retail 
expansion plan, adding 48 new pubs to 
our Retail estate, investing £82.9m.
Capital expenditure
We also invested in maintaining and 
developing our core estate, in addition to 
growing the size of our Retail estate. Total 
expenditure during the period was £169.6m.
Capital expenditure on the core estate, 
including maintenance capital, was £82.3m, 
an increase of £2.9m. A further £24.3m was 
invested in acquiring single sites and £58.6m 
was invested on these, previously acquired 
sites and transfers from Pub Partners. In 
addition, £4.3m was spent on reinstating 
fully insured fire-damaged sites.
Net debt and treasury
Net debt at the year end was £1,435.6m, a 
reduction of £14.8m from the previous year 
end, with the key movements being positive 
FCF of £67.9m, disposal proceeds of £38.4m 
and the continued investment in growing 
our Retail estate, through new sites, of £82.9m.
Our high quality pub estate supports £1,211.7m 
of securitised bonds with amortisation 
of £29.4m and a weighted average maturity 
of 13 years.
At the start of the year, we announced the 
purchase, at par, of the entire £60m tranche 
of the AB1 bond. This was financed from 
bank loan facilities, which were increased 
to £460m and extended until June 2018. 
These facilities were £280m drawn at the 
year end.
Our credit metrics remain strong with 
interest rate hedges in place for 95% of the 
variable rate net debt and a blended average 
cost of debt of 6.0%. Fixed charge cover has 
improved slightly to 2.8x, while interest cover 
has improved to 3.0x. Group net debt to 
EBITDA reduced to 4.4x and will continue 
to improve as we maximise the annual 
EBITDA returns from our investments. 
Our securitised vehicle had a free cash 
flow debt service cover ratio of 1.5x 
at the year end, giving 29% headroom.
Dividend 
The board has recommended a final 
dividend of 20.8 pence per share, up 6.9%. 
This will be paid on 15 September 2014 to 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 15 August 2014.
The proposed final dividend brings the total 
dividend for the year to 28.4 pence per share, 
up 6.8%. This is in line with the board’s policy 
of maintaining a minimum dividend cover 
of two times underlying earnings, while 
continuing to invest for future growth, 
and maintains our long-term track record 
of annual dividend growth.
Pensions 
The group maintains two defined contribution 
schemes, which are open to all new employees. 
The group’s two defined benefit schemes are 
all closed to new entrants and to future accrual.
At the year end, there was an IAS 19 pension 
deficit of £52.2m, which compares to £63.8m 
at the previous balance sheet date. The 
movement is primarily due to an increase 
in the market value of the schemes’ assets 
over the period.
Total cash contributions in the period under 
the schemes’ deficit recovery plans were £7 .3m.
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has been applied 
retrospectively from 30 April 2012. Other 
finance expenses include a £2.5m pension 
finance charge and the comparative figures 
for the period to 28 April 2013 have been 
restated and now include a £2.7m IAS 19 
finance cost. The impact of the application 
of the revised accounting standard is shown 
in note 11. Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
STRATEGIC RISKS
We have a formal risk management process which is designed to 
identify, assess and prioritise risks within the business, so that their 
impact on sustainable profitability is minimised and the group is able 
to deliver our business plans and strategic objectives, as well 
as to maximise shareholder returns. 
The board retains ultimate responsibility for 
the company’s risk management framework 
and reviews the group’s principal risks on 
an annual basis. The board has delegated 
responsibility for assurance for the risk 
management process to the audit committee, 
which regularly reviews the risk management 
processes for each division and functional 
area. The implementation of risk management 
and internal control systems is the responsibility 
of the executive directors and other 
senior management.
Each division and functional area is tasked 
with maintaining, reviewing and regularly 
updating a risk register. Classification of 
risks takes into account the likelihood of 
their occurrence and the scale of potential 
impact (both financial and reputational) on 
the business. Each division and functional 
area is then responsible for evaluating current 
controls and drawing up plans to improve 
controls and manage new risks. Progress of 
these risk implementation plans is monitored 
by senior management on a regular basis. 
In addition, a company-wide risk committee 
reviews the individual risk registers in detail, 
monitors the risk mitigation plans and assists 
in the production of the group risk register. 
Given that some risks are external and not 
fully within our control, the risk management 
processes are designed to manage risks which 
may have a material impact on our business, 
rather than to fully mitigate all risks.
This section highlights some of the key risks 
and uncertainties which affect Greene King, 
but it is not intended to be an exhaustive 
analysis of all risks facing the business.
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION MONITORING/ASSURANCE
T o achieve our Retail expansion 
plans we need to be able to 
acquire existing pubs, smaller 
pub businesses and brown or 
greenfield sites on which to 
build new pubs. The upturn 
in the economy has resulted in 
increased activity meaning more 
businesses competing for the 
same sites.
A failure to find and secure the acquisition 
(and development where appropriate) of 
top quality sites could reduce our rate of 
growth in the future. We risk costs creep 
due to the supply and demand on land, 
materials and labour.
We maintain a pipeline of sites 
(currently 100+) available for purchase 
and have expanded our team of acquisition 
managers responsible for securing new 
sites. We have also moved into new areas 
such as transport hubs. Our in-house 
property development team is employed 
to help deliver new-build projects on 
time and on budget.
Regular updates are provided to 
management as to the status of potential 
acquisitions and of development progress 
for new-build sites or major conversions 
of acquired pubs. Monthly estate plan 
meetings are held to discuss progress.
ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION MONITORING/ASSURANCE
The wider economic situation 
within the UK continues to affect 
consumer confidence, with a 
consequential impact on levels of 
consumer spending in our pubs 
and those of our tenants and 
lessees. W e also face increasing 
competitor activity .
Consumers spending less in our pubs 
whether due to concerns over interest 
rates, spending on large ticket items 
elsewhere, or significant competitor 
activity, could reduce our revenue and 
lead to lower growth rates. 
By focusing on value, service and quality 
we aim to continue to appeal to a broad 
range of consumers. We have a wide 
geographic spread of pubs including 
the more affluent areas of London and 
the south-east, and a good range of 
customer offers. We provide ongoing 
training, operational and financial 
support for our tenants alongside 
continued agreement innovation to 
ensure that more of our tenants are 
able to run profitable businesses.
The executive teams and the board 
receive regular updates on performance. 
Competitor activity is monitored at both a 
strategic and tactical level to enable suitable 
actions to be developed in response. All 
business units keep and update profit 
protection plans. Our Pub Partners division 
constantly monitors the vital signs of our 
licensee health, including debt levels and 
the numbers of tenancies at will. Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements

management systems are also in place. 
W e have upweighted technical support 
in key areas including product 
recall procedures.
We have introduced a new supplier 
assurance programme to enable us 
to give appropriate assurances to our 
customers as to the provenance of the 
food in our pubs. Our new e-commerce 
team monitors social media comments 
about us. Third party audits on food 
take place regularly to ensure standards 
are being maintained.
W e are reliant on information 
systems and technology for many 
aspects of our business.
W e are reliant on the quality of 
our employees and our licensees.
An inability to quickly recover key 
operating systems could impact our 
ability to do business and cause 
reputational damage. Loss or theft 
of personal data belonging to our 
customers or employees (including 
by cyber attack) could also cause 
reputational and financial damage.
A failure to attract, develop, retain, 
motivate and (in the case of senior 
employees) plan for the succession of 
the best employees across our expanding 
Retail business may mean that we are 
not able to execute our business plans 
and strategy. A failure to attract and 
retain good quality licensees will 
impact our Pub Partners business.
Our networks are protected by firewalls 
and anti-virus protection systems and 
back-up procedures are also in place. 
A business continuity plan is in place 
for critical business processes. We have 
access to an off-site disaster recovery 
facility in the event of a major issue 
with our head office or our systems. 
A working party has been established 
to review data security and drive 
improved behaviours and response 
management. A data security manager 
has been recruited.
A branded recruitment plan is in place with 
a strong pipeline of suitable candidates. 
Remuneration packages are benchmarked 
to ensure that they remain competitive. 
Career development programmes are 
in place to retain key employees and 
leadership training has been introduced 
for all levels of management. Exit 
interviews are conducted with all retail 
managers to enable action plans to be 
developed to deal with key leaver reasons. 
Upgraded apprenticeship schemes are 
provided through a new supplier . The 
range of tenancy agreements, training 
programmes and support available is 
designed to attract and retain the best 
quality licensees.
The IT department constantly monitor 
threats to data protection by viruses, 
hacking and breach of access controls. 
The business continuity plan is also 
regularly reviewed and tested.
Our annual employee engagement 
survey is used to obtain direct feedback 
from employees on a range of issues. 
Both staff and licensee turnover is 
measured and reviewed by relevant 
management teams. 
W e are reliant on a number 
of key suppliers and third party 
distributors to supply our pubs 
and restaurants and are also at 
risk of an event occurring which 
may prevent us from producing, 
packaging and distributing our 
own beers.
Supply disruption (whether of our own 
beers or any third party products) could 
impact customer satisfaction. Additionally 
a key supplier or distributor failure 
could over the longer term reduce our 
revenue or lead to increased costs if 
alternative arrangements are required.
Detailed risk management and mitigation 
plans exist in our internal production and 
distribution activities. Our key suppliers 
are expected to maintain disaster recovery 
plans. We also maintain back-up plans 
in the event of the failure by or loss 
of a key supplier.
Risk mitigation and product recall plans 
are reviewed and tested regularly across 
the business and disaster recovery plans 
of suppliers are reviewed regularly. 
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION MONITORING/ASSURANCE
Inflationary trends increase 
the costs of our key products, 
including food, drink and site 
services including utilities. 
Higher costs could impact margins 
and lead to reduced profitability.
We have contracts in place with 
major suppliers designed to protect us 
against significant increases in major 
cost items and against price volatility. 
We continually evolve the composition 
of menus and retail prices to optimise 
value to the customer and profits for 
the company.
All costs, including labour, are 
closely monitored by the executive 
teams to ensure that they remain 
in line with budget.

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES CONTINUED
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION MONITORING/ASSURANCE
The government has confirmed 
that it proposes to introduce 
a statutory code to manage 
the relationship between pub 
companies and their tenants 
which could have significant 
implications for our Pub 
Partners division. 
A mandatory statutory code, particularly 
if it introduced greater controls on how 
pub companies can deal with their 
tenants, could increase costs for Pub 
Partners and reduce revenue. 
We will continue to engage actively with 
government in relation to its proposed 
plans. W e have increased resources within 
Pub Partners compliance team to ensure 
the voluntary code is complied with and 
will review resources again if a statutory 
code is introduced.
The regulatory landscape is monitored 
on an ongoing basis by our public affairs 
team, so we remain aware of any potential 
changes which may adversely impact 
our business. Arrangements to monitor 
compliance with any new statutory code 
will be reviewed once details are confirmed.
We are required to comply with 
a wide range of health and safety 
legislation, including in the areas 
of food safety and fire safety, 
across all parts of our business.
A major food safety or health and safety 
incident which causes serious illness, 
injury or even loss of life to one of our 
customers, employees or tenants could 
have a significant impact on our reputation.
We have a comprehensive range of 
formally documented policies and 
procedures in place to ensure compliance 
with current legislation and approved 
guidance in this area, as well as our own 
high standards. Our health and safety 
policies are continually reviewed by 
our primary authority partner, Reading 
Borough Council, which has rated our 
safety management systems as very 
good. Safety levels for new tenants have 
been improved, and safety measures are 
in place to ensure that product integrity 
is maintained and that all food and 
drink products are fully traceable.
We have a centrally managed system 
of compliance tracking (KPIs), which 
is validated by both internal and 
independent external audits carried 
out at all Retail sites to measure 
performance against certain strict 
health and safety standards including 
food safety and fire safety. Operational 
managers are regularly briefed on 
performance and remedial actions 
are tracked from the centre. We also 
make use of external benchmarking.
SPECIFIC RISK AREAS POTENTIAL IMPACT MITIGATION MONITORING/ASSURANCE
Our financing structure requires 
us to be able to repay capital 
borrowed and interest on time 
and to ensure that we operate 
within certain financial covenants.
Breaching our financial covenants would 
have a significant impact on our ability 
to pay dividends or reinvest cash back 
into the business. It could also impact 
our reputation and ongoing 
creditworthiness.
Our long-term strategy and yearly 
business plans are formulated to ensure 
that financial covenants can be met. Our 
securitised vehicle had a free cash flow 
debt service cover ratio at the year end 
of 1.5x, giving 29% headroom. Under 
our bank facility we had 75% headroom 
on the key net debt/EBITDA covenant.
We regularly monitor our performance 
against our financial covenants, including 
stress testing. Working capital is carefully 
forecast, regularly reviewed by the 
finance teams and closely managed.
W e are reliant on maintaining 
robust systems of internal 
control to deal accurately with 
the large numbers of transactions 
undertaken by the business and to 
ensure compliance with statutory 
obligations particularly with 
regard to taxation.
Inadequate internal control systems 
increase the risk of fraud being perpetrated 
against us. Non-compliance with statutory 
obligations or a material misstatement 
in the reported results of the company 
could damage our reputation.
Our systems of internal control, more 
details of which appear on page 48, 
include robust controls, appropriately 
qualified staff, segregation of duties and 
authority levels for expenditure and 
payments. Appropriate advice is taken 
to ensure relevant statutory compliance 
and there is regular board oversight 
of open tax positions and the group’s 
tax policy.
Regular management accounts are 
produced for each area and reviewed 
in detail, to enable irregularities to be 
exposed. There is a detailed external 
audit of our statutory accounts. 
There is regular monitoring of the 
schemes’ investments and dialogue 
with the trustees on an ongoing basis 
regarding funding requirements.
W e maintain two defined benefit 
pension schemes which must be 
funded to meet the required benefit 
payments. The value and funding 
of the schemes are subject to the 
risk of changes in life expectancy , 
actual and expected price inflation 
and changes in investment yields.
The difference in value between the 
schemes’ assets and liabilities may vary, 
resulting in an increased deficit being 
recognised on our balance sheet. The 
volatility of this deficit makes longer-term 
planning more difficult.
All the schemes are now closed to future 
accrual to reduce volatility.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Pubs have an important role to play for 
customers, families and communities across 
the country and provide safe, affordable 
and convenient hospitality. 
Our commitment to delivering industry-
leading value, service and quality to our 
customers is supported by our strong retail 
brands, our dedicated teams and our ongoing 
investment in innovation, which combine 
to deliver the best experience possible 
for our customers. 
Healthy eating 
This year we appointed a nutrition manager, 
demonstrating our commitment to moving 
nutrition to the top of our agenda. The role 
supports the development of healthier menu 
options for our customers and manages our 
continued commitment to the government’s 
Public Health Responsibility Deal food 
pledges, specifically to lower the levels of 
salt within our supply chain and to remove 
artificial trans fats. 
We achieved solid results with salt reduction 
in key product lines, including our kids’ 
sausage, where we saw a 24% reduction, 
and a 22% decrease in our beef burger. 
In conjunction with these results, we are 
currently in the process of reviewing the 
salt content of several of our top ten 
product lines. 
We extended the range of healthy food 
choices across our menu brands. This summer 
we introduced a range of ‘five a day’ salads 
to promote the intake of a variety of fruit 
and vegetables, supporting government 
recommendations. We also expanded the 
range of ‘fewer than 500 calories dishes and 
will continue to develop this area of our menu. 
Several of our kids’ menus were changed to 
offer a wider range of ‘five a day’ pick and mix 
options. In some of our Destination and Local 
Pub sites, our kids’ menus allow children to 
customise their order, and highlight healthy 
options, which enable them to make healthier 
eating decisions. 
The investment in our supplier management 
system this year enabled us to have greater 
visibility of the nutritional and allergen 
content of our products, allowing us to 
provide more detailed nutritional and 
allergen reports across our retail estate. 
In response to the growing demand for 
non-gluten containing dishes, all of our menu 
brands now offer a range of non-gluten 
options. As part of our menu development 
process, we will continue to review 
and develop the range going forward. 
Our focus for the future is to continue to 
expand our nutritional expertise along with 
developing our menus with lower calorie 
and healthier options for our customers. 
Food standards 
We are committed to delivering and 
actively promoting excellent food and 
kitchen standards. In our Retail business, 
we set to do this by training, external 
audits, open dialogue with local authorities 
and operational incentive schemes. We also 
work with our tenants to support them in 
achieving excellent food standards.
Quality standards for our beers 
The Westgate Brewery in Bury St Edmunds 
and the Belhaven Brewery in Dunbar both 
maintained an A grade rating with the British 
Retail Consortium. These awards confirm 
that our beer is produced to the highest 
quality and food safety standards. 
We launched a quality and dispense services 
department in our Brewing & Brands division, 
combining the functions of the Cellar Service 
and Trade Quality teams. The aim of the 
team will be to support pubs with training 
on how to care for and serve real ale to 
improve beer quality.
Our commitment to quality was recognised 
as ten of our beers received Monde Selection 
Quality Awards this year. We were awarded 
eight gold and two silvers for our beers, 
including the newly launched Yardbird and 
Double Hop Monster, as well as our much 
loved favourites Abbot Ale and 
Old Golden Hen. 
Responsible retailing
Tackling under-age sales
We created an online employee training 
system to improve how we attempt to 
reduce and prevent under-age sales of 
alcohol. The training course must be 
completed and passed before our staff 
can serve alcohol. 
Our Retail premises continue to 
operate the ‘challenge 21’ or ‘challenge 25’ 
programmes, which are regularly audited 
to ensure notices are displayed advising 
customers that these programmes are 
in force.

We also support the principles laid out in 
the Portman Code of Practice on responsible 
retailing of alcohol. All retail managers and 
our bar staff are trained upon recruitment 
and ongoing to ensure they understand 
their role in promoting the responsible 
consumption of alcohol by our customers.
Best Bar None and Pub Watch schemes
We are working with National Best Bar None 
to re-launch the scheme to improve its profile 
and membership. At a more local level, we 
are working with the local authority to roll 
out Best Bar None across the county of Suffolk.
In England, 173 of our managed pubs 
belong to recognised Pub Watch schemes 
and a further 64 have, or are currently, 
signed up to Best Bar None award schemes 
within their area. Additional schemes 
across the UK are currently on hold.
Last year, 15 of our pubs were accredited 
with Best Bar None status, some of which 
were awarded best in specific categories 
or overall winner.
The Best Bar None Scheme in Scotland 
saw almost 100% of sites able to take part 
and resulted in these sites being fully 
accredited with numerous winners of 
categories and schemes.
Limit awareness 
Once again we supported the Government’s 
anti-drink drive Christmas campaigns. This 
year was the fifth consecutive year that we 
supported the Designated Driver Christmas 
Campaign, in conjunction with Coca-Cola 
Enterprises Limited, throughout our retail 
estate, where designated drivers were 
offered free soft drinks at Christmas.
Minimum unit pricing for alcohol
Greene King has long advocated the need 
for a minimum unit price (MUP) for alcohol 
in the UK in order to tackle the misuse of 
alcohol, which causes ill health and can lead 
to anti-social behaviour within communities. 
We remain committed to the introduction 
of minimum unit pricing. 
Unit reduction in our beers
We are also committed to removing units 
of alcohol from our brand portfolio to help 
our customers drink sensibly and within 
guidelines. We reduced the alcohol by volume 
(ABV) in Old Speckled Hen bottles and cans 
from 5.2% to 5.0%, Belhaven Best in cans 
from 3.5% to 3.2%, and in Ruddles bottles 
and cans from 4.7% to 4.3%. This removed 
2.9 million units of alcohol from circulation 
in the UK.
Public Health Responsibility Deal 
We are currently signed up to eight 
pledges in the government’s Public Health 
Responsibility Deal (PHRD) and progressed 
with these during the last year. The PHRD 
aims to tap into our potential to make a 
significant contribution to improving public 
health by taking a joint approach to tackling 
the challenges caused by lifestyle changes. 
By signing up to these pledges we are 
commit to taking action voluntarily to 
improve public health. For details of our 
signed pledges and our progress visit the 
Department of Health PHRD website,

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Pubs will always play a vital role in the 
community. They are a place where everyone 
comes together to relax and to discuss issues 
that affect their neighbourhood. We recognise 
the value of that role within the social 
fabric of our society and how, for everyone, 
maintaining the presence of a pub in a 
community is essential. We have developed 
a programme to support key organisations 
that address the inequalities in our society.
Pub is the Hub 
This year we supported Pub is the Hub by 
providing £15,000 of central funding. As a 
not-for-profit organisation, Pub is the Hub 
is dedicated to offering advice and support to 
licensees, rural pubs and community services.
Our funding supported the Community 
Services Fund. This fund provided support 
for 33,000 local people in their village 
communities through investment or 
planned investment, via the local pub, 
during the last 12 months. A further 
24,000 people are anticipated to receive 
help from future projects. 
Macmillan Cancer Support 
Our first national charity partnership was 
launched in May 2012 and we committed to 
raise £1m over three years for Macmillan 
Cancer Support. The continued hard work 
and dedication to fundraising by our employees 
and generosity and support of our customers 
resulted in £903,086 raised in the first two 
years of the partnership.
The fundraising efforts during our second 
year included employees running marathons, 
throwing themselves from aeroplanes, 
swimming lakes, riding bikes and climbing 
mountains. We also diversified our fundraising 
efforts in line with our commitment to our 
charity partners by introducing donations 
on selected desserts across all divisions, 
raising £50,000; our contribution to Macmillan’s 
World’s Biggest Coffee Morning grew by 16% 
to £117,000; 50,000 wristbands have now 
been sold, helping to raise awareness of 
Macmillan’s flagship ‘Not Alone’ campaign; 
and 162 Greene King employees took on 
the gruelling Yorkshire Three Peaks 
fundraising challenge. 
After a busy and successful year for our 
charity partnership, we were delighted to 
be shortlisted for the Employee Engagement 
category of the Third Sector Business 
Charity Awards 2014. This recognises our 
investment and commitment to launch our 
first charity partnership and the incredible 
success in engaging our employees across 
the business. 
Our £1m target is now within sight and 
we should reach it well ahead of schedule, 
although we will continue raising money 
through the remainder of the partnership.
Focus 12 
Greene King continues to support the 
charity Focus 12, based close to our head 
office and brewery in Bury St Edmunds, 
Suffolk. Focus 12 provides treatment for 
clients with drug and alcohol dependency, 
as well as guidance and counselling for 
affected family members. 
The annual Greene King Charity Ball, 
which historically raises more than £20,000 
for Focus 12, enabling it to continue to support 
the local community and tackle the effects 
of alcohol and drug abuse, will be held in 
the autumn of this year.

CASE STUDY
Employees reach their peak by 
taking on their toughest challenge 
yet for Macmillan 
On a perfectly sunny spring day in 
Yorkshire, 162 Greene King employees 
from all parts of the business took on 
the gruelling Yorkshire Three Peaks 
fundraising challenge for Macmillan.
We had pub managers, bar staff, chefs at 
Loch Fyne Seafood & Grill restaurants, 
head office employees and brewery 
workers all pulling together to raise as 
much money as possible for Macmillan 
and get as many of the team through 
to the end of the challenge. The target 
of £50,000 was comfortably beaten and 
nearly everybody on the team made 
it to the end before the sunset! 
And this was no mean feat. The Yorkshire 
Three Peaks are the three largest hills in 
Yorkshire. We covered just over 25 miles 
walking up Pen-y-Ghent, Whernside 
and Ingleborough. Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 37
Our people are our lifeblood and our greatest 
asset. With 23,000 employees, it is important 
that we attract and retain the best people and 
developing and nurturing talent is essential to 
our continued success and the future growth 
of our business. 
Employee engagement 
There are many benefits to having engaged 
employees both from a work and individual 
point of view. We are pleased that we saw an 
increase in our employee engagement of 
2%pts to 77%. This should imply an improved 
quality of service we provide our customers 
and a happier workplace. For the first time 
this year our annual attitude survey was 
managed 100% online and we also 
introduced smartphone technology.
The data is currently being reviewed across 
the business, which will result in agreed 
action plans for areas of improvement.

Isabelle said: “I chose to become an 
apprentice as I wanted to further my 
education while developing my career. 
At each stage of my progression I found 
that the apprenticeship provided great

Developing our talent
At Greene King, we recognise the wider 
benefits of developing internal talent and 
career paths that support increased employee 
retention, employee engagement and provide 
long-term career opportunities. 
Apprenticeships 
We signed up to the government’s 
apprenticeship scheme in February 2011 
and, so far, more than 3,500 employees 
have achieved a qualification. This year, 
we made a commitment to recruit over 2,000 
additional apprentices. As our business grows, 
we are proud to offer the apprentices who 
join Greene King the opportunity to move 
straight onto a career path to allow them 
to fulfil their true potential.
Where we create new jobs when acquiring, 
refurbishing or building new businesses, we 
work closely with Job Centre Plus to provide 
opportunities through pre-employment 
training for the long-term unemployed 
and younger people. 
Creating jobs 
Through the opening of new sites for Hungry 
Horse and Farmhouse Inns we created 1,583 
new jobs across the country in the last year.
Diversity 
We operate an equal opportunities policy 
to ensure that employees are recruited, 
developed, remunerated and promoted on the 
basis of their skills and suitability for the work 
performed. We are committed to making full 
use of the talents and resources of all our 
employees and to ensuring that no employee 
receives less favourable treatment on the 
grounds of their colour, nationality, race, 
religion/belief, ethnic or national origin, sex, 
marital or civil partnership status, gender 
reassignment, disability or past disability, 
part-time or fixed term status, pregnancy or 
maternity, parental responsibilities, sexual 
orientation or age.
Zero hours 
It is company policy not to operate 
‘zero hours’ contracts. 
Workplace pensions 
We became fully compliant with Workplace 
Pensions Reform Regulations to enrol our 
employees automatically into a qualifying 
workplace pension in June last year.
Support for our tenants 
Greene King has been helping people to run 
their own pubs for over 200 years. The level 
of support we provide for our tenants and 
lessees is central to attracting the best 
licensees to our pubs. 
Our support is tailored to meet the individual 
needs of our licensees from industry-leading 
training for them and their staff, to online 
business support providing easy access to a 
wide range of marketing support. Additionally, 
improved support to drive cellar quality began 
this year, with new annual visits from a cellar 
expert from our Brewing & Brands dispense 
team to all Pub Partners’ tenants, offering 
advice in their own cellar on how to improve 
and maintain beer quality. 
This is all underpinned by our professionally 
qualified BDMs, who are dedicated to 
ensuring all licensees are making the most 
of their business. Strategic report
GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 38
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUED
Our aim is to reduce the environmental impact 
of our business wherever we can. Particular 
areas of focus for us are on reducing our energy 
and water consumption and on reducing waste 
across on the business.
Energy
In terms of energy saving initiatives, our focus 
this year was on introducing more LED 
lighting into our pub estate, with more than 
310 sites converting during the year, saving, 
on average, 9% of the total electricity usage at 
each site. Combined with previous conversions, 
over 40% of our Retail sites are now fitted with 
LED lighting.
We fitted 41 sites with voltage optimisers, 
reducing electricity usage, limiting wear and 
tear on electrical equipment and subsequently 
extending the life of the equipment. We also 
replaced 160 boilers across our Retail business 
to save energy and increase efficiency.
We continue to encourage our teams in head 
office, breweries and retail outlets to use 
energy considerately, making regular use 
of ‘turn it off’ campaigns. 
We are continually investing in new 
technology to reduce energy consumption 
and emissions. In our Bury St Edmunds 
brewery, we invested £500,000 in converting 
the brewery boilers to gas from the previous 
light fuel oil, significantly reducing emissions. 
The Bury St Edmunds brewery also successfully 
passed its first triennial renewal of the ISO14001 
environmental standard, following a five-day 
audit covering all operations in Bury St Edmunds, 
including the bottling hall.
Water
To help us identify sites that may have water 
leaks in underground pipes, we now have 
water loggers installed in 190 of our pubs. 
We are working more closely with the 21 water 
companies that supply us to get their support 
for more frequent meter readings and audits 
which will help our managers identify and 
rectify excessive water use. 
We also invested in a second water recovery 
stage in our Bury St Edmunds brewing water 
treatment process, generating annual savings 
of around 23,500 cubic metres of water. On a 
combined basis, our breweries use 3.87 barrels 
of water to produce every barrel of beer.
Water consumption, however, rose during 
the year, from 2.438m cubic metres to 2.688m 
cubic metres, largely due to an increase in the 
size of the Retail estate and the increase in food 
sales in the Retail estate.
Waste
We have continued to work hard to reduce 
waste across the business. We now have 232 
sites where all of their waste is diverted from 
landfill and overall over 80% of our waste 
does not go to landfill. We remain signatories 
of the voluntary Food and Service Hospitality 
Agreement and have worked with WRAP 
on a number of initiatives to reduce food 
waste, optimise packaging and increase 
recycling rates. 
Mandatory greenhouse gas reporting
We amended our environmental reporting 
to comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006 (Strategic and Directors’ 
Report) Regulations 2013. The table below 
shows the main greenhouse gas emissions in

e) for our scope 1 
(direct) and scope 2 (indirect) CO
2
 emissions. 
Scope 1 relates to the direct emissions from 
the fuels we use in our breweries, pubs, 
restaurants, hotels and offices such as 
natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. 
It also includes emissions from owned vehicles 
(including company cars) but excludes logistics 
where we outsource this to third parties. 
Refrigerant gas and F-gas emissions in respect 
of our breweries, pubs and restaurants are 
also included for 2013/14, although we do 
not have access to comparative data for 
the previous year. 
We have used the UK government’s GHG 
Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
2013 for all scope 1 emissions with the exception 
of GWP’s for non-Kyoto refrigerants R22 and 
R401A equating to 0.5t CO
2
e. GHG emissions 
from refrigeration and air conditioning units 
have been determined using the screening 
method as described in the Environmental 
Reporting Guidelines 2013 and equate to 
<1.0% of total reported emissions.
Scope 2 relates to the indirect emissions 
associated with the generation of electricity 
consumed in our sites. Emissions have been 
determined using the 2013 Carbon Reduction 
Commitment (CRC) Energy Efficiency 
Scheme factor.
Electricity and gas figures in the table below 
cover the CRC reporting period from 1 April 
to 31 March each year, whilst all other figures 
cover our respective financial years.
Gas consumption reduced during the year, 
helped by the mild, if wet, winter and spring, 
while electricity consumption was again 
impacted by the increased focus on food sales 
and the increased number of Retail sites. The 
chosen intensity ratio of CO
2
e per £100k of 
turnover in our Retail and Brewing & Brands 
businesses is considered to be the most 
appropriate as the vast majority of our CO
2
 
emissions relate to those businesses.

OUR PRIORITIES FOR 2014/15 
Food assurance Last year, we appointed a technical and quality manager who sits in our food buying team. One of the 
key priorities of this role is to continue to review our current reporting and measurement of quality 
and make recommendations on areas for improvement and monitor implementation. 
Healthy eating Our priority over the next year is to ensure that the business is compliant with new allergen legislation 
that is due to take effect in December 2014. We are currently working towards a more structured 
allergen management programme to ensure allergen information is available to customers on request.
Salt targets As we continue to work towards our commitment of reducing salt in our supply chain, we are reviewing 
the salt content in several of our top ten product lines.
Responsible retailing We understand the importance of supporting local communities to address issues around social and 
health harms. We are working with National Best Bar None, which promotes responsible management 
and operation of alcohol licensed premises, to re-launch the scheme to improve its profile and membership. 
At a more local level, we are working with the local authority to roll out Best Bar None across the 
county of Suffolk.
Charitable support As we enter our third year in partnership with Macmillan Cancer Support, we are confident of 
delivering beyond our £1m target through fundraising activities across the business. Our businesses 
also provide significant fundraising to local charities. 
Community pubs support We will continue to help UK pubs to diversify into new services provision for their own communities. 
We have again supported Pub is the Hub with funding for a further year.
Improve employee engagement It is our aim to continue to achieve year on year improvements in our employee engagement, which 
will be monitored through our employee engagement survey. We will work on how we can improve 
areas and maintain other high scoring questions.
Apprenticeships We have pledged to recruit 2,000 new apprenticeships this year. We have recently appointed a new 
training provider so we can offer our people the most current and engaging programmes available. 
Health and safety We will continue to strive to identify and reduce health and safety risks and to improve the safety 
of our premises. 
Alcohol education While we have had an alcohol policy for some time, and we support treatment for employees who have 
dependency issues, we continue to look at implementing a new, company specific, alcohol education and 
awareness programme, to help prevent issues occurring and to highlight the impact of over-indulgence 
in alcohol. 
Reduce CO
2
We will aim to reduce CO
2
 emissions in our existing estate and to improve the ratio of CO
2
 emissions 
to revenue in Retail and in Brewing & Brands. Energy saving systems will continue to be installed 
where possible or appropriate.
Reduce water usage Our focus this year will continue to be on reducing water wastage across our Retail estate.
Reduce waste We will continue to aim for improvements in our waste recycling programme, with a view to reducing 
the amount of waste sent to landfill. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 40

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The board
Board composition
As at the year end the board comprised the 
chairman, two executive directors and four 
non-executive directors. The board believes 
that the structure and size of the board is 
appropriate and that no single individual or 
group dominates the decision making process. 
The non-executive chairman is Tim Bridge, 
the chief executive Rooney Anand, and the 
senior independent director Ian Durant. 
John Brady, who was appointed to the board 
as a non-executive director in 2005, will be 
retiring from the board on 27 July 2014.
The directors’ biographies are on page 40.
Independence of 
non-executive directors
In compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, more than half of the board, 
excluding the chairman, are non-executive 
directors and the board is satisfied that all of 
these were independent throughout the year, 
in that they satisfied the independence criteria 
of the code on their appointment and continue 
to satisfy those criteria. 
Tim Bridge, the chairman, was not independent 
on appointment, having previously served as 
chief executive. However, the board is satisfied 
that he shows independent judgment, that his 
performance as chairman is effective and that 
he demonstrates continued commitment to 
the role. 
Ian Durant is the senior independent 
non-executive director. He has never been 
employed by the company and has diverse

business interests. The board considers that 
he remained independent in both character 
and judgment, that his performance has 
been effective and that he has demonstrated 
commitment to the role. As well as supporting 
the chairman and acting as a sounding board 
for the chairman and an intermediary for 
other directors, a key responsibility for the 
senior independent director is to be available 
for direct contact from shareholders should 
they require.
CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
Greene King is committed to good governance and believes it to be essential in helping the 
business to deliver its strategy, generate shareholder value and safeguard our shareholders’ 
long-term interests. We also note the emphasis within the UK Corporate Governance Code 
on well balanced, effective boards, strong oversight of risk management, alignment of 
remuneration policies with shareholder interests and sound shareholder relations. 
This year’s corporate governance report and the reports from the board committees describe 
the operation of the board and explain how we applied the principles of good governance 
set out in the code during the year. Our committees are structured to ensure that the 
responsibilities of the board are carried out effectively and in line with best practice procedure. 
We work hard to provide, in this report, the information you need to understand our 
business model and strategy for growth and to assess our performance towards our 
goals. As a result, your board believes this annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, 
is fair, balanced and understandable, as we confirm in the directors’ responsibility 
statements on page 63. I would also encourage you to refer to our website  
www.greeneking.co.uk.
Although there have been no board changes, the board has nevertheless been focused 
on board succession issues, with the process to recruit a new non-executive director to 
replace John Brady, who will stand down at the end of July having completed nine years 
of service on the board, having begun during the year. 
Our group finance director, Matthew Fearn, fell ill during the year and has not yet returned 
to work. The board appointed David Brown, the group’s corporate finance director, as interim 
group finance director in Matthew’s absence. We wish Matthew a full and speedy recovery.
The audit committee has continued its reviews of key accounting and reporting matters 
and its report includes fuller details of the work it has undertaken during the year, 
as well as explaining how significant issues were considered. 
The remuneration committee continues to ensure that the remuneration of the directors 
is aligned with the interests of shareholders whilst at the same time motivating a successful 
team. The directors’ remuneration report includes details of the remuneration paid 
to directors during the year as well as a number of other disclosures required by the 
government’s new regulations on remuneration reporting.
Tim Bridge
Chairman
Statement of compliance with the 
UK Corporate Governance Code
The company is subject to the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the code) 
which is issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council and which is available at 
www.frc.org.uk. The code sets out 
guidance in the form of principles and 
provisions on how companies should be 
directed and controlled to follow good 
governance practice. Companies listed 
in the UK are required to disclose how 
they have applied the main principles 
and whether they have complied with 
its provisions throughout the financial 
year. Where the provisions have not 
been complied with companies must 
provide an explanation. 
The board considers that the company 
has complied with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code dated September 2012 
throughout the year. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 42
Corporate governance
The board continued
Diversity
The board approves of the principle of 
trying to recruit more women into senior 
management and director roles. When making 
new appointments, the policy of the company 
is to recruit on merit for each role on offer, 
whether executive or non-executive. We set 
out a job specification and a profile of the 
likely characteristics, qualifications, experience 
and merits required before starting a search, 
and aim to find the individual who is best suited 
to the role, without prejudice between male 
and female candidates. 
We currently have one female director on the 
board, Lynne Weedall, who is chairman of the 
remuneration committee. We have not set a 
percentage target for female representation 
on the board as we do not think it is the right 
way to address the issue for a board of seven 
people, where the key will be to ensure 
a suitable range of skills, experience and 
knowledge across the board members and 
where the issue of gender and diversity will 
be just one consideration taken into account 
when filling board vacancies. 
Leadership
Role of the board
The board is collectively responsible for the 
long-term success of the company and for its 
leadership, strategy, control and management. 
The offices of chairman and chief executive 
are separate and distinct and the division 
of responsibilities between them has been 
clearly established, set out in writing and 
agreed by the board. 
The chairman is responsible for the 
leadership and effectiveness of the board 
and for ensuring that each non-executive 
director is able to make an effective 
contribution to the board through debate 
and discussion with the executive directors. 
He is also responsible for setting the style 
and tone of board discussions.
The chief executive’s role is to develop the 
company’s strategic direction and to lead 
senior management in executing the company’s 
strategy and managing the operational 
requirements of the business. 
The non-executive directors have a particular 
responsibility to ensure that the strategies 
proposed by the executive directors are 
carefully examined and fully discussed, 
that the performance of the company 
is monitored and challenged and that 
the financial information provided is 
comprehensive and accurate. They are 
also responsible for ensuring, through 
the relevant committee, that appropriate 
remuneration arrangements are in place 
for the executive directors.
Operation of the board
The board has a formal schedule of matters 
which are reserved for its decision, including 
approval of the long-term objectives and 
strategy, approval of budgets and financial 
statements including the annual report, 
acquisitions and disposals, changes to the 
structure of the group and overall corporate 
governance issues. It reviews trading 
performance and considers major capital 
expenditure and acquisition opportunities. 
The board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to standing committees, 
details of which are set out below. By 
delegating key responsibilities to these 
committees, the board is able to ensure 
that adequate time is devoted by board 
members to the oversight of key 
areas within their responsibility.
GREENE KING BOARD
The board is ultimately responsible 
for the long-term success of the 
company. Its principal 
responsibilities are to:
 – Approve the group’s long-term objectives, commercial strategy and the overall 
funding strategy
 – Approve the budgets and financial statements, including the annual report
 – Approve acquisitions and disposals
 – Oversee the group’s operations and review performance in the light of the group’s 
strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets
Nomination
 – reviews structure, size and 
composition of the board; 
 – makes recommendations 
for appointments; and
 – succession planning.
Audit
 – reviews and monitors full year 
and interim results; 
 – monitors internal financial 
controls; 
 – oversees external audit 
relationship; and
 – oversees risk management.
Remuneration
 – sets remuneration policy; 
 – sets executive director 
remuneration and incentives; 
 – approves annual performance 
objectives; and
 – approves granting of 
long-term incentives.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 43
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Day to day management and control of 
the business is delegated to the executive 
directors, business unit managing directors 
and certain key functional heads, who meet 
formally on a monthly basis together with 
other senior managers as appropriate. 
Board meetings are scheduled to be held 
eight times a year, with main meetings 
linked to key events in the company’s 
financial calendar, with the annual results 
and dividend being approved in June or 
July and the interim results and dividend 
in November or December. Regular agenda 
items include an overview of the market and 
current trading as well as a detailed review of 
financial performance against agreed targets. 
There is a two-day meeting for the board 
in February each year focusing on strategy, 
with the business unit managing directors 
and heads of the main functional areas, 
namely commercial, HR and property, 
attending for part thereof. The strategy 
sessions include an in-depth review of 
relevant economic factors, management’s 
projections for the medium term and provide 
the board with an opportunity to agree the 
strategic plans across all areas for the short 
and medium term. Following approval of the 
company’s strategy, budgets are prepared 
for the next financial year to be approved 
by the board in April. The board also has 
a programme to review each business unit 
and main functional area in detail on a 
regular basis, with particular focus on 
the achievement of strategic objectives. 
The relevant managing director or functional 
head attends such meetings to present and 
answer questions.
The board has responsibility for determining 
whether the annual report, taken as a whole, 
is fair balanced and understandable to enable 
shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy. 
In coming to its view, the board took into 
account its own knowledge of the group, 
its strategy and performance in the year, 
the guidance given to all contributors to 
the annual report and a detailed review by 
senior management of the overall content.
Other matters specifically considered 
during the year included property acquisitions 
and disposals, financing, taxation, risk 
management and key group risks, the approval 
of new long-term incentive arrangements, 
committee terms of reference and delegated 
authority limits.
Between meetings, as required, the board 
can be in frequent contact to progress the 
company’s business and, if necessary, board 
meetings can be held at short notice. Where 
possible, however, ad hoc committees of the 
board are appointed to deal with matters 
which it is known will need to be dealt with 
between scheduled board meetings. It is 
expected that all directors attend board 
and relevant committee meetings, unless 
they are prevented from doing so by prior 
commitments. If directors are unable to 
attend meetings in person or by telephone 
they are given the opportunity to be 
consulted and comment in advance 
of the meeting.
Board papers are circulated seven days 
prior to each board or committee meeting 
to ensure that directors have sufficient 
time to review them before the meeting. 
Documentation includes detailed management 
accounts, reports on current trading, reports 
from each business unit and main functional 
areas and full papers on matters where the 
board is required to give its approval. 
The chairman holds regular, informal 
meetings with the non-executive directors 
without the executive directors being 
present and the non-executives also meet 
with the chairman and the chief executive 
on an informal basis twice each year.
Board effectiveness
Board performance and evaluation
The board conducts an annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its 
committees and directors. This year the 
evaluation was undertaken internally, in 
the form of a detailed questionnaire that 
all directors were asked to complete and 
return to the chairman. The questionnaire 
covered a range of areas including questions 
on board structure and composition, 
strategy and financials, board processes, 
risks, the board’s committees and on 
corporate governance generally. Initial 
responses have been discussed by the 
chairman and the non-executive directors. 
A number of minor comments were raised, 
although none of any significance. In addition 
to the formal evaluation exercise there is 
an ongoing dialogue within the board to 
ensure that it operates effectively. Any matters 
raised are addressed in a timely manner.
The code requires an externally facilitated 
board evaluation to be performed every 
three years and for Greene King this will 
take place during the next financial year.
An appraisal of the chairman’s performance 
was undertaken by the senior independent 
director, Ian Durant, in conjunction with 
the renewal of the chairman’s appointment. 
Discussions were held with the other 
non-executive directors and with the chief 
executive and it was agreed to appoint the 
chairman for a further term of three years. 
The performance of the executive directors 
is reviewed annually by the remuneration 
committee in conjunction with their annual 
pay review and the payment of bonuses. 
Training and support
Each director is responsible for ensuring 
that they remain up to date in their skills 
and knowledge of the company, and the 
training needs of the board and its committees 
are regularly reviewed. Particular emphasis 
is placed on ensuring that directors are 
aware of proposed legislative changes in 
areas such as remuneration, corporate 
governance and financial reporting and 
sector-specific issues. All directors are also 
encouraged to visit the company’s pubs and 
restaurants and do so throughout the year.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT CONTINUED
Board effectiveness continued
Training and support continued
Newly appointed directors receive a tailored 
induction on joining the board to acquaint 
them with the company. This generally takes 
the form of meetings with other board 
members and senior management, and the 
provision of an induction pack containing 
general information on the company, its 
policies and procedures, financial and 
operational information and a briefing 
on directors’ responsibilities. 
There is an agreed procedure, set out 
in writing, for directors, in furtherance 
of their duties, to take independent 
professional advice at the company’s 
expense. Directors also have access to 
the services of the company secretary. 
The company has in place directors’ 
and officers’ liability insurance.
Commitment and conflicts of interest
All significant commitments which the 
directors have outside Greene King are 
disclosed prior to appointment and on an 
ongoing basis where there are any changes. 
The board is satisfied that each of the 
non-executive directors commits sufficient 
time to their duties and fulfils their 
obligations to the company.
The board has the right, under the articles 
of association, to approve potential situational 
conflicts of interest. A small number of such 
potential conflicts have been approved by 
the board following disclosure by certain 
directors, in each case with the relevant 
director not taking part in any decision 
relating to their own position. Directors 
are also aware that the disclosure and 
authorisation of any potential conflict 
situation does not detract from their 
requirement to notify the board separately 
of an actual or potential conflict in relation 
to a proposed transaction by the company. 
Communication with shareholders 
The board is keen to ensure that our 
shareholders have a good understanding 
of the business and its performance, and 
that the directors are aware of any issues 
or concerns which shareholders may have. 
Communication with shareholders takes 
a variety of forms.
Institutional shareholders 
and analysts
There is a regular dialogue with institutional 
shareholders, including meetings after the 
announcement of the year-end and interim 
results. Analysts are also invited to presentations 
at those times and separately to analyst trips 
to visit our premises and hear presentations 
on specific divisions of the business. The 
board receives regular reports and feedback 
on the meetings held between the executive 
directors and principal shareholders, and 
copies of analysts’ reports on the company. 
The senior independent non-executive 
director, Ian Durant, is available to shareholders 
if they have concerns about governance 
issues which the normal channels of contact 
fail to resolve. 
AGM
The AGM is fully utilised as a means 
of communicating directly with private 
shareholders, who receive a brief presentation 
on the business before the substantive part 
of the meeting begins. They also have the 
full opportunity to ask questions during the 
meeting and to meet directors and senior 
management informally after the meeting. 
The board aims to ensure that all members 
of the board, including in particular the 
chairmen of the board committees, are 
available to answer questions at the AGM. 
The notice of the AGM is sent to shareholders 
at least 20 working days before the meeting. 
All substantive items of business at shareholders’ 
meetings are dealt with under separate 
resolutions, including a resolution to adopt 
the report and accounts. The chairman 
announces the results of the proxy voting 
on each resolution after it has been dealt 
with on a show of hands. 
Website
The company maintains a website  
(www.greeneking.co.uk) to provide 
up-to-date, detailed information on the 
company’s operations and brands, which 
includes a dedicated investor relations section. 
All company announcements are available 
on this site, as are copies of slides used for 
presentations to investment analysts. We are 
happy to answer questions by telephone or 
e-mail (investorrelations@greeneking.co.uk 
or companysecretary@greeneking.co.uk).
Board committees
The board has established a nomination 
committee, a remuneration committee and 
an audit committee, each of which has formal 
terms of reference governing its method 
of operation. Each of the terms of reference, 
which have been approved by the board, are 
available on request or to download from 
the company’s website and will be available 
for inspection at the AGM.
DTR disclosure
The information required by DTR 7.2 
is set out in this report, the nomination 
committee report and the audit committee 
report, except for information required 
under DTR 7.2.6 which is set out in the 
directors’ report. Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 45

REPORT OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Membership
During the year the nomination committee 
was chaired by Tim Bridge. The other 
members of the committee were John Brady, 
Mike Coupe, Ian Durant and Lynne Weedall. 
Apart from the chairman, all members were 
considered by the board to be independent.
Responsibilities
The role of the nomination committee is to 
identify, evaluate and nominate candidates 
for appointment to the board, to review 
regularly the structure, size and composition 
(including skills, knowledge and experience) 
of the board and make recommendations to 
the board with regard to any adjustments 
that are deemed necessary. 
The committee is also responsible for 
considering the company’s succession plans 
for board members and senior management, 
taking into account the challenges and 
opportunities facing the company, and what 
skills and expertise are therefore needed on 
the board in the future, and for reviewing 
membership of the board’s committees to 
ensure that undue reliance is not placed 
upon any individuals.
Activities during the year
The committee met twice during the 
year. Attendance at these meetings by the 
committee members is shown in the table 
on page 43.
Matters considered by the committee 
during the year included board succession 
planning, committee composition, the board 
evaluation exercise, training requirements 
for directors, the committee’s terms of 
reference and the re-election of directors. 
The composition of the board’s committees 
was reviewed and it was decided to recommend 
to the board the appointment of Mike Coupe 
to membership of the remuneration committee 
with effect from 29 April 2014. 
On the recommendation of the nomination 
committee, and taking into account the 
continuing effective performance of the 
directors, the board has decided once again 
this year to ask all directors (apart from 
John Brady who retires on 27 July) to stand 
for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. 
The committee has also commenced the 
process of appointing a new non-executive 
director to take John Brady’s place on 
the board.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN 
OF THE COMMITTEE
“ I am pleased to introduce our audit committee report for 
2013/14 which explains the committee’s role in monitoring 
the group’s financial reporting, its internal controls and 
its risk management processes.”
Ian Durant
Chairman of the audit committee
A number of topics were considered by the 
committee during the year and the most 
significant are described below. The 
committee is cognisant of revisions to the 
UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
related Guidance on Audit Committees, 
both of which came into force for the past 
year and accordingly presents this report 
which focuses on matters of particular 
significance and relevance to Greene King.
Membership
The audit committee was chaired during 
the year by Ian Durant. The other members 
of the committee were John Brady and 
Mike Coupe. All members are considered 
by the board to be independent. The board 
is satisfied that Ian Durant has recent and 
relevant financial experience, as the former 
finance director of Liberty International plc, 
since renamed as Intu Properties PLC, and 
the current audit committee chairman at 
Home Retail Group plc. 
Responsibilities
The role of the audit committee is to review 
the group’s financial reporting, controls and 
risk management processes. This includes 
assessing the external audit conclusions on 
the full year and interim results, in each case 
prior to their submission to the board. The 
board undertakes the required assessment 
that the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and consequently does not 
ask the audit committee to advise it on this. 
The committee is responsible for reviewing 
the company’s internal control systems, 
advising the board on the appointment of 
external auditors, overseeing the relationship 
with the external auditors, and reviewing the 
quality and effectiveness of internal and 
external audit. It also regularly considers 
the company’s whistle blowing procedures. 
The committee also reviews the group’s risk 
management policies and procedures prior to 
submission to the board and receives detailed 
reports on the risk management processes 
within the business units and key functional 
areas. Regular updates are provided to the 
committee on regulatory, accounting and 
reporting developments under relevant 
financial standards and codes.
Operation of the committee
The committee met three times during the 
year. Attendance at these meetings by the 
committee members is shown in the table 
on page 43. On each occasion the finance 
director (or interim finance director) and 
senior members of the finance function 
attended, as well as the company secretary 
and head of risk. The external auditor 
attended all of the meetings. By rotation, 
operational managers present risk reports 
at audit committee meetings. There is an 
opportunity at each meeting for the committee 
to discuss matters privately with the auditor 
without management present. In addition, 
the chairman of the committee is in regular 
contact with the external audit partner to 
discuss matters relevant to the company. Details 
of the committee’s specific responsibilities 
and how the committee exercised those 
responsibilities are set out in the remainder 
of this report. The committee’s detailed terms 
of reference are available on the company’s 
website and these are reviewed and updated 
annually. In addition, the committee reviews 
critically its own performance annually, taking 
input from the external auditor, and assesses 
where improvements might be made.
Financial statements and audit
Before the start of the audit cycle, the 
committee reviewed the audit plan presented 
by the auditor and agreed the scope of the audit 
work. In reviewing the financial statements 
the committee reviewed the consistency of 
accounting policies on a year-to-year basis 
and across the group, and the methods used to 
account for significant or unusual transactions. 
It also reviewed the proposed accounting 
for the sale of 275 pubs to Hawthorn Leisure 
Limited, where contracts were exchanged 
prior to the year end and the sale completed 
after the year end, resulting in an impairment 
of £19.6m on disposal. The focus given by 
the auditor to matters relating to revenue 
recognition was also noted. Significant issues 
that the committee addressed in relation to 
the financial statements are set out in the table 
on page 47. The committee also reviewed 
management’s attestation paper setting out 
the information that had been provided to 
the auditor to enable it to form its opinion 
on the group’s financial statements and 
demonstrating that it was appropriate for 
the directors to make the representations 
set out in the letter of representation. 
Effectiveness of external audit
After the audit was completed a review of 
the effectiveness of the auditor and of the 
audit service was undertaken, supported 
by a questionnaire completed by the audit 
committee chairman, the group finance 
director, and a number of key members of the 
finance team involved in the preparation of 
the statutory accounts. The review covered the 
overall quality of the service, the audit partner 
and the audit team, and considered matters 
such as the management of the audit team, the  Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 47
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Effectiveness of external audit 
continued
quality of their challenge, insight and 
communications and the cost-effectiveness of 
the audit. The committee reviewed the 
feedback provided and, with further enquiry, 
including a review of the results of external 
quality inspections of Ernst & Young by the 
Audit Quality Review team of the Financial 
Reporting Council, satisfied itself as to the 
current quality of the audit service. The 
feedback was also provided to Ernst & Young. 
The issue of audit independence was also 
considered and is covered in more detail below.
External auditor – appointment
We last tendered our external audit contract 
in 1997 and Ernst & Young has been the 
company’s auditor since then, with an annual 
rolling contract and an annual shareholder 
vote at the AGM. It is required to rotate the 
audit partner responsible for the group and 
subsidiary audits every five years and the 
current audit partner was appointed in the 
autumn of 2011. The board’s current intention 
is to put the audit of the group and subsidiary 
accounts out to tender, with a view to any 
change taking effect for the 2016/17 statutory 
accounts, at the end of the current audit 
partner’s five-year term. It is, however, also 
aware and considering the implications of 
the transitional provisions in the EU 
regulation on audit matters, which would 
allow a further period of seven years before 
a change of audit firm was required.
The audit committee has established a 
policy in relation to the use of the auditor 
for non-audit work. The company will 
award non-audit work to the firm which 
provides the best commercial solution for 
the work in question, taking into account 
the skills and experience of the firm, the 
nature of the services involved, the level of 
fees relative to the audit fee and whether 
there are safeguards in place to mitigate to 
an acceptable level any threat to objectivity 
and independence in the conduct of the 
audit resulting from such services. 
Work estimated to cost in excess of £25,000 
is put out to tender unless agreed otherwise 
by the chairman of the audit committee. 
The finance director may approve specific 
engagements up to £50,000 (in aggregate 
up to £100,000 pa), and the chairman of the 
audit committee may approve engagements 
up to £100,000 (in aggregate up to £200,000 pa), 
with fees in excess of those limits being 
subject to approval of the full committee. 
During the year the company made limited 
use of specialist teams within Ernst & Young 
for non-audit work such as taxation support, 
primarily in relation to certain tax matters 
on which Ernst & Young specialists had 
originally advised, including an ongoing 
dispute with HMRC. The total fees paid to 
Ernst & Young during the year amounted to 
£420k, of which £87k related to non-audit work.
Particular consideration was given by the 
committee to the issue of auditor independence 
and objectivity, especially in the light of tax 
support being provided by Ernst & Young in 
relation to a matter in dispute with HMRC. 
It was noted that since 2005 Ernst & Young 
has not provided tax structure advisory 
services to the group and that this policy 
continues. The committee reviewed and 
debated a report from Ernst & Young in 
which it confirmed compliance with its own 
policies, procedures and ethical standards, 
including those of the Auditing Practices 
Board, in relation to auditor objectivity and 
independence. It also noted the use by the 
auditor of a separate tax audit team to audit 
the tax disclosures in the annual report and 
took account of the robust and challenging 
audit of the group’s financial statements 
more generally. The committee was therefore 
satisfied that auditor independence and 
objectivity was safeguarded and that it was 
appropriate to recommend to the board 
Ernst & Young’s re-appointment as auditor. 
This resolution will be put to shareholders 
at the AGM. 
The committee has in place a policy in 
relation to the appointment of former 
employees of the auditor by the group. The 
policy provides that audit partners will not 
be offered employment by Greene King or 
any of its subsidiary undertakings within 
two years of undertaking any role on the 
audit. Other key team members will not be 
offered employment by Greene King within 
six months of undertaking any role on the 
audit. Other audit team members who 
accept employment by Greene King must 
cease activity on the audit immediately they 
tender their resignation to the audit firm.
Significant issues considered by the audit committee in relation to the financial statements for 2013/14
MATTER CONSIDERED WHAT THE COMMITTEE DID
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Two detailed reports from management were considered by the committee on the 
methodology used to determine the extent of impairment required. The committee 
challenged the assumptions used, the range of pubs covered by the review and questioned 
management’s site-by-site reviews and likely timetable for disposals of non-core sites. 
The committee also discussed management’s proposals with the external auditor and took 
into account its views on assumptions used, reviewed market practice and consistency. 
As a result the committee concluded that an impairment of £22.0m was appropriate in 
relation to tangible fixed assets. As regards goodwill, it was determined that £6.4m should 
be written off in relation to disposals undertaken during the year and £14.6m written off 
in relation to the sale of the 275 pubs which took place after the year end.
Uncertain tax positions The committee reviewed in detail a number of uncertain tax positions which have not yet 
been agreed or are in dispute with HMRC. For each item the committee noted their current 
status and considered the views of the group’s advisers and independent counsel as to the 
most likely outcome in each case. Particular attention was paid to the largest of these, 
an internal funding arrangement undertaken in 2003/4, known as Sussex. The committee 
also discussed with the external auditor their detailed reports on the provisions and satisfied 
itself, as a result, that appropriate provisions were in place in respect of these uncertain 
tax positions. 
Funding headroom and covenants The committee reviewed the group’s funding headroom and covenants in conjunction with 
the review of the use of the going concern assumption. Management’s projections, assumptions 
and stress testing were reviewed and challenged, as were the extent to which mitigating actions 
would achieve the desired outcomes. The committee also sought and received assurances 
from the external auditor as to the work it had undertaken in relation to this issue.  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 48
Corporate governance
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE CONTINUED
Internal audit
The committee reviewed the company’s 
internal audit function, which previously 
focused primarily on the group’s Retail 
division. The committee supported 
management’s proposals to extend the remit 
of the internal audit function to cover more 
central functions and has, since the year 
end, agreed terms of reference and reviewed 
a proposal for how the internal audit team’s 
work will be reported to the committee as 
well as work undertaken in 2013/14. Under 
the terms of reference for the function, the 
internal audit team has direct access to the 
audit committee chairman to enable it to 
raise any significant issues.
Other matters
The committee reviewed, as it does on an 
annual basis, the group’s whistle blowing 
policy and its application across the business. 
The committee considered the issue of 
cyber security following publication of the 
government’s Cyber Security Framework 
in 2013 and will be keeping this issue under 
review during the course of 2014/15.
The terms of reference of the committee 
were also reviewed and updated during the 
year and an exercise was undertaken to 
assess the effectiveness of the audit 
committee itself. 
Internal control and risk 
management
The board has overall responsibility for 
the group’s risk management framework 
and systems of internal control and for 
reviewing their effectiveness, whilst the 
audit committee monitors and reviews 
those internal controls and risks on a 
regular basis and reports to the board on 
its findings. During the course of the year 
the committee reviewed in detail reports 
from a number of business units and 
functional areas on their respective risk 
management processes and key risks. 
Representatives of the relevant business 
unit or functional area attended those 
meetings to present the reports and 
answer questions from the committee. 
A summary of the risk management 
framework is set out on page 30. The risk 
management framework and internal 
control systems are designed to manage, 
and not to eliminate, the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives. They can provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that 
the group’s assets are safeguarded and that 
the financial information used within the 
business and for external reporting 
is reliable. 
The company has in place procedures to 
assess the key risks to which it is exposed 
and has formalised the control environment 
needed to address these and other issues. 
There are processes in place which accord 
with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee 
on internal control, and these remained in 
place up to the date of this report. The board 
is satisfied that there are no significant 
weaknesses in these systems.
The key elements of the internal control 
framework are:
 – the schedule of matters reserved 
for the board;
 – the group’s defined management 
structure with suitable authority limits 
and responsibilities, staffed by 
appropriate personnel;
 – regular updates for the board on strategy;
 – a comprehensive planning and financial 
reporting procedure, including annual 
budgets and a three-year strategic plan, 
both of which are reviewed and approved 
by the board; 
 – ongoing monitoring by both the board 
and senior management of performance 
against budgets, through the periodic 
reporting of detailed management 
accounts and key performance indicators;
 – ongoing monitoring by the board of 
compliance with financial covenants;
 – a centralised financial reporting system 
and close process, with controls and 
reconciliation procedures designed 
to facilitate the production of the 
consolidated accounts; 
 – clearly defined evaluation and approval 
processes for acquisitions and disposals, 
capital expenditure and project control, 
with escalating levels of authority 
(including board approval for major 
acquisitions and disposals), detailed 
appraisal and review procedures and 
post-completion reviews;
 – review of retail operational compliance 
by the retail internal audit team 
responsible and other analytical and 
control procedures facilitated by the 
EPOS till system; and
 – documented policies to cover bribery 
and whistle blowing and regular updates 
on any incidents. 
The group finance director has been on an 
extended leave of absence since March 2014 
for health reasons. The audit committee is 
satisfied that the arrangements put in place 
in his absence ensure appropriate leadership 
of the finance function and maintain 
effective levels of internal control. Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 49

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
ANNUAL STATEMENT
“ I am pleased to introduce our directors’ remuneration report 
for the 2013/14 financial year.”
Lynne Weedall
Chairman of the remuneration committee
In light of the new disclosure requirements 
relating to executive remuneration, our 
report has three sections:
 – this annual statement;
 – a section on our policies in relation to 
directors’ remuneration, which sets out 
the forward-looking remuneration policy 
for the company’s directors, which will 
operate from 5 May 2014; and
 – an annual report on remuneration, which 
provides details of how the policy will 
be operated for the 2014/15 financial 
year and of the remuneration earned 
by the directors in relation to the 
period ended 4 May 2014.
At the forthcoming AGM the directors’ 
remuneration policy will be subject to 
a binding shareholder vote, whilst the 
annual statement and the annual report on 
remuneration will be subject to an advisory 
shareholder vote. In future years, and in 
accordance with the relevant regulations, 
the directors’ remuneration policy will only 
be subject to a binding vote every three 
years (although if changes are made to the 
policy during a three-year period we will 
put the policy to a binding shareholder vote 
again), and the annual statement and the 
annual report on remuneration will be subject 
to an annual advisory vote. 
The remuneration committee undertook a full 
review of the company’s incentive arrangements 
last year in conjunction with the renewal 
of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), and 
carried out an extensive consultation with 
our major shareholders. As well as the 
changes to the LTIP arrangements we also 
introduced shareholding guidelines for our 
executive directors for the first time. We were 
pleased to receive strong shareholder support 
for both the remuneration report and the new 
LTIP scheme. 
This year the emphasis for the committee 
has been to ensure that the remuneration 
policy continues to both support and motivate 
our senior team whilst at the same time 
aligning them to the company’s strategic 
objectives and to achieving long-term growth 
for shareholders. No changes are proposed 
for 2014/15, as the committee is satisfied 
that basic salaries remain appropriately 
positioned in the market, that the structure 
and quantum of the annual bonus continues 
to be appropriate and aligned to shareholders’ 
interests and that the LTIP, with two forms 
of award with a three-year vesting period 
based on challenging earnings per share 
(EPS) and return on capital employed (ROCE) 
performance conditions, provides a strong 
alignment between the senior executives 
and shareholders. We also remain comfortable 
with the balance between fixed and 
variable remuneration.
During the past year there has been 
continued progress on our strategic 
priorities, as we increased the size of our 
retail estate and reduced that of our 
tenanted and leased estate. Profit before tax 
and exceptionals (PBTE) increased by 7.4%, 
the dividend by 6.8% and our share price by 
22% year on year. This strong performance, 
following equally encouraging results in 
previous years, means that the awards made 
under the LTIP three years ago will vest in 
full on the third anniversary of their grant 
this summer. The bonus outturn this year is 
97% of salary for the chief executive and 
90% of salary for the group finance director. 
We continue to exercise restraint in executive 
pay levels and salary increases for the 
executive directors will be a maximum of 
2.5% for this year, which is in line with the 
workforce generally.
We are happy to receive feedback from 
shareholders at any time in relation to our 
remuneration policies and hope to receive 
your support for the two resolutions referred 
to above at the forthcoming AGM.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
POLICY REPORT
This section of the report sets out Greene 
King’s future remuneration policy. Details 
of actual remuneration paid, LTIP awards 
made and the associated performance 
conditions are set out in the annual report 
on remuneration which starts on page 54.
Policy overview
The key objective of the company’s 
remuneration policy is to provide a 
remuneration structure that is aligned 
with shareholder interests and that enables 
the company to attract, motivate and retain 
talented and high quality individuals able 
to deliver continued growth of the business 
and achieve the group’s strategic aims. The 
remuneration package is designed to be 
competitive but not excessive and to contain 
an appropriate balance between fixed and 
variable remuneration and, for the variable 
remuneration, between short-term and 
longer-term performance. 
The committee has considered whether 
there are any aspects of the policy which 
could inadvertently encourage executives 
to take inappropriate risk and is satisfied 
that this is not the case. The committee 
has also ensured that the incentive 
structure for executive directors and senior 
management does not raise environmental, 
social or governance risks by inadvertently 
motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The committee is not proposing any material 
amendments to the company’s existing 
remuneration policy. Details of each 
element of remuneration, their purpose, 
link to strategy and their operation and 
performance metrics are set out below.

Salary
To recruit, reward and retain 
high calibre executives with 
an appropriately competitive 
base salary.
Base salaries are reviewed 
annually or when a change in 
responsibility occurs, to reflect 
the executive’s responsibilities, 
market value and sustained 
performance level. In setting pay 
levels, the committee considers 
current market practice and 
makes comparisons against 
a selection of other companies 
determined by reference to 
turnover, market capitalisation 
and operational details.
When reviewing base salaries, 
the committee is mindful of 
the gearing effect that increases 
in base salary will have on the 
potential total remuneration 
of the executive directors.
There is no prescribed 
maximum annual increase. 
The committee is guided by 
the general increase for the 
broader employee population 
but on occasions may need 
to recognise, for example, an 
increase in the scale, scope 
or responsibility of the role.

Annual performance bonus
T o incentivise executive directors 
to deliver superior performance 
during the course of a year , and to 
promote retention and stability 
amongst the senior management 
team. Performance measures and 
targets are designed to reinforce 
strategic priorities for the year .
Performance measures and 
targets are set at the beginning of 
each financial year to ensure that 
the measures and weightings 
are appropriate and support 
the business strategy. Bonuses 
are payable after the end of 
each financial year, based on 
performance against those targets. 
Bonuses are non-pensionable. 
A clawback mechanism applies 
in the event of a material 
misstatement of the group’s 
accounts, error or 
gross misconduct. 
A maximum of 100% of salary 
can be earned by the executive 
directors, with no bonus payable 
for below threshold performance 
and up to 75% of salary for target 
levels of performance. Payment 
of bonuses is dependent on a 
mixture of financial targets and 
specific personal targets. In 
relation to the financial targets, 
awards are made on a straight-
line basis for performance 
between threshold and target 
and on a separate straight-line 
basis for performance between 
target and maximum.
Performance is measured 
relative to challenging targets 
in key financial measures. Details 
of measures and weightings for 
the 2013/14 financial year and 
of the proposed measures and 
weightings for next year’s 
annual bonus, are set out in the 
annual report on remuneration 
on pages 54 to 60. An explanation 
of how the performance 
measures were chosen is 
given in the notes below.
Long-term incentive  
plan (“LTIP”)
To incentivise the executive 
directors to deliver superior 
levels of long-term performance 
for the benefit of shareholders, 
thereby aligning their interests 
with those of our long-term 
shareholders.
The committee normally 
makes an annual LTIP award, 
usually in the form of nil-cost 
options. The awards are 
subject to suitably stretching 
performance conditions set 
by the committee, which are 
reviewed annually. Awards 
normally vest on the third 
anniversary of grant, subject 
to performance, and will be 
exercisable until the tenth 
anniversary of grant. 
A clawback mechanism 
applies in the event of a 
material misstatement of 
the group’s accounts, error 
or gross misconduct. 
A maximum of 200% of salary 
can be awarded each year, 
100% as a core LTIP and 100% 
as a growth LTIP . Dividend 
equivalents will be paid on any 
shares that vest. 
The core LTIP will be subject 
to a suitably stretching EPS 
target and the growth LTIP 
to a suitably stretching 
ROCE target. Performance 
will normally be measured over 
a three-year period. Vesting 
will generally be subject 
to continued employment. 
The committee retains the 
discretion to scale back the 
vesting levels of the growth 
LTIP award in appropriate 
circumstances.  Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 51

All employee 
share schemes
All employees, including 
executive directors, have the 
opportunity to build their 
shareholding in a tax-efficient 
way by participating in the 
company’s HMRC approved 
sharesave scheme.
Employees are invited to 
participate in the sharesave in 
January each year provided that 
they have the requisite service.
The maximum saving under 
the sharesave scheme will be 
no more than HMRC approved 
limits, allowing employees to 
buy company shares at up to 
a 20% discount at the end 
of a three or five-year 
savings period.

Notes
1. A description of how the company intends to implement the policy set out in this table for 2014/15 is set out in the annual report on remuneration on page 60.
2.  The choice of performance metrics applicable to the annual bonus scheme reflect the committee’s belief that the compensation should be appropriately stretching, 
but achievable, and tied to both the delivery of profit growth, key financial metrics and specific individual objectives.
3.  The EPS performance condition underpinning the core LTIP award was selected by the committee on the basis that it would reward the delivery of long-term 
financial growth and is the most widely understood profit-based measure across the business. ROCE was chosen as the performance condition to apply to the 
growth LTIP award as it will ensure that management focuses on generating the necessary returns in excess of the cost of capital and because it provides a more 
strategic measure of long-term performance, where capital needs to be re-deployed in order to focus on Retail. The performance targets are set by the committee 
following a detailed review of the company’s projections and are believed to be appropriately stretching.
4.  The policy and practice for the remuneration of employees generally differs from that for the executive directors as follows:
 – A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity (or zero bonus opportunity) may apply to employees other than the executive directors and certain senior 
executives and targets may differ by business unit and by employee.
 – Other employees may be receive fewer or lower levels of benefits than those for executive directors. Company car benefits are only offered where required for the 
role or to meet market norms.
 – Pension contribution levels may be lower for employees generally compared with those for the executive directors.
 – Participation in the core LTIP is limited to the executive directors and around 40 senior managers. Participation in the growth LTIP is limited to an even smaller 
senior management population.
  These differences generally arise from the development of remuneration arrangements that are market competitive for various categories of employees. They also reflect 
the fact that, in the case of executive directors and senior executives, there is a greater emphasis on performance related pay.
5.  Subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, executive directors are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval 
and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in this report. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 52

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Approach to recruitment 
and promotions
The remuneration package for a new 
executive director would be set in accordance 
with the terms of the company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of 
recruitment. In particular, the annual bonus 
potential will be limited to 100% of salary 
and awards under the LTIP will be limited 
to 200% of salary.
In the case of an external hire, if required 
to secure an individual, the committee may 
offer additional cash and or share-based 
elements when it considers them to be in the 
best interests of the company, to take account 
of deferred remuneration forfeited by the new 
hire when leaving their former employer. 
Any such additional payments would be one-off 
in nature, would reflect where possible the 
nature, time horizons and performance 
requirements attaching to that forfeited 
remuneration and would be limited to 
the value of the forfeited remuneration.
For an internal promotion to executive 
director level, any variable pay element 
awarded in respect of the prior role may be 
allowed to pay out in accordance with its 
terms, adjusted as relevant to take into 
account the appointment. In addition, any 
other ongoing remuneration obligations 
existing prior to appointment may continue, 
provided that they are put to shareholders 
for approval at the earliest opportunity. 
For both external and internal appointments, 
the committee may agree that the company 
may meet certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses as appropriate.
Service agreements and exit 
payment policy
Newly appointed executive directors are 
offered a service agreement with a notice 
period of one year. In the event of the 
employment of an executive director being 
terminated, the committee would take into 
account the commercial interests of the 
company, pay due regard to best practice 
and apply usual common law and contractual 
principles, including the individual’s duty 
to mitigate their loss.
The payment of any annual bonus in respect 
of the year of termination is subject to the 
discretion of the committee, which may 
determine that an annual bonus is payable 
with respect to the period of the financial 
year served, but pro-rated for time served, 
and not paid until the normal due date for 
the payment of bonuses. 
The vesting of any LTIP awards will be 
governed by the rules of the LTIP. Awards 
will normally lapse unless the individual is 
considered a ‘good leaver’. An individual 
would generally be considered a ‘good 
leaver’ if they left the group’s employment 
by reason of death, injury, ill health, 
disability approved by the committee, or 
retirement, although the committee has the 
absolute discretion to treat any individual 
as a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason. In 
the case of a ‘good leaver’, payments would 
normally be scaled back to recognise the 
shorter period of service than the award 
was intended to cover and remain subject 
to outstanding performance conditions. 
Rooney Anand, whose employment with 
the company commenced on 6 August 2001, 
is subject to a one year notice period from 
the company. His terms of employment do 
not contain any additional terms relating to 
compensation for termination of employment. 
The terms of his appointment as chief executive 
were agreed and set out in a letter dated 
24 December 2004.
Matthew Fearn’s contract may be terminated 
by the company on giving one year’s notice, 
without any additional terms relating to 
compensation for termination of employment.
There are no obligations on the company 
contained within the existing directors’ 
contracts which would give rise to payments 
not disclosed in this report.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
This section of the report explains how Greene King’s remuneration policy has been implemented during the year.
The remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is appointed by the board. The members are Lynne Weedall (chairman), John Brady, Mike Coupe (appointed 
29 April 2014) and Ian Durant. All of the committee members are regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors. 
The role of the committee, as set out in its terms of reference (which are available on the company’s website), includes determining the 
remuneration policy for the executive directors, the chairman and certain members of senior management. It agrees total individual 
remuneration packages, considers the granting of awards under the long-term incentive plan and determines bonuses payable to the 
executive directors and certain senior executives.
It approves the service contracts of the executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination. 
The committee is made aware of, and takes into account, the salary levels of the wider senior management team and of the incentive 
arrangements operating throughout the company.
During the year there were three scheduled meetings of the committee. Attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on page 43.
Advisers to the remuneration committee
The committee seeks advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from New Bridge Street, a subsidiary of Aon plc. 
Aon plc provides insurance broking and consultancy services to the group. The committee is satisfied that the provision of these services 
does not in any way prejudice the position of New Bridge Street as independent advisers to the committee. Fees paid during the year to 
New Bridge Street in respect of advice to the committee were £33k. 
Rooney Anand, chief executive, attends meetings of the committee and provides advice to help the committee determine appropriate 
remuneration and incentive packages for the finance director and the other senior executives, but he leaves the meeting when his own 
remuneration is being discussed. The chairman of the board also attends meetings of the committee.
Shareholder voting at the 2013 AGM
The table below shows the results of the advisory vote on the 2012/13 directors’ remuneration report at the AGM held on 3 September 2013.

The tables below show the details of the total remuneration paid to each director in 2012/13 and 2013/14. A large proportion of the 
remuneration paid to Rooney Anand has resulted from the vesting of awards under the LTIP and specifically from the share price growth 
since the original date of grant, from which all shareholders have benefited.

Notes
1  Pension benefits for the executive directors generally comprised cash in lieu of pension contributions, save in respect of Matthew Fearn in 2012/13 when he received 
£36,000 cash in lieu of pension contributions and £31,000 was paid to his pension scheme.
2  In 2012/13, as well as the annual cash bonus payment, the figure shown also reflects the deferred share bonus scheme award. This is no longer being operated. 
In 2013/14 Matthew Fearn’s bonus was pro-rated to cover the ten months of the year when he was working, prior to his current illness.
3  Long-term incentives in 2013/14 comprised the value of the awards granted in August 2011, which will vest in August 2014 and which were subject to performance 
targets measured over the three years to May 2014. The value of the award has been calculated using 892p, being the average share price for the last quarter of the 
2013/14 financial year, and also takes into account the dividend equivalent payable on the award. 100% vesting of the 2011 awards has been assumed. For the 
long-term incentives in 2012/13 the actual share price on the date of the award has been used. The original value of Rooney Anand’s 2011 awards which will vest in 
August 2014 was £684k. The original value of the 2010 award which vested last year was £669k respectively. The remaining value of the awards has resulted from 
the share price growth and dividend notes equivalent payments from which all shareholders have benefited.
Details of the elements included in the table above are as follows:
Base salary
The base salaries for 2013/14 for Rooney Anand and Matthew Fearn, on a 52 week basis, were £540,600 and £341,000 respectively. 
The base fee for the chairman on a 52 week basis was £174,250. The base fees for the non-executive directors on a 52 week basis were 
£44,100 for John Brady and Mike Coupe and £51,250 for Ian Durant and Lynne Weedall. 
Taxable benefits
Taxable benefits were provided to directors in line with the policy table set out on page 51.
Pension-related benefits
Cash in lieu of pension contributions were in line with the policy table set out on page 51.
Annual bonus
Executive directors may earn bonuses depending on the company’s performance and their own individual performance. Awards for the 
chief executive were based 90% on financial performance and 10% on individual performance, whilst for the group finance director the 
respective percentages were 72.5% on financial performance and 27.5% on individual performance.
For the chief executive, the financial performance measures were based on PBTE and free cash flow, whilst the group finance director had an 
additional financial target based on return on investments. The committee has decided that disclosing specific short-term financial targets is 
inappropriate as it may give competitors an advantage if they were able to see our financial targets, although the 2013/14 targets will be 
disclosed in next year’s report. Both PBTE and free cash flow are among the group’s KPIs, details of which are on page 29. The return on 
investment measure comprised the return on investments undertaken during the year on sites within Greene King’s core Retail estate.  GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 56

2  The personal targets for Matthew Fearn included targets relating to corporate reputation and certain financial targets which have not been disclosed on grounds 
of commercial sensitivity.
Performance against the combined financial and individual targets resulted in bonuses being paid at £525k (97.1% of salary) for the chief executive 
and at £257k (90.3% of salary pro-rated down to 75.2% for 10 months’ service prior to his current illness) for the group finance director.
Long-term incentive plans
The LTIP award granted on 4 August 2011 was based on a three-year performance period ended 4 May 2014. A maximum of 60% of each award 
vests if an adjusted free cash flow target has been met and the remaining 40% vests if an EPS target has been met. The target ranges, calculated 
on a straight-line basis from 0% to 100%, are set out below.

Notes
1  The estimated value of the vested shares is based on the average share price during the three months to 4 May 2014 (892 pence). As explained in the single remuneration 
table above, a significant proportion of the estimated value of the LTIP award derives from the increase in the share price from which all shareholders have benefited.
2 The LTIP enables award holders to benefit from the payment of dividend equivalents but only to the extent that the underlying share awards vest. Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 57

4 Oct 13 Growth LTIP — 43,290 — — 43,290 May 2013 – May 2016
For the 2012 LTIP award, 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow target is met and 40% will vest if an EPS performance 
target is met. The target range for the adjusted free cash flow, which is calculated on a straight-line basis from 0% to 100% is £262.0m to 
£302.0m. The EPS target has been adjusted, at the discretion of the committee, to take into account the impact on earnings of the accelerated 
disposal of 275 pubs which completed shortly after the year end. The committee is satisfied that the adjustment is appropriate, and that the 
revised target would be a fairer measure of performance and is no more or less difficult to satisfy than the previous range. The target 
and the adjustments thereto are not disclosed due to their commercial sensitivity but will be disclosed on a retrospective basis.
For the 2013 core LTIP award, the EPS target has also been adjusted from the previously disclosed target range, at the discretion of the 
committee, to take into account the impact of the above mentioned disposal. There will be no vesting for EPS growth of 16% or less above 
a revised base of 51.5p, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for growth of 28% during the performance period above that base 
(2013: target range 12–24% above a base of 55.6p as restated for IAS 19R). The committee is satisfied that the adjustment is appropriate, 
and that the revised target would be a fairer measure of performance and is no more or less difficult to satisfy than the previous range.
For the 2013 growth LTIP award, there will be no vesting for ROCE of 9.1% or less, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting 
for ROCE of 9.8% at the end of the performance period.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION CONTINUED
Other information continued
Implementation of remuneration policy in 2014/15 continued
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will remain unchanged for 2014/15. The financial performance targets will continue to be based on group 
PBTE and free cash flow for both the chief executive (maximum weighting 75% and 15% respectively) and the group finance director 
(maximum weighting 50% and 15% respectively), with the group finance director also having a target based on return on investment 
(maximum weighting 15%). 
In addition the chief executive will have 10% of his bonus based on individual targets (including corporate reputation and succession 
planning), as in 2013/14, and the group finance director will have 20% based on individual targets (including corporate reputation 
and certain financial targets). 
The committee has decided that the bonus targets should not be disclosed prospectively due to commercial sensitivity. The committee 
expects to publish the performance targets once they have ceased to be commercially sensitive, in the 2015/16 annual report.
LTIP
The awards to be made in 2014 will be based on 200% of the director’s base salary (100% for the core LTIP and 100% for the growth LTIP), 
calculated by reference to the average closing prices on the three business days immediately prior to the date of the award.
The awards will vest three years after the date of the award, subject to continued employment within the group and dependent on performance 
over the three financial years to May 2017. There will be no vesting under the core LTIP award for EPS growth (from a base of 56.1p) of 22% or 
less, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for growth of 31%. For the growth LTIP award, there will be no vesting for ROCE of 9.4% 
or less, increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ROCE of 10.0%. The committee retains the discretion to scale back the vesting levels 
of the growth LTIP awards in appropriate circumstances. 
Chairman and non-executive directors’ fees
No changes are planned to the fees payable to the chairman or the non-executive directors in 2014/15, and there will be no changes to the 
benefits receivable by the chairman. Fees for the chairman and the non-executive directors will be reviewed again in 2015. Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 61

Share capital
Details of the authorised and issued share 
capital of the company, which comprises 
a single class of shares, ordinary shares of 
12½p, are set out in note 26 to the accounts. 
The rights attaching to the shares are set out 
in the articles of association. There are 
no special control rights in relation to the 
company’s shares and the company is not 
aware of any agreements between holders of 
securities that may result in restrictions on 
the transfer of securities or on voting rights.
A total of 735k ordinary shares, with 
an aggregate nominal value of £92k were 
allotted, for cash, during the period in 
connection with the company’s sharesave 
and executive option schemes. In addition 
a further 38k shares were acquired by the 
company to satisfy awards under the 
company’s deferred share option scheme.
The company makes regular use of the 
employee benefit trust (EBT) to satisfy the 
exercise of share options and will make market 
purchases of the company’s shares from time 
to time to ensure that it has sufficient shares 
to enable it to do so. During October 2013, the 
EBT made a single market purchase of a total 
of 200k shares at a total price of £1,546k. 
The share price was 771.3p per share.
Voting rights
In a general meeting of the company, on 
a show of hands, every member who is 
present in person or by proxy and entitled 
to vote shall have one vote. On a poll every 
member who is present in person or by 
proxy shall have one vote for every share of 
which they are the holder. The AGM notice 
gives full details of deadlines for exercising 
voting rights in respect of resolutions to be 
considered at the meeting.
Under the Free4All Employee Profit Share 
Scheme, participants are the beneficial 
owners of the shares but not the registered 
owners. The registered owner is the trustee, 
Killik & Co Trustees Ltd. The trustee will 
invite participants to direct it on the 
exercise of any voting rights attaching to 
the shares held under the scheme by the 
trustee on the participants’ behalf. The 
trustee will only be entitled to vote on a 
show of hands if all directions received 
from participants are identical. The trustee 
is under no obligation to call for a poll. In 
the case of a poll, the trustee will follow the 
directions of the participants.
No voting rights will be exercised in respect 
of any own shares.
Transfer of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer 
of shares in the company other than those 
which may from time to time be applicable 
under existing laws and regulations (for 
example under the Market Abuse Directive). 
In addition, pursuant to the Listing 
Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, 
directors of the company and persons 
discharging managerial responsibility 
are required to obtain prior approval 
from the company to deal in the company’s 
securities, and are prohibited from dealing 
during closed periods.
Change of control
All of the company’s share incentive plans 
contain provisions relating to a change of 
control and full details of these plans are 
provided in the directors’ remuneration 
report. Outstanding options and awards 
would normally vest and become exercisable 
on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, 
if applicable, at that time.
The group’s banking facility agreements 
contain provisions entitling the counterparties 
to exercise termination or other rights in 
the event of a change of control. Certain 
of the company’s trading contracts also 
contain similar provisions.
There are two employees who, on a change 
of control of the company resulting in the 
termination of their employment, would be 
entitled to compensation for loss of office. 
However, in the context of the company as 
a whole, these agreements are de minimis.
Articles of association
The company’s articles of association may 
only be amended by special resolution at 
general meetings of shareholders. 
Appointment and replacement 
of directors
The number of directors on the board 
shall be no less than five nor more than 12. 
Directors may be appointed by the company 
by ordinary resolution or by the board 
of directors. A director appointed by the 
board of directors holds office until the 
next following AGM, and is then eligible 
for election by the shareholders. GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 62

Directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity insurance
The group has taken out insurance to 
indemnify, against third party proceedings, 
the directors of the company whilst serving 
on the board of the company and of any

Details of events occurring after the year 
end are set out in note 32.
Directors’ statement as to disclosure 
of information to the auditor
The directors who were members of the board 
at the time of approving the directors’ report 
are listed on page 40. Having made enquiries 
of fellow directors and of the company’s 
auditor, each of these directors confirms that:
 – to the best of each director’s knowledge 
and belief, there is no information 
relevant to the preparation of their 
report of which the company’s auditor 
is unaware; and
 – each director has taken all the steps 
a director might reasonably be expected 
to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish that 
the company’s auditor is aware of 
that information.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position, 
are set out in the chief executive’s review. The 
financial position of the group, its cash flows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are 
described in the financial review. In addition, 
note 24 to the financial statements includes 
the group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing its capital; its financial risk 
management objectives; details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and 
its exposure to credit and liquidity risk. 
The directors are of the opinion that the 
group’s forecast and projections, which take 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance, and its stress testing 
to take account of expected payments in 
respect of uncertain tax positions show that 
the group should be able to operate within 
its current borrowing facilities and comply 
with its financing covenants. 
After making enquiries, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the company 
and the group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the annual report 
and financial statements.
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP has expressed its 
willingness to continue in office and a 
resolution to re-appoint the firm as the 
company’s auditor will be proposed at 
the AGM.
Annual general meeting 
The AGM will be held at 12 noon 
on Tuesday 10 September 2014 at 
the Millennium Grandstand, Rowley 
Mile Racecourse Conference Centre, 
Newmarket, Suffolk. The notice of the 
AGM is set out in the separate circular 
to shareholders. 
The directors consider that all of the 
resolutions set out in the notice of AGM are 
in the best interests of the company and its 
shareholders as a whole. The directors will 
be voting in favour of them and unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour 
of each of them.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENTS
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of 
the group financial statements 
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the group financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union.
Under company law the directors must 
not approve the group financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they present 
fairly the financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows of the group 
for that period. In preparing those group 
financial statements the directors are 
required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies in 
accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and 
Errors and then apply them consistently;
 – present information, including 
accounting policies, in a manner that 
provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 – provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the group’s financial position and 
financial performance; 
 – state that the group has complied with 
IFRSs, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial 
statements; and
 – make judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the group and enable them to ensure that 
the group financial statements comply with 
the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Statement of directors’ 
responsibilities in respect of the 
parent company financial statements
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the strategic report, the directors’ report 
and the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. Company 
law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that 
law the directors have elected to prepare the 
financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the directors must not 
approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and 
fair view of the state of affairs of the company 
and of the profit or loss of the company for 
that period. In preparing those financial 
statements, the directors are required to:
 – select suitable accounting policies 
and then apply them consistently;
 – make judgments and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent;
 – state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 – prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is appropriate 
to presume that the company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are 
sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the company and enable them to ensure 
that the company financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
Directors’ responsibility statement
The directors confirm, to the best 
of their knowledge:
 – that these financial statements prepared 
in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by 
the European Union, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit of the parent company 
and undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; 
 – that the annual report, including the 
strategic report, includes a fair review 
of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the 
company and undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face; and
 – having taken into account all matters 
considered by the board and brought to 
the attention of the board during the year, 
the directors consider that the annual 
report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable. The directors believe 
that the disclosures set out in this annual 
report provide the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.

Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the group financial statements: 
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 4 May 2014 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and 
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
What we have audited
We have audited the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 which comprise the group income 
statement, group statement of comprehensive income, group balance sheet, group cash flow statement, group statement of changes 
in equity and the related notes 1 to 33. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 63, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an 
opinion on the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all 
the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired 
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report. 
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We identified the following risks that we believe to have had the greatest impact on our overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources 
in the audit and directing the efforts of the audit team: 
 – Asset impairment considerations in relation to the pub estate and associated goodwill;
 – Risks relating to uncertain tax positions;
 – Compliance with debt covenants;
 – Revenue recognition in relation to beer and liquor sales and the associated retrospective discounts; and 
 – Risk of management override of internal control, specifically with reference to revenue recognition. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit 
and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement 
we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable 
person, relying on the financial statements, would be changed or influenced. 
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material 
for the financial statements as a whole. We determined materiality for the group to be £8.8m (2013: £8.4m), which is approximately 5% of 
pre-tax profit. On the basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our judgment 
is that overall performance materiality for the group should be 75% of materiality, namely £6.6m (2013: £6.3m). Our objective in adopting 
this approach is to reduce to an appropriately low level the total undetected and uncorrected audit differences such that they do not exceed 
our materiality of £8.8m (2013: £8.4m) for the financial statements as whole.
We agreed with the audit committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of £400,000 (2013: £400,000), 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT (GROUP)
To the members of Greene King plc Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 65
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
An overview of the scope of our audit 
The group’s operations are based solely in the United Kingdom and therefore all audit procedures are completed by one audit team based 
in the head office location working across both the group and subsidiary financial statement audits.
Full scope audit procedures are completed for all divisions both trading and corporate which contribute to the group’s results for the year. 
The audit work on these divisions was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual division, which were lower than group 
planning materiality. 
Our response to the risks of material misstatement identified above was as follows: 
 – Asset impairment – we have challenged the assumptions used in the impairment models prepared by management, including checking 
of calculations, discussions with management’s internal property experts, verification to third party evidence or our own property 
specialists and undertaking a sensitivity analysis.
 – We have involved tax specialists in the audit of uncertain tax positions. These procedures included the consideration of correspondence 
with HMRC, assessment of technical analyses prepared by the group’s tax advisers and the appropriateness of the judgments applied.
 – In testing the group’s compliance with banking covenants and procedures in relation to going concern assessment we have obtained copies 
of the bank agreements and re-performed covenants calculations based on audited information. We have challenged management’s going 
concern assessment and considered the accuracy of the forecasts and level of headroom available to the group within committed facilities. 
reviewed management’s stress testing of forecasts.
 – We have performed detailed substantive testing over revenue recognition (including the timing of revenue recognition, proof of delivery, 
the assessment of collectability and accounting for rebate agreements), substantive analytical review procedures and an assessment 
of whether the revenue recognition policies adopted complied with IFRS. 
 – We carried out analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to identify and test the risk of material fraud arising from 
management override of control. 
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the group financial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
 – materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 – apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the group acquired in the course 
of performing our audit; or 
 – is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the annual 
report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 – the directors’ statement, set out on page 62, in relation to going concern; and 
 – the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 
and on the information in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited.

GROUP STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY
For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 71
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
1 Accounting policies
Corporate information
The consolidated financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 were authorised for issue by the board of 
directors on 2 July 2014. Greene King plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The company’s 
shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Statement of compliance
The group’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by 
the EU as they apply to the financial statements of the group for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 (prior year 52 weeks ended 28 April 2013) 
and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to 
companies reporting under IFRS. They are presented in pounds sterling, with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand, except 
where otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Greene King plc, its subsidiaries and its related party, 
Greene King Finance plc. Greene King Finance plc is a special purpose entity set up to raise bond finance for the group, which is consolidated 
as a quasi-subsidiary. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company with 
adjustments made to their financial statements to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the group.
The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, apart from the changes arising from the adoption 
of new accounting standards set out below:
The Group applied, for the first time, certain standards and amendments that require restatement of previous financial statements. 
These include amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 19 Employee Benefits (Revised 2011).
IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income (amendments to IAS 1)
The amendments to IAS 1 introduce a grouping of items presented in other comprehensive income. Items that could be reclassified 
(or recycled) to profit or loss at a future point in time, for example net gains on cash flow hedges taken to equity, are now presented 
separately from items that will never be reclassified, for example actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes. 
The amendment has affected the presentation of the consolidated statement of comprehensive income but has had no impact 
on the group’s financial position or performance.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits (revised 2011)
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has been applied retrospectively from 30 April 2012 with comparatives restated for the impact of its adoption. 
The standard replaces interest costs and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount 
rate to the net pension liability/asset. The impact of IAS 19 (revised 2011) on the current and comparative period is shown in note 9.
IAS 19 (revised) has been applied retrospectively, with the following permitted exceptions:
 – the carrying amounts of other assets have not been adjusted for changes in employee benefit costs that were included before 28 April 2012; and
 – sensitivity disclosures for the defined benefit obligation for the comparative period have not been provided.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IFRS 13 applies prospectively for financial periods that began on or after 1 January 2013 and establishes a single source of guidance under 
IFRS for all fair value measurement. IFRS 13 does not change when an entity is required to use fair values, but rather provides guidance on 
how to measure fair value under IFRS when fair value is required or permitted and extends the disclosures required in respect of fair value 
measurement. The standard defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly 
transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The default risk, i.e. the entity’s own credit risk, must also be 
reflected in the fair value of a liability. The implementation of IFRS 13 has resulted in a non-significant adjustment to the fair value of derivatives. 
Significant accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost or deemed cost on transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold and long leasehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up 
to 50 years, and short leasehold improvements are depreciated to their estimated residual values over the shorter of the remaining term 
of the lease or useful life of the asset. Residual value is reviewed at least at each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if 
residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value. Plant and equipment assets are depreciated over their estimated lives which range 
from three to 20 years.
Residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed for all categories of property, plant and equipment and adjusted, 
if appropriate, at each financial year end.
An item of property, plant and equipment is de-recognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. 
Profit or loss on de-recognition is calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, 
and is included in the income statement in the year of de-recognition.

Business combinations and goodwill 
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of 
the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. 
The choice of measurement of non-controlling interests, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable 
net assets, is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are taken to the income statement.
When the group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation 
in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the 
separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred to the vendor will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration which are deemed to be an asset or a liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 
either in the income statement or in other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be 
re-measured until it is finally settled within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred 
and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in exchange for the business combination. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions separate to the business combinations, 
such as the settlement of pre-existing relationships or post-acquisition remuneration arrangements, are accounted for separately from the 
business combination in accordance with their nature and applicable IFRSs. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal 
or separability criterion, are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised 
if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.
If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling 
interest is lower than the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held 
in the business acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment
Individual assets are grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows 
independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is an indication of impairment. If an indication exists, the group makes 
an estimate of the recoverable amount of each asset group. An asset’s or cash-generating unit’s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair 
value less costs to sell and value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
An impairment loss is recognised where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of assets. If there is an indication that any 
previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, a reversal of the loss may be made only if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amounts since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying 
amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount only up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, 
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. 
Impairment losses and any subsequent reversals are recognised in the income statement.
Details of the impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment are provided in note 14.
Goodwill
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of 
the group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective 
of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is allocated 
represents the lowest level within the group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and cannot be larger than 
an operating segment before aggregation.
Impairment is determined by the recoverable amount of an operating segment. Where this is less than the carrying value of the operating 
segment an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. This loss cannot be reversed in future periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, any goodwill associated 
with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the 
operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion 
of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill amortised prior to the conversion to IFRS on 3 May 2004 has not been reinstated and the net book value of goodwill at that date 
has been carried forward as the carrying value. Prior to May 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves. Such goodwill has not been 
reinstated and is not included in determining profit or loss on disposal.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised 
when the group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 73
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Financial assets
Financial assets are classified as either financial assets at fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity 
investments or available-for-sale financial assets. The group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and, 
where appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year end.
The group makes trade loans to publicans who purchase the group’s beer. Trade loans are non-derivative and are not quoted in an active 
market and have therefore been designated as ‘Loans and receivables’, carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and 
losses are recognised in income when the loans and receivables are de-recognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any individual trade loan is impaired. If there is evidence that an impairment loss 
has been incurred, the amount of loss is measured as the difference between the loan’s carrying amount and the expected future receipts, 
(excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred), discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised 
in operating profit.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recorded at their original invoiced amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts when collection of the full 
amount is no longer considered probable.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Raw materials are valued at average cost. Finished goods and work 
in progress comprise materials, labour and attributable production overheads where applicable, and are valued at average cost.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of 
three months or less. For the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined 
above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Property, plant and equipment held for sale
Property, plant and equipment is classified as held for sale only if it is available for sale in its current condition, management is committed 
to the sale and a sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification. Property, plant and 
equipment classified as held for sale is measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and is no longer 
depreciated or amortised.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the income statement using the effective interest method. Finance income is recognised in the income 
statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent 
measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge 
accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include the 
group’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged. 
The group also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine 
whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability), or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction). The group uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedge accounting
The effective portion of the gain or loss on an interest rate swap is recognised directly in equity, whilst any ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period that the financial income or expense is recognised, 
unless the hedged transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability whereby the amounts are transferred to the 
initial carrying amount of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, amounts previously 
recognised in equity are held there until the previously hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Trade payables
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value. Financial statements

Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that 
an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value, where the effect of the time value of money is material, using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market estimates of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amortisation of the discount is 
recognised as a finance cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits
Defined benefit pension schemes
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes which require contributions to be made into separately administered 
funds. The cost of providing benefits under the schemes is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial 
method on an annual basis. The current service cost is charged to operating profit. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full 
in the group statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
When a settlement or curtailment occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are re-measured and the resulting gain or loss 
is recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recorded in the group income statement.
The defined benefit asset or liability recognised on the balance sheet comprises the present value of the schemes’ obligations less the fair 
value of scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are restricted to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The cost of the group’s defined contribution pension schemes amounts to the value of contributions made. Contributions are charged 
to the income statement as they become payable.
Post-employment healthcare benefit
The group also provided certain additional post-employment healthcare benefits to employees which are unfunded. 
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange for shares or rights over 
shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted are measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which they were granted. 
No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market conditions 
(performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an employee 
to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions 
are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an employee 
expense with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled ending on the relevant 
vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an expense reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, adjusted for the 
estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. The periodic charge or credit is the movement in the 
cumulative position from beginning to end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest provided vesting is not conditional on market or non-vesting conditions. 
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in calculating earnings per share figures.
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The group has an employee benefit trust for the 
granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares 
is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. No gain 
or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Revenue
Generally, revenue represents external sales (excluding taxes) of goods and services, net of discounts. Revenue is recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and is measured at the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding 
discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes or duty relating to brewing and packaging of certain products. Revenue principally consists of 
drink, food and accommodation sales, which are recognised at the point at which goods or services are provided, rental income, which 
is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and machine income, where net takings are recognised as earned.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership are classified as operating leases. Lease payments 
are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease premiums paid on entering into or acquiring operating leases represent prepaid lease payments and are held on the balance sheet as 
current (the portion relating to the next financial period) or non-current prepayments. These are amortised on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term.

Taxes
Income tax
The income tax charge comprises both the income tax payable based on profits for the year and the deferred income tax. It is calculated 
using taxation rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured at the amount expected to be recovered 
from or paid to the taxation authorities.
Income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided for using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets 
and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences except where the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting 
profit nor taxable profit or loss or, in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing 
of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the 
foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax losses only to the extent that 
it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax 
losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow 
the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured, on an undiscounted basis, at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are defined as items of income or expense which, because of their nature, size or expected frequency, merit separate 
presentation to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the period.
New standards and interpretations not applied
As at the date of approval of the financial statements there are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and IFRIC 
with an effective date after the date of these financial statements and which have not been early adopted by the group. These are expected 
to be applied as follows:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments was first issued in November 2009 and has since been amended several times. The standard will eventually 
replace IAS 39 and covers the classification, measurement and de-recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, together with a 
new hedge accounting model. The IASB intends to expand IFRS 9 to add new requirements for impairment and for it to become a complete 
replacement of IAS 39 for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The adoption of the first phase of IFRS 9 will have an effect on 
classification and measurement of the group’s financial assets, but will not have an impact on classification and measurement of financial 
liabilities. The group will quantify the effect in conjunction with the other phases, when the final standard including all phases is issued.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 10 replaces the portion of IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements. It also addresses the issues 
raised in SIC-12 Consolidation — Special Purpose Entities, which resulted in SIC-12 being withdrawn. IFRS 10 changes whether an entity 
is consolidated by revising the definition of control and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. There is no 
impact on the group’s financial position of performance as a result of the introduction of this standard.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities
The new standard, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014, sets out the required disclosures for 
entities reporting under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 that were previously included in IAS 27, IAS 28 and IAS 31. The standard includes disclosure 
requirements for all forms of interest in other legal entities, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles 
and other off-balance sheet vehicles. The impact on the group is on disclosure in the consolidated financial statements only, where 
summarised information may need to be provided.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and establishes a comprehensive framework for determining 
when to recognise revenue and how much revenue to recognise. The core principle in that framework is that a company should recognise 
revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the 
company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard was published in May 2014 and the impact of its 
introduction has yet to be assessed by the group. Financial statements

Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting 
policies that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense. The group bases its estimates and judgments on historical 
experience and other factors deemed reasonable under the circumstances, including any expectations of future events. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions considered to be significant are detailed below.
Taxation
Judgment is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot be finally determined 
until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Assumptions are also made around the assets which qualify for capital 
allowances and the level of disallowable expenses and this affects the income tax calculation. Provisions are also made for uncertain exposures 
which can have an impact on both deferred and current tax. Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be 
obtained and tax provisions are made if it is possible that a liability will arise. The final resolution of these transactions may give rise to 
material adjustments to the income statement and/or cash flow in future periods. The group reviews each significant tax liability or 
benefit each period to assess the appropriate accounting treatment.
Share-based payments
Judgment is required when calculating the fair value of awards made under the group’s share-based payment plans. Note 8 describes the 
key assumptions and valuation model inputs used in the determination of these values. In addition estimates are made of the number of 
awards that will ultimately vest; judgment is required in relation to the probability of meeting non-market based performance conditions 
and the continuing participation of employees in the plans.
Pension liabilities
The present values of pension liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and depend on a number of actuarial assumptions which are 
disclosed in note 9. Any change in these assumptions will impact on the carrying amount of pension liabilities. Note 9 describes the key 
assumptions used in the accounting for retirement benefit obligations.
Impairment of goodwill
The group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis. Details of the tests and carrying value of the assets are 
shown in note 13. This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Value-in-use 
calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a 
suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. If the actual cash flows are lower than estimated, future 
impairments may be necessary.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED
For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014 Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 77
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The group determines whether property, plant and equipment is impaired where there are indicators of impairment. This requires an 
estimation of the value in use at a site level. Value-in-use calculations require assumptions to be made regarding the expected future cash 
flows from the cash-generating unit and choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. 
Note 14 describes the assumptions used in the impairment testing of property, plant and equipment together with an analysis of the 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions.
Residual values
Residual values of property are determined with reference to current market property trends. If residual values were lower than estimated, 
an impairment of asset value and reassessment of future depreciation charge may be required. Useful lives are reassessed annually which 
may lead to an increase or reduction in depreciation accordingly.
Property provisions
The group provides for its onerous obligations under operating leases where the property is closed or vacant and for properties where 
rental expense is in excess of income. The estimated timings and amounts of cash flows are determined using the experience of internal 
and external property experts. However, changes to the expected method of exiting from the obligation could lead to changes in the level 
of provision recorded.
2 Segment information
The group has determined the following three reportable segments that are largely organised and managed separately according to the 
nature of products and services provided, brands, distribution channels and profile of customers: 
Retail: Managed pubs and restaurants 
Pub Partners: Tenanted and leased pubs
Brewing & Brands: Brewing, marketing and selling beer
These are also considered to be the group’s operating segments and are based on the information presented to the chief executive who is 
considered to be the chief operating decision maker.
Transfer prices between operating segments are set on an arm’s length basis.

Exceptional operating costs
On 1 May 2014 the group announced the disposal of 275 non-core pubs from our Pub Partners estate; this disposal completed on 2 June 2014. 
An impairment charge totalling £34.2m has been recognised as a result of this disposal: £19.6m in respect of the carrying value of the 
assets and a charge of £14.6m relating to the impairment of goodwill allocated to these sites.
During the period the group has recognised an impairment loss of £22.0m (2013: £17.7m) in respect of its licensed estate. The impairment 
has been recognised in respect of pubs where the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell has fallen below the net book value. 
During the period ended 2 May 2010 the group received a refund of £7.0m from HMRC in respect of VAT on gaming machines following 
a ruling involving the Rank Group plc that the application of VAT contravened the EU’s principle of fiscal neutrality. HMRC appealed 
the ruling, issuing protective assessments to recover the VAT in the event its appeal was successful. On 30 October 2013 the decision was 
overturned and the group was therefore required to repay the VAT of £7.0m and associated interest of £1.7m in the period. On 16 April 2014 
the Supreme Court granted Rank permission to appeal which is likely to be heard in early 2015.
In the period, the group received insurance compensation to meet the costs of restoring fire-damaged sites totalling £3.4m (2013: £0.8m). 
Further amounts are receivable as the projects progress.
Acquisition costs in the prior year were in respect of amounts payable, two years post acquisition and subject to the future profitability 
of the businesses, to the former owners of Cloverleaf Restaurants and Realpubs, who remained employees of the group. 
Following the closure of the group’s defined benefit pension schemes to future accrual an exceptional credit of £8.4m was recognised in the 
prior year. This comprised a gain of £10.1m in respect of past service accruals no longer being linked to future salary growth less £1.7m 
of implementation costs and fees.
The net loss on disposal of property plant and equipment of £6.4m (2013: £5.4m loss) comprises a total profit on disposal of £8.0m (2013: £6.9m) 
and a total loss on disposal of £14.4m (2013: £12.3m). The loss on disposal includes £6.4m (2013: £4.5m) in respect of goodwill allocated 
to parts of operating segments disposed of in the year. The other loss on disposal of £1.3m relates to the loss on disposal of an investment 
in the prior year.
Exceptional finance costs
The £1.1m fair value gain is the mark-to-market movement on the ineffective element of cash flow hedges resulting from changes 
in the LIBOR yield curve.
Exceptional tax
The tax credit in respect of the licensed estate arisen from movements in their tax base cost, including the impact of indexation.
The Finance Act 2013 reduced the rate of corporate tax from 23% to 21% from 1 April 2014 and to 20% from 1 April 2015. The lower rate 
of 20% has been used to determine the overall net deferred liability as the temporary differences are expected to reverse at the lower rate. 
The effect of the lower rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net £9.1m, comprising a credit to the group income statement 
of £18.8m and a debit to the group statement of comprehensive income of £9.7m.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ income tax arises from finalising the tax returns for earlier periods including tax relief for 
capital expenditure and repairs and reversal of tax relief previously taken on intra-group transactions.
The adjustment in respect of prior periods’ deferred tax arises from finalising the tax returns and also deferred tax on revaluation 
and rolled over gains on the licensed estate.

8 Share-based payment plans
The group operates three types of share-based payment arrangements: a senior management long-term incentive plan (LTIP/growth LTIP), 
a deferred share scheme for other management and a general employee share option plan (SAYE). In prior periods a deferred bonus scheme 
and an executive share option plan (ESOS) have also been operated.
The general terms of each plan are detailed in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 49 to 60. All are equity settled. 
The total charge recognised for the period arising from share-based payment transactions including National Insurance contributions 
is £6.0m (2013: £5.0m). A corresponding credit of £4.4m (2013: £3.9m) has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of the LTIP/growth LTIP issued in 2014 is considered to be equal to the share price on the date of issue. 
The fair value of equity-settled options issued in prior years was estimated using a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the grants 
and model inputs used to calculate the fair values of grants during the period was as follows:
2014 SAYE 
Weighted average share price 865p
Exercise price 701p
Expected dividend yield 3.3%
Risk-free rate of return 0.6%
Volatility 21.6%
Expected life (years) 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 163p
2013 LTIP SAYE 
Weighted average share price 596p 708p
Exercise price — 505p
Expected dividend yield 4.5% 3.8%
Risk-free rate of return 0.2% 0.6%
Volatility 23.8% 22.0%
Expected life (years) 3.0 3.3
Weighted average fair value of grants in the year 521p 168p
Risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with the same life as the expected option life. Expected volatility 
is based on historical volatility of the company’s share price which assumes that the past trend in share price movement is indicative of 
future trends. Expected life of options has been taken as the mid-point of the relevant exercise period. This is not necessarily indicative 
of future exercise patterns. 
No other feature of the equity instruments granted was incorporated into the fair value measurement. Financial statements

The options and shares granted under the LTIP are at nil cost; therefore the weighted average exercise price for rights outstanding 
at the beginning and end of the period, granted, forfeited and exercised during the period is £nil (2013: £nil).
ESOS, SAYE and LTIP
Options were exercised on a range of dates. The weighted average share price through the period was 841p in 2014 and 607p in 2013.
The rights outstanding at 4 May 2014 under the LTIP had an exercise price of £nil (2013: £nil) and a weighted average remaining 
contractual life of 1.3 years (2013: 1.3 years). 
The outstanding options for the ESOS scheme had an exercise price between 408p and 528p (2013: 332p and 528p) and for the SAYE 
scheme between 274p and 701p (2013: 274p and 505p).
The weighted average remaining contractual life was 1.1 years for the ESOS (2013: 1.8 years) and 2.8 years for the SAYE scheme (2013: 2.8 years).
Deferred share bonus scheme
In the prior period selected senior executives participated in a deferred share bonus scheme. Awards made under this scheme are based on 
a percentage of salary and are paid in shares. Awards are made to eligible employees on the achievement of corporate targets and vest once 
required service periods are completed.
During the year 0.04m (2013: 0.05m) shares were purchased to fulfil awards made in 2012/2013 (2011/2012) under this scheme.

9 Pensions
The group maintains two defined contribution scheme, which are open to all new employees, and two defined benefit schemes. 
The group also has a past service liability in relation to post-employment medical benefits offered to employees to cover any medical costs 
after employment. This benefit is no longer given to employees.
Defined contribution pension scheme
Member funds for the defined contribution schemes are held and administered by the Friends Life Group. The total cost recognised 
in operating profit for the period was £4.4m (2013: £2.2m).
Defined benefit pension schemes and post-employment benefits
The group maintains the following defined benefit schemes which are all closed to new entrants and were closed to future accrual during 
the prior year. All schemes have had full actuarial valuations in the last three years: Greene King Pension Scheme (last valued as at 5 April 2012) 
and Belhaven Pension Scheme (last valued as at 4 May 2011). During the year the Hardys & Hansons Pension Scheme merged with Greene 
King Pension Scheme. 
Member funds for the defined benefit schemes are held in separate funds independently of the group’s finances and are administered 
by pension trustees. Pension benefits are related to members’ final salary at the earlier of retirement or closure to future accrual and 
their length of service.
Since the pension liability is adjusted for the changes to consumer price index, the pension plan is exposed to inflation, interest rate risks 
and changes in the life expectancy for pensioners. As the plan assets include significant investments in quoted equity shares of entities in 
manufacturing and consumer product sector, the Group is also exposed to equity market risk arising in the manufacturing and consumer 
products sector.
IAS 19 (revised 2011) restatement
IAS 19 (revised 2011) has been applied retrospectively from 30 April 2012. As a result, expected returns on pension schemes’ assets are 
no longer recognised in profit or loss. Instead, net interest on the net defined benefit obligation calculated using the discount rate used 
to measure the pension liability is recognised in profit or loss.
The impact on the current and prior years’ consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and earnings 
per share is as follows. There is no impact on the consolidated balance sheet or consolidated cash flow statement.

Expected pension payment increases 3.3% 3.1%
Rate of inflation (RPI) 3.6% 3.2%

Factors that may affect future tax charges
The Finance Act 2013 reduced the rate of corporation tax from 23% to 20% from 1 April 2015. The effect of these changes is to reduce 
the net deferred tax liability by £9.1m, comprising a credit to the group income statement of £18.8m and a debit to the group statement 
of comprehensive income of £9.7m (as explained in note 5).

Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of £96.1m (2013: £95.4m) by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period (excluding own shares held) of 217.2m (2013: 216.1m). 
Diluted earnings per share has been calculated on a similar basis taking account of 1.1m (2013: 1.3m) dilutive potential shares under option, 
giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares adjusted for the effect of dilution of 218.3m (2013: 217.4m). There were no (2013: nil) 
anti-dilutive share options excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation. The performance conditions for share options 
granted over 2.6m (2013: 2.8m) shares have not been met in the current financial period and therefore the dilutive effect of the number 
of shares which would have been issued at the period end has not been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. 
Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items and is presented to show the underlying performance of the group 
on both a basic and diluted basis.

All goodwill was purchased as part of business combinations. As from 3 May 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer 
amortised but is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill has been allocated to operating segments, the lowest group of cash-generating units in the group at which goodwill is monitored 
internally, based on the extent that the benefits of acquisitions flow to that segment.
Goodwill disposed of in the year is the amount of goodwill allocated to parts of operating segments disposed of during the year. The amount 
disposed is calculated based on the relative value of the operation disposed and the portion of the operating segment retained. 
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated £353.5m (2013: £353.8m) to Retail, £135.8m (2013: £156.5m) to Pub Partners and £214.5m 
(2013: £214.5m) to Brewing & Brands.
The recoverable amount of each segment was determined on a value-in-use basis, using cash flow projections based on one year budgets 
approved by the board, and in all cases exceeded the carrying amount. 
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are budgeted EBITDA, the pre-tax discount rate and the growth rate used 
to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budgeted period.
Budgeted EBITDA is based on past experience adjusted to take account of the impact of expected changes to each cash-generating unit’s 
pub estate or operations, sales prices and volumes, capital expenditure, business mix and margin. 
Cash flows are discounted at 9.0% (2013: 9.0%) which is used as an approximation for the risk-adjusted discount rate of the relevant 
operating segment. A growth rate of 2.0% (2013: 2.0%) has been used to extrapolate cash flows. The growth rate is considered a 
conservative rate and is below the long-term average growth rate for the industry. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The calculation is most sensitive to changes in the assumptions used for budgeted cash flow, pre-tax discount rate and growth rate. 
Management considers that reasonable possible changes in assumptions would be an increase in discount of 1% point, a reduction in 
growth rate of 1% point or a 10% reduction in budgeted cash flow. As an indication of sensitivity, when applied to the value-in-use

Valuation
The licensed estate properties were valued by the group’s own professionally qualified chartered surveyors, as at 20 December 2003, 
on the basis of existing use value, in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors’ Appraisal and Valuation Standards. 
A representative sample of properties was also valued by external valuer Gerald Eve Chartered Surveyors and Property Consultants, 
who confirmed that the values were consistent with their appraisal. Frozen revaluation has been taken as deemed cost on the transition 
to IFRS; therefore no historic cost analysis is provided.
Up to 1999 the brewery and depots were valued at depreciated replacement cost and other properties at open market value. These valuations 
have been retained but they have not been updated. Subsequent additions have been included at cost or, in the case of acquisitions, 
at fair value.
Charges over assets
Included in land and buildings are properties with a net book value of £1,422.1m (2013: £1,437.7m) over which there is a first charge 
in favour of the securitised debt holders as detailed in note 23.

Impairment of property, plant and equipment
During the year £41.6m of impairment losses (2013: £19.3m) were recognised in the income statement as exceptional costs. The impairment 
includes a £19.6m charge in relation to the sale of the disposal group as discussed in note 5.
£1.6m of the impairment recognised in the prior year within the Retail estate was in respect of licensed properties damaged by fire. 
In the period the group has received £3.4m (2013: £0.8m) of insurance compensation to meet the costs incurred to date of restoring these 
properties; further compensation is expected to be received as the restoration projects progress.
These are analysed between the group’s principal reporting segments as shown below:

Retail 3.5  3.8 
Pub Partners 18.5  15.5 
Pub Partners in respect of disposal group (note 5) 19.6 —
41.6 19.3 
The group considers that each of its individual pubs is a cash-generating unit (CGU). Each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators 
of impairment. When indicators of impairment are identified the carrying value of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of the CGU’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used are the discount rate applied to cash flow 
projections of 9% (2013: 9%) and the projected cash flows extrapolated using an average growth rate of 2% (2013: 2%) which is below the 
long-term average growth rate for the industry. Other commercial assumptions relating to individual CGUs have been made based on 
historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of medium-term trading prospects.
Estimates of fair value less costs to sell are based on valuations undertaken by in-house property experts.
The impairment in respect of the disposal group has been calculated based on expected net disposal proceeds. 
The remaining impairment charge recognised in the Retail and Pub Partners estates are primarily the result of the reduced trading 
performance of a relatively small number of pubs due to a combination of site-specific trading circumstances and the general weakening 
of the UK consumer environment seen in the year. 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
The level of impairment is predominantly dependent upon judgments used in arriving at fair values, future growth rates and the discount 
rate applied to cash flow projections. The impact on the impairment charge of applying different assumptions to fair values, the growth 
rates used to calculate cash flow projections and in the pre-tax discount rates would be as follows:

Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are utilised for the day to day management of cash. The group has facilities of £25.0m (2013: £25.0m) available with interest 
linked to base rate.
Bank loans – unsecured
In the year the group increased and extended a five-year revolving credit facility of £460m (2013: £400m), of which £276.6m (2013: £177.9m) 
was drawn down at the year end. Any amounts drawn down bear interest at a margin above LIBOR, with commitment payments on the 
undrawn portions. Interest is payable at each renewal date which vary in maturity. Although any individual draw-downs are repayable 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the group expects to renew this funding. Immediate renewal is available under the £460m 
facility until June 2018. Final repayment of the total drawn-down balance is due as one payment on the agreement repayment date.
Liquidity facility
During the current period the standby liquidity facility provider had its short-term credit rating downgraded below the minimum prescribed 
in the relevant facility agreement and as such the group exercised its entitlement to draw the full amount of the facility and hold it in a 
designated bank account. The corresponding balance of £157.5m (2013: £nil) held in this bank account is included within cash and cash 
equivalents. The amounts drawn down can only be used for the purpose of meeting the securitisation’s debt service obligations should there 
ever be insufficient funds available from operations to meet such payments. As such these amounts are considered to be restricted cash. 
Securitised debt
The group has issued various tranches of bonds in connection with the securitisation of 2,035 of the group’s pubs held in Greene King 
Retailing Limited at the date of the most recent tap. The bonds are secured over the properties and their future income streams and were 
issued by Greene King Finance plc.

Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Repayment of nominal is made by quarterly instalments, in accordance with the repayment schedule, over the period shown above. 
Payment of interest is made on quarterly dates for all classes of bond. All of the floating rate bonds are fully hedged using interest rate swaps.
The Class A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 bonds rank pari passu in point of security and as to payment of interest and principal, and have preferential 
interest payment and repayment rights over the Class B bonds. The Class B1 and B2 bonds rank pari passu in point of security, principal 
repayment and interest payment.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Greene King Retailing Limited, 
a group company. These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability 
to move cash to other group companies.
24 Financial instruments
The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business 
needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group. If appropriate, the group uses financial 
instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, 
cash and short-term deposits. Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, 
payables and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group’s operations 
and financing sources. No speculative trading in derivative financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks from the group’s financial instruments are cash flow risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The policy for 
managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk
Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group’s borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying 
debt. The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising 
from the floating rate instruments. The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged. 
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure. The swaps are designated as cash flow hedges at the date of contract 
included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every six months.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in 
interest rates. This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest 
rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 4 May 2014 and 28 April 2013. The analysis relates only to balances at these 
dates and is not representative of the year as a whole. The following assumptions were made:
 – Balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits 
does not change as interest rates move.
 – Gains and losses are recognised within equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies of the group.
 – Cash flow hedges were assumed to be effective or ineffective on the same basis as those as at the year end. An explanation for the split 
between those hedges that were effective at the year end and those that were ineffective is detailed within the cash flow hedging note.
Based on the group’s net position at the year end, a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would change the group’s profit before tax 
by approximately £0.6m (2013: £0.2m) and the group’s equity by £81.0m (2013: £106.1m). 
Liquidity risk
The group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt. 
The group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank 
loans. The group also monitors the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
The standard payment terms that the company has with its suppliers is 60 days following month end (2013: 60 days following month end).
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than one month. Short-term 
flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets. Financial statements

Credit risk
The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to regular credit verification 
procedures. Receivable balances are also monitored on an ongoing basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the 
exposure to bad debts to a non-significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans and cash. Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation 
and the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging
At 4 May 2014 the group held four (2013: four) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £170m (2013: £140m), designated as a hedge 
of the cash flow interest rate risk of the £276.6m (2013: £177.8m) draw down from the variable credit facility in the year. The interest rate 
swaps are held on the balance sheet as a fair value liability of £23.4m (2013: £4.0m). The cash flows occurred semi-annually based a 
variable rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 4 May 2014 the group held five (2013: five) interest rate swap contracts for a nominal value of £585.1m (2013: £667.9m), entered into as 
part of the securitisation and subsequent securitisation taps. A fair value liability of £149.0m (2013: £235.2m) has been recognised on the 
balance sheet in respect of these contracts which are designated cash flow hedges against £585.1m (2013: £667.9m) of variable rate bonds, 
receiving a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a weighted average fixed rate of 7.3% (2013: 5.1%). The contract maturity 
dates are December 2034 and March 2036. The bonds and interest rate swaps have the same critical terms excluding credit risk.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective. Following repurchase 
of the £60.0m AB1 the cash flow hedge in respect of this bond has ceased to be effective and hedge accounting has been discontinued. In the 
prior year an exceptional cost of £28.2m was recognised in respect of the fair value of the interest rate swap no longer qualifying for hedge 
accounting which has been recycled from equity to the income statement. The remaining interest rate swaps have been assessed as highly 
effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over their remaining contract lives.
The percentage of debt that was fixed as at the year end was 95.5% (2013: 98.6%) in line with the group’s policy of fixing at least 95% of all debt.

The interest on variable rate financial instruments is repriced at intervals of less than one year. The interest on fixed rate financial instruments 
is fixed until the maturity of the instrument. Investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables are not included above 
as they are non-interest bearing and are not subject to interest rate risk.
Fair values
Set out in the table on page 98 is a comparison of carrying amounts and fair values of all of the group’s financial instruments.
The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current 
transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale. The following methods and assumptions were used to 
estimate the fair values:
Cash and cash equivalents (comprising cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits) – approximates to the carrying amount stated 
in the accounts.
Financial assets – these are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and fair value is deemed to be the same as this.
Short-term loans and overdrafts – approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term loans – based on quoted market prices in the case of the securitised debt; approximates to the carrying amount in the case 
of the floating rate bank loans and other variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps – calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date and adjusting for, 
where appropriate, the group’s and counterparty credit risk. The changes in credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness 
assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships. Financial statements

Hierarchical classification of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value
IFRS 13 requires that the classification of financial instruments at fair value be determined by reference to the source of inputs used 
to derive fair value. 
The classification uses the following three-level hierarchy:
Level 1 – unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
During the periods ending 4 May 2014 and 28 April 2013 there were no transfers between levels 1, 2, or 3 fair value measurements.
Capital risk management
The group aims to maximise shareholder value by maintaining a strong credit rating and a core level of debt which optimises the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC) and shareholder value.
A number of mechanisms are used to manage debt and equity levels (together referred to as capital), as appropriate in the light of economic 
and trading conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return 
capital to shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the period.
The group monitors capital using interest cover and several other measures including fixed charge cover, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
and free cash flow debt service coverage. Interest cover is calculated by dividing operating profit before exceptional items by net finance 
costs before exceptional items (note 7). For the period to 4 May 2014 interest cover was 3.0x (2013: 2.9x). The board’s dividend policy 
is to maintain a minimum dividend cover of two times adjusted basic earnings per share.

Share premium represents the excess of proceeds received over the nominal value of new shares issued.
Capital redemption reserve 
Capital redemption reserve arose from the purchase and cancellation of own share capital, and represents the nominal amount of the share 
capital cancelled.
Hedging reserve
Hedging reserve adjustments arise from the movement in fair value of the group’s derivative instruments used as an effective hedge, in line 
with the accounting policy disclosed in note 1. Amounts recycled to income are included within finance costs in the income statement.
Own shares 
Own shares relates to shares held in treasury, held by the employee benefit trust or purchased to fulfil awards made under the deferred 
share bonus scheme. At 4 May 2014 0.53m shares (2013: 0.69m) were held in treasury, 0.55m shares (2013: 1.06m) were held by the 
employee benefit trust and 0.04m (2013: 0.05m) were held to fulfil awards under the deferred share bonus scheme. The market value 
at 4 May 2014 of the treasury shares was £4.6m (2013: £4.9m), of the shares held by the employee benefit trust was £4.8m (2013: £7.5m) 
and of the shares held for the deferred share bonus scheme was £0.3m (2013: £0.3m). 
The employee benefit trust is independently managed and has purchased shares in order to satisfy outstanding employee share options and 
potential awards under the long-term incentive plan.
At the year end 0.39m (2013: 0.55m) treasury shares and 0.31m (2013: 0.44m) shares in the employee benefit trust were allocated to meet 
awards under the long-term incentive plan.
A transfer of £4.7m (2013: £4.0m) from own shares to retained earnings has been made to reflect transfers to satisfy awards under the 
long-term incentive plan and options exercised under the executive share option plan and reflects the weighted average cost of own shares.
During the period 0.04m (2013: 0.05m) shares were repurchased at a cost of £0.3m (2013: £0.3m) to fulfil awards made under the deferred 
share bonus scheme with 0.04m shares transferred to individuals to satisfy awards. The employee benefit trust purchased 0.20m shares 
(2013: 0.45m) at a cost of £1.6m and 0.70m (2013: 0.79m) shares were transferred to satisfy awards under the long-term incentive plan.
Goodwill
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions made prior to May 1998 amounts to £89.7m. Financial statements

GREENE KING PLC Annual report 2014 www.greeneking.co.uk 102
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014 which comprise the 
parent company balance sheet and the related notes 34 to 42. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 63, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies 
we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 – give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 4 May 2014;
 – have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 – have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 – the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 – the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 – adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
 – the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 – certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
 – we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial statements of Greene King plc for the 53 weeks ended 4 May 2014.

NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS
For the fifty-three weeks ended 4 May 2014
34 Accounting policies
Basis of accounting and presentation
The accounts are prepared on a going concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting and financial 
reporting standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of 
derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Changes in accounting policy
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost less impairment and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet. The carrying value of 
investments is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, 
with the following exceptions: 
 – Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation (and similar fair value adjustments) of fixed assets, and gains on disposal 
of fixed assets that have rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement 
to dispose of the assets concerned. However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, 
it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement 
assets are sold. 
 – Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable 
taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences 
reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are de-recognised 
when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash 
flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The company is exempt, in accordance with FRS 29.2D, from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain 
disclosure that complies with FRS 29 (IFRS 7).
Finance costs and income
Finance costs are expensed to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are not capitalised. Finance income 
is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs. After initial recognition, 
interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability. Subsequent measurement 
is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the 
gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception. Documentation must include 
the company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being 
hedged. The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis 
to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value (hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability) or cash flow (hedging the 
variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability or forecast transaction). The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
For these cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the profit and loss account. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the profit and loss account when 
the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. 
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are then transferred to the profit 
and loss account as above. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit and loss. Annual report 2014 GREENE KING PLC www.greeneking.co.uk 105
Corporate governance Strategic report Financial statements
Own shares
Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust. The company has an employee benefit trust 
for the granting of shares to applicable employees. 
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from equity shareholders’ funds. Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such 
shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
Share-based payments
Certain employees and directors of subsidiary companies receive equity-settled remuneration, whereby they render services in exchange 
for shares or rights over shares. The fair value of the shares and options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes model, at the date at which 
they were granted. No account is taken in the fair value calculation of any vesting conditions (service and performance), other than market 
conditions (performance linked to the price of the shares of the company). Any other conditions that are required to be met in order for an 
employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered non-vesting conditions. Like market performance, non-vesting conditions are 
taken into account in determining the grant date fair value. The fair value of shares and options granted is recognised as an increase in the 
company’s investments in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in equity spread over the period in which the performance conditions 
are fulfilled ending on the relevant vesting date. The cumulative amount recognised as an investment reflects the extent to which the 
vesting period has expired, adjusted for the estimated number of shares and options that are ultimately expected to vest. 
In accordance with the exemption within FRS 20 no amount is recorded in respect of grants made under the above schemes prior 
to 7 November 2002 which had not vested by the date of implementation of FRS 20.
Related party transactions
In accordance with FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures the company is not required to disclose transactions with its wholly owned subsidiaries.
35 Profit for the period
No profit or loss account is presented for the company as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The profit after tax for the 
period is £10.6m (2013: £10.0m profit).
36 Auditor’s remuneration
Auditor’s remuneration in respect of the company audit was £16,300 (2013: £16,300).
37 Directors’ remuneration and employee costs
Details of directors’ remuneration is contained in the directors’ remuneration report on pages 54 to 60. The company has no employees 
other than directors and the directors are not remunerated through this company. Details of share options issued by the company are given 
in note 8 to the group accounts.
The directors do not believe that it is practicable to apportion these amounts between their services as directors of the company and their 
services as directors of other group companies.

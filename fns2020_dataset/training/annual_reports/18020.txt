Capco FTSE 350 Real Estate Index
Capco has delivered another year of strong performance. Since its 
listing in 2010, the business has grown consistently , delivering 
market-leading total returns for its shareholders. Through this 
time the management team has proven the strategy , invested in a 
unique skillset and deepened Capco’s culture. 
The business retains a strong focus on two prime locations in 
central London, Covent Garden and Earls Court. We have a clear 
strategy and in 2014 signiﬁcant milestones were achieved across  
the business. The Board spends considerable time monitoring the 
changing risk proﬁle of the business to ensure that the strategy 
continues to be appropriate.
The balance sheet remains conservative with low gearing and high 
liquidity , strengthened by our new debt facilities including a US 
Private Placement and a successful equity raise which allowed 
Capco to accelerate value creation across the business. 
Covent Garden continues to thrive as a distinct and vibrant part of 
London. The valuation increased by £284 million to £1.6 billion, a 
25 per cent increase on a like-for-like basis driven by strong leasing 
and investment activity over the year. The redevelopment of Kings 
Court, our largest development to date at Covent Garden, 
commenced in October and we have further expanded our footprint 
through £167 million of acquisitions on the estate. 
Earls Court Properties saw positive momentum over the year and 
the valuation increased by 18 per cent on a like-for-like basis to  
£1.2 billion. The Earls Court Masterplan remains a vital residential 
regeneration project for London in a key opportunity area. An  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 7 
investment vehicle with Transport for London (“TfL”) was 
established early in the year to enable the development of EC1 & 
EC2 and detailed planning consents were achieved within the 
overall Earls Court Masterplan area. At Lillie Square, our joint 
venture launched its ﬁrst phase successfully and construction has 
started on a development that will deliver over 800 new homes in 
this popular and desirable part of London.
Olympia London has had a positive year following our investment 
and re-launch. Over 80 per cent of shows transitioned from Earls 
Court, which closed at the end of 2014. 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS
In 2014, Capco delivered strong performance with a total return  
of 25 per cent which represents the growth in net assets plus the 
dividends paid during the year. The valuation of the Group’s 
property assets increased by 22 per cent on a like-for-like basis and 
total shareholder return, which reﬂects the share price change and 
dividends paid, was 12 per cent. 
The Directors are proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 1.0 pence per share, 
which brings the total dividend paid and payable for 2014 to 1.5 
pence per share. 
I would like to thank Capco employees for their commitment and 
hard work during a year in which they continued to generate 
excellent performance and results for our shareholders.  
THE BOARD
The Board has taken the opportunity to review the Group’s 
Executive structure to reﬂect the growth and evolution of the 
business over the past ﬁve years. Covent Garden and Earls Court 
Properties have reached a scale where they would beneﬁt from 
speciﬁc leadership to reach their potential. As a result Gary Yardley 
and Soumen Das are promoted to the role of Managing Director 
with responsibility for the oversight and investment performance 
of Earls Court & Olympia and Covent Garden respectively in 
addition to their existing responsibilities. Gary’s title will be 
Managing Director & Chief Investment Officer and Soumen’s title 
will be Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer. Both Directors 
will continue to report to Ian Hawksworth, Chief Executive. I 
would like to congratulate both Directors on their new 
responsibilities. Their appointments reﬂect the growing needs of 
our business and our commitment under Ian’s continued vision 
and leadership to deliver long-term outstanding performance for 
our shareholders. These changes will take effect on 1 March 2015. 
The Board has been active in planning Board succession to match 
the future needs of the Company with a diverse set of skills, style 
and experience. As we recently announced, Andrew Huntley will  
be retiring from the Board at our forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting (“AGM”), and will step down from the Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees on 1 March 2015. The Board and I would 
like to thank Andrew for his contribution to the Board since its 
establishment in 2010. We will be welcoming Gerry Murphy as a 
Non-executive Director on 1 March 2015. Gerry is a former partner 
of Deloitte LLP , and brings a broad range of experience to the 
Board. A description of our recruitment process, which will 
continue in early 2015, is set out in the Nomination Committee 
report on page 64.
TALENT AND DIVERSITY
The Board is committed to developing talent and diversity within 
the business, a key focus because of the increased span of activities 
undertaken by Capco. In Capco’s ﬁrst ﬁve years we have seen that 
investment in talent and skills brings strategic advantage. We are 
proud that Capco has a diverse management team, and the Board 
Capco Chairman Ian Durant and Creative Director Bev Churchill speak at South 
Tyneside College to support the 30% Club, an initiative committed to achieving better 
gender balance in business
encourages the development of future talent. In support of this,  
I, and a number of our Directors, have personally mentored 
individuals as part of Capco’s leadership development programmes. 
The Board will continue to support such initiatives.
DELIVERING VALUE RESPONSIBLY
How we conduct our business in the communities and 
environments in which we operate forms an important part of our 
culture. As long-term stewards of some of the best addresses in 
London, we have a strong commitment to creating public value and 
delivering with integrity . Already at Lillie Square we are starting to 
deliver apprenticeships as the ﬁrst part of our commitment to 
training and skills in the local area. At Olympia London we are 
proud to be leading the events industry by representing the UK  
on the committees developing the international standards in 
sustainable events management. Our employees remain committed 
and engaged with our Corporate Responsibility programme, 
supporting worthwhile projects that maximise opportunities for 
young people where our assets are located. 
LOOKING AHEAD
London is a leading global city and continues to be a magnet for 
people and investment. Despite the uncertainty which may arise 
from the upcoming General Election, we are conﬁdent that 
London’s strengths and popularity will allow it to thrive and 
prosper and our strategy to drive long-term value from our assets 
remains clear and focused. Capco has a deep understanding of 
London and our assets are uniquely well-placed both to beneﬁt 
from and contribute to London’s continued success and world-class 
status. We enter 2015 well positioned to deliver value for our 
shareholders and for London.

Chief Executive’s review
2014 was another year of signiﬁcant progress for Capco. The 
business performed strongly delivering a total return of 25 per cent, 
underpinned by a clear and focused strategy to drive value creation 
at Covent Garden and Earls Court. 
The successful equity raise in May provided the business with 
additional ﬂexibility to accelerate value across the business which  
is demonstrated in these results today . Our overall aim is to provide 
long-term market-leading returns for our shareholders, through 
our distinct approach to creating places. 
Our balance sheet remains robust, with a conservative loan-to-value 
ratio of 12 per cent. Following a restructuring of our bank facilities 
and a successful US Private Placement, our cost of debt has reduced 
to 3.4 per cent and we have moved to a predominantly unsecured 
debt model at Covent Garden. 
Over the last ﬁve years Capco’s business has grown from a total 
property value of £1.2 billion to over £3.0 billion. To ensure we have 
the capacity and capabilities to drive continued performance from 
our growing estates, Gary Yardley and Soumen Das’ responsibilities 
will expand to include Managing Director roles with responsibility 
for oversight and investment performance at Earls Court Properties 
& Olympia and Covent Garden respectively . Their appointments 
highlight the depth of knowledge and expertise that they both 
bring to the Group and their new responsibilities will support me 
in delivering the strategy we have in place for Capco. 
London – a global and growing city
London is a global and growing city . Its economic prospects are 
strong and according to the London Plan, published by the Greater 
London Authority (“GLA”), the Capital’s population is expected to 
grow by two million by 2031. For London to continue to thrive and 
provide, it needs more places for people to live, work and enjoy . 
Covent Garden and Earls Court are two of the Capital’s greatest 
addresses and are well placed to succeed against this backdrop of 
growth. Our approach to creative asset management at Covent 
Garden will continue to ensure its success as a vibrant destination 
for retailers, visitors and residents while the Earls Court Masterplan 
is a unique opportunity to provide thousands of new homes, 
creating the new great estate of London.
Valuations
The Group has beneﬁted from strong valuations following positive 
performance across the business. The property portfolio is valued at 
£3.0 billion as at 31 December 2014, having grown by 21.9 per cent 
on a like-for-like basis over the year. 
Covent Garden – a leading global destination 
Covent Garden has reinforced its position as a leading global 
destination. Our creative approach to managing and investing in 
our estate continues to attract premium brands and the district’s 
vibrancy continues to attract quality footfall.
The estate experienced its strongest year of performance since 
Capco’s listing in 2010 as our consistent and successful 
DELIVERING VALUE THROUGH

repositioning strategy is now embedded across the estate. The 
estate is valued at £1.6 billion as at 31 December 2014, delivering  
a like-for-like increase of 24.5 per cent over the year. We achieved 
record new lettings, with ERV up 13.7 per cent on a like-for-like 
basis to £75.1 million. The initial yield is 2.5 per cent and the 
equivalent yield is 3.7 per cent.
Following a very strong year of lettings progress and a positive 
outlook for rental growth, we are conﬁdent that we will be able to 
grow the value and prominence of our estate. Our ability to drive 
superior rental growth through our distinct approach to managing 
Covent Garden gives us conﬁdence to increase the ERV guidance  
to £100 million by 2017 . This represents a continued underlying 
growth rate of circa 10 per cent, in line with the last ﬁve years and 
would imply an ERV of £125 million by December 2019.
Covent Garden is now an important destination for contemporary 
luxury and dining brands looking for a premium location in 
London. This demand for well-managed prime space has seen a new 
Zone A rental level of £1,000 achieved on James Street, a new record 
level for the estate. In addition, our creative asset management 
strategy , where every street has a plan, has seen the introduction of 
brands including Bobbi Brown, Clinique and Nigel Cabourn as well 
as The Ivy Market Grill.
It has been a year of signiﬁcant investment activity on the estate  
as we have expanded our footprint in this prime area with 
acquisitions totalling £167 million. We have a solid pipeline of 
opportunities ahead of us. We are on site and works are underway 
for the redevelopment of Kings Court. The scheme will improve the 
ﬂow of footfall on the estate and unlocks the opportunity to extend 
our place-making approach to Floral Street.  
Earls Court – a central London ‘Opportunity Area’ 
The valuation of Capco’s interests at Earls Court, represented by 
Earls Court Properties, has grown positively in the year to £1.2 
billion. This represents an increase of 17 .9 per cent over the year on  
a like-for-like basis beneﬁting from Capco’s value creation strategy 
though planning, land assembly and land enablement, as well as 
positive market conditions in London.

The Earls Court Masterplan continues to advance. Our investment 
vehicle with TfL over EC1 & EC2 was successfully established and 
works started in December for the demolition of these buildings, 
further de-risking the land in this part of the scheme. Earls Court 
Village, which relates to two-thirds of the EC1 & EC2 area, received 
detailed planning consent and the Empress State Building received 
detailed consent for residential conversion.
Lillie Square, the ﬁrst opportunity to bring new residential product 
to the Earls Court Masterplan area, was successfully launched last 
spring and established a positive pricing benchmark for the area,  
as its central location, connectivity and premium speciﬁcation 
generated high demand. The ﬁrst phase is now substantially sold.
The Earls Court Masterplan is a unique opportunity to create a new 
estate in central London. The masterplan is in one of the GLA ’s 
opportunity areas, making it a strategic scheme for London and 
received formal outline planning consent in 2013. Against a backdrop 
of London’s rapidly growing population and its housing needs, 
options are now being considered to intensify the masterplan to 
optimise the development potential of this strategic project. 
Venues – strong operational performance
Olympia London has been reinvigorated following Capco’s £30 
million investment in recent years. Over 80 per cent of Earls Court’s 
2014 shows have moved to Olympia London in 2015, following  
Earls Court’s closure in December 2014. Olympia London continues 
to attract new events highlighting the renewed appeal of this 
historic venue. 
The Venues business performed ahead of expectations in 2014 with 
EBITDA for the year of £11.1 million. Its valuation was up 27 .6 per 
cent to £211 million on a like-for-like basis, reﬂecting the successful 
transition and its bright prospects. 
Outlook
Capco remains well positioned to deliver further signiﬁcant value 
for its shareholders from its strategy to drive value creation at 
Covent Garden and Earls Court.
At Covent Garden, the focus continues to be on attracting new 
premium retail and restaurant brands, to drive rental growth, while 
investing selectively in acquisitions and developments which 
enhance the estate and meet our return objectives.
At Earls Court, the focus is on continued enablement of the  
EC1 & EC2 land through demolition, planning applications which 
enhance the vision for the scheme, as well as sales of Phase 2 at  
Lillie Square.
The balance sheet is strong and ﬂexible, strengthened over the year 
with our new bank facilities, a US Private Placement and the 
successful equity raise in May . We remain alert to the uncertainty 
which may arise from the upcoming General Election. However, 
Capco’s strategy is clear and focused and with two unique assets in 
prime central London, we are well positioned to deliver long-term 
value for our shareholders. We enter a new year with conﬁdence.

1  Based on consensus estimates at 18 February 2015 for comparator group where results unavailable.
The three-year total property return is calculated assuming annual reinvestment. Annualised three-year total return and total shareholder return are calculated on a basis consistent 
with the Group’s long-term incentive plans.
A number of other indicators of performance are considered by the Board either at a Group level (including underlying earnings per share) or specifically relevant to each estate,  
for example ERV at Covent Garden and EBITDA at Venues. These are discussed further in the asset-specific operating reviews in the Strategic Report.
All three key performance indicators are directly linked to Executive Directors’ remuneration. These three indicators are carefully aligned with the Group’s strategy of creating and 
growing value and delivering market-leading total returns over the longer term. Total Property Return, underlying earnings per share and net asset value are linked to annual bonuses 
available to certain of the Group’s employees.

DESCRIPTION
Total property return is calculated as capital 
growth including gains and losses on 
disposal plus rents received less associated 
costs, including ground rent
This metric allows comparability with the 
IPD Total Return All Property Index
 
Total return is the growth in EPRA 
adjusted, diluted NAV per share plus 
dividends per share during the period
Outperformance over a three-year period, 
versus the median of a comparator group of 
the nine largest constituents of the FTSE 
350 Real Estate Index, is identiﬁed as a key 
measure of the success of Capco’s strategy
Total shareholder return is the increase  
in the price of an ordinary share plus 
dividends during the period
The Group’s total shareholder return is 
benchmarked against the median total 
shareholder return of a comparator group 
of the nine largest constituents of the  
FTSE 350 Real Estate Index
As a key metric for the long-term equity-
based compensation for the Group’s 
employees, total shareholder return aligns 
incentives with shareholder interest

Principal risks and uncertainties
EFFECTIVE RISK 
MANAGEMENT
Through risk management and internal control 
systems the Group is able to identify , assess  
and prioritise risk within the business and  
seeks to minimise, control and monitor their 
impact on proﬁtability whilst maximising the 
opportunities they present
RISK ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE
The Board has overall responsibility for 
Group risk management. It reviews principal 
risks and uncertainties regularly , together 
with the actions taken to mitigate them. The 
Board has delegated responsibility for the 
assurance of the risk management process 
and the review of mitigating controls to the 
Audit Committee.
Executive Directors together with senior 
management from every division and 
corporate function of the business complete 
a Group risk register. Risks are considered 
in terms of their impact and likelihood 
from both a ﬁnancial and reputational 
perspective. Risks are assessed both gross 
and net of mitigating controls. Review 
meetings are held to ensure consistency of 
response and adequacy of grading. Detailed 
risk registers are reviewed bi-annually and 
upon any material change in the business.  
A full risk review is undertaken annually , at 
which point it is also reviewed in detail by 
the Audit Committee with new or emerging 
risks considered by the Committee as 
appropriate. This allows the Audit 
Committee to monitor the most important 
controls and prioritise risk management 
and internal audit activities accordingly .

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A global destination in London’s West End
The Covent Garden estate is a global destination 
where people can shop, dine, live and work, 
experiencing culture and entertainment within a 
historic setting. It has been a very active year of 
leasing. Following the continued operational 
momentum as a result of the estate’s strategy and our 
distinct approach to managing Covent Garden, the 
ERV guidance has been increased to £100 million by 
December 2017 . This represents a continued 
underlying growth rate of circa 10 per cent in line with 
the last ﬁve years and would imply an ERV of £125 
million by December 2019. 
Overview
Providing over one million square feet of lettable 
space in London’s West End, the estate represents  
54 per cent of Capco’s portfolio. Covent Garden 
demonstrates Capco’s value growth strategy which  
is realised through granular asset management, 
acquisitions and strategic development, underpinned 
by a vision to consistently compete as one of the best 
destinations globally and delivered through Capco’s 
distinct approach to place-making.
Covent Garden performed strongly in 2014 as the 
business executed its leasing and investment plans. 
The value of the estate increased by 24.5 per cent on  
a like-for-like basis to £1.6 billion. ERV was £75.1 
million, a like-for-like increase of 13.7 per cent, 
following a very active year of estate repositioning. 
The estate is beneﬁting from positive leasing 
momentum and over the period 61 new lettings and 
renewals were negotiated securing £7 .6 million of 
passing rent, 12.2 per cent above the 31 December 2013 
ERV level. 
Footfall remains consistently strong at 42 million 
customer visits per year, of which 54 per cent were 
Londoners, 20 per cent international and 26 per cent 
domestic. Of the UK based audience, 93 per cent is 
classiﬁed as ABC1. 
As the owner of the Covent Garden estate, Capco 
regularly hosts exciting events, which also contribute 
to the high quality footfall attracted to the estate. In 
October, a cultural installation by young British artist 
Alex Chinneck created the illusion of the Market 
Building levitating over the Piazza. This innovative 
display attracted global media attention, including 
broadcast coverage in the UK, China and Japan.
Capco continues to work closely with community 
stakeholders including Westminster City Council and 
the Covent Garden Area Trust to maintain and 
celebrate the attributes which make the area unique. 
Corporate Responsibility remains inherent in Capco’s 
asset management approach in Covent Garden and 
initiatives included a fundraising installation from 
the British Heart Foundation and supporting the 
Royal British Legion Poppy fundraising day for the 
third consecutive year.

HENRIETTA STREET TRANSFORMS
Covent Garden
Retail
The estate has experienced its most active year for new 
leasing and renewals since Capco’s listing in 2010. In 
line with its focused repositioning strategy , where every 
street has a plan, Capco has continued to introduce 
fresh brands and concepts into Covent Garden. 
James Street has seen a rapid progression of value 
following key lettings over the year and the introduction 
of Italian cosmetics brand, Kiko, has set a new Zone A 
rental level of £1,000 per square foot, which compares to 
a December 2013 Zone A level of £800. This follows the 
relocation of existing tenant, Karen Millen, who moved 
to a larger unit on the street, demonstrating the appeal 
of Covent Garden to existing tenants. 
The ‘Street to Suit’ strategy to create a menswear focus, 
as well as a complementary dining offering, on 
Henrietta Street has seen positive momentum with ﬁve 
brands introduced to the street. British vintage inspired 
menswear brand Nigel Cabourn and Japanese denim 
store The Real McCoy’s have both opened their doors, 
while vintage denim concept, Edwin, has recently taken 
space on the street. Existing tenants Fred Perry and 
Oliver Sweeney have relocated to Henrietta Street from 
their previous locations on the estate. 
Repositioning the Royal Opera House Arcade with  
a luxury beauty , accessories and gifting focus is 
underway . Building upon the success of beauty concept 
stores from Chanel, Dior and Burberry in the Market 
Building, the Estee Lauder Group has taken space for 
two of its premium beauty brands, Bobbi Brown and 
Clinique, which have both opened and have added to 
Covent Garden’s appeal as a beauty hub in London.
Dining 
Covent Garden’s dining offer continues to strengthen, 
offering an increased depth and range of options. 
The Ivy Market Grill, Caprice Holdings’ new ﬂagship 
restaurant, opened successfully in November. The 
property , which was previously leased to Pizza Hut, 
overlooks the Piazza at the top of Henrietta Street and 
will add to the all-day dining offer on the estate. 
This follows the introduction of LIMA Floral on  
Garrick Street which offers Peruvian cuisine as well  
as a dedicated cocktail bar, and French eatery , Chez 
Antoinette, which opened in the Market Building 
earlier in the year, and further enhances Covent 
Garden’s reputation for destination dining.
Acquisitions
It has been an active year for acquisitions. Capco has 
taken advantage of opportunities to accelerate value,  
as referenced in the May 2014 capital raise, and has 
expanded its footprint on the estate through tactical 
acquisitions on key streets. Over the year, eight new 
properties have been acquired for £167 million, 
representing £7 .1 million of ERV .
Capco has created a signiﬁcant presence on Bedford 
Street, which is one of the access points on to the estate, 
through the acquisitions of 10-14 Bedford Street and 
since the year end, 31-33 Bedford Street. These  Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Residential 
In line with its strategy to restore the estate’s residential 
heritage, Capco launched two ﬂagship developments in 
2014, The Beecham and The Southampton. 
The Beecham is a luxury development overlooking the 
Piazza. The scheme, which provides nine apartments, 
completed in the autumn and has received a high level 
of interest. One apartment was sold prior to completion 
at £2,850 per square foot setting a new benchmark for 
the area.
The year saw a buoyant rental market for Capco’s brand 
of premium residential product establishing a rental 
tone of £65 - £70 per square foot. The Southampton 
which created seven luxury apartments also completed 
in the autumn and ﬁve apartments have been leased. 
This follows the refurbishment of 7 Garrick Street and  
4 Henrietta Street which were rented earlier in the year. 
Developments 
The development of Kings Court is underway following 
works which started in the autumn. The scheme, which 
is Capco’s largest development to date at Covent 
Garden, will transform pedestrian ﬂow in the area 
between Floral Street and King Street, creating a new 
connecting passage between the two streets. The entire 
scheme, including Carriage Hall, will provide over 
100,000 square feet (Net Internal Area, “NIA”), 
including over 20,000 square feet of new space.
Kings Court will provide over 85,000 square feet (NIA) 
of space through 45 premium apartments as well as 
eight retail and two restaurant units centred around  
a new public courtyard. Carriage Hall includes the 
refurbishment of 15,000 square feet (NIA) to create a 
ﬂagship store. Plans include the provision of a double 
height covered atrium in what is currently a courtyard.
The Kings Court and Carriage Hall schemes are 
expected to complete by early 2017 and the total 
development cost is expected to be £85 - £90 million. 
In December, Capco submitted a planning application 
for the refurbishment of 11-12 Floral Street which 
includes plans to create a retail unit, health club and 
nine residential apartments. The new development  
will create 11,000 square feet of new space.
Work commenced on Kings 
Court in autumn 2014. This 
new mixed use development 
will open up a pedestrian route 
between Floral Street and King 
Street, establishing new high  
quality residential, retail and 
restaurant space

RESTORING RESIDENTIAL HERITAGE
ON SITE AT KINGS COURT
FUTURE PRIORITIES 
The creative vision for Covent Garden to consistently be 
one of the most attractive destinations for retailers and 
customers will continue to underpin Capco’s distinct 
approach to place-making on the estate. This provides 
for a clear and focused strategy to grow value through 
creative asset management and strategic investment 
opportunities, enhancing its ownership on key streets 
through selective development and tactical acquisitions.
The introduction of contemporary luxury brands and 
fresh dining concepts is a priority to continue to 
position the estate for positive rental performance. This 
will enable Capco to deliver on the initiatives in place 
for its streets, including Henrietta Street and the Royal 
Opera House Arcade. The Kings Court scheme is 
underway and the focus will be delivery of the scheme 
in 2017 . This development will be used as the catalyst  
to reposition Floral Street and capture the unlocked 
potential in this part of the estate. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 26

an opportunity to create a new estate underpinned  
by Capco’s distinct approach to creating places.
Earls Court is one of the GLA’s 45 designated 
‘opportunity areas’ making it a strategic scheme for  
the Capital. According to the London Plan, London’s 
population is expected to grow by two million by 2031 
and the provision of housing is a key priority with the 
Capital needing over 45,000 new homes per annum. 
Against this backdrop of London’s housing need, the 
GLA increased the housing designation for Earls Court 
from 4,000 to a minimum of 7 ,500 new homes in its 
latest revision of the London Plan in January 2014.
Earls Court Properties represents Capco’s interests in 
Earls Court, which principally comprise:
• The leasehold interests in “EC1 & EC2”; subject to an 
agreement with TfL to create an investment vehicle 
63 per cent owned by Capco which would own a 999 
year lease in EC1 & EC2
• 100 per cent of the Empress State Building 
• 50 per cent interest in the Lillie Square joint venture
In addition, Capco has exercised its option under the 
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”), a binding 
agreement in relation to the West Kensington and Gibbs 
Green Estates. 
The valuation of Earls Court Properties has performed 
strongly during 2014, reﬂecting continued progress 
through planning, land assembly and land enablement, 
as well as a positive London residential market. The total 
valuation has increased to £1.2 billion, a like-for-like 
increase of 17 .9 per cent. 
The scheme sits in two London Boroughs, the Royal 
Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London

changed administration following the local elections  
in May 2014. Capco continues to work positively and 
constructively with all its stakeholders.
The Earls Court Masterplan saw continued progress  
and achieved a number of important milestones in 2014. 
Continued planning momentum
As part of its strategy to create value through the 
planning process, Capco achieved two detailed planning 
consents in 2014. This follows receipt of formal outline 
planning permission for the 10.1 million square feet  
Earls Court Masterplan in November 2013.
Earls Court Village, which represents two-thirds of  
the EC1 & EC2 site, achieved detailed planning consent.  
The consent covers an area of 16 acres and will provide  
for 2.4 million square feet of residential-led, mixed-use 
space. This will include over 1,200 new homes, over  
three acres of publicly accessible park and the ﬁrst phase 
of the new High Street with retail, dining, leisure, culture 
and community facilities.
The Empress State Building achieved consent for a 
change of use from commercial to residential and adds 
610,000 square feet of residential ﬂoor space to the overall 
masterplan area. The new scheme proposes the creation 
of 340 new homes and 102 affordable units as well as 
improvements to the facade of the existing building. 
Signiﬁcant progress in land assembly and  
land enablement 
Earls Court Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), the 
investment vehicle with Transport for London (“TfL”) 
in respect of EC1 & EC2, was established in March 2014. 
Capco owns a 63 per cent share and is leading the 
venture following its appointment as exclusive 
business and development manager. The arrangements 
are expected to complete in full in the ﬁrst half of 2015 
and will result in new 999 year leases over EC1 & EC2 
being granted to the investment vehicle.
As part of the process to enable the land relating to  
EC1 & EC2, demolition of the existing exhibition halls 
started in December 2014. This process is expected to 
take 18 months due to the complexity of the site at a 
cost of £50-£60 million.
Over the year, Capco has made positive progress  
in consolidating its ownership in the area through  
£51 million of small acquisitions around the Earls Court 
Masterplan, as referenced in the May 2014 capital raise. 
The majority of these acquisitions will be transferred 
into ECPL upon its completion; they provide the 
opportunity to enhance the implementation of the 
early stages of the scheme and are positioned around 
the masterplan.
In November 2013, Capco exercised its option under  
the Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”), a 
binding agreement relating to West Kensington and 
Gibbs Green Estates, and to date has paid £30 million  
of the £105 million cash consideration, the remainder  
of which is payable in ﬁve annual instalments starting 
in December 2015. Plans are progressing towards the 
construction of Block D of Lillie Square, which will 
create the ﬁrst phase of replacement homes for the 
residents of the estates.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report

LILLIE 
SQUARE
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
The Lillie Square development is a one million square  
feet (GEA) residential scheme located adjacent to the  
Earls Court Masterplan. 
The valuation of Capco’s 50 per cent interest in Lillie 
Square, which is held in a joint venture with the Kwok 
Family Interests (“KFI”), increased to £182 million, a 
like-for-like increase of 9.9 per cent over the year. 
The development will be delivered in three phases. Sales 
of the ﬁrst phase began in spring last year and received 
strong demand, with over 85 per cent reserved in the ﬁrst 
ﬁve weeks. Sales progressed well throughout the year  
and Phase 1 is substantially sold. As planned, sales of the 
penthouses will continue throughout the project. The 
average sales price for Phase 1 is between £1,400 and 
£1,500 per square foot with individual premium units 
achieving over £2,200 per square foot. Following 
successful enabling works, construction has started,  
with ﬁrst completions on track for 2016. 
Construction of the private element of the scheme is now 
expected to cost £400 million which reﬂects the overall 
higher speciﬁcation of the development and increased 
margins in the construction industry . Material changes 
are not expected to occur to either of these factors  
going forward.
Due to the phased nature of the development the peak 
capital requirement is £130 million and in May 2014, 
Capco signed a £130 million revolving credit facility 
(Capco share: £65 million) to ﬁnance the scheme. 
Capco notes the conclusion of legal proceedings 
concerning certain members of the Kwok Family . These 
proceedings have not had an impact on the operation of 
the joint venture. 
• Lillie Square valued at £182 million (Capco’s share)  
up 9.9 per cent (on a like-for-like basis)
• Strong demand for Phase 1
• Construction of Phase 1 underway
• Create value through the delivery of a high quality 
residential-led scheme with joint venture partner
• Continued sales and price progression

FUTURE PRIORITIES 
Capco remains committed to its strategy to create value 
through planning, land assembly and land enablement 
through the development of the masterplan.
The Earls Court Masterplan is currently consented  
for 10.1 million square feet of residential-led space  
and is one of the GLA’s opportunity areas, making it  
a strategic scheme for the Capital. The provision of 
more housing is a major priority for London, with  
over 45,000 homes a year needed to meet future 
requirements. Efficient utilisation of opportunity  
areas, such as Earls Court, is key in order to meet these 
requirements and options are now being considered 
which enhance and maximise the potential of this 
important London scheme.
At Earls Court, the focus of activities this year will be 
continued demolition of EC1 & EC2 following a 
successful start in December 2014, and this process is 
expected to take 18 months. In addition, Capco will 
continue its land assembly plans, acquiring small 
properties to enhance its ownership around the 
masterplan area. Capco notes the announcement by  
TfL in June highlighting the feasibility of relocating  
its operational depot away from Earls Court. 
Lillie Square is the ﬁrst manifestation of the masterplan 
within the Earls Court area. Following the strong 
success of Phase 1, the focus is now on construction of 
Phase 1 and successful sales of Phase 2 over the course  
of the year.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Venues – strong operating performance
The Venues business performed ahead of expectations 
in 2014 following a successful transition process and 
new shows coming to Olympia London. EBITDA for the 
year was £11.1 million up by 7 per cent compared to 2013. 
This is reﬂected in the positive valuation performance, 
which has increased 27 .6 per cent to £210.6 million  
over 2014.
In preparation for the closure of Earls Court, which  
held its last show in December 2014, the transition  
of bookings to Olympia London progressed very well 
through the year. Over 80 per cent of Earls Court’s 
shows have transferred and include the Ideal Home 
Show and The London Book Fair. 
The enhanced Olympia business has had a successful 
year, attracting new events as the venue beneﬁts from 
over £30 million invested over recent years. 
FUTURE PRIORITIES
The successful transition of shows to Olympia London 
demonstrates the renewed appeal of this historic venue 
following the actions taken to enhance its offering. The 
focus of activities going forward will be to build upon 
the momentum achieved in 2014 and maximise the 
potential of this reinvigorated venue. 
• Strong valuation performance up 28% like-for-like
• EBITDA of £11.1 million, up 7%

Financial review
EPRA adjusted, diluted net assets per share rose 25.0 per cent during 
the year, increasing from 249 pence at 31 December 2013 to 311 pence. 
This 62 pence increase together with the 1.5 pence dividend paid 
during the year represents a total return of 25.4 per cent.
At Covent Garden, continued growth in rental values as well as 
yield compression have increased the value of the estate by 21.4 per 
cent (24.5 per cent like-for-like) following a number of new lettings, 
lease re-gears, rent reviews and progress made on developments.
The market value of Earls Court Properties, which comprises  
the Group’s interests at Earls Court, has increased by 15.2 per cent  
(17 .9 per cent like-for-like), primarily the result of the successful 
launch of the ﬁrst phase of the Lillie Square scheme together with 
the strong central London residential sales market. The valuation of 
the Group’s EC1 & EC2 interests by Jones Lang LaSalle, the Group’s 
external valuers, implies a land value of £42.7 million per acre (2013: 
£31.7 million) for the combined freehold and leasehold interest.

Re-presentation of prior year comparatives
Following the adoption of IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ (“IFRS 11”) 
the Group is required to represent its joint ventures as though the 
standard had been in effect at 1 January 2013. The standard removes 
the proportional consolidation option that was previously available 
under IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. Under the equity method, 
rather than proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of 
assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis, the 
Group’s net equity interest in joint ventures is now disclosed as a 
single line item in both the consolidated balance sheet and 
consolidated income statement. Loans between the Group and its 
joint ventures, as well as interest thereon, are no longer eliminated 
on consolidation. 
The Group’s joint ventures consist of the Lillie Square joint venture 
(“LSJV”) and the discontinued operation, The Great Capital 
Partnership (“GCP”). Under the equity method, when the Group’s 
share of losses in a joint venture exceeds its investment, as is the 
case with LSJV , the Group does not recognise further losses, unless 
it has legal or constructive obligations to make payments on behalf 
of the joint venture. As a result, loan advances from the Group to 
LSJV have been impaired by £19.2 million (2013: £6.3 million) to 
their recoverable amount. There has been no overall change in the 
net asset position or proﬁt after tax of the Group as a result of 
adopting IFRS 11.
The LSJV business plan is the development and sale of a one million 
square feet residential scheme and LSJV therefore holds trading 
property which is carried at the lower of cost and market value.  
The carrying value of the trading property at 31 December 2014  
was £193.5 million however the market value was £360.4 million, 
resulting in an unrecognised revaluation surplus of £166.9 million 
(Capco share £83.4 million). Therefore, while Lillie Square 
demonstrates positive pricing evidence as discussed in the Operating 
Review , the unrecognised surplus will not be evidenced in the 
consolidated ﬁnancial statements until proﬁt on sale is recognised.
Internally the Board focuses on and reviews information and 
reports prepared on a proportionately consolidated basis, which 
includes the Group’s share of joint ventures. Therefore to align  
with the way the Group is managed, this ﬁnancial review presents 
the ﬁnancial position, performance and cash ﬂow analysis on a 
proportionately consolidated basis. Continuing and discontinuing 
operations have also been combined.
Conditional Land Sale Agreement (“CLSA”)
In November 2013 the Group exercised its option under the CLSA, 
which it entered into with the London Borough of Hammersmith  
& Fulham (“LBHF”), for the purchase of the West Kensington and 
Gibbs Green housing estates (the “Estates”). The overall 
consideration payable is expected to be £105 million cash plus the 
planning requirement to provide up to 760 replacement homes.
The CLSA remains unrecognised in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements of the Group as its main underlying asset (the land 
relating to the Estates) does not currently meet the recognition 
criteria required for investment and development property . Of the 
£30 million paid to date, £15 million relates to the acquisition of two 
properties and £15 million remains held as a prepayment against a 
future draw down of land. The future payments, totalling £75 
million are disclosed as a capital commitment. Annual payments of 
£15 million start in December 2015. Where amounts are paid prior to 
the transfer of property , they will be carried on the Group’s balance 
sheet as prepayments against future land draw down. A transfer from 
prepayment to investment and development property will occur 
once the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the Group. 
Once this occurs, in line with the Group’s accounting policy , the land 
will become subject to bi-annual valuation with any uplift reﬂected 
in the Group’s reported net asset measure.
Earls Court Partnership Limited (“ECPL”)
In March 2014 the Group established ECPL, an investment vehicle 
between the Group (63 per cent controlling interest) and TfL  
(37 per cent interest) to enable the development of EC1 & EC2 in  
line with the Earls Court Masterplan. On completion of the transfer  
of assets into ECPL, which will occur in the ﬁrst half of 2015, the 
Group’s current leasehold interests will be replaced with a 63 per 
cent economic interest in the new 999 year lease granted by TfL.
FINANCIAL POSITION
At 31 December 2014 the Group’s EPRA adjusted net assets were 
£2.6 billion (2013: £1.9 billion) representing 311 pence per share 
adjusted and diluted, an increase of 62 pence per share since  
31 December 2013.
Investment, development and trading property
The revaluation surplus on the Group’s property portfolio was 
£484.0 million during the year, a 21.9 per cent gain on a like-for-like 
basis compared with the IPD Capital Return for the equivalent 
period of 12.4 per cent.
Total property return for the year was 21.9 per cent which compares 
with the IPD Total Return index which recorded a 19.3 per cent 
return for the corresponding period.
Valuation surpluses on trading property are not recorded and are 
carried on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value. 
Any unrecognised surplus is however reﬂected within the EPRA 
adjusted net asset measure. At 31 December 2014, the unrecognised 
surplus on trading property was £96.3 million, up from £69.2 
million at 31 December 2013. This primarily arises on property 
assets at Lillie Square. 
Property acquisitions in the year were £222.0 million, of which  
the majority, £166.7 million, were acquisitions at Covent Garden. 
Disposals in the year of £17 .6 million consisted of 32-33 Long Acre 
which was swapped for 16-18 King Street, the last residential 
apartment at The Russell and the ﬁrst residential apartment at  
The Beecham.
Capital raise
In May the Group completed a placing of 75.9 million new ordinary 
shares at a price of 340 pence per share to provide additional 
ﬂexibility to fund the acceleration of value creation at Covent 
Garden and Earls Court. The placing generated net proceeds  
of £251.7 million. The number of ordinary shares in issue at  
31 December 2014 was 836.2 million. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 40

Debt and gearing
In February the Group signed a £665 million ﬁve year unsecured 
revolving credit facility to replace the Group’s Covent Garden 
facilities. Total costs of £12.9 million were incurred of which  
£8.1 million were capitalised and £4.8 million was charged to the 
income statement relating to the termination of derivatives and  
a write off of unamortised transaction costs relating to the  
previous facilities.
In November the Group signed an agreement with ﬁve US 
institutional investors for a private placement of £150 million 10 
and 12 year senior unsecured notes which enhanced the unsecured 
debt platform at Covent Garden. Closing occurred in December  
and proceeds were used to repay bank debt.
In May the Group entered into a £130 million (Capco share £65 
million) four year construction facility to fund the Lillie Square 
development. The ﬁrst draw down occurred in December. 
Net debt has increased by £15.5 million in the year principally as a 
result of property acquisitions and subsequent expenditure offset 
by proceeds from the capital raise.
The gearing measure most widely used in the industry is loan-to-
value (“LTV”). LTV is calculated on the basis of net debt divided by 
the value of the Group’s property portfolio. The Group focuses most 
on an LTV measure that includes the notional share of joint venture 
interests but excludes the share of cash, debt and property which is 
held by the Group on behalf of TfL in respect of ECPL. The LTV of 
12.1 per cent remains comfortably within the Group’s target limit of 
no more than 40 per cent.

Loan to value 12.1% 15.2%

Weighted average debt maturity 5.1 years 4.3 years

Proportion of gross debt with interest  
rate protection 94% 100%
The Group’s policy is to substantially eliminate the medium and 
long-term risk arising from interest rate volatility . The Group’s 
banking facilities are arranged on a ﬂoating rate basis, but swapped 
to ﬁxed rate or capped using derivative contracts. At 31 December 
2014 the proportion of gross debt with interest rate protection was 
94 per cent (2013: 100 per cent).
The Group remains compliant with all of its debt covenants. 
The Group has capital commitments of £171.4 million at 31 December 
2014 (2013: £105.9 million). The increase is attributable to the Lillie 
Square construction contract. Since the year end, the Group signed a 
£64.8 million building contract for the construction of Kings Court, 
Covent Garden.

Dividends paid (11.0) (6.9)
Net cash ﬂow 66.9 (139.5)
1  Includes the acquisition of plant and equipment.
Recurring cash ﬂows were £19.4 million compared with £8.0 
million for 2013, mainly due to lower ﬁnance costs and a taxation 
receipt in the year relating to the close out of the previous year’s 
taxation computations.
Investing activities mainly comprise acquisitions of £203.4 million 
and subsequent expenditure of £55.7 million, offset in part by 
proceeds received from the disposal of property and investments  
of £8.1 million.
During the year eight properties were acquired in Covent Garden 
for £166.7 million. Net of a swap and a further property which had 
exchanged but not yet completed, total cash invested towards 
expanding the estate during 2014 was £144.7 million. The 
remaining property acquisition and development expenditure was 
mainly in respect of Earls Court Properties. Proceeds from the sale 
of property and investments primarily comprise the disposal of the 
last remaining residential unit at The Russell, Covent Garden and 
the ﬁrst residential unit at The Beecham, Covent Garden.
Issue of shares reﬂects the capital raise previously referred to net  
of costs and the vesting of equity based compensation awards. 
The £665 million ﬁve year unsecured revolving credit facility 
replaced the Group’s Covent Garden facilities and has in part been 
repaid by cash received from the capital raise and US Private 
Placement to reduce cash drag in the short-term until it is invested. 
On completion of the facility , £25.2 million of fees and derivative 
contract termination fees were paid. 
Dividends paid of £11.0 million reﬂect the ﬁnal dividend payment 
made in respect of the 2013 ﬁnancial year and the 2014 interim 
dividend paid in September. This was higher than the previous year 
due to additional ordinary shares in issue at the record date and a 
lower take up of the scrip dividend alternative, 11 per cent versus  
21 per cent in 2013.
As a result of the May 2014 capital raise, the US Private Placement 
and the two new facilities previously discussed, the Group’s cash 
and undrawn committed facilities at 31 December 2014 have 
increased to £655.0 million (2013: £287 .0 million).

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group has presented an underlying calculation of proﬁt after 
tax and adjusted earnings per share ﬁgures in addition to the 
amounts reported on a proportionately consolidated basis. The 
Group considers this presentation to provide useful information  
as it removes unrealised and other one-off items and therefore 
represents the recurring, underlying performance of the business.

Taxation on non-recurring items 1.4 10.3 
Underlying earnings 13.1 7.3 
Underlying earnings per share (pence) 1.6  1.0
Net rental income
Net rental income increased by £5.3 million (3.9 per cent like-for-
like) in the year. Acquisitions at Covent Garden, strong performance 
at Olympia London which is beneﬁting from the transition of 
exhibitions from Earls Court, and the acquisition of control of 
Empress State in May 2013 have increased net rental income by  
£6.5 million. The sale of properties within GCP reduced net rental 
income by £1.2 million which is in line with expectations.
Gain on revaluation and sale of investment and  
development property
The gain on revaluation and sale of the Group’s investment and 
development property was £454.4 million, £270.2 million arising 
from the Covent Garden estate, £139.0 million from Earls Court 
Properties, £45.6 million from Olympia London and a loss of  
£0.4 million from Other.
Administration expenses
Administration expenses have increased by 27 .8 per cent to £43.2 
million. This change is due to increased employee costs in line with 
expansion of the Group’s activities. 
Net ﬁnance costs
Net ﬁnance costs have decreased by 27 .8 per cent to £15.1 million 
due to the combined impact of a reduced cost of debt and lower 
average debt as a result of the capital raise and re-ﬁnancings over 
the past 18 months.
Non-recurring ﬁnance costs
Non-recurring ﬁnance costs relate primarily to charges incurred  
on termination of debt facilities in respect of the Covent Garden 
reﬁnancing, discussed earlier within ‘debt and gearing’.
Taxation
The total tax charge for the period was £1.6 million which is made 
up of both underlying tax and non-underlying tax. 
Tax on underlying proﬁts for 2014 reﬂects a rate of 20.5 per cent, in 
line with the current rate of UK corporation tax. This is offset by an 
adjustment in respect of previous years leading to an underlying 
tax charge of £0.2 million. The UK corporation tax rate will fall to 
20 per cent from April 2015. 
Contingent tax, the amount of tax that would become payable on a 
theoretical disposal of all investment properties held by the Group 
remains £nil. The contingent tax position is arrived at after 
allowing for indexation relief and Group loss relief. A disposal of 
the Group’s trading property at market value would result in a 
corporation tax charge to the Group of £20.7 million (21.5 per cent 
of £96.3 million). 
The Group’s tax policy , which has been approved by the Board and 
has been disclosed to HM Revenue & Customs, is aligned with the 
business strategy . The Group seeks to protect shareholder value by 
structuring operations in a tax efficient manner, with external 
advice as appropriate, which complies with all relevant tax law and 
regulations and does not adversely impact our reputation as a 
responsible taxpayer. As a Group, we are committed to acting in an 
open and transparent manner. 
Consistent with the Group’s policy of complying with relevant tax 
obligations and its goal in respect of its stakeholders, the Group 
maintains a constructive and open working relationship with  
HM Revenue & Customs which regularly includes obtaining 
advance clearance on key transactions where the tax treatment  
may be uncertain.
Dividends
The Board has proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 1.0 pence per share to be 
paid on 19 June 2015 to shareholders on the register at 29 May 2015. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer a scrip 
dividend alternative. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

Going Concern
At 31 December 2014 the Group’s cash and undrawn committed 
facilities were £655 million and its capital commitments were 
£171.4 million. With weighted average debt maturity exceeding  
ﬁve years, LTV of 12 per cent and sufficient headroom against all 
ﬁnancial covenants, there continues to be a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and Group will have adequate resources to meet 
both on-going and future commitments for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly , the Directors have prepared the 2014 Annual Report & 
Accounts on a going concern basis.

Continue to support community projects which speciﬁcally beneﬁt  
young people in London within the areas where our assets are located.
Earls Court
As part of the 2014 Earls Court Education Programme:
Pupils from Year 5 at Fulham Primary School undertook a ‘story book project’ 
looking at Earls Court past and present. Having beneﬁted from coaching from a 
professional actor, they presented some of the fascinating stories they had 
researched and photographed.
In addition, Year 2 pupils from Servite Primary School became detectives and looked 
at the streets surrounding Earls Court, investigating their current appearance and 
predicting how they will look in the future.
We sponsored the Bizworld Charity Project which offers children a hands-on, 
project-based learning programme covering key aspects of entrepreneurship.
This year the ‘Take Four’ schools project involved approximately 100 Year 6 pupils 
from four local schools across our assets. This ﬁlm making project was designed to 
engage children in personal safety , community safety and health issues through 
new media. The grand ﬁnale took place at Olympia in front of a large audience.
The ﬁnance team at head office spent a morning designing a large collage of  
London with members from the Learning Disabilities Resource Centre who have 
severe disabilities.
Covent Garden
The Covent Garden team continues to work alongside local stakeholders and 
community groups, residents, tenants and The Covent Garden Area Trust to 
improve the local area.
We hosted the Apple Market Challenge for the ninth year running. Year 6 students 
from nine schools were mentored by sixth formers, and the task involved designing 
and marketing a product to be sold on the market. Four ﬁnalists were chosen to 
come to Covent Garden to present to an expert panel. The winning team created a 
multi-purpose ‘Super Smart Bag’ that was a phone charger, cooler pocket for cold 
drinks and a pull-out laptop holder.
A 2014 highlight was the Turtles Nursery new garden project. Capco volunteers 
teamed up with contractors and architects working on the Kings Court 
development to help fund the £9k project, and staff helped build and paint  
new equipment.
Continue to support community 
projects which speciﬁcally beneﬁt 
young people in London within the 
areas where our assets are located.
We continue to enhance local employment by supporting the work of Recruit London 
who are regularly introduced to occupiers of our estate at stakeholder events. We 
created a leaﬂet outlining their service, which we provide to new and existing retailers 
who may not otherwise be aware of it. Our retailers have recruited 59 new employees 
via the scheme (17 of those in 2014).

Local communities – we make a positive impact on the local communities where our assets are located
What we achieved in 2014 2015 objective
Further develop our property management strategy for the beneﬁt of  
all stakeholders.
There have been signiﬁcant improvements in the facilities at Olympia during 2014 
and, following the investment of £4m, the venue has been prepared for an increased 
number of events due to be held in 2015 and beyond.
The majority of the investment has been used to refurbish the venue’s roofs to 
improve the watertight integrity of the exhibition spaces. In addition, the National 
Hall beneﬁted from an additional goods lift and upgraded air handling units.
A further £4m investment is 
planned for Olympia in 2015 to 
ensure that it maintains its position 
as a leading UK venue.
Major planned projects include  
the refurbishment of the Grand Hall 
roof and improved heating and 
lighting for the Grand Hall.
Organisers can now request a sustainability report for their events and, since this 
service was launched in July , four show reports have been issued.
Increase uptake of sustainability 
reports to 10 for the year.
The Covent Garden Management Plan was developed. This included the continued 
funding of two Street Wardens (known as Covent Garden Guardians) who minimise 
illegal trading, ﬂy-tipping and unsocial behaviour around the Covent Garden 
estate. Supplemental cleaning was also implemented in the area, including 
scrubbing of pavements, bin washing and litter picking. 
Implement further enhanced 
cleaning more widely in Covent 
Garden – introduction of new 
equipment. Implement a 
Neighbourly Initiative Scheme.
The Customer Forum meetings continued this year with more emphasis on 
providing customer research information to stakeholders.
We carried out a further set of Customer Forum Meetings at Covent Garden with 
stakeholders, and for the ﬁrst time shared the research carried out during the Christmas 
period. We completed a further set of Sparkle Weeks during July which included 
painting of public realm areas such as bollards, street lamps, railings and gates.
Further develop the Customer 
Forum meetings, widening the 
topics covered and build closer 
relationships with stakeholders  
via the newly appointed Retail 
Liaison Manager.

Capco people – we employ people with a diverse range of experience and expertise
What we achieved in 2014 2015 objective
To further develop learning programmes that will enhance the capability  
and performance of our people.
We continue to attract talented graduates who attend a structured induction 
programme on joining the business, which involves technical skills training, 
effective time management skills, communication, inﬂuencing and impact skills. 
The graduates have access to an external trainer to provide them with support in 
obtaining their APC qualiﬁcations. All graduates rotate around the business for a 
period of six to nine months to ensure they get a broad depth of experience.
An internal leadership training programme “Essential Management Skills” 
commenced in April 2014 for our high potential employees at mid-level. The aim of 
the programme was to develop their capabilities in leadership, focusing on personal 
awareness, communication, effectiveness, collaboration and delegation skills. The 
programme culminated in the delegates developing a robust solution to a current 
business challenge or opportunity .
A training programme was delivered to secretarial staff covering communication, 
professionalism, time management and networking skills. 
A number of employees beneﬁted from external coaching and internal mentoring 
which focused on individual development needs. Overall, 79.5 per cent of total 
employees at head office and Covent Garden attended training during 2014 
equating to more than 1,000 hours.
Collaboration across the Group was enhanced by the introduction of bespoke team 
building exercises. For example, the Earls Court team spent a day learning about 
team work in Formula One. They experienced a high pressure team situation by 
taking part in a simulated pit-stop challenge supervised by the Williams Formula 
One team. The Covent Garden team used the Belbin model to analyse team dynamics. 
At the Venues business, training in 2014 focused on the following key areas: customer 
service, health and safety , security of guests, staff and premises, sustainability , 
statutory compliance and technical training for facilities management.
To further develop learning 
programmes that will enhance  
the capability and performance  
of our people.
Encourage employees to engage in CR initiatives and contribute  
350 Group employee hours to supporting these projects.
Capco staff completed 625 hours of CR related activities during 2014, an increase  
of 110 hours on 2013. A greater variety of opportunities for employees to participate 
in Company-wide CR projects was offered and individuals were encouraged to 
volunteer for the CR initiatives publicised via the Company’s intranet, The Wire.

Further improve our health and safety reporting across the Group.
The Group’s Health & Safety Committee, chaired by the Executive Investment 
Director, met on a monthly basis to review activities across the business and ensure 
that satisfactory policies and procedures were in place.
With the commencement of works on site at Earls Court and Lillie Square, we have 
carried out a review of health and safety training requirements and implemented a 
programme of training to ensure that all staff are aware of their responsibilities. 
At Covent Garden, there were 15 RIDDOR incidents during 2014 and 59 accidents 
overall. There were no injuries to staff. 
At the Venues business, bi-monthly staff health and safety meetings were 
conducted. In addition, as competent health and safety representation for every 
event is a venue requirement, safety brieﬁngs were held with each event  
organising team.
There were six RIDDOR incidents during 2014 and 78 accidents overall involving 
visitors to Earls Court events. Two staff were treated for minor injuries.
To the end of December 2014, there were three RIDDOR accidents involving visitors 
to Olympia events and 190 accidents overall; no speciﬁc trends or major injuries 
were identiﬁed. There were seven injuries to staff, all of which were minor.  
Ensure that good standards of 
health and safety across the Group 
are maintained, including in 
relation to our development-related 
activities at Covent Garden,  
Lillie Square and Earls Court.
Ensure that health and safety 
continues to be at the forefront of

Continue to expand our tenant engagement programme on environmental  
issues such as waste reduction, recycling and energy management. Aim to  
increase waste segregation to 55 per cent.
We continued our engagement with the food and beverage occupiers in Covent 
Garden Market. We meet with around four-ﬁve occupiers a month and share the 
recycling statistics on a monthly basis to show our progress.
The waste segregation target of 55 per cent was achieved in Covent Garden, despite 
an increase in waste due to a greater number of food and beverage operations.
At Earls Court, following engagement with local stakeholders, we adopted an 
engineered solution to the demolition of the bridge, in order to minimise noise  
to the surrounding areas over the Christmas period.

Corporate governance report
Ian Durant, Chairman
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2014 Corporate 
Governance Report. 
As I reported in my statement on page 6, Capco has 
grown consistently since its establishment in 2010, 
and has delivered market-leading returns for 
shareholders. In delivering this performance, the 
Company has been supported by a framework of 
oversight, controls and reporting which allows it  
to operate with a level of openness and ﬂexibility 
appropriate for the business. 
The Board sits at the head of this structure and is 
accountable for the Company’s success, providing 
strategic leadership, monitoring delivery of its 
objectives and managing its risk. In this report, and 
the Committee reports which follow, we explain the 
operation of the Board and Committees, the matters 
that have occupied the Board during 2014, and our 
priorities for 2015.
Throughout the year the Board considered the 
Company’s strategy , including in-depth presentations 
and debate at its annual two-day strategy meeting. 
Under the management of the Audit Committee, the 
Company’s changing risk proﬁle was monitored to 
ensure that risk and strategy were appropriately 
aligned. I am pleased to conﬁrm that the Board is 
conﬁdent that the current strategy is appropriate, and 
the monitoring and management of risk will continue 
to be a key item on the Board’s agenda in 2015. 
In 2014, the Nomination Committee focused on the 
recruitment of new Non-executive Directors to ensure 
that Capco’s Board continues to be well-positioned for 
the future. The Nomination Committee report 
explains the recruitment process followed to date, and 
work to recruit an additional Non-executive Director 
will continue in the early part of 2015.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 66 
explains the new salaries approved by the 
Remuneration Committee in light of Soumen Das and 
Gary Yardley’s new roles as Managing Directors of the 
Company . Having received shareholder approval of 
our remuneration policy in 2014, this year we will be 
asking shareholders to vote only on the Annual 
Report on Remuneration. However, the 
Remuneration Committee has considered whether 
the remuneration policy is appropriate for future 
years and will be conducting a review of these 
arrangements in 2015. 
In 2014, as part of the Audit Committee’s review of the 
annual accounts, it paid particular attention to the 
Group’s property valuations, as these are the most 
signiﬁcant numbers within our ﬁnancial statements. 
The Committee met with each of the valuers and 
challenged the assumptions used in preparing the 
valuations, concluding that the approach taken by  
the valuers is appropriate.
This report has been prepared under the version of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2012 
(the “Code”). We will report against the revised 
version of the Code published in September 2014 in 
our 2015 Annual Report.

Board composition
As at 31 December 2014, the Board comprised the 
Chairman, three Executive Directors and six Non-
executive Directors. The table below summarises the 
membership of the Board and Committees. In addition, 
biographies of all the Directors including information 
about their skills and experience can be found on pages

Board independence
The Code requires that, excluding the Chairman, at 
least half the Board should comprise Non-executive 
Directors determined to be independent.
The Board has considered the independence of the 
Non-executive Directors, and the table below sets out 
those Directors considered to be independent in 
character and judgement. Each of these Directors has 
also conﬁrmed that there is no reason why they should 
not continue to be considered independent.
In considering Director independence, the Board 
concluded that Directors’ tenure should be counted 
from the date of their ﬁrst election by shareholders to 
the Capco Board.

AN EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
The Board is collectively responsible for the long-term success of 
the Company , and for its leadership, strategy , values, standards, 
control and management. 
The roles of the Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and 
formally documented. The Chairman is responsible for the 
leadership of the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and setting its 
agenda, and ensuring effective links between shareholders, the 
Board and management. The Chief Executive is responsible for 
developing the Company’s strategic direction, implementing 
policies and strategies decided by the Board and managing  
the business.
The Non-executive Directors constructively challenge the 
Executive Directors and monitor the delivery of the agreed strategy 
within the risk and control framework set by the Board. 
Day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Executive 
Directors, subject to formal delegated authority limits, however 
certain matters have been reserved for Board approval. These 
matters are reviewed annually and include: Board and Committee 
composition, Company strategy , signiﬁcant funding decisions  
and corporate transactions, delegated authority limits and  
dividend policy .
Through the Chairman, the Company Secretary is responsible for 
advising the Board on matters of corporate governance, and ensures 
good information ﬂows within the Board and its Committees and 
between senior management and Non-executive Directors. The 
General Counsel attends Board and Audit Committee meetings.  
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and the General Counsel.
The Board meets formally throughout the year with main meetings 
timed around the ﬁnancial calendar, and additional meetings 
convened to consider speciﬁc matters as required. Attendance at 
Board and Board Committee meetings held during 2014 is shown  
in the table on page 60. 
The annual Board calendar includes a two-day strategy meeting 
which is held away from head office. At this meeting the Board 
receives detailed updates from external advisers and the business 
units, and is able to consider strategic issues in depth, and spend time 
with members of senior management in a less formal environment.
Board papers are typically circulated a week in advance of meetings 
to ensure that Directors have sufficient time to consider their 
content prior to the meeting. If matters require approval at short 
notice, written approval is sought from the Directors. 
The Chairman meets regularly with the Non-executive Directors 
without the Executive Directors being present and maintains 
regular contact with both the Chief Executive and members of 
senior management. 
As matters that require the Board’s decision are often large, 
complex and slow moving, informal update meetings are held 
between Board meetings which are designed to allow Board 
members adequate time and preparation to explore, understand 
and challenge matters under consideration. These are often 
combined with site visits and provide an opportunity for the 
Non-executive Directors to meet senior management. Three such 
updates were held during 2014, which included visits to the Lillie 
Square marketing suite and the Earls Court project room.
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration, Nomination  
and Corporate Responsibility Committees to enable the Board  
to operate effectively and ensure a strong governance framework 
for decision making. A summary of the role of each Committee is 
shown in the ﬁgure above, and the activity of each Committee 
during 2014 is described on pages 61 to 85.
Each Committee has written terms of reference which were 
reviewed by the Audit Committee and Board during the year.  
The terms of reference can be viewed on the Company’s website  
www.capitalandcounties.com. Minutes of all Committee meetings 
are made available to all Directors. The Committee Chairmen attend 
the AGM to answer any questions on the Committees’ activities.

2014 BOARD EVALUATION
ENSURING AN EFFECTIVE BOARD
Board performance and evaluation
Recognising that Capco’s Board must be effective, the Board 
conducts an annual evaluation of its own performance and that  
of its Committees and Directors. Following an external evaluation 
in 2013, the 2014 Board Evaluation was managed by the Chairman 
and Company Secretary . The evaluation built on matters identiﬁed 
during the 2013 external evaluation. Directors were asked to  
assess the effectiveness of the Board by providing a mixture of 
quantitative and narrative responses. The outcomes of the 
evaluation were considered by the Board and a Board action  
plan was agreed.
In addition, during the year the Senior Independent Director 
conducted an appraisal of the Chairman’s performance which 
identiﬁed a number of matters for focus during 2015, and the 
Chairman undertook appraisals of the other Directors’ performance.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Our policy
The Board is keen to ensure that our shareholders and potential 
investors have a good understanding of Capco’s business and 
performance, and that Directors are aware of any issues and 
concerns which shareholders may have. The Company 
communicates with stakeholders in a number of ways:
Corporate website
Our corporate website www.capitalandcounties.com allows  
visitors to access Company information, annual reports, results 
presentations and webcasts. The site also includes links to our 
business unit websites and contact details for shareholder queries.
Annual General Meeting
Our AGM allows the Board to update our shareholders on Capco’s 
progress, and provides an opportunity for shareholders to pose 
questions to the Directors, and meet senior executives.
Shareholders are encouraged to vote on the resolutions put to the 
meeting, either in person at the meeting, online or by submitting a 
proxy card. We publish the results of the votes on all resolutions on 
our website following the meeting.
Our 2015 AGM will be held on 1 May 2015. The notice of Annual

themselves for election or re-election.
The Chairman, Chairmen of the Board Committees and other 
Directors will be available at the AGM to meet shareholders and

The Board met seven times in 2014. Each Board and Committee member attended all scheduled Board and Committee meetings with the exception of Graeme 
Gordon who was unable to attend one meeting due to a family bereavement, and Demetra Pinsent and Andrew Strang who were each unable to attend one meeting 
called at short notice.
Communications with shareholders
Communication with the Company’s investors is a priority for  
the Board and an investor relations manager was appointed  
during 2014. The Company runs an extensive investor relations 
programme, and the Chief Executive and Finance Director hold 
meetings with institutional shareholders throughout the year, 
including results presentations, webcasts, road shows, one-to-one 
meetings and investor tours.
The Company’s major shareholders are encouraged to meet with 
the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director to discuss any 
matters they may wish to raise. During 2014, the Chairman and 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee held a number of 
meetings with shareholders, including discussion of proposed 
amendments to the Executive Directors’ remuneration prior to  
the AGM.
The Directors receive regular updates on the Company’s major 
shareholders, and receive reports on shareholder feedback at each 
Board meeting. The Non-executive Directors are invited to attend 
the Company’s results presentations. 
Private shareholders may raise questions through the  
Company Secretary’s office either by telephone or by email 
(feedback@capitalandcounties.com).
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
The Chairman’s other business commitments are set out in his 
biography on page 55. The Board is satisﬁed that the Chairman’s 
additional commitments allow him to devote sufficient time to 
perform his duties as Chairman of Capco.
The Deputy Chairman is a Director of the Board of Capco’s joint 
venture in respect of the Lillie Square development. He receives  
no remuneration for this appointment. The Board considered this 
appointment carefully before conﬁrming its approval and remains 
satisﬁed that there is no conﬂict of interest and that the 
appointment does not compromise his independence.
On appointment, and each subsequent year, Non-executive 
Directors are required to conﬁrm in writing that they have 
sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. In addition,  
they are required to seek prior approval from the Chairman before 
taking on any additional external commitments which may affect 
their time available to devote to the Company , and the Board is 
advised of any changes.
The interests of new Directors are reviewed during the recruitment 
process and if appropriate authorised by the Board on appointment.
The Board is satisﬁed that all Non-executive Directors are 
contributing effectively to the operation of the Board.
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board to 
authorise potential conﬂicts of a Director’s interests that may arise. 
The Board has adopted a procedure under which Directors must 
notify the Chairman of any potential conﬂicts. The Chairman then 
decides whether a conﬂict exists and recommends its authorisation 
by the Board where appropriate. A Director who had a conﬂict of 
interest would not be counted in the quorum or entitled to vote 
when the Board considered the matter in which the Director had  
an interest.

Audit committee report
Henry Staunton, Chairman of the  
Audit Committee
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2014 Audit Committee Report. The Committee 
monitors and reports to the Board on all aspects of the Group’s ﬁnancial 
reporting, internal controls and risk management. This report provides an 
overview of the work undertaken by the Committee over the past year.
During 2014, the most signiﬁcant topics considered by the Committee 
included the Group’s property valuations, taxation, risk and a number of 
corporate transactions. Descriptions of the Committee’s work on these matters 
can be found on page 62.
Henry Staunton
Chairman of the Audit Committee, 26 February 2015
Members:
Henry Staunton (Chairman)
Ian Henderson
Andrew Strang
The Audit Committee, reporting to the Board,  
oversees the ﬁnancial reporting process, monitors  
the effectiveness of internal control, internal audit,  
risk management and the statutory audit and monitors 
the independence of the statutory auditors and the 
provision of non-audit services. As at 31 December 2014 
and the date of this report the Committee comprises 
three independent Non-executive Directors, and is 
chaired by Henry Staunton, who is considered to have 
signiﬁcant, recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience.
The Committee’s meetings were also attended by the 
Company’s Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance 
Director, General Counsel, Company Secretary and 
Financial Controller together with senior 
representatives of the external and internal auditors. 
The valuers and members of senior management, 
including the Director of Tax and Treasury , attended  
by invitation to present reports required for the 
Committee to discharge its responsibilities. 
The Audit Committee met three times during 2014. 
Attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on 
page 60. The Committee also met privately during the 
year with both the external and internal auditors. 
The Committee follows an annual programme, which  
is agreed with the Committee Chairman, management 
and external auditors prior to each ﬁnancial year, that 
ensures it gives thorough consideration to matters of 
particular importance to the Company , and additional 
matters are considered when appropriate. The 
Company’s 2014 agenda is shown in the table below, 
and the signiﬁcant matters considered by the 
Committee during the year are explained on page 62.

SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE DURING 2014
Matter considered What the Committee did
Valuations As in previous years, the independent external valuers presented the half-year and year-end 
valuations to the Committee. The Committee reviewed the methodology and component 
parts of the valuations, discussed the valuations with the external auditors and challenged 
the valuers on the assumptions used, which included how planning progress, increased cost 
certainty , residential sales values and the investment vehicle with TfL should be reﬂected. 
The Committee also obtained conﬁrmation that all information requested by the valuers had 
been provided by management. The Committee was satisﬁed that the approach taken by the 
valuers was appropriate. Please refer to note 16 on pages 114 to 117 in the notes to the accounts.
Deferred tax The Director of Tax and Treasury presented regular reports to the Committee, explained the 
basis of the Group’s tax position and updated the Committee on the on-going relationship 
with HMRC. The Committee challenged the assumptions made in arriving at the tax position 
and discussed with the external auditor the assumptions and judgements made in arriving at 
the deferred tax position. The Committee was satisﬁed that the policy was appropriate for the 
Group. Please refer to note 29 on page 129 in the notes to the accounts.
Signiﬁcant  
and complex 
transactions
The Committee received updates from the Financial Controller on signiﬁcant and complex 
transactions, including the accounting treatment of the investment vehicle with TfL and the 
CLSA. The Committee discussed the accounting treatments of each transaction with 
management and the external auditors and is satisﬁed that the appropriate approach has 
been taken. Further information on each matter is available within the Financial Review.
Risk The Committee reviews the Group’s risk register, the approach taken in its compilation and 
the proposed principal risk disclosures as explained on page 12 on an annual basis and 
ensures that they are consistent and appropriate. 
External and internal auditors
(a) External auditors
The Committee oversees the relationship with the 
external auditors, and is responsible for developing, 
implementing and monitoring the Company’s policy  
on external audit, and for monitoring the auditors’ 
independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical, 
professional and regulatory requirements. The external 
auditors are not permitted to perform any work that 
they may subsequently need to audit or which might 
either create a conﬂict of interest or affect the auditors’ 
objectivity and independence. Non-audit services are 
normally limited to assignments that are closely related 
to the annual audit or where the work is of such a nature 
that a detailed understanding of the Group is necessary .
Capco tendered its external audit contract in 2010, and 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) were appointed as 
Group auditors on an annual rolling contract. After the 
transitional period, Capco will comply with the 
forthcoming regulatory requirement that the external 
audit contract be tendered at least every 10 years. The 
Committee monitored PwC’s effectiveness and 
performance during 2014, and considered a paper 
prepared by the Financial Controller which conﬁrmed 
that in management’s view PwC were providing a high 
quality audit service and continued to deliver against  
all objectives considered at their appointment. The 
Committee is satisﬁed that the Group is receiving a 
robust and challenging objective audit and has therefore 
recommended to the Board that PwC be reappointed in 
2015. In compliance with the requirement that the audit 
partner responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits 
is rotated every ﬁve years, a new audit partner was 
assigned to the Group by PwC during 2014.
The external auditors have direct access to the Audit 
Committee Chairman should they wish to raise any 
concerns outside formal committee meetings.
(b) Internal auditors
Capco has appointed BDO LLP as its internal auditor. 
During 2014, BDO’s audit plan had a strategic focus and 
included reviews of anti-bribery policies, Lillie Square 
project management, provision of information to 
valuers, service charges, IT strategic planning, contract 
management, health and safety , lease incentives and 
accounts payable. The 2015 internal audit programme 
will include contract management, Lillie Square sales, 
treasury , cash management, bank covenants, anti-
bribery policies, payroll and health and safety . The 
Committee is satisﬁed that the internal auditor was 
independent and its services effective.
(c) Non-audit services
The Company has adopted a policy to ensure that the 
provision of non-audit services by the external auditors 
does not compromise their independence or objectivity . 
The policy requires prior approval by the Audit 
Committee Chairman for non-audit work with a cost 
exceeding the lower of £50,000 or 15 per cent of the 
estimated annual level of the auditors’ fees at that time. 
Approval is only given following a full and thorough 
assessment of the value case for using the auditor and 
the skills and experience the auditor would bring. 
Additionally , consideration must be given to the 
preservation of auditor independence, and the external 
auditors are required to conﬁrm that they are acting 
independently and must not audit their own work, 
make management decisions for the Company , create 
mutuality of interest, develop close personal 
Audit committee report continued Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 63 
relationships with the Company’s personnel or ﬁnd 
themselves in the role of advocate for the Company . The 
Committee is satisﬁed that the policy remains effective. 
The total fees paid and payable to PwC in 2014 were 
£442,000, of which £55,000 related to non-audit work. 
These fees primarily relate to corporate transactions. 
The Committee is satisﬁed that the external auditors 
remain independent and objective.
Internal control and risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk 
management framework and system of internal control 
and the on-going review of their effectiveness. A 
summary of the risk management framework is set out 
on page 12. The framework is designed to manage 
rather than eliminate risk, and can only provide 
reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
The Company has established processes to identify , 
evaluate and manage the signiﬁcant risks faced by the 
Group. These controls accord with the Turnbull 
guidance ‘Internal Control – Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code’ and remained in place up to the 
date of the approval of this Annual Report. The 
procedures are reviewed by the Board on an annual 
basis and will be subject to a detailed review in 2015 as 
the Company implements the provisions of the revised 
UK Corporate Governance Code published in 2014.
The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the 
Group’s internal controls and risk, and reports to the 
Board on its work and conclusions. 
The key elements of the Group’s day-to-day procedures 
and internal control framework are:
 – Schedule of matters reserved for the Board
 – Remit and terms of reference of Board Committees
 – Delegated authority limits
 – Documentation of signiﬁcant transactions
 – The Executive Directors are closely involved in  
the day-to-day operations of the business and  
hold regular meetings with senior management  
to review all aspects of the business, including risks 
and controls
 – The Board receives regular updates on strategy  
and project developments at Board meetings and 
Board updates
 – A whistleblowing procedure under which staff may 
raise matters of concern is in place. One matter was 
raised during the year. An investigation was 
conducted which concluded that no wrongdoing  
had occurred.
The Committee conducts an annual review of the 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls and 
considers reports provided by the Financial Controller, 
external auditor and internal auditor. The Committee is 
satisﬁed that the Group’s internal controls are 
operating effectively .
Speciﬁc controls relating to ﬁnancial reporting and 
consolidation processes include:
 – Management structure staffed by appropriate 
personnel, with clear lines of responsibility and 
accountability
 – A comprehensive budgeting and review system. The 
Board and Audit Committee receive regular reports 
from the Finance Director which include forecasts and 
performance against budget and ﬁnancial covenants 
 – The internal audit programme undertaken by BDO
 – Led by the Chief Executive, the Group ﬁnance team 
participates in the control self-assessment and policy 
compliance elements of the risk management 
framework and sets formal requirements with 
business unit ﬁnance functions which specify the 
reports and approvals required. BDO regularly 
reviews the effectiveness of internal controls and 
report its ﬁndings to the Audit Committee.
An annual risk management process is followed to 
identify risks and review the effectiveness of mitigating 
controls. All senior managers are responsible for 
managing and monitoring risks in their area of 
responsibility and recording these in the Group risk 
register. The Group risk register is reviewed by the 
Chief Executive and other Executive Directors. An 
assessment is made of the maximum risk exposure, 
taking into account parameters such as the risk 
category , the likelihood of the risk occurring, the 
mitigating controls and the consequence of the failure 
of controls. The risk register is reviewed twice a year 
and upon any material change to the business, with a 
full review being undertaken annually , at which point  
it is also reviewed by the Audit Committee with new  
or emerging risks considered by the Committee as 
appropriate. The Group’s principal risks and 
uncertainties are set out on pages 12 to 15. Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 64

Committee
Nomination committee report
I am pleased to introduce Capco’s 2014 Nomination Committee Report.
Following the work on succession planning reported in 2013, the Committee’s 
main focus in 2014 was on the recruitment of new Non-executive Directors, 
and I am pleased that Gerry Murphy will be joining the Board on 1 March 2015, 
bringing valuable skills and experience to the Board. 
A summary of the process followed in the recruitment of Gerry , and a 
description of the induction programme that will help ensure he quickly 
becomes familiar with Capco’s business are included in this report.
As I explained in my letter on page 7 , Andrew Huntley will be retiring from 
the Board at the Company’s forthcoming AGM and will step down from the 
Remuneration Committee on 1 March 2015. The Board is grateful for 
Andrew’s contribution to the Company since 2010.
Recognising the need to maintain the depth of property expertise on the 
Board, the Committee will continue its focus on Board composition in 2015.

NOMINATION 
COMMITTEE REPORT
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for 
making recommendations on Board appointments and 
succession to the Board.
The members of the Committee as at 31 December 2014 
and the date of this report are listed above. The 
Nomination Committee met twice during the year, and 
attendance at these meetings is shown in the table on 
page 60.
During 2014, The Zygos Partnership was engaged to assist 
with the recruitment of Non-executive Directors. The 
Zygos Partnership provides no other services to the Group.
Non-executive Director recruitment
Capco operates a rigorous and transparent recruitment 
process for new Directors. Following the Board succession 
planning undertaken in 2013, a review of the skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of Board 
members, and in anticipation of Andrew Huntley’s 
retirement from the Board, the Committee agreed that 
two new Non-executive Directors should be recruited, of 
whom at least one should have speciﬁc property expertise. 
The Zygos Partnership was appointed to assist with the 
recruitment process and a broad brief was provided to 
ensure that the long-list of candidates reﬂected 
diversity of both gender and experience. The Chairman 
and Chief Executive met with each of the short-listed 
candidates and provided regular updates to the 
Committee. Preferred candidates then met with each  
of the independent Non-executive Directors and the 
General Counsel, following which the Committee made 
a formal recommendation to the Board that Gerry 
Murphy be appointed as a Non-executive Director of 
Capco, and as a member of the Nomination Committee, 
Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee.
Work on the recruitment of an additional Non-
executive Director, who will have speciﬁc property 
experience, will continue during the early part of 2015.
Non-executive Director induction
An induction programme is provided for each new 
Non-executive Director, which is tailored depending on 
the Director’s experience and expected role on the Board. 
A typical induction programme for a Capco Non-executive 
Director will include individual meetings with the 
Chairman, Executive Directors, General Counsel, 
Company Secretary and members of senior management, 
site visits to Capco’s estates, and an introduction by the 
Chairman to the Company’s brokers, advisers and lawyers. 
The Director is also provided with copies of past Board 
and Committee papers and minutes, and individual 
brieﬁngs are arranged on topics such as Directors’ duties 
and responsibilities and the property market.
Non-executive Director development
The Chairman and the Committee together ensure that 
Directors keep their skills and knowledge up to date to 
allow them to fulﬁl their roles on the Board and Board 
Committees. The General Counsel and Company 
Secretary update the Board on legal and corporate  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 65 
governance matters, and information on 
training opportunities and seminars is 
regularly circulated to Directors. The 
Company also arranges periodic brieﬁngs 
from external advisers, and Directors receive 
regular business updates from the Executive 
Directors. Directors may also take 
independent advice at the Company’s 
expense where they feel this is appropriate.
Diversity
Diversity is important to Capco across the 
Group and we recognise the business 
beneﬁts of employing people with varied 
outlooks. We are keen to develop female 
talent and the ratio of women to men within 
Capco’s senior management team is 1:1. 
Further information on our people practices, 
including our learning and development 
strategies, is contained in the Corporate 
Responsibility Report on pages 47 and 48.
At present, Capco has one female Director. 
The Board does not feel that it is 
appropriate to set targets on gender 
diversity as all appointments must be  
made on merit; however, gender and wider 
diversity will continue to be taken into 
consideration when evaluating the skills, 
knowledge and experience desirable to ﬁll 
each Board vacancy .
Board composition and succession
The Committee will continue to focus  
on the recruitment of an additional Non-
executive Director in the early part of 2015, 
and expects to make a recommendation to the 
Board in due course. The Committee will also 
continue to consider Board succession and 
composition, and will make recommendations 
to the Board where appropriate.
Matters considered by the 
Committee during the year include:
 – Board and Committee composition 
including diversity
 – Non-executive Director 
recruitment
 – Non-executive Director time 
commitments
 – Board evaluation (described on 
page 59)
 – Committee terms of reference
 – Directors’ skills and training 
opportunities
Matters considered by the 
Committee during the year include:
 – CR reporting
 – The Company’s CR strategy
 – Updates on Group CR activity
 – Charitable donations and spend 
against budget
 – Brieﬁng on environmental matters 
at Lillie Square and the Earls Court 
demolition and waste 
management plan
 – Update on new legislation

Directors’ remuneration report
DIRECTORS’ 
REMUNERATION REPORT
Ian Henderson, Chairman of Remuneration Committee
ANNUAL STATEMENT
Dear Shareholder,
The key objectives for the Committee, as in previous 
years, are to ensure that the executive team is 
appropriately incentivised, and that the remuneration 
arrangements are fully aligned with the Company’s 
strategy to provide long-term market-leading returns 
to shareholders. Management incentives are linked to 
the KPIs which the Company uses to measure the 
creation and growth of value for shareholders. These 
KPIs are set out on page 11.
This year has been another strong year at Capco, 
which has been reﬂected in our incentive payments. 
NAV has grown year-on-year by c. 25 per cent and TPR 
growth was 2.6 per cent above the benchmark. This 
strong annual performance, combined with strong 
total shareholder return and total return over the last 
three years, resulted in the ﬁnancial element of the 
bonus paying out in full as all targets were exceeded, 
and the expected vesting of 93.1 per cent of the PSP 
and MSP awards granted in 2012.
As explained earlier in the Annual Report, Soumen 
Das and Gary Yardley have each been appointed as 
Managing Directors of the Company with effect from  
1 March 2015. These re-designated roles take account 
of the increased scale and expanding complexity of the 
business. Soumen Das will assume investment 
responsibility for the Covent Garden estate in addition 
to his current responsibilities as Chief Financial 
Officer. Gary Yardley will assume Board level oversight 
for the investment performance of Earls Court and 
Olympia, and will continue to lead new real estate 
investment activities as Chief Investment Officer.
As a result of these signiﬁcant role changes and 
increased responsibilities, the Remuneration 
Committee has decided to increase the base salary  
for both individuals. Gary Yardley’s base salary  
will increase in 2015 by 3 per cent above the increase 
for head office and Covent Garden staff to fully reﬂect 
the change in role. Soumen Das’ base salary increase 
will be phased over two years: the ﬁrst increase in 2015 
will be 3.2 per cent above the increase for head office 
and Covent Garden staff and the second increase in 
2016 will be subject to the Committee’s assessment of 
his performance in role.
Other decisions relating to 2015 remuneration 
included:
 – Annual bonus opportunity performance measures 
and weightings will remain unchanged; and
 – No exceptional awards will be made under the 
Performance Share Plan or Matching Share Plan.
The Committee noted that the strong property 
market, particularly in London, had increased  
demand for employees with experience in property 
development, and that this is placing pressure on our 
ability to attract and retain employees. This is reﬂected 
in the average salary increase awarded this year to head 
office and Covent Garden staff of 6.3 per cent.
The Committee keeps under review the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors against remuneration levels 
and structures at other property and development 
companies. The Company is a much larger and more 
complex business than when the current 
remuneration arrangements were put in place at 
demerger in 2010. These arrangements are too 
complicated and our Chief Executive’s base salary and 
normal incentive opportunity are materially below 
market levels. However, the Committee decided to 
suspend any increase in the Chief Executive’s salary in 
excess of the general workforce increase this year, even 
though it signalled its intent to do so in last year’s 
Annual Report on Remuneration.
Instead, the Committee has decided to consider all of 
these issues in a full review this year, together with all 
feedback received from shareholders on our 
remuneration policy . This review has been initiated to 
“ Our incentive payments reﬂect 
Capco’ s strong performance.” Governance Financial statements Strategic report

COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration 
Committee on behalf of the Board and complies 
with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK 
Listing Authority , Schedule 8 of the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. In accordance with 
Section 439 of the Companies Act, an advisory 
resolution to approve the above Annual Statement 
and the Annual Report on Remuneration for 2014 
will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting 
(‘AGM’) of the Company to be held on 1 May 2015. 
The information in this report subject to audit 
comprises the single ﬁgure of remuneration and 
associated detail, conﬁrmation that there were no 
payments for loss of office or to former Directors, the 
incentive achievement for 2014, the incentives to be 
awarded in 2015 and the details of Directors’ 
shareholdings and share interests.
1. POLICY REPORT
This section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets 
out Capco’s future remuneration policy . Details of actual 
remuneration paid, share awards made, and the approach 
to remuneration for 2015 are set out within the Annual 
Report on Remuneration which starts on page 74.
1.1 Remuneration policy
The key objectives of the Company’s remuneration policy 
are to:
• Strongly align executive and shareholder interests
• Underpin an effective pay-for-performance culture
• Support the retention, motivation and recruitment of 
talented people who are commercially astute
• Encourage executives to acquire and retain signiﬁcant 
holdings of Capco shares
The Committee aims to achieve an appropriate balance 
between ﬁxed and variable remuneration, and between 
variable remuneration based on short-term and longer-
term performance. Fixed remuneration includes base 
salary , beneﬁts and pension. Variable remuneration 
includes an annual bonus, half of which is deferred in 
shares and may be matched via the Matching Share Plan 
(MSP), co-investment under the MSP and awards under 
the Performance Share Plan (PSP).
The remuneration policy is aligned to the strategy and 
nature of the Company , and reﬂects the importance of 
total return and the long-term nature of Capco’s 
business, rewarding the Executive Directors for 
delivering strong performance against the Company’s 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
The Remuneration Committee is not proposing any 
amendments to the Company’s existing 
remuneration policy .
Details of each element of remuneration, their operation, 
purpose, link to strategy and performance metrics are set 
out in this section.
ensure that Capco remuneration policy remains 
aligned with shareholder interests, market practice 
and the revised UK Corporate Governance Code, 
and provides an effective incentive to achieve 
Capco’s strategic goals. The Committee has 
appointed new advisers, New Bridge Street, to 
advise it and help conduct this review, and will be 
consulting with its shareholders and leading 
voting agencies so that their views are considered 
in the formulation of policy .
Finally , in 2015 the membership of the Committee 
will change as Andrew Huntley will step down and 
Gerry Murphy will be appointed on 1 March 2015. 
This year, consistent with market practice, we are 
not submitting the remuneration policy for 
another vote at the 2015 AGM, and we will only  
ask shareholders to approve the Annual Report  
on Remuneration and this Annual Statement. 
However, we have included the remuneration 
policy in the Annual Report in order to provide 
clarity for our shareholders. The Committee looks 
forward to receiving your support for this advisory 
vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

1.2 Executive Director Policy Table
The table below summarises each of the components of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
Purpose and link to strategy Operation
Base Salary
To provide an appropriately 
competitive base salary , whilst placing 
emphasis on the performance related 
elements of remuneration.
The Committee believes base salary  
for high-performing experienced 
Executive Directors should be at  
least median. 
Base salaries are reviewed on an annual basis, with any increase taking effect from 1 April.
The Committee reviews base salaries with reference to:
• other property companies (including the constituents of the long-term incentive plans’ comparator group)
• UK companies of a similar size
• each Executive Director’s performance and contribution during the year
• scope of each Executive Director’s responsibilities
• changes to the remuneration and overall conditions of other employees
When reviewing base salaries, the Committee is mindful of the gearing effect that increases in base salary will 
have on the potential total remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Beneﬁts
To be appropriately competitive with 
those offered at comparator companies.
Beneﬁts will be in line with those offered to some or all employees and may include private dental and 
healthcare, life insurance, personal accident cover, travel insurance, income protection and a car allowance, 
currently paid in cash.
Other beneﬁts may be introduced from time to time to ensure the beneﬁts package is appropriately competitive 
and reﬂects individual circumstances. For example, Directors may be offered relocation and/or expatriate 
beneﬁts should a Director be required to relocate as a result of emerging business requirements.
Pension
To be appropriately competitive with 
that offered by comparator companies.
Capco offers a deﬁned contribution pension scheme.
Executive Directors may elect to be paid some or all of their entitlement in cash.
Annual Bonus
To incentivise and reward performance.
The Committee selects performance 
measures and targets each year to 
reinforce the strategic business 
priorities for the year.
The deferral of half of the bonus into 
shares is designed to further align 
executives with shareholders’ interests.
The annual bonus arrangements are reviewed prior to the start of each ﬁnancial year to ensure performance 
measures and weightings are appropriate and support the business strategy .
The Committee reviews performance against the annual bonus targets but has the ability to take into account 
broader factors and may exercise two-way discretion to ensure that the annual bonus awarded properly reﬂects 
the performance of the Company and each Director.
Adjudication of bonuses will be explained in the Directors’ Remuneration Report.
50 per cent of any bonus earned is deferred in Capco shares or nil-cost options for three years (under the MSP) 
subject to risk of forfeiture should an Executive Director leave the Company . Alternatively the Committee may 
invite Executive Directors to use 50 per cent of their net bonus to purchase shares in the Company which will be 
matched under the MSP and held for three years subject to equivalent restrictions.
Performance Share Plan “PSP”
To incentivise and reward long-term 
outperformance, and help retain 
Executive Directors over the  
longer term.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive awards under the PSP , which may be made as market value share 
options, shares, or nil-cost options, at the discretion of the Committee.
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁgures are  
a genuine reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.
Matching Share Plan “MSP”
To further align the interests of 
Executive Directors with those  
of shareholders.
To enable participants to enhance their 
long-term incentive opportunity by 
committing to signiﬁcant long-term 
investment in the Company .
To provide a link between short-term 
and long-term remuneration.
A matching award may be made in respect of deferred bonus described above.
Executive Directors may also be offered the opportunity to co-invest up to 150 per cent of salary in aggregate 
(across outstanding award cycles) under the MSP .
In assessing the outcome of the performance conditions, the Committee must satisfy itself that the ﬁgures are  
a genuine reﬂection of underlying ﬁnancial performance, and may exercise discretion when determining the 
proportion of an award that will vest.
All Employee Share Schemes
The Company does not currently operate any All Employee Share Schemes, however if such a scheme were 
introduced the Executive Directors would be able to participate on the same terms as other employees. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 69 
Maximum opportunity Performance metrics
Base salary increases will be applied in line with the outcome of the 
annual review and will normally be in line with increases awarded 
to other employees. However, the Committee may make additional 
adjustments in certain circumstances to reﬂect, for example, an 
increase in scope or responsibility , to address a gap in market 
positioning and/or to reward the long-term performance of an 
individual. The Chief Executive will have the highest base salary of 
all Executive Directors, and the maximum base salary for the Chief 
Executive will be within the top quartile of the Chief Executive 
salaries for the constituents of the long-term incentive schemes’ 
comparator group (current constituents listed on page 79).
The Committee considers individual and Company performance when setting  
base salary .
Set at a level which the Committee considers appropriate in light of 
relevant market practice for the role and individual circumstances. 
The cost of all beneﬁts will not exceed 10 per cent of base salary , with 
the exception of any future expatriate and/or relocation beneﬁts, 
which would be disclosed in the annual report on remuneration.
N/A
The maximum and current contribution rate for Executive 
Directors is 24 per cent of base salary .
N/A
The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is  
150 per cent of annual salary with a bonus of 75 per cent of salary 
payable for achieving target levels of performance. No bonus is 
payable for below threshold performance. The payment for 
threshold performance will not exceed 10 per cent of maximum. 
Awards are made on a straight-line basis for performance between 
threshold and target, and on a separate straight-line basis for 
performance between target and maximum.
Executives’ performance is measured relative to challenging targets in key ﬁnancial, 
operational and strategic measures. The measures selected and their weightings vary 
each year according to the strategic priorities.
At least 75 per cent of the bonus will be measured against ﬁnancial performance.
Measures and respective weightings used for the current annual bonus and proposed 
for next year’s annual bonus are set out in the annual report on remuneration on 
pages 76 and 77.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 70.
Each year participants may be granted up to 150 per cent of salary in 
shares or nil-cost options or up to 300 per cent of salary in market 
value share options.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can make awards of  
up to 200 per cent of salary in shares or nil-cost options or up to  
400 per cent of salary in market value share options.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that could 
warrant the granting of exceptional awards under incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests  
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made,  
25 per cent vests for median performance.
PSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the additional 
element of an exceptional award is subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment and the Company’s 
performance over a three-year performance period based:
• 50 per cent on relative Total Return (Net Asset Value growth plus dividends)
• 50 per cent on relative TSR
For both measures, performance is measured relative to a comparator group 
comprising the largest FTSE350 property companies.
The performance measures and weightings which apply to the PSP are reviewed by 
the Committee annually , and the Committee may make non-signiﬁcant changes to 
the weightings and/or comparator group to ensure that they remain relevant to the 
Company strategy and suitably stretching.
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those proposed 
for 2015 awards, are set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 78 and 79.
An explanation of how the performance measures were chosen and how the 
performance targets are set is given on page 70.
Participants may earn up to one matching share for each invested 
share, in normal circumstances.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee can award two 
matching shares for each invested share.
The Committee’s policy is to consider exceptional executive 
performance (in the year prior to grant) as a circumstance that could 
warrant the granting of exceptional awards under incentive plans.
For awards made under the usual scheme limit, 33 per cent vests  
for median performance. Where an exceptional award is made,  
16.5 per cent vests for median performance.
MSP awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, however the additional 
element of an exceptional award made in respect of deferred bonus is subject to a 
two-year post-vesting holding period.
The vesting of awards is subject to the same conditions as the PSP .
Details of the performance conditions for previous years’ awards, and those proposed 
for 2015 awards, are set out in the annual report on remuneration on pages 78 and 79.

performance targets are set is given on page 70.

1.3 Notes to the Policy Table
Performance measurement selection
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses 
depending on the Company’s ﬁnancial 
performance and their own individual 
performance. The current structure of the 
annual bonus performance conditions is 
illustrated within the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 77 . The ﬁnancial 
performance measures and the importance 
of each are set out in the table below.
The annual ﬁnancial performance targets 
are set by the Committee in the ﬁrst quarter 
of each year following an analysis of 
external and internal expectations 
compiled by the Committee’s independent 
adviser. The Committee sets targets it 
believes to be appropriately stretching,  
but achievable.
Long-term incentives
As mentioned above, the performance 
conditions are consistent for the MSP and 
PSP , which ensures that the interests of 
participants in different plans are aligned, 
and comprise two measures:
• Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
• Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee believes that these two 
measures are the most appropriate 
measures of long-term success for Capco as 
long-term relative performance provides an 
appropriately objective and relevant 
measure of Capco’s success which is strongly 
aligned with shareholders’ interests.
The Committee believes that NAV growth  
is the most important internal measure of 
success for Capco at this time. Accordingly , 
the Committee considered it appropriate  
to reward NAV performance in both the 
short and long-term incentive 
arrangements, with one-year absolute  
NAV growth being used in respect of the 
annual bonus arrangements and three-year 
relative NAV (as the main component  
of three-year Total Return) being used in 
respect of the long-term incentives. NAV  
is used as a performance measure by over 
half of FTSE350 property companies in 
their long-term incentive arrangements.
Relative TSR helps align the interests of 
Executive Directors with shareholders by 
incentivising share price growth and, in the 
Committee’s view , provides an objective 
measure of the Company’s long-term success.
Performance is measured relative to a 
comparator group comprising the largest 
FTSE350 property companies and Capco. 
The members of the comparator group are 
shown in Figure 4 on page 79.
In order for any awards to vest, the 
Committee must also satisfy itself that the 
TR and TSR ﬁgures are a genuine reﬂection 
of underlying ﬁnancial performance. In 
assessing the extent to which the 
performance conditions have been met, the 
Committee consults with its independent 
remuneration adviser. The calculation  
of the returns is also reviewed by the 
Company’s auditors as appropriate.
The performance targets are set by the 
Committee following an analysis of internal 
and external expectations, and are believed 
to be appropriately stretching.
The current structure of the long-term 
incentive performance conditions is 
illustrated within the Annual Report on 
Remuneration on page 79.
Payments resulting from existing 
arrangements
Executive Directors are eligible to receive 
payment resulting from contractual 
arrangements entered into or the vesting of 
any award made prior to the approval and 
implementation of the remuneration policy 
detailed in this report.
Bonus malus
Awards granted from 2013 (other than 
awards made in respect of the 2012 ﬁnancial 
year) are subject to bonus malus in the event 
of gross misconduct of a Director which is 
considered to have had a material 
detrimental impact on the business of any 
Group company or to have brought the 
business of such company into signiﬁcant 
disrepute, or in the event that the prior 
ﬁnancial statements of any Group company 
or any business unit or division of any 
Group company are materially restated, 
corrected or amended. The application of 
any malus is at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
Why is each performance measure appropriate for Capco?
Measure Reason
Growth in Net Asset Value  
per share
Considered by the Committee to be the most important driver of value creation for Capco at the present time.
Relative Total Property Return Rewards the additional portfolio value created by management over and above any changes in value from tracking the 
property market as a whole, as measured by IPD.
Earnings Per Share Rewards value growth in net rental income as well as the management of ﬁnancing and other costs. However, given 
the current stage of the Company’s development, the Committee considers EPS to be less relevant as an indicator of 
value creation than growth in Net Asset Value per share. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 71 
Remuneration of employees below  
the Board
The policy and practice with regard to the 
remuneration of head office and Covent 
Garden employees below the Board is 
consistent with that for the Executive 
Directors, except as set out below. 
Employees below Board level have not,  
to date, participated in the MSP but do 
participate in the PSP with awards being 
subject to the same performance conditions 
as apply to awards made to Executive 
Directors (with the exception of the 
conditions that apply to any exceptional 
portion of an award made to an Executive 
Director). The 2015 awards for employees 
below the Board will be subject to the same 
performance conditions as previous years’ 
awards. In exceptional circumstances, such 
as recruitment, long-term incentive awards 
may be granted without performance 
conditions to participants below the Board. 
The pension contribution rate for employees 
below the Board is lower than that for 
Executive Directors. 
Employees below the Board are not  
subject to any minimum shareholding 
requirement. 
The Venues business has separate 
remuneration arrangements appropriate 
for that business. These comprise salary , 
separate pension arrangements and 
discretionary bonuses. 
Shareholding guidelines
The Chief Executive is required to achieve a 
shareholding in the Company equivalent to 
300 per cent of salary and the other 
Executive Directors are required to achieve 
a shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved 
by retaining at least 50 per cent of any 
vested share awards (net of tax) and/or 
within three years. The Committee believes 
that these shareholding requirements are 
the most stringent in the listed property 
sector in the UK. The current shareholdings 
of the Executive Directors are set out on 
page 83. The Chairman is required to 
maintain a shareholding in the Company 
equivalent to 100 per cent of his base fee.
1.4 Performance scenario charts
The potential reward opportunities 
illustrated in Figure 1 are based on the 
policy which will apply in 2015, applied  
to the base salary at the salary review date,  
1 April 2015, and provide estimates of  
the potential future reward opportunity  
 
for each Executive Director, and the 
potential split between the different 
elements of remuneration under three 
different performance scenarios: ‘Below 
Threshold’ , ‘Target’ and ‘Maximum’ . 
The Below Threshold scenario includes base 
salary , pension and beneﬁts (ﬁxed pay). No 
annual bonus or PSP and MSP elements are 
included (variable pay). The Target scenario 
includes ﬁxed pay , on target bonus and 
threshold vesting of PSP and MSP awards. 
The Maximum scenario includes ﬁxed pay , 
maximum bonus and full vesting of PSP 
and MSP awards. For variable pay , the 
amounts illustrated are the normal 
maximum opportunities, except for the 
2013 MSP co-investment matching 
opportunity which is based on an 
exceptional match on an annualised 
co-investment of 50 per cent of salary .
It should be noted that the PSP and MSP 
awards granted in a year do not normally 
vest until the third anniversary of the date 
of grant. The projected values of long-term 
incentives shown here exclude the impact 
of share price movement and dividends.

1.5 Approach to recruitment remuneration
When hiring or appointing a new Executive Director, the Committee may make use of any of the existing components of remuneration,  
as follows:
Element of remuneration Policy on recruitment Maximum opportunity
Salary Based on scope and nature of responsibilities of the proposed role; the 
candidate’s experience; implications for total remuneration positioning vs.
market pay levels for comparable roles; internal relativities; and the candidate’s 
current salary .
N/A
Pension On a similar basis to other Executive Directors.
Beneﬁts Appropriate beneﬁts will be provided, which may include the continuation of 
beneﬁts received in a previous role. 
Annual Bonus Executive Directors will participate in the annual bonus scheme on the same 
basis as existing Executive Directors, pro-rated for proportion of year served.
Normal policy table limits may 
be exceeded on recruitment in 
exceptional circumstances. The 
maximum additional bonus 
opportunity will be limited to  
50 per cent of salary
Matching Share Plan* New Executive Directors may participate in the MSP on similar terms to other 
executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Performance Share Plan* New Executive Directors may be granted awards under the PSP on similar terms 
to other executives.
As per the normal policy table.
Other In determining appropriate remuneration for new Executive Directors, the 
Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including quantum, 
the nature of remuneration and where the candidate was recruited from) to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best interests of Capco and its shareholders.
Remuneration may include:
• An award made in respect of a new appointment to “buy out” existing incentive 
awards forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In such cases the compensatory 
award would typically be a like-for-like award with similar time-to-vesting, 
performance conditions and likelihood of those conditions being met. The fair 
value of the compensatory award would not be greater than the awards being 
replaced. To facilitate such a buyout, the Committee may use an award under a 
different structure or an additional award under the PSP or MSP .
• A relocation package, should this be required. 
• In the event that an employee is promoted to the Board, the Company would 
honour any existing contractual arrangements.
* Awards are subject to performance conditions.
1.6 Service contracts and exit payment policy
The service contracts of Executive Directors are approved by the Remuneration Committee and are one-year rolling contracts. The current 
contracts commenced on 17 May 2010. The service contracts may be terminated by either party giving one year’s notice to the other. It is the 
Company’s policy that termination payments should not exceed the Director’s current salary and beneﬁts for the notice period.
Where a Director may be entitled to pursue a claim against the Company in respect of his/her statutory employment rights or any other 
claim arising from the employment or its termination, the Committee will be entitled to enter into a settlement agreement with the 
Director. The Company may pay a Director’s legal fees in relation to any settlement agreement. 
When considering exit payments, the Committee reviews all potential incentive outcomes to ensure they are fair to both shareholders and 
participants. Any annual bonus payment in respect of the year of termination is subject to the discretion of the Committee.

The table below summarises how MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁc leaver circumstances, with the ﬁnal treatment 
remaining subject to the Committee’s discretion:
Reason for leaving Timing of vesting Treatment of awards
Good leaver Normal vesting date, although 
the Committee has discretion to 
accelerate
Payments are pro-rated for time and remain subject to outstanding performance 
conditions. Where vesting is accelerated, payments are further pro-rated to reﬂect the 
extent to which the performance conditions had been satisﬁed at the date of leaving.
Change of control Immediately Except in certain cases which were set out in full in the Company’s prospectus dated 12 
March 2010, vesting will be pro-rated for time and remain subject to performance 
conditions. However, the Committee has discretion to allow awards to vest in full in such 
circumstances if it deems this to be fair and reasonable.
Any other reason Awards lapse
An individual would generally be considered a ‘good leaver’ if they left the Group’s employment by reason of injury , ill-health, disability 
approved by the Committee, redundancy or retirement with the agreement of the employing company . The table above summarises how 
MSP and PSP awards are typically treated in speciﬁc leaver circumstances, with the ﬁnal treatment remaining subject to the Committee’s 
discretion, for example an individual may be considered a ‘good leaver’ for any other reason at the absolute discretion of the Committee, 
and the vesting of awards may be reduced for ‘good leavers’. 
There are no obligations on the Company contained within the existing Directors’ service contracts which would give rise to payments not 
disclosed in this report.
The service contracts of any future-appointed Directors will provide for mitigation in the event of termination.
1.7 Non-executive Director Policy Table
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment. The letters of appointment of the 
Non-executive Directors are reviewed by the Board annually and contain a one month notice period. The Chairman’s letter of appointment 
contains a 12 month notice period. 
Non-executive Directors’ dates of appointment and unexpired terms:

1.8 External Directorships
The Company’s policy is to encourage each 
Executive Director to take up one or more 
Non-executive Directorships, subject to 
Board approval. Fees received for serving  
as a Non-executive Director of a company 
outside the Capco Group are retained by  
the Executive Director. Details of current 
external appointments are set out on  
pages 54 and 55.
1.9 Consideration of conditions 
elsewhere in the Company
When setting Executive Director pay the 
Committee considers the remuneration and 
overall conditions of all employees. The 
Committee does not consult with employees 
when deciding remuneration policy , but it 
receives regular updates from the HR 
Director on salary increases, bonus and share 
awards made to Group employees and is  
 
 
aware of how the remuneration of Directors 
compares to that of other employees, for 
example, salary increases are generally in line 
with increases awarded to other employees, 
which are set with reference to market data. 
1.10 Consideration of shareholder views
It is the Committee’s policy to consult with 
major shareholders as appropriate, for 
example, prior to ﬁnalising any major 
changes to its executive remuneration policy .
2. ANNUAL REPORT ON 
REMUNERATION
This section of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report explains how 
Capco’s remuneration policy has been 
implemented during the year.
2.1 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
responsible for determining and 
recommending to the Board the policy for 
the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors, setting targets for the Company’s 
incentive schemes and determining the 
total individual remuneration package for 
each Executive Director. Membership of 
the Committee as at 31 December 2014 and 
the date of this report is set out on page 67. 
In addition, the Company Chairman, Chief 
Executive, Company Secretary and the 
Director of HR & CR are invited to attend 
Committee meetings and contribute, 
except on matters relating to their own 
remuneration. Attendance at the six 
meetings held during the year is shown  
in the table on page 60 and a summary of 
the matters considered by the Committee 
during the year is set out in the adjacent 
shaded box in column 3.
2.2 Remuneration Committee and  
its advisers
In 2014, the Committee appointed New 
Bridge Street as its independent 
remuneration adviser following a 
competitive process. During the year, the 
Committee received advice on matters 
including remuneration structure, 
incentive design and target setting from 
Kepler Associates until they were replaced, 
and then from New Bridge Street. Both 
advisers are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and adhere to its code 
of conduct. The Committee has received 
conﬁrmation of independence from New 
Bridge Street and Kepler, and is satisﬁed 
that the advice received was objective and 
independent. In addition to advice 
provided to the Committee, these advisers 
also provided share award valuation 
services to the Company . During 2014, the 
Company was charged a total of £82,731  
by Kepler Associates and £28,940 by  
New Bridge Street in respect of advice  
to the Committee. Fees were charged on  
a time basis.
2.3 Statement of shareholder voting
The table below shows the results of the 
binding vote on our Directors’ 
remuneration policy and the advisory vote 
on the 2013 Directors’ Remuneration Report 
at the 2 May 2014 AGM. 
As in prior years, we consulted with 
shareholders before the AGM and we 
received a range of views on our 
remuneration arrangements. Our major 
shareholders were supportive of the 
arrangements and of certain elements of 
developing best practice such as the 
inclusion of a two-year holding period for 
exceptional awards granted under the PSP 
and MSP . However, some issues were raised 
by other shareholders which included:
• Policy report: ability to grant exceptional 
awards
• Annual Report on Remuneration: Chief 
Executive salary increase above that 
provided to the general workforce and 
the use of the exceptional award limits 
for the PSP and MSP . 
The Committee has considered this feedback 
together with developing best practice. For 
example, the Committee considered the 
introduction of a two-year holding period for 
all PSP and MSP awards and it has decided to 
consider this issue as part of the review of 
remuneration which will be conducted in 
2015. This review of remuneration, which has 
been discussed in the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman’s Annual Statement on 
pages 66 and 67 , will cover the issues raised 
by shareholders in 2014, and as part of the 
review process we will be increasing our 
engagement with shareholders to ensure that 
their feedback is taken into account when 
formulating any revised policy .
Matters considered by the Committee 
over the past year include:
• Executive Director remuneration
• Shareholder discussion meetings
• Appointment of Remuneration 
advisers
• Directors’ Remuneration Report
• Committee terms of reference
• Institutional investor voting reports 
and voting at 2014 AGM
• Setting of and evaluation of 
performance against Executive 
Directors’ performance targets 
• Annual bonus structure and 
application across the Group
• Share scheme awards and 
performance targets
• Chairman and Chief Executive’s 
expenses

2  In the 2014 table, this comprises the expected value on vesting of the 2012 PSP and MSP awards which have a performance period that ran from 2012 to 2014, and are expected to vest 
in early 2015. The value on vesting of these awards has been included in the 2014 single ﬁgure as the performance conditions relating to these awards had been substantially (but not 
fully) completed during 2014, and has been calculated assuming 93.1 per cent vesting and using the average share price for the last three months of 2014, being £3.464. As required 
under the remuneration regulations, the 2013 multi-year variable comparators (which were previously disclosed on the basis described above assuming full vesting and using a price 
of £3.368) have been restated with values calculated using the actual share prices on the dates that the awards vested, which were £3.451 and £3.529.
3 Comprises payments in lieu of pension contributions.

2.5 Incentive outcomes in respect of the 
year ended 31 December 2014
Annual Bonus Scheme
Executive Directors may earn bonuses of up  
to 150 per cent of salary depending on the 
Company’s ﬁnancial performance and their 
own individual performance. Awards are 
based 75 per cent on ﬁnancial performance, 
and 25 per cent on individual performance. 
The ﬁnancial performance element for the year 
ended 31 December 2014 was based on growth 
in absolute NAV per share (NAV), Total 
Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index (TPR), and adjusted 
EPS (EPS). In determining the annual targets 
for these measures in 2014, the Committee 
recognised the long-term nature of some 
aspects of the Company’ s strategy , and the 
extent to which this would be reﬂected in these 
measures on a 12-month horizon. The 
performance measures, weightings and targets 
that applied in respect of the 2014 annual 
bonus are summarised in the table on page 77 . 
The TPR target is included in the Company’s 
KPIs on page 11. The KPIs are in part 
dependent upon the occurrence of certain 
discrete events. Therefore, whilst the 
out-performance targets that apply to the 
long-term incentives are disclosed, the Board 
has decided that prospective disclosure of 
speciﬁc short-term NAV and EPS targets 
would provide a level of information to 
counterparties that could prejudice the 
Company’s commercial interests. 
The Committee has previously committed  
to publish the ﬁnancial performance targets 
once they cease to be commercially sensitive. 
The ﬁnancial performance targets that applied 
in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 
are no longer commercially sensitive; 
accordingly , the targets and the Company’s 
performance against these targets are set  
out on the following page. The 2012 annual 
bonus awards were based 50 per cent on 
ﬁnancial performance and 50 per cent on 
individual performance.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2014, 
the Company performed strongly against its 
ﬁnancial targets, for example NAV per share 
was over 10 per cent higher than the top end of 
the target range set by the Committee, Total 
Property Return at 21.9 per cent compares to 
19.3 per cent for the IPD index, and EPS of 1.6p 
was around 7 per cent above our maximum 
target. Accordingly awards of 112.5 per cent of 
salary were made to each Executive Director in 
respect of the ﬁnancial performance measures. 
The Committee assessed individual 
performance against a set of KPIs which align 
with the Company’s objectives outlined on 
page 10 of the Annual Report. 
These KPIs include:
• Corporate objectives: enhancing Capco’s 
position and reputation in the market; 
progress towards meeting medium-term 
corporate objectives;
• Financial objectives: optimising liquidity 
and ﬁnancing; effective cost and capital 
expenditure management; other  
budgeted KPIs;
• Investment objectives: strategic investment 
initiatives; establishment of JVs; 
implementation of business plans; 
achievement of planning targets; and
• CR/HR objectives: optimisation of 
divisional structure; nurturing of future 
leaders; evolution of environmental targets.
The performance of the Executive Directors in 
2014 was considered to have been excellent, 
including the achievement of record rental 
levels at Covent Garden, the Covent Garden 
reﬁnancing and US Private Placement, the 
9.99 per cent equity placing, the establishment 
of the investment vehicle with TfL, the launch

Directors’ remuneration report continued
of Lillie Square, the transition of the venues 
business to Olympia, and securing detailed 
planning consent for Earls Court Village and 
residential consent for the Empress State 
Building. Accordingly , awards of between 30.6 
and 34.7 per cent of salary were made to each 
Executive Director in respect of the individual 
performance measures.
Performance Share Plan (PSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the PSP are explained in 
the remuneration policy on pages 68 and 69. 
Details of the awards made to Executive 
Directors under the PSP in 2014 and in past 
years are set out in the tables on pages 84 and 
85. Since 2011, in line with common market 
practice, with the exception of awards made 
under the HMRC approved schedule to the 
PSP , the Committee has made awards to 
Executive Directors in nil cost options which 
utilise a lower proportion of the Company’s 
share capital than market value share options.
In 2014, an award of 150 per cent of salary 
was made to Executive Directors in nil-cost 
options and the Committee has decided 
that the same level of award will be made in 
2015. In 2014, the Committee determined 
that the performance conditions relating to 
the market value options awarded under 
the PSP in 2011 had been satisﬁed and 
accordingly the awards vested in full.
Details of the performance conditions that 
apply to awards made under the PSP are set 
out in Figure 4 on page 79. The Committee 
continues to explore ways of structuring 
future awards under the long-term 
incentive arrangements in a potentially 
more tax efficient manner for participants. 
The Committee will ensure that any 
changes are cost neutral to Capco. No 
changes are proposed at this time.
2.6 Long-term incentive performance 
conditions
As explained in the policy report, the 
current performance conditions are the 
same for both the MSP and PSP and 
comprise two equally weighted measures:
• Three-year relative Total Return (TR, 
growth in NAV per share plus dividends)
• Three-year relative Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR, increase in price of an 
ordinary share plus dividends)
The Committee has reviewed the 
performance conditions for the PSP and 
MSP and concluded that the existing 
performance measures are believed to be 
appropriately stretching and remain 
appropriate. The Committee believes 
relative TSR outperformance of +4 per cent 
per annum to be broadly equivalent to an 
upper quartile level of performance. 
The performance conditions for the MSP 
and PSP awards are illustrated in Figure 4 
on page 79.
2.7 Vesting of 2011 and 2012 MSP and 
PSP awards (Audited)
In 2014, having considered a report prepared 
by the Company’s auditors, the Committee 
determined that Capco’s Total Shareholder 
Return had outperformed the median of the 
comparator group by more than 14 per cent 
p.a. (vs. an outperformance target of 4 per 
cent), and that Capco’s Total Return had 
outperformed the median of the comparator 
group by more than 8 per cent p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 2.5 per cent p.a.) 
and as such the 2011 PSP and MSP awards 
vested or, where holding periods apply , will 
vest in full subject to continued employment 
on the third anniversary of grant.
In 2015, the Committee determined that 
Capco’s Total Return was expected to 
outperform the median of the comparator 
group by 9.6 per cent p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 2.5 per cent), and 
that Capco’s Total Shareholder Return was 
expected to outperform the median of the 
comparator group by 3.2 per cent p.a. (vs. an 
outperformance target of 4 per cent), and as 
such the performance conditions relating to 
the 2012 PSP and MSP awards had been met 
in part. Accordingly 93.1 per cent of the 2012 
PSP and MSP awards are expected to vest, 
subject to continued employment on the 
third anniversary of grant. 
Long-term Incentive Arrangements
Matching Share Plan (MSP)
The operation of, and the maximum 
opportunities under, the MSP are explained 
in the remuneration policy on pages 68 and 
69. Details of the awards made to Executive 
Directors under the MSP in 2014 and in past 
years are set out in tables on pages 84 and 85. 
These awards include deferred bonus shares, 
and matching awards made in respect of 
deferred bonus and co-investment, in 
accordance with the remuneration policy .
Annual bonus: The Committee has awarded 
a normal 1:1 matching opportunity in 
respect of Directors’ deferred bonus shares 
for 2014. 
Co-investment opportunity: In 2010 (the 
inception year of Capco), Executive 
Directors were invited to co-invest up to  
150 per cent of salary in the Company’s 
shares during the ﬁrst 12 months of 
inception (subsequently extended to 24 
months as the Company was subject to 
extended restricted periods during which 
Directors were unable to purchase Capco 
shares) in return for the opportunity to 
receive up to two shares for each share 
purchased, subject to three-year 
performance. The Committee considered 
that the MSP had been highly successful 
and had played a crucial role in motivating 
and retaining management. Accordingly , 
and in light of the Company’s strong 
performance since 2010, which signiﬁcantly 
exceeded the maximum level of 
performance rewarded under the original 
performance conditions, the Committee 
offered the Executive Directors in 2013 an 
opportunity to invest up to 150 per cent of 
2013 salary between 2013 and 2016 when 
permitted by scheme headroom with an 
exceptional matching opportunity of 2:1. 
The additional matching opportunity can 
only be earned for performance above the 
normal stretch targets, as illustrated in 
Figure 4 on page 79. The MSP awards made 
in respect of co-investment under this 
invitation to date are set out on page 85. Governance Financial statements Strategic report

2.10 External Non-executive 
Directorships
During the year, Ian Hawksworth received a 
fee of £28,750 in respect of his Non-executive 
Directorship of AIM-listed Japan Residential 
Investment Company Limited. No other 
Executive Director currently serves as a 
Non-executive Director elsewhere.
2.11 Statement of implementation of 
policy for 2015
Salary
The Executive Directors’ salaries are 
reviewed annually .
The current salary positioning of the Chief 
Executive remains below the level that the 
Committee believes to be appropriate for the 
contribution and experience of the individual 
concerned and is also below market levels 
when compared to property and development 
companies of similar size. However, the 
Committee has decided to address this issue 
as part of the 2015 review of remuneration, 
and for 2015 will increase the salary of the 
Chief Executive by 6.3 per cent which is in 
line with the increase expected to be applied 
to the head office and Covent Garden staff.  
In setting the 2015 salaries of the Managing 
Directors, the Committee took advice from  
its remuneration adviser, and considered the 
increased scope of each role, each Director’s 
current experience, and market data. The 
salary of the Managing Director & Chief 
Investment Officer will be increased by 
approximately 9.3 per cent to £500,000. The

approximately 9.5 per cent to £410,000, and 
there will be a second increase in 2016 to 
£450,000, subject to the Committee’s 
assessment of his performance in role.

Pension and beneﬁts
As described in the policy table on pages 68 
and 69.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus opportunity will remain 
unchanged for 2015.
The ﬁnancial performance targets for the 
year ended 31 December 2014 were based on 
growth in absolute NAV per share, Total 
Property Return relative to the IPD Total 
Return All Property Index, and adjusted 
EPS. The Committee has decided that these 
measures remain appropriate for 2015 as 
they reﬂect the KPIs by which the Company 
measures its success. Further information 
on the Company’s KPIs can be found on 
page 11. The weightings of each ﬁnancial 
measure are unchanged from 2014 and 
reﬂect the Committee’s view of their 
relative importance for 2015 given the 
current stage in the execution of Capco’s 
strategy . The key area of focus for 2015 
continues to be capital growth. The 
Committee has decided that the 2015 
annual bonus targets should not be 
disclosed prospectively due to commercial 
sensitivity . The Committee expects to 
publish the performance targets 
retrospectively once they have ceased to be 
commercially sensitive.

2.15 Statement of Directors’ shareholdings and share interests
(a) Directors’ shareholdings
The beneﬁcial interests in the shares of the Company for each Director who served during the year are set out in the table below. The Chief 
Executive is required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 300 per cent of salary and the other Executive Directors are 
required to achieve a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary , to be achieved by retaining at least 50 per cent 
of any vested share awards (net of tax) and/or within three years. The Chairman is required to maintain a shareholding equivalent to 100 
per cent of his base fee. The Committee believes that these shareholding requirements, which have been met, are the most stringent in the 
UK property sector. The current shareholdings of the Chairman and Executive Directors are illustrated in Figure 7 .

Directors’ responsibilities 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
& Accounts, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared 
the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union. Under company law the Directors 
must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group 
and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to: 
(a)  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
(b)  make judgements and accounting estimates that are  
reasonable and prudent; 
(c)  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union (EU) have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the financial  
statements; and  
(d)  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy at any time,  
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps 
for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in the 
Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: 
– the Group financial statements, which have been prepared  
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true  
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position  
and profit of the Group; and 
– the Directors’ report contained includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that it faces. 
– having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought  
to the attention of the Board during the year into account, the 
Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as  
a whole are fair, balanced and understandable. The Directors 
believe that the disclosures set out in of the Annual Report & 
Accounts provide the information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. 
 
Signed on behalf of the Board on 26 February 2015.

Our audit approach 
Overview 
Materiality Overall Group materiality: £31 million which represents 1% of total assets. 
Audit scope We audited the complete financial information of each of the Group’s four business lines of which Covent Garden,  
Earls Court and Venues are financially significant.  
Area of focus Valuation of central London investment and development properties. 
 Taxation 
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).We designed  
our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular,  
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved 
making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of 
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented  
a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.  
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort,  
are identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in order  
to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures should be  
read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.  
   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 90 
Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Capital & Counties Properties PLC continued 
Area of focus   How our audit addressed the area of focus 
Valuation of central London investment and  
development properties 
Refer to page 61 to 63 (Audit committee report), page 100 to 105 
(Principal accounting policies) and page 100 to 139 (Notes to  
the accounts). 
The valuation of the Group’s investment and development properties  
is the key component of the net asset value and underpins the  
Group’s result for the year. The result of the revaluation this year  
was a gain of £454m (2013: £304m), which is accounted for within 
‘Gain on revaluation and sale of investment and development property’ 
and is a significant component of total consolidated income. 
The Group’s property portfolios, which comprise investment property 
(including, retail, restaurants, offices, exhibition and residential) and 
development property located in central London are not uniform in 
nature, and therefore a number of different assumptions are made  
by the Group’s external valuers in determining fair value: 
 Investment properties – The valuation of investment properties 
(principally Covent Garden) is inherently subjective, due principally 
to the individual nature of each property (including its location)  
which heavily influences the future rental it is expected to generate. 
The assumptions on which the property values are based are 
influenced by tenure and tenancy details for each property, 
prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions. 
 Development properties – The valuation of development property  
is also inherently subjective. For development properties (principally 
Earls Court), these are valued using the residual appraisal method 
(i.e. by estimating the fair value of the completed project using either 
a sales comparison or income capitalisation method less estimated 
costs to completion and a market based profit margin providing  
a return on development risk). 
The valuations were carried out by third party valuers, Jones Lang 
LaSalle and CB Richard Ellis (the “Valuers”). They were engaged by  
the Directors, in accordance with the RICS Valuation – Professional 
Standards (“RICS”). The Valuers used by the Group are well-known 
firms, with considerable experience of the Group’s market.  
The fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property 
valuations, when aggregated, could result in a material misstatement, 
warrants specific audit focus on this area.  
Experience of Valuers and relevance of their work 
We read the Valuers’ reports from CB Richard Ellis which covers 
approximately two thirds of the total property valuation and Jones Lang 
LaSalle covering the remainder of the portfolio. We confirmed that  
the approaches used were consistent with RICS and the requirements 
of IFRS. We assessed the Valuers’ competence and capabilities  
and read their terms of engagement with the Group, determining that 
there were no matters that affected their independence and objectivity 
or imposed scope limitations upon them.  
Data provided to the Valuers 
For investment properties we sample tested data provided to the  
Valuers by management and found that it was accurate and reliable. 
This data included tenancy schedules, capital expenditure details, 
acquisition cost schedules and square footage details which we agreed 
back to appropriate supporting documentation. For development 
properties we agreed that the planned schemes being valued were 
consistent with the actual planned developments in place. 
Assumptions and estimates used by the Valuers 
We met with the Valuers independently of management and 
challenged the valuation methods and assumptions used. The nature  
of assumptions used varied across the portfolio depending on the  
nature of each property but they included, estimated capital values, 
investment yields, construction costs and developers margins. In each 
of these areas, and on a sample basis, we compared the estimates  
and assumptions used by the Valuers against our own expectations 
using evidence of comparable market transactions. Where we 
identified estimates and assumptions that were outside the typical 
ranges used, we discussed these with the Valuers to understand the 
rationale and then assessed, based on all the available evidence  
and our experience in this sector, whether the use of the estimate or 
assumption was justified. 
Our testing indicated that the estimates and assumptions used were 
justified in the context of the Group’s property portfolio. 
Taxation 
Refer to page 61 to 63 (Audit committee report), page 100 to 105 
(Principal accounting policies) and page 100 to 139 (Notes to the 
accounts). 
Tax is a specific risk for the Group due to the degree of judgement 
involved in some of the on-going activities of the Group at Earls Court 
and Covent Garden. This gives rise to material tax considerations on 
the calculation, recognition, and classification of current and deferred 
tax balances from both a tax compliance and accounting perspective. 
Judgements are made by management to arrive at the current and 
deferred tax position. These judgements include the impact of the 
transfer of investment property to trading property on the Covent 
Garden residential conversions and the Group holding structure.  
We assessed the principal assumptions and judgements made in 
arriving at the current and deferred tax position by using our  
experience of similar matters in the industry.  
We used our tax expertise to evaluate tax provisions and potential 
exposures as at 31 December 2014, challenging the Group’s 
assumptions and judgements through our knowledge of the tax 
circumstances and by reading relevant correspondence between  
the Group and Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs and the Group’s 
external tax advisors.  
Our testing did not identify any matters that the Directors had  
not adequately reflected in their calculation of the necessary current  
and deferred tax provisions.

How we tailored the audit scope 
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements  
as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which 
the Group operates.  
The Group is structured along four business lines, being Covent Garden, Earls Court Properties (including the Lillie Square development), 
Venues and Other (including the discontinued operation, The Great Capital Partnership), each of which is a reporting unit. The Group 
engagement team audited all business lines except Venues, where the detailed audit procedures were performed by a separate engagement 
team. The Group team issued the Venues audit team with detailed instructions that explained the work that the Venues audit team needed 
to do and highlighted, in particular, the areas of focus insofar as they were relevant to the Venues business line. Throughout the audit, the 
Group team communicated with the Venues team to make sure that we obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence to form a basis for 
our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality 
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality.  
These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of  
our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.  
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: 
Overall Group materiality £31 million (2013: £23 million). 
How we determined it 1% of total assets. 
Rationale for benchmark applied The key area of focus in the audit is the valuation of investment and development properties and the  
balance sheet as a whole. Given this, consistent with the prior year, we set an overall Group materiality 
level based on total assets. 
In addition, in recognition of the contribution made by revenue line items to certain key performance indicators of the Group we applied  
a lower specific materiality of £13 million (2013: £9 million) based on a three year average profit before tax for testing net rental income,  
finance costs and administrative expenses. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified 
during our audit above £1 million (2013: £1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting  
for qualitative reasons. 
Going concern 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ statement, set out on page 88, in relation to going concern.  
We have nothing to report having performed our review. 
As noted in the Directors’ statement, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using  
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Parent Company have adequate resources  
to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were  
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate. 
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and  
Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE AUDIT 
Our responsibilities and those of the Directors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the  
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs  
(UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with  
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save  
where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
What an audit of financial statements involves 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance 
that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:  
– whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been  
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;  
– the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and 
– the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide  
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both.  
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with  
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the accounts 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
General information 
Capital & Counties Properties PLC (the “Company”) was 
incorporated and registered in England and Wales on  
3 February 2010 under the Companies Act as a public company 
limited by shares, registration number 7145051. The registered 
office of the Company is 15 Grosvenor Street, London, W1K 4QZ, 
United Kingdom. The principal activity of the Company is to act  
as the ultimate parent company of Capital & Counties Properties 
PLC Group (the “Group”), whose principal activity is the 
development and management of property.  
The Group’s assets principally comprise investment  
and development property at Covent Garden, Earls Court and  
the exhibition halls at Olympia. 
Basis of preparation 
The Group’s consolidated financial statements are prepared  
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”), as adopted by the European Union, International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) 
interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared  
under the historical cost convention as modified for the  
revaluation of property, available-for-sale investments and 
derivative financial instruments.  
Standards and guidelines relevant to the Group that were in  
issue and endorsed at the date of approval of the consolidated 
financial statements but not effective at the balance sheet date  
and have not been adopted early are: 
IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’ (amendment) 
The assessment of amendments issued but not effective are not 
anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements.  
During 2014, the following accounting standards were adopted  
by the Group: 
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ 
IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’ 
IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities’ 
IAS 27 ‘Separate Financial Statements’ (revised) 
IAS 28 ‘Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures’ (revised) 
IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ (amendment) 
IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’ (amendment) 
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ 
(amendment) 
These pronouncements had no significant impact on the 
consolidated financial statements and resulted in changes to 
presentation and disclosure only with the exception of IFRS 11 
‘Joint Arrangements’ (“IFRS 11”).  
Impact of transition to IFRS 11  
IFRS 11, which has been endorsed by the European Union, removes 
the proportional consolidation option which was available under 
IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’. This impacted the Group’s 
published accounting policy in respect of joint ventures. The 
Group’s net interest in joint ventures is now disclosed as a single 
line item on the consolidated balance sheet and in the consolidated 
income statement using the equity method of accounting rather 
than proportionally consolidating the Group’s share of assets, 
liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis. 
 
This change has increased the total assets and total liabilities as 
previously presented, but there has been no overall change in net 
assets. This standard was adopted by the Group from 1 January 2014 
with retrospective application. The change in accounting policy has 
a material impact on the consolidated balance sheet at 1 January 
2013; consequently, the opening consolidated balance sheet has 
been presented within the primary statements. 
The following tables show the impact of the change in accounting 
policy on the consolidated income statement, consolidated balance 
sheet and consolidated statement of cash flows for all periods 
presented. There is no impact on the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in 
equity or basic and diluted earnings per share.

A summary of the Group’s principal accounting policies, which 
have been applied consistently across the Group is set out below. 
Going Concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future  
and for this reason the consolidated financial statements have  
been prepared on a going concern basis. 
Basis of consolidation  
These consolidated financial statements include the consolidation 
of the following limited partnerships: Capital & Counties CGP, 
Capital & Counties CGP 9, Capco CGP 2010 LP, Capco CGP 2012 LP, 
EC Properties LP, Claremont Park Properties LP and The Empress 
State Limited Partnership. The members of these qualifying 
partnerships have taken advantage of disclosure exemptions 
available in Statutory Instrument 2008/569 and therefore will  
not produce consolidated accounts at the partnership level.  
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in British 
pounds sterling, which is also determined to be the functional 
currency of the Parent. 
 
Subsidiaries  
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which  
the Group has control; it is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with an entity and has the ability to 
affect those returns through its power over an entity. Subsidiaries 
cease to be consolidated from the date this control is lost. 
Non-controlling interests are recognised on the basis of their 
proportionate share in the recognised amounts of a subsidiary’s 
identifiable net assets. On the balance sheet non-controlling 
interests are presented separately from the equity of the owners  
of the Parent. Profit or loss and total comprehensive income for the 
period attributable to non-controlling interests are presented 
separately in the income statement and the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Estimation and uncertainty 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, income and 
expenses. Although these estimates are based on management’s 
best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results 
ultimately may differ from those estimates.  
The most significant area of estimation and uncertainty in the 
consolidated financial statements is in respect of the valuation  
of the property portfolio and investments, where external 
valuations are obtained. The valuation of the Group’s property 
portfolio is inherently subjective due to the assumptions as 
outlined within the property portfolio note. As a result, the 
valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject  
to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions 
which may not prove to be accurate and could therefore have a 
material effect on the Group’s financial performance and position. 
Other areas of estimation and uncertainty are included within  
the accounting policies below, the more significant being: 
Revenue recognition 
Share-based payment 
Provisions 
Pensions 
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Income taxes 
Trade and other receivables 
Operating segments 
Management has determined the operating segments with 
reference to reports on divisional financial performance and 
position that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive,  
who is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker. 
Revenue recognition 
Property rental income and exhibition income consist of gross 
income calculated on an accruals basis, together with services  
where the Group acts as principal in the ordinary course of 
business, excluding sales of property. Rental income is spread 
evenly over the period from lease commencement to lease expiry.  
Tenant lease incentive payments, including surrender premiums 
paid which can be directly linked to enhanced rental income,  
are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
Upon receipt of a surrender premium for the early termination  
of a lease, the profit and non-recoverable outgoings relating to the 
lease concerned are immediately reflected in net rental income.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 102 
Notes to the accounts continued 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Revenue recognition continued 
Contingent rents, being those lease payments that are not fixed  
at the inception of a lease, for example increases arising on  
rent reviews, are recorded as income in the periods in which  
they are earned.  
Rent reviews are recognised as income, based on management 
estimates, when it is reasonable to assume they will be received. 
Estimates are derived from knowledge of market rents for 
comparable properties determined on an individual property  
basis and updated for progress of negotiations. 
Where revenue is obtained by the sale of property, it is recognised 
when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to  
the buyer. This will normally take place on exchange of contracts 
unless there are conditions that suggest insufficient probability  
of future economic benefits flowing to the Group. For conditional 
exchanges, sales are recognised when these conditions are satisfied. 
Revenue arising from the sale of property under construction is 
recognised when both contracts have been exchanged and the 
building work is physically complete.  
Other income includes management fees charged to joint ventures 
for services associated with the management of properties and 
other general expenses as defined by management agreements. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the 
principal outstanding and the effective interest rate. 
Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right  
to receive payment has been established. 
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items are those items that in the Directors’ view  
are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their size  
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s  
financial performance.  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in currencies other than the Company’s functional 
currency are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the 
transaction date. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting  
from settlement of these transactions and from retranslation of 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are recognised in the income statement except for differences 
arising on the retranslation of available-for-sale investments  
which are recognised in other comprehensive income.  
Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount payable on the taxable income for the 
year and any adjustment in respect of prior years. It is calculated 
using rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by  
the balance sheet date.  
In accordance with IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’, deferred tax is provided 
for using the balance sheet liability method on temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of those assets 
and liabilities. However, temporary differences are not recognised 
to the extent that they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill 
or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business 
combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither 
accounting nor taxable profit or loss; or are associated with 
investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates where  
the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be 
controlled by the parent, venture or investor, respectively,  
and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse  
in the foreseeable future. 
 
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected 
to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the 
deferred tax liability is settled.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that 
management believes it is probable that future taxable profit  
will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be 
recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when 
there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and 
liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate  
to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the  
same taxable group or different taxable entities where there is an 
intention to settle balances on a net basis.  
Tax is included in the income statement except when it relates  
to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in 
equity, in which case the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively.  
An investment property accounted for at fair value will normally  
be recovered through sale rather than use.  
Discontinued operation 
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s  
business that represents a separate major line of the business  
that has been disposed of or meets the criteria for classification  
as held for sale. Discontinued operations are presented separately 
from continuing operations in both the income statement and 
statement of cash flows. 
Share-based payment 
The cost of granting share options and other share-based 
remuneration to employees and Directors is recognised  
through the income statement with reference to the fair value  
of the instrument at the date of grant.  
The income statement is charged over the vesting period of  
the options with a corresponding increase in equity. An option 
pricing model is used applying assumptions around expected 
yields, forfeiture rates, exercise price and volatility.  
Upon eventual exercise, a reserves transfer occurs with no  
further charge reflected in the income statement. 
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans and 
other share-based payment arrangements are treated as treasury 
shares and deducted from equity.  
Investment and development property 
Investment and development property are owned or leased by  
the Group and held for long-term rental income and capital 
appreciation and exclude property occupied by the Group. 
The Group has chosen to use the fair value model. Property and  
any related obligations are initially recognised when the significant 
risks and rewards attached to the property have transferred to the 
Group. Payments made in respect of the future acquisition of 
investment and development property, as is the case for the CLSA, 
are initially recognised as prepayments until the recognition 
criteria outlined above have been met. Investment and 
development property are recorded at cost and subsequently 
revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined  
by professionally qualified external valuers on the basis of market 
value after allowing for future transaction costs.  
The fair value of property is arrived at by adjusting the market 
value as above for directly attributable tenant lease incentives  
and fixed head leases.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 103 
 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED 
Investment and development property continued 
Property held under leases is stated gross of the recognised finance 
lease asset. 
The valuation is based upon assumptions as outlined within the 
property portfolio note. These assumptions conform with the  
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation 
Professional Standards. The cost of development properties 
includes capitalised interest and other directly attributable 
outgoings, with the exception of properties and land where no 
development is imminent in which case no interest is included. 
Interest is capitalised (before tax relief) on the basis of the  
weighted average cost of debt outstanding until the date of 
practical completion. 
When the Group redevelops a property for continued future use, 
that property is classified as investment and development property 
during the redevelopment period and continues to be measured  
at fair value. 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment 
property are recognised in the income statement in the period in 
which they arise. Depreciation is not provided in respect of 
investment property including plant and equipment integral  
to such investment property. Investment properties cease to be 
recognised as investment property when they have been disposed  
of or when they cease to be held for the purpose of generating rental 
income or for capital appreciation.  
Where the Group disposes of a property at fair value in an arm’s 
length transaction the carrying value immediately prior to the sale 
is adjusted to the transaction price, offset by any directly 
attributable costs, and the resulting gain or loss is recorded in  
the income statement.  
A property ceases to be recognised as investment property and  
is transferred at its fair value to trading property when, in the 
Directors’ judgement, development commences with the intention 
of sale. Criteria considered in this assessment include, the Board’s 
stated intention, contractual commitments and physical, legal  
and financial viability. 
When the use of a property changes from trading property to 
investment property, the property is transferred at fair value  
with any resulting gain recognised in the income statement. 
Trading property 
Trading property comprises those properties that in the Directors’ 
view are not held for long-term rental income or capital 
appreciation and are expected to be disposed of within one year of 
the balance sheet date or to be developed with the intention to sell.  
Such property is constructed, acquired, or if transferred from 
investment and development property, transferred at fair value 
which is deemed to represent cost. Subsequently trading property 
is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable 
value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of 
business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling costs. 
This approximates market value as determined by professionally 
qualified external valuers at the balance sheet date.  
The amount of any write down of trading property to market value 
is recognised as an expense in the period the write down occurs. 
Should a valuation uplift occur in a subsequent period, the amount 
of any reversal shall be recognised as a reduction in the previous 
write down in the period in which the uplift occurs. This may not 
exceed the property’s initial cost.  
The sale of trading property is recognised as income when the 
significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the buyer. 
Total costs incurred in respect of trading property are recognised 
simultaneously as an expense.  
 
Leases 
Leases are classified according to the substance of the transaction. 
A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards  
of ownership to the lessee is classified as a finance lease.  
All other leases are normally classified as operating leases.  
Group as a lessee: 
In accordance with IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’, property  
held under finance and operating leases may be accounted for as 
investment property. Finance leases are recognised as both an asset 
and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.  
The investment property asset is included in the balance sheet  
at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum  
lease payments, gross of the recognised finance lease asset.  
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance 
charges so as to achieve a constant financing rate. 
Other finance leased assets are capitalised at the lower of the  
fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum 
lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term 
and the useful life of the asset.  
Rental expenses under operating leases are charged to the  
income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Plant and equipment 
Plant and equipment consist of fixtures, fittings and other office 
equipment. Plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset plus any 
attributable cost in bringing the asset to its working condition  
for its intended use. Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated  
useful life to a maximum of five years. 
Investment in Group companies  
Investment in Group companies, which eliminates on 
consolidation, is stated in the Company’s separate financial 
statements at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses 
are determined with reference to the investment’s fair value less 
estimated selling costs. Fair value is derived from the subsidiary’s 
net assets at the balance sheet date. On disposal, the difference 
between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is 
included in the income statement. 
Investment in joint ventures 
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group  
has joint control, established by contractual agreement. 
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity 
method. On initial recognition the investment is recognised at  
cost, and the carrying amount is subsequently increased or 
decreased to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss of the 
joint venture after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment 
in joint ventures is presented separately on the balance sheet and 
the Group’s share of the joint venture’s post-tax profit or loss for 
the year is also presented separately in the income statement.  
Where there is an indication that the Group’s investment in joint 
ventures may be impaired the Group evaluates the recoverable 
amount of its investment, being the higher of the joint venture’s 
fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverable 
amount is lower than the carrying value an impairment loss is 
recognised in the income statement.  
If the Group’s share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds  
its investment in the joint venture, the Group does not recognise 
further losses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to 
make payments on behalf of the joint venture.  Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 104 
Notes to the accounts continued 
1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Available-for-sale investments 
Available-for-sale investments, being investments intended  
to be held for an indefinite period, are initially recognised and 
subsequently measured at fair value.  
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of  
available-for-sale investments are included in other comprehensive 
income, except to the extent that losses are determined to be 
attributable to impairment, in which case they are recognised in the 
income statement and may not be reversed in subsequent periods. 
Disposals are recorded upon distribution, at which time 
accumulated fair value adjustments are recycled from reserves  
to the income statement. 
Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost. The Directors 
exercise judgement as to the collectability of the Group’s trade  
and other receivables and determine when it is appropriate to 
impair these assets. 
Impairment of financial assets 
An annual review is conducted for financial assets to determine 
whether there is any evidence of a loss event as described by  
IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
Factors such as days past due, credit status of the counterparty, 
historical evidence of collection and probability of deriving future 
economic benefit are considered to assess whether there is  
objective evidence of impairment. The amount of any potential loss 
is calculated by estimating future cash flows or by using fair value 
where this is available through observable market prices. If, in a 
subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases 
and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring 
after the original impairment was recognised, the impairment 
reversal is recognised in the income statement on a basis consistent 
with the original charge. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at fair value. Cash and 
cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits with banks  
and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. 
Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses non-trading derivative financial instruments  
to manage exposure to interest rate risk. They are initially 
recognised on the trade date at fair value and subsequently 
remeasured at fair value based on market price.  
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends  
on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, 
and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.  
Instruments that have not been designated as qualifying for  
hedge accounting are classified as held for trading. Changes in  
fair value of these instruments are recognised directly in the income 
statement.  
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of a highly 
probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). For hedging 
instruments, the Group documents at the inception of the 
transaction the relationship between hedging instruments  
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives  
and strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The Group  
also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on  
an on-going basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes  
in cash flows of hedged items. 
 
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  
that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  
in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit 
or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.  
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge  
no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative 
gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is 
recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised 
in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in 
equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.  
Trade and other payables 
Trade payables are obligations for goods or services acquired in  
the ordinary course of business. Trade and other payables are 
recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost until settled. 
Deposits 
Property deposits and on account receipts are held within trade  
and other payables. 
Dividend distribution 
Dividend distributions to shareholders are recognised as a liability 
once approved by shareholders. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a current obligation 
arising from a past event and it is probable that the Group will be 
required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the 
Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at their net proceeds as an 
approximation of fair value and subsequently carried at amortised 
cost. Any transaction costs, premiums or discounts are capitalised 
and recognised over the contractual life of the loan using the 
effective interest rate method; or on a straight line basis where  
it is impractical to do so. In the event of early repayment, 
transaction costs, premiums or discounts paid or unamortised  
costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.  
Pensions 
The costs of the defined contribution scheme and the Group’s 
personal pension plans are charged against profits in the year in 
which they fall due.  
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments  
and changes in actuarial assumptions of the defined benefit  
scheme are recognised immediately as a charge in other 
comprehensive income for the period in which they arise with a 
corresponding increase in the pension surplus or deficit. These  
re-measurements are not reclassified to the income statement in 
subsequent periods. Past service costs, current service costs, 
curtailment or settlement gains or losses and net interest income  
or expense are recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the 
opening plan assets and scheme obligation.  
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by 
independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method  
and applying assumptions which are agreed between the Group 
and its actuaries.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report

1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED  
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments 
Contingent liabilities are disclosed where there are present or 
possible obligations arising from past events, but the economic 
impact is uncertain in timing, occurrence or amount. A description 
of the nature and, where possible, an estimate of the financial effect 
of contingent liabilities are disclosed. 
Capital commitments are disclosed when the Group has a 
contractual future obligation which has not been provided for  
at the balance sheet date, as is the case for the CLSA. Amounts are 
only provided for where such obligations are onerous. 
Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as a 
deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.  
Where the Group’s own shares are re-purchased, the consideration 
paid is classified as treasury shares and deducted from equity. 
Where such shares are subsequently sold or re-issued, any 
consideration received is included in equity. 
2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING 
Management has determined the operating segments based  
on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to  
be the chief operating decision maker. The principal performance 
measures have been identified as net rental income and net  
asset value. For management and reporting purposes the Group  
is organised into four divisions: 
– Covent Garden; 
– Earls Court Properties which comprises the Group’s interests  
at Earls Court, predominantly EC1 & EC2, the Empress State 
Building and 50 per cent of the Lillie Square joint venture; 
– Venues comprises the exhibitions business including the 
Olympia property assets; and 
– Other comprises the discontinued activity of The Great Capital 
Partnership, the Group’s residual China investments, the 
business unit historically known as Opportunities and other 
head office companies. 
Management information is reported on a proportionally 
consolidated basis. Segmental reporting has been presented in  
line with management information and therefore consolidation 
adjustments are presented to reconcile segmental performance  
and position to the IFRS total.  
The Group’s operating segments derive their revenue primarily 
from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Venues 
which generates revenue principally from the exhibition business.  
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally 
which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to 
individual segments.   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 106

10 BUSINESS COMBINATION  
The Empress State Limited Partnership 
On 29 May 2013, the Group acquired control of the 50 per cent interest not already owned in The Empress State Limited Partnership 
(“ESLP”), which owns and manages, through its general partner, the Empress State Building in West London. This 451,000 square foot,  
31 storey office building is adjacent to the Group’s EC1 & EC2 interests and benefits from an index linked lease to the Metropolitan Police 
Authority until 2019. ESLP was accounted for as a joint venture under the equity method to the date that control of the partnership was 
acquired by the Group.  
The partnership contributed revenues of £2.4 million during the period between exchange in May and completion in August,  
of which £1.2 million is disclosed as being attributable to non-controlling interest. A net profit of £1.0 million was attributable to the  
non-controlling interest during this time. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 January 2013 the Group’s revenue and the net profit would 
have been £3.1 million and £7.9 million higher respectively. The net profit amount includes revaluation gains recognised on exchange  
of contracts. 
On the date control was acquired, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the business combination were fair valued with  
resulting gains or losses being taken to the Group’s consolidated income statement. No deferred tax was recognised on this date  
because the tax base of the underlying asset was equal to its fair value.  
   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 110

The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the business combination were as follows:

Non-current assets 234.0
Current assets 5.6
Current liabilities (151.8)
Net assets of ESLP on acquisition of control  87.8
Disposal of investment in ESLP as joint venture (43.9)
Net assets acquired 43.9
Completion of the acquisition occurred on 1 August 2013. Consideration for the net assets acquired, including the non-controlling  
interest share of profits, was £45 million. Total cash paid was £50.3 million comprising both consideration and the repayment of the  
joint venture partner’s loan account. ESLP is now consolidated as a subsidiary of the Group.  
11 DISCONTINUED OPERATION 
On 29 April 2013, the Group exchanged contracts for the disposal of the final asset, Park Crescent West, in The Great Capital  
Partnership (“GCP”). This was affected as part of the Group’s strategy to dispose of non-core assets in support of the Group’s core  
estates and, as a result, the partnership has been presented as a discontinued operation. GCP was established as a joint venture in 2007  
with Great Portland Estates plc (“GPE”), to own, manage and develop a number of central London properties.  
A summary of the results of GCP for the year which have been presented separately in the consolidated income statement is set out below:

16 PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONTINUED 
At 31 December 2014, the Group was contractually committed to £100.9 million (re-presented 2013: £103.9 million) of future expenditure 
for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Refer to note 33  
‘Capital Commitments’ for further information on capital commitments.  
The fair value of the Group’s investment, development and trading property at 31 December 2014 was determined by independent, 
appropriately qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court Properties (excluding the Empress State Building)  
and Venues; and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Group’s property portfolio. The valuations conform to the Royal Institution  
of Chartered Surveyors (“RICS”) Valuation Professional Standards. Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts. 
Each year the Investment Director, on behalf of the Board, appoints the external valuers. The valuers are selected based upon their 
knowledge, independence and reputation for valuing assets such as those held by the Group. 
Valuations are performed bi-annually and are performed consistently across all properties in the Group’s portfolio. At each reporting  
date appropriately qualified employees of the Group verify all significant inputs and review computational outputs. Valuers submit  
and present summary reports to the Group’s Audit Committee, with the Investment Director reporting to the Board on the outcome  
of each valuation round. 
Valuations take into account tenure, lease terms and structural condition. The inputs underlying the valuations include market rent  
or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, forecast growth rates, yields, EBITDA, discount rates, construction costs 
including any site specific costs (for example section 106), professional fees, planning fees, developer’s profit including contingencies, 
planning and construction timelines, lease re-gear costs, planning risk and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar 
properties or properties similar to those contemplated for development. 
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use. When considering the highest and best use a valuer will 
consider, on a property by property basis, its actual and potential uses which are physically, legally and financially viable. Where the 
highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing  
this change in arriving at its valuation.  
A number of the Group’s properties have been valued on the basis of their development potential which differs from their existing use.  
In respect of development valuations, the valuer ordinarily considers the gross development value of the completed scheme based upon 
assumptions of capital values, rental values and yields of the properties which would be created through the implementation of the 
development. Deductions are then made for anticipated costs, including an allowance for developer’s profit before arriving at a valuation.  
Most notably, within Earls Court Properties the Group’s interests at EC1 & EC2 have been valued on the basis of a mixed use, residential  
led scheme, deriving a residual land valuation on the basis of a standalone development of these interests. During 2014 the properties  
were used as exhibition venues, generating an income stream for the Group, while the process to achieve the change in use is being 
implemented. Within the Covent Garden segment, where appropriate, a number of properties have been valued on the basis of their 
development potential, principally for the conversion of existing use to residential use or for improving the configuration of retail units.  
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets. 
The most significant of these occur when planning permission or lease extension and renegotiation of use are required (as is the case 
currently regarding the Empress State Building and EC1 & EC2 respectively) or when a credit facility is in place. These restrictions are 
factored into the property’s valuation by the external valuer. Refer to disclosures surrounding development risks on page 15. 
Non-financial assets carried at fair value, as is the case for investment and development property held by the Group, are required to  
be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ (“IFRS 13”). Trading property  
is exempted from IFRS 13 disclosure requirements. The different valuation levels are defined as: 
Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets; 
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either  
directly or from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices; and 
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data. 
When the degree of subjectivity or nature of the measurement inputs changes, consideration is given as to whether a transfer between  
fair value levels is deemed to have occurred. Unobservable data becoming observable market data would determine a transfer from  
Level 3 to Level 2. All investment and development property held by the Group are classified as Level 3.

A number of Earls Court properties previously valued on an income capitalisation approach have been valued on a residual development 
method as a result of significant progress taking place in land assembly this year. There is a major residential scheme planned for the site  
as part of the main Earls Court Masterplan.  
Planning consent for a hotel was received during the year on part of the Venues’ site. This has resulted in a change to residual development 
method of valuation for this site.

On 21 February 2014, the Group entered into £665 million unsecured five year revolving credit facility to replace existing secured debt 
facilities that were due to mature in 2016 and 2017 and to improve operational and financial flexibility. The Group incurred charges of 
£12.9 million as a result of the refinancing. Transaction costs of £8.1 million were capitalised and will be amortised over the contractual  
life of the new facility. £190 million of the facility was drawn at year-end. 
On 16 December 2014, the Group issued a US Private Placement of £150 million 10 and 12 year senior unsecured notes. The Group incurred 
and capitalised charges of £0.6 million as a result of the placement. 
The market value of investment and development property secured as collateral against borrowings at 31 December 2014 was  
£278.0 million (2013: £1,339.6 million).  
Cash and undrawn committed facilities attributable to the Group at 31 December 2014 were £579.8 million (2013: £285.0 million). 
The fair values of floating rate borrowings have been established using the market value, which approximates nominal value.  
The fair values of fixed rate borrowings have been calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.

Finance lease liabilities are in respect of leasehold interests in investment and development property. Certain leases provide for payment  
of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the minimum lease payments above. 
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.

27 OPERATING LEASES 
The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment property to tenants under operating leases. 
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of  
five to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review every five years.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Group’s operations: market risk (including interest rate risk and  
foreign exchange risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. 
The majority of the Group’s financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board  
of Directors. The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are  
summarised below. 
Market risk 
(a) Interest rate risk 
Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of  
a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial 
instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. 
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk,  
whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR. 
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest  
rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using fixed interest rate derivatives. Interest rate swaps 
have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates. Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the 
maximum interest rate payable at the collar’s ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.  
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn external borrowings profile of the Group and joint 
ventures. The table is disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis in line with the reporting of this information internally to management.

Interest rate protection  94% 100%
1 Excludes current loan notes of £6.0 million to which the Group has no interest rate exposure under the terms of the borrowing. 
Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection on Group external debt is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent. 
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective at 31 December 2014 was 2.2 per cent (2013: 3.2 per cent). 
Cash flow hedge: 
In 2014, the Group entered into a forward starting interest rate swap to hedge the variability in specified hedged interest cash flows arising 
on £50 million of outstanding debt from 2014 to 2024. The gain recognised in other comprehensive income in the year was £0.3 million. 
This gain will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the consolidated income statement over the term of the designated debt. 
The fair value of the designated hedging instrument at 31 December 2014 was £nil. The hedge was 100 per cent effective; therefore no 
charge for an ineffective portion has been taken to the consolidated income statement during the year.    Governance Financial statements Strategic report
www.capitalandcounties.com 125 
 
28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement  
in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of £6.9 million (2013: £6.2 million).  
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement  
in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the consolidated income statement of £6.9 million (2013: £6.2 million).  
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely. However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the 
possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents management’s assessment  
of possible changes in interest rates. The fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, therefore such a 
movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall. 
(b) Foreign exchange risk 
The Group does not have significant foreign exchange exposure. 
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.  
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Group’s operational requirements and investment commitments.  
The Group’s policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities. 
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entity’s ability to meet the relevant facility’s 
financial covenants. The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.  
The Group’s policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing 
risk. The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest cost. 
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through  
the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates. Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the 
contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk. This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time  
of the desired refinancing. This was the strategy employed in the refinancing of existing borrowings in 2014.  
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Group’s financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to 
make payments of interest and to repay principal. Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate, the rates used are  
those implied by the par yield curve.

28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 
Credit risk 
The Group’s principal financial assets are trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, amounts receivable from joint ventures 
and loan notes. Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract. Credit risk 
arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Group’s undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such  
as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.  
Trade and other receivables:  
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed; tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously 
monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default. 
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, by obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial 
information. As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained. The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2014 was  
£5.9 million (2013: £4.2 million). 
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment specifically  
on each contract. 
In relation to the Group’s exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are provided for in full. Additionally, specific provisions  
are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns. The amounts of trade 
receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. 
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: 
Group  
2014  
£m 
Group 
2013 
£m
Up to 90 days 7.9 5.5
Over 90 days 0.2 0.3
Trade receivables 8.1 5.8
In 2014 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of £0.4 million (2013: £0.1 million).  
Loan notes: 
Included within receivables are £6.2 million (2013: £6.0 million) of loan notes that relate to the disposal of a subsidiary in 2008. The loan  
notes have been impaired by £9.8 million (2013: £10.0 million) to their recoverable amount with reference to the market value of secured 
property assets. Whilst uncertainty remains, the loan notes have continued to perform, all interest payments have been serviced on  
a timely basis during 2014 and are forecast to continue during 2015.  
Amounts receivable from joint ventures: 
Following the adoption of IFRS 11 and the application of the equity method, loans between the Group and its joint ventures, as well  
as interest thereon, are no longer eliminated on consolidation. Included within receivables is £19.1 million (2013: £18.4 million) of amounts 
advanced to LSJV. The carrying value of the investment in LSJV is £nil (2013: £nil) as the Group’s share of losses exceeds the cost of its 
investment. Total funding advanced to LSJV of £38.3 million (2013: £24.7 million) has been impaired by the cumulative losses attributable 
to the joint venture, £19.2 million (2013: £6.3 million).  
LSJV is in a net liability position due to carrying trading property at the lower of cost and market value. However based on a market valuation 
undertaken by the Group’s valuers Jones Lang LaSalle, there is an unrecognised surplus of £83.4 million (Group share) as at 31 December 2014. 
This surplus will only be evidenced on sale of trading property when building work is physically complete. Therefore, while Lillie Square 
demonstrates positive pricing evidence commercially and funding provided is not deemed to be at risk of default, for reporting purposes the 
Group is required to impair amounts advanced to LSJV until the unrecognised surplus on trading property is realised through sale. 
Cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments:  
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury. Relationships  
are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group cash investment policy relating  
to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties (between BBB+ and A+).  
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Capital structure 
The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and  
by managing the capital structure. The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and other financial instruments and aims to access both debt  
and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.  
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio. The Group aims 
not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 40 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent. These ratios are 
disclosed on a proportionally consolidated basis excluding the non-controlling interest share of net debt and property in line with the 
reporting of this information internally to management. These metrics are discussed in the Financial review on pages 38 to 43.

Fair value estimation  
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be analysed by level depending on the valuation method adopted under IFRS 13. 
The different valuation levels are defined in note 16 ‘Property Portfolio’. 
The tables below present the Group’s financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013. The 
fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined from observable market prices or estimated using appropriate yield curves at  
31 December each year by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.

29 DEFERRED TAX  
The decrease in corporation tax rate referred to in note 12 ‘Taxation’ has been substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12  
‘Income Taxes’ (“IAS 12”) and therefore has been reflected in these consolidated financial statements based on the expected timing of  
the realisation of deferred tax.  
Deferred tax on investment and development property is calculated under IAS 12 provisions on a disposals basis by reference to the 
properties’ original tax base cost. Elements factored into the calculation include indexation relief and the Group’s holding structure.  
The Group’s recognised deferred tax liability on investment and development property as calculated under IAS 12 is £11.8 million at  
31 December 2014 (2013: £3.1 million).  
A disposal of the Group’s trading property including Lillie Square at their market value as per note 16 ‘Property Portfolio’ would result in  
a corporation tax charge to the Group of £20.7 million (21.5 per cent of £96.3 million). 
The Group’s contingent tax liability which is calculated on the same basis as the IAS 12 liability above is £nil (2013: £nil) after allowing  
for loss relief.

33 CAPITAL COMMITMENTS 
At 31 December 2014, the Group was contractually committed to £100.9 million (re-presented 2013: £103.9 million) of future expenditure 
for the purchase, construction, development and enhancement of investment, development and trading property. Of the £100.9 million 
committed, £40.9 million is committed 2015 expenditure.  
In November 2013, the Group exercised its option under the CLSA which it entered into with LBHF in January 2013 in relation to  
LBHF’s land interest within the Earls Court Masterplan. Under the terms of the CLSA, the Group can draw down land in phases but  
no land can be transferred unless replacement homes for the residents of the relevant phase have been provided and vacant possession  
is given. The Group has already paid £30 million of the £105 million cash consideration payable under the CLSA. Independent of the  
land draw down process, exercising the option commits the Group to the payment of the residual £75 million which is yet to be paid.  
This is expected to be settled in five annual instalments of £15 million starting on 31 December 2015.  
The Group’s share of joint venture capital commitments arising on LSJV amounts to £70.5 million (2013: £1.9 million).  
34 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of legal claims, guarantees and warranties arising from the ordinary course of business. 
Contingent liabilities that may result in material liabilities are described below.  
Under the terms of the CLSA the Group has certain compensation obligations relating to achieving vacant possession, which are subject  
to an overall cap of £55 million. Should any payments be made in respect of these obligations, they will be deducted from the total 
consideration payable to LBHF (refer to note 33 ‘Capital Commitments’). 
In March 2013, an agreement with Network Rail was signed to acquire a 999 year leasehold interest in the air rights above the West  
London Line where it runs within the ECOA. Within the terms of the agreement, the Group can exercise options during the next 50 years 
for further 999 year leases over the remainder of the West London Line to allow for development within the Earls Court Masterplan. 
Network Rail is entitled to further payments of 5.55 per cent of the residual land value which will be payable at the time of development  
or disposal of each phase of the Earls Court Masterplan.  
Within the terms of the agreement of the acquisition of the Northern Access Road land, the vendor’s successor in title is entitled to  
further payments until 2027 if certain conditions are met. Further payments become due following the grant of a planning permission  
for change of use or on disposal. In the event such planning permission is implemented, the payment is calculated at 50 per cent of the 
uplift in land value following the grant of the permission. In the event of a disposal, the payment is calculated as 50 per cent of the 
difference between the sale value against the land value without the relevant permission.

remuneration report on pages 66 to 85 form part of these consolidated financial statements.   Capco Annual Report & Accounts 2014 134 
Notes to the accounts continued 
39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes relating to employee benefits and incentives. All schemes are equity  
settled with the increase in equity measured by reference to the fair value of the Group’s equity instruments at the grant date of the share 
awards. The corresponding expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number 
of shares that are expected to vest. The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of share-based  
payments for 2014 was £4.8 million (2013: £4.7 million). 
Reconciliations of movements in share incentive schemes are given in the tables on pages 134 to 136.  
1. Performance share plan 
Market value and nil cost options to subscribe for ordinary shares and conditional awards of free shares may be awarded under the  
Group Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). 
Exercise at the vesting date is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration  
Committee (“the Committee”) at the time of grant.  
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: 
– the Group’s Total Return (“TR”) over three consecutive financial years (“the TR Performance Period”) relative to the median of the  
TRs over the equivalent period of the Group, Intu Properties plc, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc,  
Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc (“the Comparator Group”); and  
– the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) over a period of three years (“the TSR Performance Period”) relative to the median  
of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group. 
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.  
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the  
TR performance period. In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will  
be added back.  
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period  
re-invested in ordinary shares.  
Full details of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 69, 78 and 79. 
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection  
of underlying financial performance and may exercise discretion when determining the proportion of an award that will vest. 
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has  
ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.  
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group (whether to replace a removed member or otherwise) if it  
believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group. 
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. In general, options are forfeited if the 
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
In 2011 a schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme; therefore the Company may make a proportion of awards as 
approved options. 
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2014 were exercisable between nil pence and 268.1 pence and have a weighted average  
remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2015 and 2024.

Deferred share awards made under the performance share plan vest on the third anniversary of the date of award, subject to continued 
employment and satisfaction of performance conditions. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the PSP was  
£2.7 million (2013: £2.2 million). 
2. Matching share plan 
Under the Group Matching Share Plan (“MSP”), deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus. These awards may also be made  
as nil cost options.  
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that 
participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award. Awards of nil cost 
options were made in both the current and comparative periods. The fair value of share awards is determined by the market price  
of the shares at the grant date.

Under the MSP, awards, which may be awarded as nil cost options, may also be made in respect of certain shares purchased by Directors  
or in respect of awards of the deferred shares or nil cost options described above made under the Company’s annual bonus scheme.  
The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred. In exceptional circumstances the matching 
awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred. 
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions. Vesting  
of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally 
determined. The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years. Full details  
of the performance criteria and vesting outcomes are set out on pages 69, 78 and 79. 
Matching nil cost options and share awards generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased  
or deferred shares. 
The total expense recognised in the consolidated income statement in respect of shares and share options awarded under the MSP was  
£2.1 million (2013: £2.5 million).

The Chairman does not participate in the PSP or MSP, however for any shares purchased within 12 months of the establishment of Capco  
in May 2010 up to a value of 150 per cent of his base fee, the Company made a 1:1 matching award of deferred shares on a gross of tax basis.  
The Chairman invested more than 150 per cent of his base fee in the Company’s shares during 2010, and accordingly an award of 529,536 
deferred shares was made to him on 1 September 2010. The Chairman’s matching share award carried no performance conditions but was 
subject to him remaining in office for three years and retaining ownership of the invested shares. The shares vested in full on 10 May 2013. 
The total expense recognised in the 2013 consolidated income statement in respect of the Chairman’s award was £0.1 million. The share 
price at the date of vesting was 327.9 pence. 
3. Fair value of share-based payment 
As stated above, one half of each award granted is subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance 
condition. The fair value of share awards is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for the half that is subject to the  
TR performance condition and using the stochastic pricing model for the half that is subject to the TSR performance condition. Inputs  
to the models for share awards during the year are as follows: 
Year of share award 2014 2013 2012 2011
Closing share price at grant date  320 – 350p 271p 196p 183p

40 PENSIONS 
1. Current pension arrangements 
The Venues business (“Venues”) has a hybrid pension scheme comprising a money purchase section that was closed on 28 February  
2014 and a final salary section which closed to new members in 2006, and closed to future benefit accrual on 31 December 2011. The final 
salary section is a funded defined benefit scheme (“the Scheme”) which is contracted out of State Second Pension. On closure of the  
money purchase section of the Venues’ pension scheme, a defined contribution group personal pension plan was offered to eligible  
Venues employees.  
The Group’s current policy is largely to provide future retirement benefits through defined contribution arrangements. 
The Scheme exposes the Group to a number of risks: 
– Investment risk – the Scheme holds investments in asset classes, such as equities, which have volatile market values and while these 
assets are expected to provide positive real returns over the long-term, the short-term volatility can cause additional funding to be 
required if deficit emerges. 
– Interest rate risk – the Scheme’s liabilities are assessed using market yields on high quality corporate bonds to discount the liabilities.  
As the Scheme holds assets such as equities the value of the assets and liabilities may not move in the same way. 
– Inflation risk – a significant proportion of the benefits under the Scheme are linked to inflation. Although the Scheme’s assets are 
expected to provide a good hedge against inflation over the long-term, movements over the short-term could lead to deficits emerging. 
– Mortality risk – in the event that members live longer than assumed a deficit will emerge in the Scheme.

the net interest income or expense on the Scheme’s opening plan assets and scheme obligation is included in the Group’s administration 
expenses. For the year ended 31 December 2014 this amounts to a charge of £nil to the consolidated income statement (2013: charge £nil).

Equity and property returns are developed based on the selection of an appropriate risk premium above the risk free rate which is 
measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds. Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and 
corporate debt as appropriate to the Scheme’s holdings of these instruments. The assets do not include any investment in shares of  
the Group.

Increases to pensions in payment (Limited Prices Index 5%) 3.0 3.4
Increases to deferred pensions before payment 2.2 2.7
Post retirement mortality assumption (S1 PXA CM1) 1.5 1.5
The discount rate is determined on the yield available on a high quality long dated corporate bond of appropriate term and currency.  
As a result, a discount rate of 3.4 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2014 (2013: 4.4 per cent). This is higher than the rate used  
in prior year given the changes to the yields on bonds over the current year. 
Mortality assumptions are based on standard tables provided by the Institute of Actuaries using insurance company data updated from 
time to time to reflect current trends. The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA,  
CMI (150%), and Year of Birth. The table below makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each 
member. 
2014  2013
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were:  
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 45): Male 90.1 89.9
 Female 92.6 92.4
Life expectancy at age 65 (current age 65): Male 87.8 87.7

The pension charge in respect of other schemes is the actual contributions paid. These amounted to £1.2 million (2013: £0.7 million). 
41 EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD 
On 5 January 2015, the Venues business vacated EC1 & EC2 and development started on site. Under the agreement with Transport  
for London (“TfL”) the Group was obliged to provide vacant possession of the exhibition halls at EC1 & EC2 prior to 31 January 2015  
which was the earliest date that transfer of EC1 & EC2 to the investment vehicle, Earls Court Partnership Limited (“ECPL”), established 
with TfL could be triggered. ECPL is held 63 per cent by the Group, 37 per cent by TfL and will enable the development of EC1 & EC2 in line 
with the Earls Court Masterplan. When the Group’s investment properties are transferred to ECPL, TfL will simultaneously grant 999 year 
headleases over EC1 & EC2. As ECPL is fully consolidated, the Group’s investment property will reflect the full value of the 999 year 
headlease and this increase will be offset by the recognition of non-controlling interest and loan notes attributable to TfL such that the 
impact on the net assets attributable to owners of the Parent is neutral. Since the year end, arrangements have been put in place such  
that completion will occur by the date of the interim financial statements, 30 June 2015. 
On 9 January 2015, the Group acquired the freehold interest of 31-33 Bedford Street, Covent Garden for £30.0 million. 
On 14 January 2015, the Group signed a £64.8 million building contract with Sir Robert McAlpine for the construction of  
Kings Court, Covent Garden.

The Directors of Capital & Counties Properties PLC have proposed  
a final dividend per ordinary share (ISIN GB00B62G9D36) of  
1.0 pence payable on 19 June 2015.  
Dates 
The following are the salient dates for payment of the proposed 
final dividend: 
Annual General Meeting 1 May 2015
Sterling/Rand exchange rate struck 14 May 2015
Sterling/Rand exchange rate and dividend amount  
in Rand announced 15 May 2015

Ordinary shares listed ex-dividend on the London 
Stock Exchange 28 May 2015
Record date for final dividend in UK and South Africa 29 May 2015
Dividend payment date for shareholders 19 June 2015
South African shareholders should note that, in accordance with 
the requirements of Strate, the last day to trade cum-dividend  
will be 22 May 2015 and that no dematerialisation of shares will  
be possible from 25 May 2015 to 29 May 2015 inclusive. No transfers 
between the UK and South Africa registers may take place from  
14 May 2015 to 29 May 2015. 
Subject to SARB approval, the Board intends to offer an optional 
scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2014 final dividend.  
The above dates are proposed and subject to change. 
Important Information for South African Shareholders: 
The final cash dividend declared by the Company will constitute  
a dividend for Dividends Tax purposes. Dividends Tax will 
therefore be withheld from the amount of the final cash dividend 
which is paid at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies 
for an exemption and the prescribed requirements for effecting  
the exemption, as set out in the rules of the Scrip Dividend Scheme,  
are in place. 
It is the Company’s understanding that the issue and receipt of 
shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not have any 
Dividends Tax nor income tax implications. The new shares which 
are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated  
as having been acquired for nil consideration. 
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation  
for shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capco’s 
understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.  
Any shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position  
should seek independent professional advice. Governance Financial statements Strategic report
